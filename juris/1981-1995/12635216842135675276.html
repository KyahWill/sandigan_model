The constitutional question raised in a declaratory relief proceeding 
treated as a special civil action for prohibition, one of first 
impression, arose from the issuance of a proclamation by the President,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>  directing that a plebiscite be conducted in certain barangays<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>  all within the municipality of Mayoyao, Province of Ifugao, segregated under a Batas Pambansa,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>
  "to determine whether the said Barangays shall become a new 
municipality to be known as the Municipality of Aguinaldo, Province of 
Ifugao." In such proclamation, respondent Commission on Elections<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>
  was charged with the duty of supervising the conduct of such 
plebiscite and empowered to promulgate the necessary rules and 
regulations to implement the proclamation.  It is alleged that Batas 
Pambansa Blg. 86 is unconstitutional for being violative of Article XI, 
Section 3 of the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>
  The basis for such contention is that the state excluded from the 
plebiscite the voters from the poblacion and other barangays of the 
Municipality  of Mayoyao except those mentioned in the Act.
<p>
This is the issue specifically posed:  Who are to be included in such 
plebiscite?  As contended by petitioners Zosimo J. Paredes and Mario W. 
Chilagan, the former being the incumbent Governor of the Province of 
Ifugao and the latter, Mayor of the Municipality of Mayoyao, Ifugao, all
 the inhabitants of such municipality should participate in such 
plebiscite as they are inclu­ded in the "unit or units affected."
</p><p>
Such interpretation is disputed by respondents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>
  It is their submission that in the interpretation of the above phrase,
 the Court "should not lose sight of the fact that this provision is 
intended to promote autonomy of our local government units.  Thus, in a 
case where barrios are being separated from an existing municipality to 
form a new municipality, as in the case at bar, the units affected are 
the barrios whose transfer is being sought.  It is the people in these 
barrios who will really be affected by the new grant of autonomy.  They 
will be under a new set of officials, a new govern­ment, a new set of 
powers and responsibilities.  They should thus be consulted on whether 
they are willing to shoulder the responsibilities attendant to autonomy.
  Barrios which will remain with the original municipality are not 
affected since their autonomy vis-a-vis the national government is not 
in any way diminished.  They will be under the same local government, 
without any diminution whatsoever of their rights.  There is there­fore 
no infringement of the Constitution if people in these barrios do not 
vote in the plebiscite.  On the contrary, an anomalous situation may 
arise if they are allowed to vote and if their voters are numerically 
superior to frustrate any attempt of some barrios to break away from the
 original municipality.  In such an eventuality, one very populous 
barrio may for selfish reason prevent the desired autonomy of other 
barrios."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> 
</p><p>
The Court sustains the stand of respondents.  The petition must be dismissed.
</p><blockquote>
  <p> 1.  Admittedly, this is one of those cases where the discretion of
 the Court is allowed considerable leeway.  There is indeed an element 
of ambiguity in the use of the expression "unit or units affected." It 
is plausible to assert as petitioners do that when certain barangays are
 separated from a parent municipality to form a new one, all the voters 
therein are affected.  It is much more persuasive, however, to contend 
as respondents do that the acceptable construction is for those voters, 
who are not from the barangays to be separated, should be excluded in 
the plebiscite. </p>
  <p>
    2.  For one thing, it is in accordance with the settled doctrine 
that between two possible constructions, one avoiding a finding of 
unconstitutionality and the other yielding such a result, the former is 
to be preferred.  That which will save, not that which will destroy, 
commends itself for acceptance.  After all, the basic presumption all 
these years is one of validity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>
 The onerous task of proving otherwise is on the party seeking to 
nullify a statute.  It must be proved by clear and convincing evidence 
that there is an infringement of a constitutional provision, save in 
those cases where the challenged act is void on its face.  Absent such a
 showing, there can be no finding of unconstitutionality.  A doubt, even
 if well-founded, does not suffice.  Justice Malcolm's aphorism is <em>apropos</em>: "To doubt is to sustain."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> 
  </p>
  <p> 3.  Such a doubt moreover is dispelled by a reference to this 
fundamental principle declared in the Constitution: "The State shall 
guarantee and promote the autonomy of local government units, especially
 the [barangays], to ensure their fullest development as self-reliant 
communities."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>  It is clear that in granting autonomy, priority is to be accorded the smallest unit, the <em>barangay.</em>
  That enables its residents the fullest development as a self-reliant 
community, with a distinct personality of its own.  Adherence to such a 
philosophy compels the conclusion that when there are indications that 
the inhabitants of several barangays are inclined to separate from a 
parent municipality they should be allowed to do so.  What is more 
logical than to ascertain their will in a plebiscite called for that 
purpose.  If is they, and they alone, who shall constitute the new unit.
  New responsibilities will be assumed.  New burdens will be imposed.  A
 new municipal corporation will come into existence.  Its birth will be a
 matter of choice - their choice.  They should be left alone then to 
decide for themselves.  To allow other voters to participate will not 
yield a true expression of their will.  They may even frustrate it.  
That certainly will be so if they vote against it for selfish reasons, 
and they constitute the majority.  That is not to abide by the 
fundamental principle of the Constitution to promote local autonomy, the
 preference being for smaller units.  To rule as this Tribunal does is 
to follow an accepted principle of constitutional construction, that in 
ascertaining the meaning of a particular provision that may give rise to
 doubts, the intent of the framers and of the people may be gleaned from
 provisions in <em>pari materia.</em> </p>
  <p> 4.  One last consideration.  What is sought in this suit is to 
enjoin respondents particularly respondent Commission from implementing 
Batas Pambansa Blg. 86, specifically "from conducting, holding and 
undertaking the plebiscite provided for in said Act." The petition was 
filed on December 5, 1980.  There was a plea for a restraining order, 
but Proclamation No. 2034 fixing the date for such plebiscite on 
December 6, 1980 had been issued as far back as November 11, 1980.  Due 
to this delay in filing this suit, attributable solely to petitioners, 
there was no time even to consider such a plea.  The plebiscite was duly
 held.  The certificate of canvass and proclamation of the result 
disclosed that out of 2,409 total votes cast in such plebiscite, 2,368 
votes were cast in favor of the creation of the new municipality, which,
 according to the statute, will be named municipality of Aguinaldo.  
There were only 40 votes cast against.  As a result, such municipality 
was created.  There is no turning back the clock.  The moot and academic
 character of this petition is thus apparent. </p>

DISSENTING OPINION
</strong>
</p><p><strong>
ABAD SANTOS, J.:
</strong>
</p><p>
With all due deference to Chief Justice Enrique M. Fernando who has no 
peer on the subject of Constitutional Law, I am constrained to dissent.
</p><p>
Batas Pambansa Blg. 86 created the Municipality of Aguinaldo out of 
eight barangays within the Municipality of Mayoyao, Ifugao.  The same 
statute, presumably because of the provision of the Constitution which 
stipulates that "No province, city, municipality, or barrio may be 
created, divided, merged, abolished or its bounda­ries substantially 
altered except in accordance with the criteria established in the local 
government code, and subject to the approval by a majority of the votes 
cast in a plebiscite in the unit or units affected" (Art. XI, Sec. 3), 
states in Section 3 thereof that a plebiscite be conducted in the areas 
constituting the proposed new Municipality of Aguinaldo.  Accordingly, 
the other barangays of the Municipality a Mayoyao were excluded from the
 plebiscite.
</p><p>
I have grave doubts about the constitutionality of B.P. Blg. 86 for two reasons:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    1. It was enacted even before there was a local government code and,
 therefore, the creation of the Municipality of Aguinaldo or the 
division of the Municipality of Mayoyao was done without reference to 
any established criteria.
  </p>
  <p> 2. I believe that when the Constitution speaks of "the unit or 
units affected" it means <span style="font-style: italic;">all </span>of the people of the municipality if the 
municipality is to be divided such as in the case at bar or <span style="font-style: italic;">all</span> of the 
people of two or more municipalities if there be a merger.  I see no 
ambiguity in the Constitutional provision. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In the case of the creation of the Municipality of Aguinaldo, it is 
obvious that the people in all of the barangays of the Municipality of 
Mayoyao have an interest in the matter for it will mean the 
dis­memberment of their town.
</p><p>
The proposition that:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Barrios which will remain with the original muni­cipality are not
 affected since their autonomy vis-a-vis the national government is not 
in any way diminished.  They will be under the same local government, 
without any diminution whatsoever or their rights.  There is therefore 
no infringement of the Constitution if people in these barrios do not 
vote in the plebiscite"
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
is utterly false.  For to reduce a municipality both in area and 
population will produce adverse effects.  Rizal was once the premiere 
province of the Philippines.  But after several towns were removed from 
it such as Pasay and Caloocan and after still more towns were detached 
from it to form part of Metro Manila, Rizal province has been reduced to
 a practically insignificant political entity.
</p><p>
No effect on the barangays which will remain with the Municipality of 
Mayoyao?  Why then did the Governor of Ifugao and the Mayor of Mayoyao 
get excited?
