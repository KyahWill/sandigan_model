				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The issue in this petition for <i>certiorari</i> is the
timeliness of the petitioner's election protest.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Gil C. Gallardo and private respondent Franco F. <span class="SpellE">Rimando</span> were rival candidates for the Office of Municipal
Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Naguilian</span>, La Union, in the local elections
of <st1:date year="1988" day="18" month="1">January 18, 1988</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1988" day="19" month="1">January
 19, 1988</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Rimando</span> was proclaimed the
winner over Gallardo by a margin <span style="">of</span>
12 votes.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="22" month="1">January 22, 1988</st1:date>,
Gallardo filed in the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) a petition to annul the
proclamation of <span class="SpellE">Rimando</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1988" day="8" month="12">December
 8, 1988</st1:date>, the COMELEC dismissed the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="12" month="12">December 12, 1988</st1:date>,
Gallardo appealed the <span class="SpellE">COMELEC's</span> final resolution to
this Court (Gallardo vs. COMELEC, G.R. No. 85974).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1989" day="23" month="6">June
 23, 1989</st1:date>, he received the Supreme Court's final resolution dated <st1:date year="1989" day="30" month="5">May 30, <span class="GramE">1989</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, dismissing his petition for review.</span> On June 30, 1989, he
filed an election protest entitled, "Gil C. Gallardo vs. Franco F. <span class="SpellE">Rimando</span>," Case No. 4-Bg, Municipal Election Protest,
in the Regional Trial Court, Branch 33 at <span class="SpellE">Bauang</span>, La
Union (p. 17, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Rimando</span> filed a motion to dismiss the
protest on the ground that it was not filed within ten (10) days after the
proclamation of the results of the election fixed in Sec. 51 of the Omnibus
Election Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judge <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Quintos</span> of the Regional Trial Court at <span class="SpellE">Bauang</span>, La Union, denied the motion to dismiss.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Rimando</span> filed a motion for reconsideration
of Judge <span class="SpellE">Quintos</span>' order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He insisted that the election protest was
late because the <span class="SpellE">COMELEC's</span> decision in the
pre-proclamation case had become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
under Section 246 of the Omnibus Election Code, which provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 246.</span> <span class="GramE"><u>Summary</u>
<u>proceedings</u> <u>before</u> <u>the</u> <u>Commission.</u></span> â€“ All
pre-proclamation controversies shall be heard summarily by the Commission after
due notice and hearing, and its decisions shall be <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
<u>after</u> <u>the</u> <u>lapse</u> <u>of</u> <u>five</u> <u>days</u> <u>from</u>
<u>receipt</u> <u><span style="">by</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>the losing</u> <u>party</u> <u>of</u>
<u>the</u> <u>decision</u> of the Commission, unless restrained by the Supreme
Court." <span class="GramE">(Underscoring ours, Sec. 55, BP 697.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">He argued that since the <span class="SpellE">COMELEC's</span>
decision dated <st1:date year="1988" day="8" month="12">December 8, 1988</st1:date>,
dismissing Gallardo's petition to annul the proclamation of <span class="SpellE">Rimando</span>,
became final five (5) days later, on <st1:date year="1988" day="14" month="12">December
 14, 1988</st1:date>, the filing of the election contest by Gallardo on <st1:date year="1989" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1989</st1:date>, <span class="GramE">was</span>
tardy.</p>

<p class="BODY">Following <span class="SpellE">Rimando's</span> argument, Judge <span class="SpellE">Quintos</span> issued an order on <st1:date year="1989" day="19" month="9">September 19, 1989</st1:date> (p. 34, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>),
setting aside his previous order of <st1:date year="1989" day="3" month="8">August
 3, 1989</st1:date> and dismissing the election protest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1989" day="24" month="11">November
 24, 1989</st1:date>, he denied Gallardo's motion for reconsideration (Annex H,
p. 39, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>; Annex K, p. 52, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1989" day="7" month="12">December 7, 1989</st1:date>,
Gallardo filed a notice of appeal (Annex L, p. 57, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)
and on <st1:date year="1989" day="18" month="12">December 18, 1989</st1:date>,
he filed this petition for review (p. <span style="">58,
</span><span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">The question is:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Was
Gallardo's election protest filed on time?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 251 of the Omnibus Election Code provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">SEC. 251.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span><u>Election</u> <u>contests</u> <u>for</u> <u>municipal</u> <u>offices.</u>
- A sworn petition contesting the election of a municipal officer shall be
filed with the proper regional trial court by any candidate who has duly filed
a certificate of candidacy and has been voted for the same office, within ten
days after proclamation of the results of the election."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">(Art. XVIII, Sec. 190, 1978 EC.)</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Rimando</span> was proclaimed by the Municipal
Board of Canvassers as the duly elected municipal mayor of <span class="SpellE">Naguilian</span>
on <st1:date year="1988" day="19" month="1">January 19, 1988</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two (2) days later, or on <st1:date year="1988" day="21" month="1">January 21, 1988</st1:date>, Gallardo filed in
the COMELEC <span style="">a </span>pre-proclamation
petition to annul the proclamation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, only eight (8) days of the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period for filing an election protest remained. This period was suspended
during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the pre?proclamation
case, i.e., while it was pending in the COMELEC and in the Supreme Court, until
Gallardo received on June 23, 1989 the Supreme Court's final resolution
dismissing his petition for review of the <span class="SpellE">COMELEC's</span>
decision in said case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 248 of
the Omnibus Election Code provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Sec. 248.</span> <span class="GramE"><u><span style="">Effect</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>of</u> <u><span style="">filing</span></u><span style=""> <u>petition</u> </span><u>to</u> <u><span style="">annul</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>or</u> <u>to</u> <u><span style="">suspend</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>the pr</u><u><span style="">oclamation.</span></u></span><span style=""> - </span>The filing with the Commission of a
petition to annul or to suspend the proclamation of any candidate shall suspend
the running of the period within which to file an election protest or <u><span style="">quo</span></u><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>warranto</u></span> </span>proceedings."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">After <st1:date year="1989" day="23" month="6">June 23, 1989</st1:date>, the eight-day remainder of the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period to file an election protest resumed
running.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deadline was <st1:date year="1989" day="1" month="7">July 1, 1989</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gallardo seasonably filed his election
protest on the 7th day - <st1:date year="1989" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1989</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the light of Section 248, the lower court's statement that
"the running of the ten-day period to file an election protest is not
stopped by protestant's elevation to the Supreme Court of the <span class="SpellE">COMELEC's</span> decision" in the pre-proclamation case, is
not correct. The appeal by <i>certiorari</i> to the Supreme Court, which is a
right secured to the defeated party under Section 7, Title A, Article IX of the
1987 Constitution, is part of the annulment proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case is not over until the Supreme Court has
given its verdict, hence, the computation of the ten-day-period for filing an
election contest does not begin until that verdict has been handed down by the
Supreme Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Judge <span class="SpellE">Quintos</span> also misinterpreted
Section 246 of the Omnibus Election Code which provides that the decision of
the COMELEC in a pre-proclamation controversy, etc. "shall be <span class="SpellE">executory</span> after the lapse of five (5) days from receipt by
the losing party of the decision of the Commission, unless restrained by the
Supreme Court." He erroneously thought that because the <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> decision in the pre-proclamation case became
final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> (absent a restraining order from
the Supreme Court), the appellant lost his right to file an election protest
under Section 251 of the Omnibus Election Code. That is not so.</p>

<p class="BODY">The right of the prevailing party in a pre-proclamation case to
the execution of the <span class="SpellE">COMELEC's</span> decision (i.e., to be
proclaimed and to assume office) after the lapse of five (5) days from receipt
of said decision by the losing party, unless restrained by the Supreme Court,
does not bar the losing party from filing an election contest within the
ten-day period fixed in Section 251.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
absence of a restraining order from the Supreme Court simply allows the
prevailing party to be proclaimed and assume office.</p>

<p class="BODY">His proclamation and assumption of office does not end the
contest for the COMELEC in a pre-proclamation controversy determines only the
following issues:</p>

<blockquote>(a)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The legality of the
composition or proceedings of the board of canvassers;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>(b)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether the canvassed
election returns are incomplete, contain material defects, appear to be
tampered with or falsified, or contain discrepancies in the same returns or in
other authentic copies thereof as mentioned in Section 233, 234, 235 and 236 of
this Code;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>(c) <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Whether the election
returns were prepared under duress, threats, coercion, or intimidation, or they
are obviously manufactured or not authentic; and<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>(d)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether substitute or
fraudulent returns in <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> polling places
were canvassed, the results of which materially affected the standing of the
aggrieved candidate or candidates. (Sec. 243, Omnibus Election Code.)<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Its decision, therefore, is not a bar to
the election contest where the task of the regional trial court is to ascertain
the results of the election or the true will of the voters by a proper
evaluation of the votes cast, and by determining the integrity of the ballots
and recounting them.</p>

<p class="BODY">In "Gallardo vs. COMELEC," G.R. No. 85974, May 30,
1989, the appellant did not ask this Court to restrain the execution of the
COMELEC decision for the simple reason that his opponent, <span class="SpellE">Rimando</span>,
had already been proclaimed even before the pre-proclamation case was filed by
him (Gallardo) in the COMELEC. That circumstance, was precisely the reason why
the COMELEC dismissed the pre-proclamation case, for the rule is that after the
winning candidate has been proclaimed and assumed office, a pre-proclamation
petition does not lie against him (<span class="SpellE">Casimiro</span>, et al.
vs. COMELEC, et al., G.R. Nos. 84462-63, March 29, 1989; and Antonio, et al.
vs. COMELEC, et al., G.R. Nos. 84678-79, March 29, 1989).</p>

<p class="BODY">But, although already proclaimed and installed in office, he may
still be unseated:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) when his opponent
is adjudged the true winner of the election by a final judgment of the courts
in the election contest (Sec. 251, Omnibus Election Code); (2) when the
prevailing party is declared ineligible or disqualified by final judgment in a <u><span style="">quo</span></u><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>warranto</u></span> </span>case (Sec. 253,
Omnibus Election Code); and (3) when the incumbent is removed from office for
cause (Sec. 264, Omnibus Election Code, <span class="SpellE">Secs</span>. 8, 9
and 12, Rep. Act No. 3019).</p>

<p class="BODY">For all the foregoing, we hold that respondent Judge committed a
patent error and a grave abuse of discretion in dismissing Gallardo's timely
election protest.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition for review is granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The orders dated <st1:date year="1989" day="19" month="9">September 19, 1989</st1:date> (Annex G, p. 34, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>) and <st1:date year="1989" day="24" month="11">November
 24, 1989</st1:date> (Annex K, p. 52, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>) of the
