<blockquote>I would like to register this letter-complaint against the
Presiding Judge of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">the Regional Trial
Court of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, Branch 76 who is likewise the
incumbent President of the </span>Philippine Judges Association, Judge Manuel
M. <span class="SpellE">Calanog</span>, Jr., for immorality and conduct
unbecoming of a public official.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Sometime in 1987, when I intervened in the case for (sic) intestate
estate of my late common-law husband which was then pending before the RTC,
Branch 94, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, where incidentally Judge
Manuel M. <span class="SpellE">Calanog</span>, Jr. was temporarily holding office
at that time, the latter was referred to me by an acquaintance of mine as a
person who could assist me and help facilitate for (sic) the early termination
of the case in my favor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, I
personally met Judge Manuel M. <span class="SpellE">Calanog</span>, Jr. in his
office located at the 11th floor of the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City Hall</st1:placetype></st1:place>
where he transferred.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the said
meeting, he advised me to see him at his law office located in <span class="SpellE">Mandaluyong</span>, Metro Manila which I did.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When I met him at <st1:time minute="0" hour="12">noon</st1:time>, he invited me to eat in a restaurant and even asked
me to ride with him in his car but instead, to my surprise, he took me to a
motel where he made sexual advances on me.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As he did not succeed in his evil design, he asked me if I will (sic) a<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">gree </span>to the proposition that he be my
sub-husband (sic) and promised to give me his condominium unit located at <span class="SpellE">Pagasa</span> Bliss Condominium, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City, as well as to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">provide </span>financial
support for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">my </span>two (2) minor
children and place them in an exclusive school for girls.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Due to confusion because of the untimely
death of my common-law husband coupled with the persistent pleadings of Judge
Manuel M. <span class="SpellE">Calanog</span>, Jr., he was able to convince <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">me.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>Upon
giving my consent, he immediately <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">gave </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">his </span>condominium unit no. 19-22 at <span class="SpellE">Pagasa</span> Bliss Condominium, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city>, where l and my two
(2) minor daughters reside up to the present.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1989" day="27" month="5">May 27, 1989</st1:date>, as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">a </span>result of our relationship, l gave
birth to a baby boy which (sic) we named Jerome Christopher <span class="SpellE">Calanog</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Judge Manuel M. <span class="SpellE">Calanog</span>, Jr. is very
well-known to my two (2) minor daughters as they fondly called him as
"Tito <span class="SpellE">Nonong</span>".</blockquote>

<blockquote>From the time I gave birth to our son Jerome Christopher <span class="SpellE">Calanog</span>, said Judge Manuel M. <span class="SpellE">Calanog</span>,
Jr. has refused to provide us financial support nor placed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">my </span>two (2) minor daughters to an
exclusive school as he had promised.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Worst, to the present, he fails and refuses to pay the monthly
installments of the condominium <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">unit he </span>gave
to me despite being informed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">by </span>the
National Housing Authority that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">we </span>will
be evicted from the said place for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">failure
</span>to pay the same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Despite my
repeated verbal demands for him to give us, or at least his son Jerome
Christopher <span class="SpellE">Calanog</span>; financial support, Judge Manuel
M. <span class="SpellE">Calanog</span>, Jr. just ignored my pleas.</blockquote>

<blockquote>May I then ask and pray that justice be given to me and my children
or at least for my son Jerome Christopher <span class="SpellE">Calanog</span>?
May I further request that the proper sanction be meted against Judge Manuel M.
<span class="SpellE">Calanog</span>, Jr. for his conduct unbecoming of a public
official and immorality?</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Acting on the complaint filed by Castillo, the Court required the
respondent to answer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The respondent
took time in answering the complaint.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
was only after two motions for extension of time to file <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">answer </span>did he file on <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">April </span>10, 1990 his two-paragraph
Answer dated April 5, 1990 followed by another two-paragraph pleading entitled
"Supplemental Answer" dated May 30, 1990.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In both answers he simply averred that the
complainant "has expressly stated that she is no longer interested in
pursuing the same (complaint) and therefore, pray that the said complaint be
considered withdrawn." The respondent prayed "that the instant case
be considered Withdrawn and/or D<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">i</span>smissed."
In his Supplemental Answer he "vehemently denies for being untrue the
material allegations of complainant in her letter-complaint dated <st1:date year="1990" day="17" month="1">January 17, 1990</st1:date>." <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">H</span>e reiterated his prayer "that
the instant case be dismissed." Later, on <st1:date year="1990" day="5" month="2">February 5, 1990</st1:date>, the complainant filed a sworn
letter-request dated <st1:date year="1990" day="1" month="2">February 1, 1990</st1:date>,

everything I executed that letter addressed to the Honorable Justices of the

<p class="BODY">As alleged by the complainant, verified by Justice Gloria C. <span class="SpellE">Paras</span>, and confirmed by Jose Javier and agents of the
National Bureau or Investigation, Judge <span class="SpellE">Calanog</span> did
establish an intimate, albeit immoral, relationship with complainant Emma
Castillo although he, Judge <span class="SpellE">Calanog</span>, is a married
man.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Out of that liaison Emma Castillo
gave birth to Judge <span class="SpellE">Calanog's</span> child, Jerome
Christopher, whom he housed in a condominium unit together with his (Jerome's)
mother and her two older children.</p>

<p class="BODY">Judge <span class="SpellE">Calanog</span> has behaved in a manner
not becoming of his robes and as a model or rectitude, betrayed the people's
high expectations, and diminished the esteem in which they hold the judiciary
in general.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is of no import that the evidence on record is not sufficient
to prove beyond reasonable doubt the facts of <span class="SpellE">concubinage</span>
having indeed existed and been committed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This is not a criminal case for <span class="SpellE">concubinage</span>
but an administrative matter that invokes the power of supervision of this
Court over the members of the judiciary.</p>

<p class="BODY">The circumstances show a lack of circumspection and <span class="SpellE">delicadeza</span> on the part of the respondent judge by failing
to avoid situations that make him suspect to committing immorality and worse,
having that suspicion confirmed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Canon I states:</p>

<blockquote>xxx<span style="mso-tab-count:2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="mso-tab-count:2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>Rule 1.01 -- A judge should be the embodiment of competence,
integrity, probity and independence.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court's Commentary on this Rule states:</p>

<blockquote>The integrity and independence of the judiciary can be reduced to
one common denominator: the judge--the individual who dispenses justice, and
upon whose attributes depend the public perception of the judiciary.</blockquote>

<blockquote><st1:city><st1:place>Independence</st1:place></st1:city> or the
judiciary requires that the judge should be independent-minded, imbued with a
sense of mission, a person of honor, integrity, courage and conviction.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Under Rule 140, Immorality is classified under "Serious
Charges".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This means that the
following sanction may be imposed:</p>

<blockquote>Dismissal from the service with forfeiture of benefits (except
accrued leaves) and disqualification from reinstatement or appointment to any
public office including a government-owned or controlled corporation;<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Code of Judicial Ethics mandates that the conduct of a judge
must be free of a whiff of impropriety not only with respect to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">his </span>performance of his judicial
duties, but also to his behavior outside his <span class="SpellE">sala</span> and
as a private individual.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no
dichotomy of morality:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>a public official
is also judged by his private morals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Code dictates that a judge, in order to promote public confidence in
the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary, must behave with propriety at
all times.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As we have very recently
explained, a judge's official life can not simply be detached or separated from
his personal existence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>Being the subject of constant <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">public
</span>scrutiny, a judge should freely and willingly accept restrictions on
conduct that might be viewed as burdensome by the ordinary citizen.</blockquote>

<blockquote>A judge should personify judicial integrity and exemplify honest
public service.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The personal behavior of
a judge, both in the performance of official duties and in private life should
be above suspicion.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Justice Gloria C. <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> of the Court of
Appeals, the assigned investigator of this case, submitted on <st1:date year="1990" day="19" month="11">November 19, 1990</st1:date> her report and
recommendation the ultimate portions of which state:</p>

<blockquote>xxx<span style="mso-tab-count:2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="mso-tab-count:2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>The statements of the aforesaid witnesses, Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Bustamante</span> and Jose Javier confirm the amorous relationship
between the respondent and the complainant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Investigator is of the view that the respondent who is a married
man, and a member of the judiciary and the incumbent President of the
Philippine Judges Association, had committed immorality.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Exacting standards of morality and decency have been strictly
adhered to and laid down by the Highest Court of the land in regard to those in
the service of the judiciary and more specifically so when the malefactor <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">is </span>a judge (<span class="SpellE">Sicat</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span>, 161 SCRA 284 [1988]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It need not be stated that the personal and
official actuations of every member of the bench must be beyond reproach and
above suspicion for the faith and confidence of the public in the administration
of justice can not be maintained if a Judge who dispenses it is not equipped
with the cardinal judicial virtue of moral integrity, and if he obtusely
continues to commit an affront to public decency.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Supreme Court, in the case of <span class="SpellE">Leynes</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Veloso</span>, 82 SCRA (1978),
has also said:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"A Judge suffers
from moral obtuseness or has a weird notion of morality in public office when
he labors under the delusion that he can be a judge and at the same time have a
mistress in defiance of the mores and sense of morality of the community.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The absence of criminal liability does not
preclude disciplinary action by reason of his highly unconventional and
censurable <span class="SpellE">behaviour</span>."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Concluding, the undersigned Investigator respectfully recommends
that:</blockquote>

<blockquote>(1) The "Motion to Strike Out Testimony From The
Records", filed by counsel for the complainant be DENIED; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>respondent Jud<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">g</span>e Manuel M. <span class="SpellE">Calanog</span>, Jr. be found
guilty of immorality and be meted out the severest disciplinary action of
Dismissal from the service with prejudice to appointment to any government
position and forfeiture of retirement benefits, if any.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We have examined the entire record of the case <span class="SpellE">vis-a-vis</span> this report and recommendation and we are in full
accord with them.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is worth <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">noting </span>here
that the respondent judge, in violating a judicial <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">p</span>recept, has also committed a grave injustice upon the
complainant, who had sought his assistance in expediting the intestate estate
proceedings of her deceased common-law husband.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The judge, who was in the first place, prohibited by the Code of
Judicial Conduct<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

advantage of the complainant's helplessness and state of material deprivation
and persuaded her to become his mistress.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The exploitation of women becomes even more reprehensible when the
offender commits the injustice by the brute force of his position of power and
authority, as in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the respondent Judge, the Hon. Manuel M. <span class="SpellE">Calanog</span>, Jr., is found guilty of IMMORALITY and is hereby DISMISSED
from the roll of judges, with prejudice to his reinstatement or appointment to

<p class="OTHERHEADING">DISSENT AS TO THE PENALTY</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">GUTIERREZ, JR., <i>J</i>.:</p>

<p class="BODY">I must state at the outset that this dissent is not a brief for
immorality.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is a plea for fairness
and compassion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Judge Manuel M.
<span class="SpellE">Calanog</span>, Jr. has been found guilty of the charges
filed against him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I believe that there
is enough <span class="GramE">basis</span> for the administrative finding that,
being a married man, he had sexual liaisons with the complainant.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent has erred.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He has sinned.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His conduct in
this instance has fallen short of the highest standards of morality and virtue
expected of all who serve in the judiciary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, the penalty of virtually capital punishment meted upon him is
too severe considering the circumstances surrounding the offense and the
offender.</p>

<p class="BODY">No infraction should go unpunished but the punishment should also
fit the offense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I believe that the
Court should also take into account the fact that fault should not
automatically and entirely be attributed solely to the respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Judge <span class="SpellE">Calanog’s</span>
record of excellent public service, his dedication to the welfare of the
members of the bench, his involvement in civic and national affairs, the
leadership traits acknowledged by his peers, and the respect and unstinted cooperation
he has always given to this Court should also be considered.</p>

<p class="BODY">I am aware of the cases brought before this Court where
immorality is cited as a reason for the dismissal, suspension or disbarment of
a member of the Bar or Bench (Rule 138, Section 27) It is a course of conduct
inconsistent with the requirement of good moral character that is required for
the continued practice of law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Cordova
vs. Cordova, Adm. Case No. 3249, Nov. 29, 1982) If good moral character is
required of a lawyer, with more reason is the requirement exacted of a member
of the judiciary who at all times is expected to observe irreproachable
behavior and is bound not to outrage public decency.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Leynes</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Veloso</span>, 82 SCRA 325 [1978]) Members of the judiciary are
admonished to so conduct themselves as to be beyond reproach and suspicion, and
to be free from any appearance of impropriety in their personal behavior, not
only in the discharge of their official duties but also in their everyday,
life.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Association of
Court Employees of <span class="SpellE">Panabo</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Tupas</span>,
Adm. Matter No.</span> MTJ-87-141, July 12, 1989; <span class="SpellE">Sicat</span>
V. Judge <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span>, Adm. Matter No. R-006-RTJ, May
11, 1988) <span class="GramE">In</span> cases where the charges, of immorality
have been sufficiently established and where public decency has been outraged;
the Court has not hesitated to impose the penalty of removal from office.</p>

<p class="BODY">The penalty in the instant case, however, deserves to be treated
in a different light.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As aptly stated by
former Chief Justice Fernando in <u>Garcia</u> <u>v.</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Comelec</u></span>
(105 SCRA 250 [1981), "There can be a diversity of result in the
decision-making process in cases which apparently are not dissimilar.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This perspective allows for individualization
of justice." Thus, I believe that justice would be better served if we
were to view the present controversy with equity and compassion.</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be emphasized that all the evidence against the
respondent has been taken from the allegations of the complaint an ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> "discreet" investigation by agents of the
National Bureau of Investigation, and statements from two subordinate personnel
of the respondent's court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But while the
silence of the respondent may be taken as proof that indeed there was a sexual
relationship with the complainant, it does not necessarily follow that the
various details in the Investigator's Report must be taken as unvarnished truth
and that the implications may not be negated or minimized by contrary
considerations.</p>

<p class="BODY">The present case arose from a complaint filed by a woman who
sought help from the respondent regarding the settlement of the intestate
estate of <u>her</u> <u>common-law</u> <u>husband</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was alleged, although the allegation was
later withdrawn, that the complainant initially refused the respondent's
amorous advances during their first meetings but she later agreed to be the
respondent's mistress after promises of financial stability were given to her;
i.e. the purchase of a condominium unit, schooling for the complainant's two
minor daughters at an exclusive girl's school and because of the “confusion”
arising from the death of her common-law-husband.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case may be considered peculiar in the sense that the
complainant is not the offended, abandoned or neglected wife nor is she a
person with only the best of intentions in mind.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It would have been easy for us to give total
credence to a complaint filed by one who has no ill-motive or cause to complain
against the respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(See <span class="SpellE">Dela</span>.</span> Paz v. <span class="SpellE">Inutan</span>, 64 SCRA 540 [1975]) But here, the other party is a
liberated woman who appears to have no compunctions about living in illicit
relations with men.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is, of course,
no proof that, Judge <span class="SpellE">Calanog</span> was the one seduced but
I will not also swallow hook, line, and sinker the picture of an aggressive
middle-aged man importuning a reluctant woman, whose common-law-husband had
just died, and practically forcing or inducing her to submit to his advances.</p>

<p class="BODY">What I see from the scanty records of this administrative case is
a woman who was willing, if she did not actually inveigle, to enter, into a
sexual relationship.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When the financial
expectations were not forthcoming and a life of relative ease and comfort could
not be assured, she struck out with the administrative complaint.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Realizing perhaps that he had sinned and
should sin no more, the respondent had assumed what to the other party was a
sudden, cold, and security-threatening attitude.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The complainant's intentions are indeed
suspect, if not motivated by revenge and bad faith.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(See Lim v. Antonio, 125 SCRA 273 [1983]) The
case, especially the punishment imposed, deserves to be examined more carefully.</p>

<p class="BODY">The complainant is obviously a woman of experience, wise in the
ways of the world, with two (2) children from an earlier common-law
relationship.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She appears to be
sufficiently, mature and intelligent, enough to know what she was entering
into.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She certainly was aware of the
consequences of an illicit arrangement with the respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her consent to the illicit relationship with
the respondent is without question.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>From
all indications, this was a voluntary act of indiscretion between two (2) consenting
adults who were fully aware of the consequences of their deed and for which
only they should ordinarily be held responsible.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Abaigar</span> v. Paz, 93
SCRA 91 [1979])</p>

<p class="BODY">The liaison was a most discreet affair.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the other party had only remained quiet,
it would not have been discovered.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
other words, the affair was not characterized by scandalous behavior or a
public flaunting, of decency and morals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was wrong to be sure but not outrageously so.</p>

<p class="BODY">The majority considers the promise of a dwelling place and
education for the children as financial helplessness taken advantage of by the
respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I have a different
view.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead of concluding that the
complainant is a helpless woman wronged by a predatory profligate, I prefer to
think that the complainant and the respondent alike are both offenders and
victims.</p>

<p class="BODY">I can not, therefore, agree that the respondent should be made to
suffer the most severe penalty we can impose when the immorality committed by
him was made possible by the rather equivocal conduct of the complainant
herself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The ruling in <span class="SpellE"><u>Viojan</u></span> <u>v.</u> <u>Duran</u>, (4 SCRA 390 [1962])
could very well apply to this case before us:</p>

<blockquote>"'The respondent has committed an act of immorality.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The flesh is weak.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But man should possess that consciousness to
do the right and avoid the wrong.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And <span class="GramE">one</span> who has taken the oath of public service to dispense
with justice, should be more possessed of the courage and the will to overcome
the weakness of the flesh.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since the
dispensation of justice has to originate from sound moral consciousness, one
who lacks it, or has shown to be wanting of it, cannot offer the guaranty
required for the performance of a just dispensation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A magistrate has to live by the example of
his precepts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He cannot judge the
conduct of others when his own needs judgment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It should not be ‘do as I say and not what I do.’<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For then the court over which he is called to
preside will be a mockery, one devoid of respect.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence, the necessity for
the magistrate to possess enough fortitude to subdue his passion for wrong.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>There is, therefore, no question that for the immorality he
committed within the territory of his jurisdiction as a Justice of the Peace,
the respondent should be punished.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But, <u>considering</u>

<p class="BODY">True, the respondent is a Judge.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>But he is also human.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Regrettably, yielding to the cravings of the flesh is a most common
human failing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is ample literature
to show that Presidents, Prime Ministers, Generals, high ranking members of the
clergy, and other representatives of the powerful and famous all over the world
pave unfortunately engaged in sexual escapades.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As so succinctly stated by Henry Kissinger, "Power is the greatest
aphrodisiac." If such publications like the Kinsey Report are to be
trusted, the incidence of infidelity and immorality in polite society is
unbelievably if not shockingly high.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A
Judge who falls into the trap of this altogether human and common failing
should be disciplined.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court cannot
be indulgently permissive.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the same
time, the above nature of the offense requires that we should take into account
all relevant circumstances and, where warranted, mitigate the severity of the
punishment for a few who somehow failed to summon the moral fiber needed to
resist this all too human failing.</p>

<p class="BODY">If a public officer, on his or her own initiative or through the
enticements of the other party, is involved in an illicit relationship, he or she
should be allowed and encouraged to get out of that situation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, if instant and automatic dismissal
is always the punishment, a scheming paramour would have a weapon to <span class="GramE">keep the erring officer</span> going deeper and deeper into the
mess instead of rectifying the unfortunate error.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It would be a sword of Damocles keeping a
Judge who has stumbled from rising up, correcting the error, and terminating
the unfortunate relationship.</p>

<p class="BODY">Judge <span class="SpellE">Calanog</span> has positive
accomplishments in his favor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We are not
aware of any other shortcoming or offense committed by him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As a member of the Judiciary Planning
Development and Implementation Office (JPDIO), he has with talent and
resourcefulness represented judges allover the country, bringing their problems
to the JPDIO and the Courts attention.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Judicial reforms are more readily implemented because of close
coordination between the Office of the Court Administrator and the Philippine
Judges Association (PJA) which the respondent headed until recently.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The respondent initiated the College
Assurance Plan for children of Judges and a modest insurance plan which gives
death benefits to qualified members.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
has tried his best these past few years to push through a housing development
for members of the bench and apparently his efforts are about to bear
fruit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He and the other officers of the
PJA have shown unfailing respect for and cooperation with this Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent <span class="SpellE">Calanog</span>
has rallied all Judges to stand behind the Court when we were unfairly charged
or subjected to senseless vituperation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The respect which members of the bench and bar have accorded to the
respondent is shown by the warm receptions extended to him in <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span>, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, and other parts of the country when the PJA officers
visit their fellow Judges or attend judicial conferences and conventions.</p>

<p class="BODY">Ours is not only a court of law but also a court of equity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Mindful of the circumstances surrounding a

dealing with errant members of the Bar or Bench especially when the offenses
committed is the subject's first offense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>To illustrate a few:</p>

<p class="NUM">1)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span><u>In</u> <u>re:</u><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>Petition</u> <u>for</u> <u>the</u> <u>Dismissal</u>

(173 SCRA 719 [1989] - This is a case where reinstatement was ordered after
Judge <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> had,
in our view, sincerely evinced humble repentance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He admitted that he committed an error in
interpreting the law but we considered the mistake as not so grave as to
warrant the penalty of “virtually capital punishment.” The Court also
considered Judge <span class="SpellE">Dizon's</span> long years of dedicated and <span class="GramE">devoted,</span> service to the government.</p>

<p class="NUM">2)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE"><u>Tolentino</u></span>

Examining the lawyer's failure to give notice of an adverse decision to her
client, the court found that such error may be traced to the lawyer's
inexperience.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Considering that this was
the <u>first error</u> committed by the respondent, the court resolved to
merely admonish her instead of suspending her for one month as recommended by
the Solicitor General, the same being too harsh and severe.</p>

- Respondent, through his malpractice and gross misconduct in office committed
a most serious breach of public trust which under other circumstances could
well result in the forfeiture of his privilege and license as a member of the
Philippine Bar.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Taking into
consideration, however, the respondent's submission in effect to the report and
recommendation of the Solicitor General and his manifestations of remorse and finally,

for only six (6) months suspension.</p>

<p class="BODY">There, are likewise instances such as those involving Judges
entitled to full retirement benefits, where the Court has acted with compassion
for the sake of the wife or widow and the children of the respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">I submit that we should apply the reformative and not the
punitive principle in the instant case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>For the sake of the respondent's obviously bright future, the fair name
and honor of his family and the prospective service that he could render to the
judiciary and the nation, the Court should help the respondent redeem himself.</p>

<p class="BODY">CONSIDERING THE FOREGOING, I vote to impose a penalty of FORTY

warning that a repetition of the same offense shall be accorded the highest,
penalty within the Court’s power to impose.</p>
