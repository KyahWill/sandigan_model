South <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>, Branch I, in Criminal Case No. 1625
for murder, imposing the death penalty on accused-appellants Francisco <span class="SpellE">Aposaga</span> and <span class="SpellE">Constancio</span> Monte for
the murder of Atty. Jose <span class="SpellE">Barranda</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The victim, who was popularly called "Attorney", was a
law practitioner in <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> and <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the time of his death, he lived in his
36-hectare farm at <span class="SpellE">Palkan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Polomolok</span>,
South <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>, with his common-law wife Gloria <span class="SpellE">Salongcong</span> and their four children namely, Ruth, Samuel,
Ester and Jose, Jr. Gloria had four other children by a previous liaison,
namely, Fe, <span class="SpellE">Noe</span>, <span class="SpellE">Felomena</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Fely</span>, all surnamed Cabrera, who were likewise
staying with the couple at their house on the said farm. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>In the same barrio live the two
accused-appellants as well as <span class="SpellE">Sotera</span> <span class="SpellE">Salongcong</span> <span class="SpellE">Resaba</span>, a sister of
Gloria, whose house near the highway is about 1/2 kilometers away from the <span class="SpellE">Barrandas</span>'; Jesus Francisco, an ousted ex-tenant of
"Attorney" and a nephew of Gloria and <span class="SpellE">Sotera</span>,
whose house is also along the highway; and <span class="SpellE">Doroteo</span> <span class="SpellE">Estorque</span>, father of the common-law wife of
accused-appellant <span class="SpellE">Aposaga</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Monte was recruited by the deceased from his former employment as
security guard of <span class="SpellE">Lianga</span> Industries, Inc. in <span class="SpellE">Tumbis</span>, <span class="SpellE">Barobo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> <span class="GramE">del</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>,
to be the administrator of his farm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
arrived in <span class="SpellE">Polomolok</span> with his family in July, 1965
and stayed in a house owned by the <span class="SpellE">Barrandas</span> near
their own.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the house of the <span class="SpellE">Barrandas</span> there
were three then as now possible routes to the provincial highway, one passing
through the house of <span class="SpellE">Sotera</span> and Jesus on the General
Santos side, another through the house of <span class="SpellE">Aposaga</span> and
<span class="SpellE">Estorque</span> on the <span class="SpellE">Marbel</span>
side, and the third was a short cut through a small road, to the highway.</p>

<p class="BODY">The deceased was last seen alive in the morning of <st1:date year="1965" day="13" month="12">December 13, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had summoned Monte to their house at about
<st1:time minute="0" hour="18">six o'clock</st1:time> that morning, and they
conferred about the farm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Afterwards,
Monte had breakfast with "Attorney's" family before leaving the
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Attorney" also left
shortly thereafter to go to <span class="SpellE">Dadiangas</span>, taking the
second route (<span class="SpellE">Marbel</span> side) described above.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gloria <span class="SpellE">Salongcong</span>
also left the house one minute later for <span class="SpellE">Dadiangas</span>,
taking the first route on the General Santos side, to pass by the house of her
sister <span class="SpellE">Sotera</span> to fetch her daughter Fe, who was then
staying with <span class="SpellE">Sotera</span>, to bring her to <span class="SpellE">Dadiangas</span> for her medical examination.</p>

<p class="BODY">While walking on the trail to the highway, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Barranda</span> was chased by 3 men armed with bolos or knives,
who acted concertedly in hacking or stabbing the victim to death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His lifeless body was later buried inside a
dry well, while his portfolio and personal papers were buried around 300 meters
away from the body.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nothing was mentioned or heard about the death of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Barranda</span> until on <st1:date year="1966" day="20" month="1">January
 20, 1966</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Pio</span> Francisco came to Barrio <span class="SpellE">Palkan</span> to barter fish and visit his son Jesus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter told his father that he could
hardly sleep at night because he was being "abused" or
"raided" by <span class="SpellE">Aposaga</span>, Monte and alias <span class="SpellE">Calbo</span>, and that these three had killed the attorney.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Pio</span> verified the
matter from <span class="SpellE">Sotera</span> <span class="SpellE">Salongcong</span>,
who confirmed the killing of the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He decided to report to the authorities, but waited for the picture of
accused <span class="SpellE">Aposaga</span> in the possession of Gloria <span class="SpellE">Salongcong</span> before he made a report.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Pio</span> first mentioned the matter to a
Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Edoria</span> of the Philippine Constabulary when he
saw him in front of their house on <st1:date year="1966" day="30" month="1">January
 30, 1966</st1:date> or 48 days thereafter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Edoria</span> immediately brought him, together
with <span class="SpellE">Felomena</span> Cabrera, to the office of Sgt. Ricardo
Vargas of the 101st PC Company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
showed Sgt. Vargas a newspaper clipping about a certain Francisco <span class="SpellE">Lozada</span>, who was wanted by the authorities with a prize of
P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> on his head for a series of robbery and
murder cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After being told that the
wanted man was in barrio <span class="SpellE">Palkan</span>, Sgt. Vargas lost no
time in going to the said barrio, together with other PC soldiers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When they reached the said barrio, <span class="SpellE">Felomena</span> pointed to them the house of <span class="SpellE">Aposaga</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But when he confronted <span class="SpellE">Aposaga</span>,
he found out that his name was Francisco <span class="SpellE">Aposaga</span> and
not Francisco <span class="SpellE">Lozada</span>, and that his physical features
did not tally with the description in the newspaper clipping.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He therefore returned to headquarters without
making an arrest.</p>

<p class="BODY">At <st1:time minute="0" hour="12">noon</st1:time> of the same
day, <span class="SpellE">Felomena</span> Cabrera came <span class="SpellE">tosee</span>
him again, this time with Jesus Francisco, informing him that <span class="SpellE">Aposaga</span> was the killer of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Barranda</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only then that he learned of the
murder of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Barranda</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He therefore returned to <span class="SpellE">Palkan</span>
with 2 other PC officers to conduct an investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When they arrived there, <span class="SpellE">Aposaga</span>
was no longer in his house, having left for <span class="SpellE">Norala</span> to
harvest <span class="SpellE">palay</span>, according to his wife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, he proceeded with his
investigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="1" month="2">February 1, 1966</st1:date>
he took the statements of <span class="SpellE">Constancio</span> Monte (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "K", pp. 19-20, Folder of <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Exh</span></span><span class="GramE">.,</span>
Vol. <span class="GramE">I) and his wife, <span class="SpellE">Bienvenida</span> <span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span> Monte (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span>
"M", pp. 24-25, Folder of <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Exh</span></span><span class="GramE">.,</span> Vol. <span class="GramE">I), both pointing to <span class="SpellE">Aposaga</span> and <span class="SpellE">Calbo</span> as the killers,
and of <span class="SpellE">Noe</span> Cabrera (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span>
<span class="GramE">"I", p. 1, Folder of <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.,
Vol. II), naming <span class="SpellE">Aposaga</span>, Monte and <span class="SpellE">Calbo</span> as the culprits.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter he filed a motion to exhume the
body of the deceased (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "D", p. 10,
Folder of <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Exh</span></span><span class="GramE">.,</span> Vol. I).</p>

<p class="BODY">The examination was conducted on <st1:date year="1966" day="2" month="2">February 2, 1966</st1:date> in the presence of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> J. Reyes, municipal health officer of <span class="SpellE">Polomolok</span>, the PC provincial com­mander, the chief of
police, and members of the Rural Health Unit of <span class="SpellE">Polomolok</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They found the already decomposing body of
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Barranda</span>, which was identified through the
identifying information furnished by his wife, like the dentures, the clothes
he was wearing, his height and built, as well as the I.D. and personal papers
in his wallet and other things found on his body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the exhumation, they also unearthed the
valise or portfolio of the deceased which was buried about 300 meters away from
the body and 15 meters from the house of Jesus Francisco.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The spot was pointed to them by Jesus
Francisco himself who admittedly buried the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The valise contained the raincoat and other
personal things of the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
also recovered a cellophane bag containing some legal documents and land titles
purportedly removed from the bag of the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the basis of the above, a criminal
complaint dated <st1:date year="1966" day="1" month="2">February 1, 1966</st1:date>
was filed against Francisco <span class="SpellE">Aposaga</span>, alias <span class="SpellE">Calbo</span>, alias <span class="SpellE">Pedoy</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sotera</span> <span class="SpellE">Salongcong</span> and <span class="SpellE">Constancio</span> Monte (p. 5, CFI rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="14" month="2">February 14, 1966</st1:date>,
after more statements were taken, the complaint was amended (p. 4, CFI, rec.),
such that the name of alias <span class="SpellE">Calbo</span> was indicated as Alfredo
<span class="GramE">Villanueva, that</span> of alias <span class="SpellE">Pedoy</span>
as Jesus Francisco, and Gloria <span class="SpellE">Salongcong</span> was
included among the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of the six
accused named in the amended complaint (<span class="SpellE">Aposaga</span>,
Monte, Villanueva, alias <span class="SpellE">Calbo</span>, Francisco, alias <span class="SpellE">Pedoy</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sotera</span> <span class="SpellE">Salongcong</span>
and Gloria <span class="SpellE">Salongcong</span>), Villanueva remained at large
and never faced trial; Gloria <span class="SpellE">Salongcong</span> was ordered
excluded from the complaint on June 10, 1966 for insufficiency of evidence (p.
29, CFI rec.); and Jesus Francisco alias <span class="SpellE">Pedoy</span> was
likewise dropped from the complaint on January 10, 1967 upon motion of his
counsel (pp. 45-48, CFI rec.) for the purpose of utilizing him as a state
witness (p. 54, CFI rec.); and <span class="SpellE">Sotera</span> <span class="SpellE">Salongcong</span> was also excluded from the complaint upon her
own motion (pp. 50-51, CFI rec.) on January 27, 1967.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The warrant issued for Gloria <span class="SpellE">Salongcong</span> was therefore recalled, while Francisco and <span class="SpellE">Sotera</span>, who had been under detention, were ordered
released.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1967" day="4" month="8">August 4, 1967</st1:date>, Jesus Francisco was ordered
re-included in the complaint and a new warrant issued for his arrest (p. 76,
CFI rec.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet, despite his appearance
in court as a witness for the prosecution, he was never re-arrested.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, only <span class="SpellE">Aposaga</span>
and Monte faced trial after they waived their right to the second stage of the
preliminary investigation (p. 79, CFI rec.), and <span class="GramE">an
information</span> was filed against them on <st1:date year="1968" day="24" month="4">April 24, 1968</st1:date> (p. 81, CFI rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the trial court in its decision (pp. 136-179, CFI
rec.) dated April 28, 1969, found the two accused guilty of murder and
sentenced them to the supreme penalty of death and to indemnify the heirs of
the deceased in the amount of P12,000.00 as well as to pay the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court noted that the evidence for the prosecution
suffered from many flaws and some incon­sistencies (p. 31, rec.). <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless, it gave credence to the
testimonies of two alleged eyewitnesses and other corroborative witnesses for
the state.</p>

highway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Paran</span>
(Francisco <span class="SpellE">Aposaga</span>) and <span class="SpellE">Calbo</span>
(Alfredo or Jessie Villanueva) ran after him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All at once <span class="SpellE">Paran</span> hacked him in the neck while
<span class="SpellE">Calbo</span> thrust his knife at the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deceased ("Attorney") was
trying to parry their blows with the sweater he was carrying.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then <span class="SpellE">Constancio</span>
Monte arrived and also hacked the victim.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When the victim stumbled and fell, Monte rode on him and thrust his
knife through the victim's stomach.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
was just about 25 meters away from them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Later, the two dragged the victim's body to the <span class="SpellE">cogonal</span>
area, after which they approached the witness (<span class="SpellE">Noe</span>),
and <span class="SpellE">Paran</span> threatened him that if he should squeal, he
and his mother, sisters and brothers were going to be killed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Monte got the bag carried by the deceased and
they left towards the direction of the highway.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The witness went home to eat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
mother was not in the house yet, having left earlier for <span class="SpellE">Dadiangas</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">When his mother arrived home in the afternoon, she asked him if
he had seen his stepfather, to which he answered no.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She therefore asked him to accompany her in

to the house of <span class="SpellE">Dorot</span> (<span class="SpellE">Doroteo</span>

Monte, <span class="SpellE">Paran</span> and <span class="SpellE">Calbo</span>, the
wife of Monte, and others, drinking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His

<p class="BODY">The wife of <span class="SpellE">Dorot</span> said that Attorney
rode a yellow bus going to <span class="SpellE">Marbel</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Dorot</span> and his son
Vicente also gave the same information.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She asked other persons, who gave negative information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When they went home, Monte and his wife came

going to <st1:city><st1:place>San Francisco</st1:place></st1:city> (<span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>) to look for Attorney.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But Monte advised her not to go any more

downstairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Monte followed him to borrow
his sledge, which he lent to him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Afterwards, he brought his horse to Crossing <span class="SpellE">Palkan</span>
to drink.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he was returning home, he
saw Vicente, <span class="SpellE">Calbo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Paran</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Vicente was riding the <span class="SpellE">carabao</span>
while <span class="SpellE">Calbo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Paran</span> were
following the sledge, where the body of their stepfather was loaded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were going towards barrio <span class="SpellE">Palkan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He <span class="GramE">lot</span> his horse run and headed for home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not tell his mother or his brothers
and sisters about the attack on his stepfather because he was afraid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only when he was brought to the PC
headquarters in <span class="SpellE">Dadiangas</span> that he talked of the
incident for there he was no longer afraid (pp. 5-63, <span class="SpellE">TSN</span>).</p>

</span>In the morning of the said date, her stepfather summoned Monte to their
house, and the two talked for sometime.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, Monte ate breakfast with them before returning to his
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he had gone, Attorney
prepared to leave for <span class="SpellE">Dadiangas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He left via their kitchen towards the west to
the national highway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">One

hacking her stepfather with two others, namely, <span class="SpellE">Aposaga</span>
and alias <span class="SpellE">Calbo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She went to the house of Monte and asked Monte's wife, <span class="SpellE">Bienvenida</span>, why they killed Attorney.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Bienvenida</span> answered
"because the Attorney is a bad man".<span style="">&nbsp;

a field about 500 meters north of the residence of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Barranda</span>,

the bones – as scapula and right clavicle, simply means that the big cut
involved only the muscles, big blood vessels and vital nerves of the right side
of the lower part of the neck and shoulder area near that side of the neck --
in short, the soft tissues were cut, without cutting the bones (called the hard
tissue).</blockquote>

described in para­graph (a) was a thrust wound inflicted while the victim was
standing in front of the assailant (p. 219, <span class="SpellE">TSN</span>); the

down; the other one under paragraph (c) could have been caused by mauling while

where he used to work as guard of its bulldozer department.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In July of 1965, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Barranda</span>
convinced him to go with him to <span class="SpellE">Palkan</span>, <st1:place>South
 <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span></st1:place>, to be the overseer of his
36-hectare farm, as a condition of which he need not give any share of the

wife, Gloria <span class="SpellE">Salongcong</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In addition, he (Monte) will get 25% of the

planted to potatoes and cabbage, plus P5.00 monthly per head of the <span class="SpellE">carabaos</span>, horses and cattle he was supposed to care
for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he arrived with his family in <span class="SpellE">Palkan</span> in the same month, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Barranda</span>
called for <span class="SpellE">Sotera</span> <span class="SpellE">Salongcong</span>
and Jesus Francisco, his erstwhile tenants, and told them that it was their
last day as Monte was taking over. Atty. <span class="SpellE">Barranda</span>
instructed him (Monte) to get the <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> and plow
from Jesus Francisco.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the month of December, Fe Cabrera informed him that she was
raped by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Barranda</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometime later, while he was under the <span class="SpellE">Barrandas</span>' house to fetch the cow, he overheard a

Francisco running, followed by <span class="SpellE">Calbo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not know who <span class="SpellE">Calbo</span>
was, but <span class="SpellE">Noe</span> told him that he is from <span class="SpellE">Polo­molok</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However,

to sign by Sgt. Vargas although he told the judge that there was an error.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The error was that when he mentioned the name

not know how to go about the correction.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was only when Francisco <span class="SpellE">Aposaga</span>, who is his

one week after (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">"L",
p. 21, Folder of Exhibits, Vol.</span> I), he was made to sign the same without
appearing before Judge <span class="SpellE">Mirabueno</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants now raise only one issue -- <span class="GramE">that</span>
the prosecution failed to prove their guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They try to discredit the testimonies of the
prosecution witnesses, particularly those of the two eyewitnesses which, they
claim, are "corrupt, bias, unreliable and incompetent because of their
inherent improbabilities" (p. 86, rec.), as shown by the following
circumstances:</p>

</span>Why did he not tell his mother about it when the latter arrived home
from <span class="SpellE">Dadiangas</span> and was asking about the victim (p.

did he have to go with his mother around the barrio to look for his stepfather
if he knew — after having witnessed the killing -- <span class="GramE">that</span>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How could <span class="SpellE">Felomena</span>
have witnessed the murder of her stepfather from the kitchen of their house
when, according to the PC investigator, Sgt. Vargas, the place of the incident
was not visible from the kitchen or balcony of the <span class="SpellE">Barranda</span>
house because it was covered by banana hills, <span class="SpellE">talahibs</span>
and <span class="SpellE">calamansi</span> trees (pp. 301-302, <span class="SpellE">TSN</span>)?</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Why did she not secretly tell her mother

the murder of her stepfather but about the presence of a certain wanted man in
their barrio (p. 264, <span class="SpellE">TSN</span>)?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why did it take her 48 days to make such
report?</p>

<p class="BODY">WE find the above observations insufficient to warrant the
exculpation of the appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While it
is true that the testimonies of the two eyewitnesses may have suffered flaws
and inconsistencies, the same refer only to minor details which are not
sufficient to destroy their credibility.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Their actuations after witnessing the commission of the crime (i.e., not
shouting or running for help, not reporting earlier, etc.), do not indicate
that they were not present when the killing of their stepfather took
place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, the testimony of the PC
investigator that the place of the incident is not visible from the kitchen of
the victim's house, because of the presence of banana hills, <span class="SpellE">talahibs</span> and <span class="SpellE">calamansi</span> trees,
cannot overcome the positive assertion of <span class="SpellE">Felomena</span>
that she saw her stepfather killed, especially so since the investigation took
place about 50 days after the incident and conditions obtaining them may be
different from those at the time of the offense.</p>

<p class="BODY">A closer scrutiny of their testimonies shows convincingly that
they had indeed witnessed the com­mission of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only doubtful portion is their allegation
that they were threatened with death -- with their mother the first to be
killed -- against revealing it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because,
even if there were such a threat, they could have secretly revealed it to their
mother who would certainly take steps to protect them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, if the danger of the threat was real
to them, they should have stopped going to the houses, of the accused, instead
of maintaining normal relations with them after the incident; <span class="SpellE">Felomena</span> should not have gone to the PC headquarters twice
on January 30, 1966; and <span class="SpellE">Noe</span> should not have slept in
the house of Monte after his family had gone to <span class="SpellE">Dadiangas</span>
to make the report.</p>

<p class="BODY">These actuations are inconsistent with the reality of the
threat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is easier to believe that
they discussed the incident with their mother but had to deny it to protect
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The maxim "blood is thicker
than water" must have prompted these two (2) eyewitnesses to insist that
their mother did not know anything about it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Otherwise, the involvement of their mother and other close relatives
will be an undeniable conclusion.</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, the trial court, while noting the same flaws and
inconsistencies, gave credence to the testimonies of the said eyewitnesses who,
despite their minority, the excitement generated by the court proceedings and
the long and searching cross-examinations, firmly stuck to their testimonies
which pointed to the appellants and a companion known as <span class="SpellE">Calbo</span>
as the killers of their stepfather.</p>

<p class="BODY">Time and time again WE have ruled that where the issue is
credibility of the witnesses, appellate courts will generally not disturb the
findings of the trial judge, who heard the witnesses themselves and observed
their deportment and manner of testifying, unless he has plainly overlooked
certain facts of substance and value that, if considered, might affect the result
of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This exception does not
obtain here (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Laguisma</span>, 98 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 69 [1980]; People vs. de la Cruz, 97 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 386 [1980]; People vs. Bautista y <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>,
92 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 465, 472 [1979]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, no motive was shown why the two eyewitnesses should
testify against them falsely; hence, they must be telling the truth (People vs.
<span class="SpellE">Arevalo</span>, 92 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 207
[1979]; People vs. Lim, 71 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 249 [1976]).</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellants likewise theorize that the prosecution witnesses <span class="SpellE">Sotera</span> <span class="SpellE">Salongcong</span>, Jesus
Francisco and probably Gloria <span class="SpellE">Salongcong</span> must have
plotted against the life of the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Sotera</span> and Jesus harbor resentment against the
victim for having ousted them from their tenancy in favor of Monte.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, <span class="SpellE">Sotera</span>
wanted to revenge the raping of her niece by the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These are strong motives to do away with the
victim, whereas the appellants have no motive to kill him.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case of People vs. <span class="SpellE">Veloso</span> (92 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 515, 524 [1979]), WE held that motive, as
distinguished from criminal intent, is not an essential element of a crime and
hence, need not be proved for purposes of conviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Motive is essential to conviction in murder
cases only when there is doubt as to the identity of the culprit, something
which does not obtain in this case (also People vs. <span class="SpellE">Verzo</span>,
21 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 1403 [1967]; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Caggauan</span>,
94 Phil. 118 [1953]).</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense vainly tried to utilize the apparent involvement of
the prosecution witnesses Gloria and <span class="SpellE">Sotera</span> <span class="SpellE">Salongcong</span> and Jesus Francisco in claiming a frame-up and a
scheme to lay the blame on the two (2) accused-appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While WE agree with the observation that
these 3 witnesses are probably involved in various ways and degrees, and their
exclusion from the charge is questionable, WE cannot find any reason to believe
that the appellants are innocent as they pretend to be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">As aptly held by the trial
court, "that there were principals by induction in the commission of a
crime who were not prosecuted is no legal impediment to a finding of guilt of
the principals by direct participation for the same crime.</span> x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">x</span></span><span class="GramE"><span style="">&nbsp; </span>[</span>T]he
non-prosecution of Gloria and <span class="SpellE">Sotera</span> <span class="SpellE">Salongcong</span> in the case at bar did not make the <span class="SpellE">indictees</span> before us less guilty, much more, innocent as to
be blessed with a judgment of acquittal" (pp. 52-53, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">On the contrary, the guilt of both appellants <span class="GramE">appear</span>
to be a moral certainty, even without the testimonies of Gloria, <span class="SpellE">Sotera</span> and Jesus.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Aside from the positive identification of the two eyewitnesses, the
evidence even of the defense <span class="GramE">tend</span> to establish the
guilt of the appellants.</p>

<p class="BODY">The tale woven by <span class="SpellE">Aposaga</span> about his
sudden departure from <span class="SpellE">Polomolok</span> as soon as the
authorities started the investigation, was not only uncorroborated but was also
too improbable to believe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First, he
said he told Vargas that he was going to <span class="SpellE">Norala</span> for a
vacation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When Vargas returned after he
had gone, his wife told Vargas that <span class="SpellE">Aposaga</span> went to <span class="SpellE">Norala</span> to harvest <span class="SpellE">palay</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he reached <span class="SpellE">Norala</span>,
his aunt told him to proceed to <st1:city><st1:place>Iloilo</st1:place></st1:city>
because his mother was ill.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the
source of his aunt's information was the same cousin who allegedly fetched him
from <span class="SpellE">Polomolok</span> for the self-same reason -- the
alleged illness of his mother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
allegedly stayed in <st1:city><st1:place>Iloilo</st1:place></st1:city> for
about 8 to 10 months although according to the records, he was there for more
than a year until the policemen from <span class="SpellE">Polomolok</span> came
to arrest him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be pointed out
that his sudden departure must have left his wife and child in <span class="SpellE">Polomolok</span> without any means of support, as the land he was
plowing was never planted after he left (p. 409, <span class="SpellE">TSN</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All these could lead to but one conclusion --
<span class="GramE">that</span> he had to flee and hide with his guilty
conscience to avoid arrest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Flight and
going into hiding indicate a guilty conscience (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span>,
94 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 642 [1979]; People vs. Moreno, 85 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 649 [1978]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Defense witnesses <span class="SpellE">Doroteo</span> and Vicente <span class="SpellE">Estorque</span>, father and brother, respectively of <span class="SpellE">Aposaga's</span> common-law wife, tried to establish an alibi for <span class="SpellE">Aposaga</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their
testimonies, however, are inherently weak and doubtful in many substantial
aspects, and appear to be nothing more than vain attempts to save a
"family member" from conviction.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For instance, they testified that <span class="SpellE">Aposaga</span> was
plowing with them at the time of the incident.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Doroteo</span>, however, stated that when he heard
the shout "wait, wait", <span class="SpellE">Aposaga</span> was 30 meters
behind him although he could not see him as he was hidden by <span class="SpellE">talahibs</span> (p. 385, <span class="SpellE">TSN</span>; <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">J-1).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Vicente, on the other hand, plowed with <span class="SpellE">Aposaga</span> and his father only from <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00</st1:time> to <st1:time minute="30" hour="10">10:30</st1:time>
that morning (p. 404, <span class="SpellE">TSN</span>), whereas the incident
occurred between <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">6:00</st1:time> and <st1:time minute="0" hour="7">7:00 A.M.</st1:time> <span class="SpellE">Doroteo</span>
further declared that there was nothing unusual that happened on <st1:date year="1965" day="13" month="12">December 13, 1965</st1:date>, and he does not
remember what day it was. Yet, he could recall at the witness stand four (4)
years later that he saw Gloria <span class="SpellE">Salongcong</span> running at five
o'clock that morning; what dress Gloria was wearing; what time they started
plowing (6:00 A.M.); what time they left the farm; what time they took their
meals; what they ate for breakfast and lunch and other minor details of daily
life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Doroteo</span>
claimed that he does not know <span class="SpellE">Calbo</span> but he admitted
seeing him in the house of Monte that fateful morning of December 13th (p. 394,
<span class="SpellE">TSN</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He never
tried to find out who uttered the words "wait, wait" (p. 394, <span class="SpellE">TSN</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was
surprised to learn of the death of the victim whom he had believed to be in <span class="SpellE">Bislig</span> (p. 386, <span class="SpellE">TSN</span>); but he
never visited the remains after exhumation when he already knew he was dead (p.
379, <span class="SpellE">TSN</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is
this the natural reaction to a surprising death of a barrio-mate who owned the
land he was plowing?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Vicente's testimony
likewise suffered from similar inconsistencies and improbabilities as to
command little, if any, probative value.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The testimonies of these defense witnesses are mere concoctions that
cannot neutralize the positive identification of the appellants by the two
prosecution witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, it is a well-settled doctrine that for alibi to be
acceptable, it must be shown that the place where the accused was alleged to be
must be located at such a distance that it is well-nigh impossible for him to
be at the scene of the crime when it was committed (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Tirol</span>, L-30538, January 31, 1981; People vs. de la Cruz, 97
<span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 387 [1980]; People vs. Mercado 97 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 232 [1980]; People vs. Angeles, 92 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span>
432 [1979]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such was not the situation
in this case; for the place where <span class="SpellE">Aposaga</span> was
allegedly plowing was only about 150 meters from the house of the victim (p.
368, <span class="SpellE">TSN</span>) and within hearing distance from the place
of the incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The place of the
incident in turn was only 60 to 70 meters from the victim's house (p. 314, <span class="SpellE">TSN</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was there­fore
very convenient for <span class="SpellE">Aposaga</span> to slip away from his
plowing and participate in the murder of the deceased even if he actually
plowed the farm in the morning of <st1:date year="1965" day="13" month="12">December
 13, 1965</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, <span class="SpellE">Aposaga</span> was named as a
killer of the deceased in two sworn statements executed by his co-accused Monte
(<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. <span class="GramE">"K" and
"L"), which sworn statements were corroborated by his wife <span class="SpellE">Bienvenida</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span>
"M").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Monte tried to retract
these statements on the witness stand by explaining that when he said
"Francisco" he meant Jesus Francisco, and not appellant Francisco <span class="SpellE">Aposaga</span>, and that the said affidavit was never read to him
by Municipal Judge <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> <span class="SpellE">Mirabueno</span>,
before whom he signed and swore to it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The latter claim was belied by Judge <span class="SpellE">Mirabueno</span>
who testified that he read the contents of all affidavits to the affiants and
made sure they under­stood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also
asked searching questions to determine the truth of their statements (pp.
557-569, <span class="SpellE">TSN</span>).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Since it has not been shown that the said judge has any interest in the
case, it is not difficult to determine which of the two (2) testimonies
deserves consideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the claim of mistaken identity of the person named
"Francisco", it is obvious from the very substance of Monte's sworn
statements that the "Francisco <span class="SpellE">Aposaga</span>" he
named therein as a killer of the deceased was different and distinct from the
"Jesus Francisco" (<span class="SpellE">Pedoy</span>) who buried the
leather bag of the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, it
is understandable that Monte will try his best to save his co-accused who had
so gallantly provided him a defense counsel which he could not afford.</p>

<p class="BODY">For his part, Monte tried to establish his innocence by pointing
out that it was unnatural for him to kill Atty. <span class="SpellE">Barranda</span>
after the latter had satisfactorily explained about the problems of his work
and after they had breakfast together (p. 82, rec.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, he had no motive to kill his
employer and benefactor who had given him better opportunities and sufficient
means to support his family by taking him as tenant and supervisor (pp. 89-90,
rec.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, these allegations
cannot overcome the incriminating testimonies of the two (2) eyewitnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, even from his own testimony, the
following circumstantial evidence <span class="GramE">appear</span> to be inconsistent
with his innocence:</p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Monte testified that he
heard of a threat against the life of the deceased in a conversation among
Gloria <span class="SpellE">Salongcong</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sotera</span> <span class="SpellE">Salongcong</span> and Jesus Francisco (p. 471, <span class="SpellE">TSN</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet, when he saw Jesus running after the
deceased carrying a bolo, he did not even look to see what Jesus intended to do
(pp. 485-486; 500-501, <span class="SpellE">TSN</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not do anything
about the disappearance of his employer for forty-eight (48) days, even though
the last time he saw him (deceased) was when somebody (Jesus Francisco) was
running after him (pp. 500-501, <span class="SpellE">TSN</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it were true that the
deceased had told him he was going to <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span> to
become a judge (p. 475, <span class="SpellE">TSN</span>), why did he not remind
Gloria of such fact when Gloria came looking for her husband (p. 489, <span class="SpellE">TSN</span>)?</p>

<p class="BODY">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although he saw Jesus
running after the deceased that morning, he did not say so when Gloria asked
him about the deceased; and when Gloria expressed the possibility that the
deceased might have been waylaid, his answer was, "Nobody could do that
because it is daytime" (p. 490, <span class="SpellE">TSN</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Monte escaped from the
municipal jail on <st1:date year="1966" day="9" month="7">July 9, 1966</st1:date>,
allegedly because his wife was sick in <st1:city><st1:place>San Francisco</st1:place></st1:city>,
<span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
explained that when he wired his wife to inform her that their hearing will be
in May (1966), his father-in-law replied that she was sick (p. 524, <span class="SpellE">TSN</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If that were
true and this allegation was never corroborated, his escape should have been
timed around May, 1966, and not July of that year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records do not disclose any hearing in
July, 1966.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Surely, it is more logical
to conclude that Monte's flight, like that of his co-accused, indicated a
guilty conscience.</p>

<p class="BODY">All the above could lead but to one conclusion, that the guilt of
the two (2) accused-appellants has been proven beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">This case should, however, be further investigated to determine
the participation of <span class="SpellE">Sotera</span> <span class="SpellE">Salongcong</span>,
Jesus Francisco and Gloria <span class="SpellE">Salongcong</span> in the
perpetration of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their own
respective statements implicate themselves.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, as pointed out by the appellants, these prosecution witnesses
have strong motives to kill the deceased:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Sotera</span> and Jesus for their ouster from
tenancy, and Gloria for the rape of her daughter Fe.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, for lack of necessary votes, the death penalty cannot be
imposed.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> THE JUDGMENT APPEALED FROM IS HEREBY AFFIRMED,
WITH THE MODIFICATION THAT APPELLANTS ARE HEREBY SENTENCED TO <u>RECLUSION</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>PERPETUA</u></span>, WITH COSTS AGAINST THEM.</p>

<p class="BODY">LET A COPY OF THIS DECISION BE FURNISHED THE MINISTER OF JUSTICE
FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION SO THAT OTHERS WHO APPEAR RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CRIME
MAY BE DULY PROSECUTED.</p>
