employees from reporting for work and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">SSS
</span>members from transacting business with the SSS; that the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">strike was </span>reported to the Public

that the strikers refused to return to work; and that the SSS suffered damages <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">as a </span>result of the strike.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The complaint prayed that a writ of

(petitioners herein) be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">ordered to pay
damages; and that the strike be declared illegal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that the SSSEA went on strike after the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">SSS </span>failed to act on the union's

pay and holiday pay; conversion of temporary or contractual employees with <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">six </span>(6) months or more of service into
regular and permanent employees and their entitlement to the same salaries,
allowances and benefits given to other regular employees of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">SSS; </span>and payment of the children's

for decision.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The position of the petitioners is that the Regional Trial Court
had no jurisdiction to hear the case initiated by the SSS and to issue the
restraining order and the writ <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of
preliminary injunction, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">as </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">jurisdiction lay with the Department of Labor

involves </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">labor dispute.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">SSS
</span>advances the contrary view, on the ground that the employees of the SSS
are covered by civil service laws and rules and regulations, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">not the Labor Code, therefore they </span>do <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">not have the right to strike.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since neither the DOLE nor the NLRC has
jurisdiction over the dispute, the Regional Trial Court may enjoin the
employees from striking.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In dismissing the
petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition with preliminary injunction
filed by petitioners, the Court of Appeals held that since the employees of the
SSS, are government employees, they are not allowed to strike, and may be
enjoined by the Regional Trial Court, which had jurisdiction over the SSS’
complaint for damages, from continuing with their strike.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Thus, the sequential

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The 1987 Constitution, in
the Article on Social Justice and Human Rights, provides that the State
"shall guarantee the rights of all workers to self-organization,
collective bargaining and negotiations, and peaceful concerted activities,
including </span>the right to strike in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">accordance
with law" [Art. XIII, Sec. 3.]<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">By itself, this provision
would seem to recognize the right of all workers and employees, including those
in the public sector, to strike.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But the
Constitution itself fails to expressly confirm this impression, for in the
Sub-Article on the Civil Service Commission, it provides, after defining the
scope of the civil service as "all branches, subdivisions,
instrumentalities, and agencies of the </span>Government, including
government-owned or controlled corporations with original charters," that
"[t]he right to self-organization shall not be denied to government <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">employees" [Art. <span class="GramE">IX(</span>B),
Sec. 2(1) and (5).] Parenthetically, the Bill of Rights also provides that
"[t]he right of the people, including those employed in the public and
private sectors, to form unions, associations, or societies for purposes not
contrary to law shall not abridged" [Art. III, Sec. 8.] Thus, while there
is </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">no </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">question that the Constitution recognizes the
right of government employees to organize, it is silent as to whether such
recognition also includes the right to strike.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Resort to the intent of
the framers of the organic law becomes helpful in understanding the meaning of
these provisions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A reading of the
proceedings of the Constitutional Commission that drafted the 1987 Constitution
would show that in recognizing the right of government employees to organize,
the commissioners intended to limit the right to the formation of unions or
associations only, without including the right to strike.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

because they have the right to organize, they also have the right to
strike.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That is a different matter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We are only talking about organizing, uniting
as </span>a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">union.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>With regard to the right to strike, everyone
will remember that in the Bill of Rights, there is </span>a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">provision that the right to form </span>associations
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">or societies whose purpose is not
contrary to law shall not be abridged.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Now then, if the purpose of the state is to prohibit the strikes coming
from employees exercising government functions, that could be done because the
moment that is prohibited, then the union which will go on strike will be an
illegal union.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And that provision is
carried in Republic Act 875.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">In </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

moment we allow anybody in the government to strike, then what will happen if
the members of the </span>Armed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Forces
will go on strike?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What will happen to
those people trying to protect us?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So
that is a matter of discussion in the Committee on Social Justice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But, I repeat, the right to form an
