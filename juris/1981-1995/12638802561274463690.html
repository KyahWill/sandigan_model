				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The instant petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> seeks to set
aside the decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. No. 03262 entitled
"People of the Philippines vs. Isidro Mendoza" which affirmed the
appealed decision of the Regional Trial Court of Daet, Camarines Norte, finding
then accused-appellant Isidro Mendoza guilty of the crime of homicide and
sentencing him to an indeterminate penalty of imprisonment of six (6) years and
one (1) day of <u>prision</u> <u>mayor</u> as minimum to twelve (12) years and
one (1) day of <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u> as maximum and to indemnify the
<span style="">heirs of the victim Sofia Libranda in
the amount of P30,000.00 plus P8,300.00 as compensatory damages and to pay the
costs.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The facts as found by the trial court and adopted by the
Appellate Court are as follows:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">At about 5:20 in the morning of October 13, 1983 while Norma
Vardeloza Nasayao, a 42-year old housewife, was making wrappers (bags for rice)
out of empty cement bags in her house in Barangay Minasag (Rizal), Sta. Elena,
Camarines Norte, she heard a woman shouting:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Huwag mong saksakin, huwag mong saksakin."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Norma went down her house to investigate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From a distance of one meter, she saw the
accused-appellant approach and stab Sofio Libranda on the left breast with a
bladed weapon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sofio <span style="">then leaned on the shoulder of Eleanor Amparo
Mendoza, the wife of the accused-appellant, for support.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon seeing Sofio's critical condition, Norma ran to the house of
Sofio to ask for help.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She found his
widowed sister, <span style="">Gregoria, who, </span>on
being informed that Sofio had been stabbed, ran to <span style="">her </span>brother's <span style="">succor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Gregoria saw him leaning face down
("subsob") on the back of Eleanor, while the accused Isidro stood
nearby.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sofio then sat down on a
bench.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gregoria saw that <span style="">he was bleeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gregoria asked him who stabbed him and he
answered that it was Isidro Mendoza.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Gregoria and her brother Nolasco Libranda brought the wounded
Sofio to the nearby clinic of Dr. Cesar Umali.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After giving the victim first-aid treatment, the doctor advised the
Librandas to take Sofio to a hospital in Calauag, Quezon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were still far from Calauag when Sofio
died.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to the death certificate, the forty-two year old Sofio
Libranda succumbed <span style="">t</span>o the
following injuries:</p>

<blockquote>"Stab wounds at the following areas of the body:</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(a) Incised wound
at left med clavicular 3rd intercostal space, measuring 5 cm. length and 5 cm.
in depth.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(b) Incised wound
at left lower chin measuring 2.5 cm. length.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(c) Incised wound
at left shoulder measuring 2.5 cm. length.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(d) Incised wound
right upper chest (back) measuring 5 cm. length."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In an information dated January 12, 1984, accused Isidro Mendoza
was charged with homicide for <span style="">the </span>death
of Sofio Libranda.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon arraignment,
Isidro pleaded not guilty and trial ensued.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On February 3, 1986, the trial court rendered a judg­ment of conviction
which on appeal to the Court <span style="">of </span>Appeals
was affirmed <u>in</u><span style=""> </span><u>toto</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence this recourse.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused, now petitioner, contends that the courts <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
erred in relying on the so-called positive identification made by <span style="">Norma Nasayao, in concluding that </span>his
wife Eleanor and <span style="">the deceased Sofio had
an amorous relationship based on the love letters allegedly written by Eleanor,
and, in not acquitting him on reasonable doubt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petition is devoid of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the outset, it must be stressed that generally, when an
appealed conviction hinges on the credibility of witnesses, the assessment of
the trial court is accorded the highest degree of respect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Absent any proper reason to depart from this
fundamental rule, factual conclusions reached by the lower court, which <span style="">had the opportunity to observe and evaluate
the demeanor of the witnesses while on the witness stand, should not be
disturbed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Isidro Mendoza now insists that Nasayao could not have
witnessed the actual stabbing as she had claimed because it is his submission
that it was his wife, Eleanor, who fatally stabbed Sofio in an attempt to ward
off Sofio's lewd advances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To prove his
point, petitioner presented photographs showing bloodstains in various parts of
his house and a toppled chair as testimonies to the struggle between his wife
and Sofio which ended in death for Sofio.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He also brought out the fact that it was Eleanor who surrendered to the
nearby Philippine Constabulary base patrol and later to the police station in
Sta. Elena where she gave a written statement whereby she confessed having
stabbed <span style="">Sofio in defense of her honor
but only to subsequently refuse to sign the statement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner likewise presented as defense witness CHDF member
Armando de la Cruz who stated that on his way to his detachment at about 5:00
o'clock in the morning of August 13, 1983, in Sta. <span style="">Elena, he saw the shadow </span>of <span style="">two persons moving around as if in circle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As De la Cruz moved nearer, he saw a man and
a woman embracing each other but one was holding a bladed weapon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then the two figures started grappling for
possession of the weapon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He shouted at
them to stop.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He recognized the man as
Sofio Libranda and the woman as Eleanor Mendoza.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The woman was holding the bladed weapon.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">But on cross-examination, De La Cruz admitted that he did not see
the actual stabbing.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court and the appellate court did not err in according
more weight to the eyewitness account of Norma Nasayao.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The transcript clearly reflected her
candidness and innate intel­ligence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her
answers were forthright and direct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At a
short distance of one <span style="">meter, it was </span>indeed
possible for her to have <span style="">witnessed the
crime as it swiftly unfolded before her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She knew </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">characters well because they were neighbors.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, Norma Nasayao's unerring recognition of petitioner as
the knifewielder had strong corroboration from Gregoria and Nolasco Libranda,
the victim's sister and brother, respectively.</p>

<p class="BODY">Right after the stabbing when Norma called out to them, Gregoria
rushed to her brother's side and asked him who did it and her brother replied
"Isidro Mendoza." For his part, Nolasco recounted:</p>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
did you come to know that your brother Sofio was stabbed by Isidro Mendoza?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Norma
Nasayao came running to our house shouting, ‘Sinaksak ni Isidro Mendoza si
Sofio!’</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Q<span style="">:<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>What did you do when Norma <span style="">Nasayao </span>came to you running and
shouting that Sofio, your brother, was <span style="">stabbed
</span>by Isidro Mendoza?<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
immediately proceeded to the place of the incident, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What
did you find out at the <span style="">place of </span>the
incident?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
saw my brother seated on a bench, he was bloody.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What
did you do when you saw your brother seated on a bench, bloody?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
asked him who stabbed him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What
was Sofio's answer?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
said that I do stabbed him and ‘I do’ in our place is Isidro Mendoza."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From the telltale blood spatters found in the house of petitioner
and the furniture in disarray, the trial court concluded that it was none other
than petitioner who stabbed the deceased while they were inside the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consumed with rage because he had just caught
his wife with the half-naked Sofio <span style="">right
in his own conjugal home, petitioner unrelentingly pursued his victim up to the
roadside where Norma Nasayao caught sight of Eleanor trying vainly to stop the
two men who were moving in circles, until petitioner was able to wound Sofio
once again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, petitioner
dropped the knife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deceased leaned
against Eleanor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was the scenario
witnessed by CHDF De La Cruz who mistakenly deduced </span><span style="">that </span><span style="">it was Eleanor who mortally knifed Sofio.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Going now to the controversial love letters reportedly written to
Sofio by Eleanor, whether or not she did write those incriminating letters is
not material in view of the positive identification by an eyewitness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are relevant insofar as they have
established the motive of the petitioner in killing <span style="">Sofio, which was to avenge his honor as a husband who has been wronged
by his wife in the most humiliating manner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that the conviction of Isidro Mendoza for homicide, <span style="">mitigated by passion </span><span style="">and obfuscation, was in accordance with law
and jurisprudence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be upheld.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the instant petition is hereby DENIED for lack
of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finding no reversible error in
the decision under review, the same is AFFIRMED but with the sole modification
that the indemnity to be paid by petitioner Isidro Mendoza to the heirs of the
victim be increased to P50,000.00 in line with recent jurisprudence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Costs against petitioner.</p>
