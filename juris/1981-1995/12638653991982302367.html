dated July 14, 1988 of the respondent appellate court in CA - G.R. CV - No.

Pedro Ramon <span class="SpellE">Jao</span> and Catalina <span class="SpellE">Jao</span>
(hereinafter referred to as JAO), executed a deed of absolute sale selling to
spouses <span class="SpellE">Zosimo</span> H. Tan and Elizabeth O. Tan
(hereinafter referred to as TAN) four (4) hectares of property located in <span class="SpellE">Novaliches</span>, <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> City, for and

 31, 1956</st1:date>, the said deed of sale was registered with the Register of
Deeds, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> and TCT No. 45783 was issued

<p class="BODY">According to JAO, the four (4) hectares of land was merely loaned
to TAN to be utilized as a site of a <st1:place><st1:placename>Chinese</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Temple</st1:placetype></st1:place> to be returned to JAO if the
temple could not be erected in five (5) years from the date of said

<p class="BODY">It appears however that a certain <span class="SpellE">Segundina</span>
<span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Tiongson</span>
fraudulently holding herself out as Elizabeth O. Tan filed a petition for the
issuance of a new owner's duplicate of Transfer Certificate of Title No. 45783
in lieu of the one supposedly lost, successfully obtained another duplicate
copy thereof on February 7, 1964 and then on February 10, 1964 executed <span style="">a </span>false deed of absolute sale in her
favor which was inscribed at the back of TCT No. 45783 resulting in its
cancellation and the issuance of TCT No. 3559 in the name of <span class="SpellE">Segundina</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Tiongson</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Tiongson</span> then offered the property for <span style="">sale </span>to the spouses Pablo and <span class="SpellE">Laureana</span> <span class="SpellE">Bairan</span> (herein referred
to as BAIRAN) <span style="">who </span>after finding
after verification with the Register of Deeds that the title of <span class="SpellE">Tiongson</span> was <span style="">in </span>order
bought <span style="">the </span>same and was issued
TCT No. 3667.</p>

<p class="BODY">All the while that the foregoing transactions transpired, TCT
45783, allegedly lost, was in the possession of the TAN spouses.</p>

<p class="BODY">Reduced to bare essentials, the only issue in this <span style="">case </span>is whether or not the rights or
title to the property of <span class="SpellE">Tiongson</span>, an impostor, can
be the root of a valid title for the BAIRAN spouses, allegedly innocent
purchasers for value.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not disputed that the <span class="SpellE">BAIRANs</span> not
only had knowledge of the decision of the trial court in Civil Case No. 390
declaring the Deed of Absolute Sale between JAO and TAN <span style="">as a </span>simulated sale and as such null
and void and inexistent and ordering the <span class="SpellE">TANs</span> to
execute a deed of <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> over the four (4)
hectares of land covered by TCT No. 45783 in favor of JAO, which decision had
been affirmed by both the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court and which had
become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, but the <span class="SpellE">BAIRANs</span> even judicially admitted and acknowledged that the
property in litigation belongs to the JAO family and used that fact as basis of
their "Motion to Dismiss" <span style="">in </span>Civil
Case No. C-190.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In addition, <span class="SpellE">Segundina</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Tiongson</span> was prosecuted and convicted of falsification of
public document in Criminal Case No. C-566, leaving no doubt that the title of <span class="SpellE">Tiongson</span> from which the title of <span class="SpellE">BAIRANs</span>
was derived, was procured through misrepresentation, <span style="">deceit </span>and fraud.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under similar circumstances, this Court has already ruled that
wrongly reconstituted certificates of title secured through fraud and
misrepresentation cannot be the source of legitimate rights and benefits,
unless of course the transferee of the title is in good faith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in the case of Republic v. Court of
Appeals, it was held that:</p>

<blockquote>"The existence of the two titles of the Government <u>ipso</u>
<u>facto</u> nullified the reconstitution proceedings and signified that the
evidence in the said proceedings were sham and deceitful and were filed in bad
faith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such humbuggery or imposture
cannot be countenanced and cannot be the source of legitimate rights and
benefits.</blockquote>

<blockquote>X<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>X<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>X</blockquote>

<blockquote>"To sustain the validity of the reconstituted titles would be
to allow Republic Act No. 26 to be utilized as an instrument for land grabbing
(see Republic v. Court of Appeals, <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> and Anglo,
L-­31303-04, May 31, 1978, 83 SCRA 453, 480 per J.G.S. Santos) or to sanction
fraudulent <span style="">machinations for depriving a
registered owner </span>of <span style="">his land to
undermine the stability and security of Torrens titles and to impair, the
Torrens system of registration.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The theory of A &amp; A <span class="SpellE">Torrijos</span>
Engineering Corporation that it was a purchaser in good faith and for value is
indefensible because the title of the lot <span style="">which
it purchased unmistakably shows that </span>such title was reconstituted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That circumstance should have alerted its <span style="">officers </span><span style="">to make the necessary investigation in the registry of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> City and <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> where
they could have found that </span><st1:place><span style="">Lot</span></st1:place><span style=""> 918 is

<p class="BODY">The case at bar involves the issuance of a new <span class="SpellE">owners's</span> duplicate through court proceedings equally sham
and deceitful which under the same principle cannot be the source of legitimate
rights and benefits.</p>

<p class="BODY">A new owner's duplicate certificate of title issued under these
circumstances indicates that it was issued in lieu of a lost one and should
have alerted the <span class="SpellE">BAIRANs</span> to take precautions in the
examination of the records in the Registry where they could easily discover
among others:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that the Order for the Issuance
of a New Owner's Duplicate Copy of TCT No. 45783 was dated February 7, 1964; on
February 8, 1964 a Deed of Sale in favor of <span class="SpellE">Tiongson</span>
for a measly sum of five thousand pesos (P5,000) was executed on February 8,
1964; the certificate was <span style="">already in the
name of </span><span class="SpellE">Tiongson</span> on February 10, 1964 and on
March 4, 1964, the title was transferred to <span class="SpellE">BAIRANs</span>,
all in less than the 30-day period from notice or Order to the Register of
Deeds before a lost owner's duplicate copy could be reissued.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
As they obviously did not, they cannot now claim to be <span style="">in goo</span><span style="">d</span> faith.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither can they claim prescription which <span style="">is </span><span style="">u</span>navailing not only against the registered owner but also
equally against the latter's hereditary successors<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
more specially in this case where private respondents themselves admitted that
subject land belong to JAO, nor can they take advantage of the non-cancellation
of their title TCT No. 3667 for it has been settled by this Court, that where
the reconstituted certificates of titles had been secured through fraud and
misrepresentation and the lower court has not annulled the owner's duplicate
certificate issued in compliance with the Order of Reconstitution, the holder
thereof is regarded as a mere trustee of the rightful owners, with the
obligation to give and convey to the latter their respective shares.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>
