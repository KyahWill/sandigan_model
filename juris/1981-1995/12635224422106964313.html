Automatic review of the decision rendered by the defunct Court of First 
Instance of Zamboanga del Sur in Criminal Case No. 72 because of the 
imposition of the death penalty.
<p>
In an information dated July 15, 1970, DIOSDADO EGOT was accused of rape said to have been committed as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "That on February 4, 1970, at about 5:00 o'clock in the afternoon,
 in the cemetery of barrio Pangi, municipality of Ipil, pro­vince of 
Zamboanga del Sur, Republic of the Philippines and within the 
jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused with lewd 
designs, in order to facilitate the commission of the crime, did, then 
and there wilfully and feloniously bring one Liberty Siodora, an eleven 
year old girl to the ceme­tery an isolated place, with the pretext that 
they will look for his lost horse, upon reaching the cemetery, with his 
bolo intimidated the young girl and by force have carnal knowledge with 
her against her will." (<em>Expediente</em>, p. 1.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
EGOT pleaded "not guilty" when he was arraigned and after trial the court rendered the following sentence:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "WHEREFORE, this Court hereby finds the accused DIOSDADO EGOT 
guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of RAPE penalized under 
Article 333 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, and pursuant to said 
article, sentences him to suffer the supreme penalty of DEATH, and to 
pay to the offended party Liberty Siodora the SUM OF EIGHT THOUSAND 
(P8,000.00) PESOS as moral damages, with Costs against the accused." (<em>Id.,</em> pp. 62-63.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In imposing the death penalty the trial court said:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Under Article 333 of the Revised Penal Code the crime of rape 
committed either by force or inti­midation or even without such force or
 intimidation, where the woman raped is below 12 years old, the penalty 
shall be <em>reclusion perpetua</em> (life imprisonment) and where the 
rape was committed with the use of deadly weapon, as in this case, since
 there is evidence that the accused Egot used a sharp-pointed bolo in 
the commission of the offense, the penalty shall be <em>reclusion perpetua</em>
 to death. Considering that the offense was attended with the 
aggravating circumstance of uninha­bited place as it was committed in a 
cemetery which is uninhabited and isolated and far from the road and 
grassy, the penalty imposable on the accused is the supreme penalty of <em>death</em>." (<em>Id.,</em> p. 62.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The People's version of the facts is as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "At around 4:00 o'clock in the afternoon of February 4, 1970, at 
barrio of Pangi, Municipality of Ipil, Zamboanga del Sur, Pelagia 
Siodora left her house and went to her neighbor's farm (p. 28, tsn., 
February 22, 1972), leaving her daughter Liberty who was eleven years 
old (Exhibits C, C-1 and C-3; p. 79, tsn., March 23, 1972) and her other
 younger children (p. 28 tsn., February 22, 1972). Before she left her 
house that afternoon, she saw appellant Diosdado Egot riding on 
horseback and alighting at the house of his aunt Candida Ramos, whose 
house is about ten meters from her house (pp. 28-30, tsn., February 22, 
1972). </p>
  <p> "At about 5:00 o'clock of the same afternoon appellant went to the
 house of Pelagia Siodora who was no longer there at that time. He 
talked to complainant Liberty asking her to 'accompany me look for my 
horse, if we find it I will give you biscuit' (p. 75, tsn., March 23, 
1972). Liberty unsuspectingly agreed to accompany appellant ostensibly 
to look for his horse. Upon reaching the cemetery, which was about one 
hundred fathoms from Liberty's house (p. 31, tsn., February 22, 1972), 
appellant pointed a bolo at her (p. 72, tsn., March 23, 1972) and told 
her to lie down (p. 71, tsn., March 23, 1972). Appellant then removed 
her panty and after opening the front part of his pants let his penis 
come out (p. 72, tsn., March 23, 1972). Then appellant went on top of 
her and inserted his penis into Liberty's vagina and had sexual 
intercourse (p. 74, tsn., March 23, 1972). </p>
  <p> "After the incident Liberty went home and reported the matter to 
her mother (p. 67, tsn., March 23, 1972). The following day the mother 
reported the incident to the police (p. 33, tsn., February 22, 1972). 
She could not report the incident on the same date to the police as it 
was already nighttime and barrio Pangi is about three kilometers from 
the town proper (p. 73, tsn., February 22, 1972). The police told her to
 secure a medical certificate (p. 32, tsn., February 22, 1972). She 
submitted her daughter for physical examination to Dr. Henry de Villa, 
Rural Health Officer of Ipil, Zamboanga del Sur (p. 34, tsn., February 
22, 1972), who issued a medical certificate (Exhibit A) which reads: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      'I.  General data:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>

    </blockquote>
    <p>

    <p>
      'V.  Conclusion -
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p> The findings are compatible with history of the victim.'" (Brief, pp. 1-4.) </p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
EGOT denied the rape. He interposed the defense of alibi. He said that 
he could not have raped Liberty as alleged because at that time he was 
in the cornfield of Pelagia Siodora, Liberty's mother, together with his
 aunt Candida Ramos; they were there to retrieve his horse which strayed
 after it got freed from its tether.
</p><p>
In this review, the appellant is represented by counsel de oficio, Atty.
 Salvador B. Britanico, who made the following assignment of errors:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "A.  THAT THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING THE ACCUSED GUILTY OF RAPE; and, </p>
  <p> "B. THAT, ASSUMING ARGUENDO THAT THE EVIDENCE ARE ADEQUATE TO 
SUPPORT THE CONVICTION OF THE HEREIN ACCUSED, THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN 
IMPOSING THE DEATH PENALTY. THE APPRO­PRIATE PENALTY SHOULD HAVE BEEN <em>RECLUSION PERPETUA</em>." (Brief, p. 1.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
According to the trial court, "At the time of the sexual intercourse 
Liberty was only 11 years and 7 months old, having been born on July 4, 
1958." (<em>Expediente</em>, p. 53.) The trial court relied on the 
testimony of Pelagia Siodora that Liberty was born on July 4, 1958. 
(TSN, Feb. 22, 1972, p. 27.) It also relied on Exhbit C, the supposed 
birth certificate of Liberty where her date of birth is given as July 4,
 1958. (<em>Expediente</em>, p. 33.)
</p><p>
The appellant questions the authenticity of Exhibit C; it "is being 
disputed by the defense on the ground that she could not have been born 
on that date considering that the Birth Certificate (Exhibit "C") was 
filed and registered on April 14, 1958 (Exhibit "1") or three (3) months
 before the alleged birth." (Brief, p. 3.)
</p><p>
Indeed, Exhibit C is of doubtful authenticity. For aside from the 
circumstance cited by the appellant, Exhibit C does not have the 
signature of the Local Civil Registrar. But the testimony of Pelagia 
Siodora in respect of the date when her daughter Liberty was born has 
not been subs­tantially impugned. Liberty must be deemed to have been 
below 12 years old on February 4, 1970. Moreover, Liberty's age becomes 
unimportant in the light of the allegation in the information that the 
appellant used a bolo to intimidate her to submit to his carnal desire.
</p><p>
The first assignment of error questions the appreciation of the evidence
 by the trial court. To be sure this raises a problem albeit not 
insur­mountable. "The difficulty, recognized and acknowledged, in the 
decision-making process where the prosecution is for rape, arises from 
the fact that usually only the participants can testify as to the 
alleged sexual abuse. The accused may deny such an occurrence, put up 
the defense that he was somewhere else, or allege the consent on the 
part of the complainant. The court then is left with no choice but to 
exert the utmost effort to determine the likelihood that a sexual act 
did take place and under what circumstances. Such choice is not always 
easy." (<em>People vs. Imbo</em>, G.R. No. L-36759, Aug. 31, 1982, 116 SCRA 355, 357.)
</p><p>
The appellant questions the credibility of Liberty Siodora. He claims 
that she was not a reliable witness "because of her proven retarded 
mentality." (Brief, p. 8.) He quotes from the decision which states: 
"The Court which had the opportunity to observe the offended party 
Liberty Siodora, had noticed her stunted growth and somewhat retarded 
personality and mentality." (<em>Expediente</em>, pp. 56-57.) But the 
appellant ignores completely the other statements of the trial court 
that: "According to the prosecution's evidence, as a consequence of the 
rape committed by accused Egot on the person of Liberty, she became 
somewhat mentally deranged and from the time of the incident up to the 
present, she shivers and gets scared whenever she sees the accused Egot 
or a male person. x x x But at the trial, she positively demonstrated in
 open court how the accused Egot raped her on that un­fortunate 
afternoon of February 4, 1970, stating that he (Egot) told her to lie 
down and, armed with a sharp-pointed bolo, went on top of her and forced
 his penis into her vagina and had sexual intercourse with her. She 
positively identified accused Egot in open court as the man who ravished
 her." (<em>Id.,</em> pp. 56-57.)
</p><p>
Liberty's tender age lends credibility to her testimony. For as this 
Court said: "Moreover, if there is anything apparent from our past 
decisions on rape cases, with the offended parties being young and 
immature girls from the ages of twelve to sixteen, it is that there is 
considerable receptivity on the part of this Tribunal to lend credence 
to their version of what transpired, considering not only their relative
 vulnerability but also the shame and embarrassment to which such a 
gruelling experience as a court trial, where they are called upon to lay
 bare what perhaps should be shrouded in secrecy did expose them to. 
This is not to say that an uncritical acceptance should be the rule. It 
is only to emphasize that skepticism should be kept under control." 
(People vs. Molina, G.R. No. L-30191, Oct. 27, 1973, 53 SCRA 495, 
500-501.)
</p><p>
There is circumstantial evidence to support the testimony of Liberty 
that she was raped by the appellant: when Liberty came home and was 
asked by her mother why she was crying she replied that she had been 
raped by Egot at the cemetery; and then there was the physical 
examination conducted by Dr. Henry de Villa which showed that Liberty's 
sexual organ had lacerations, irritation and abrasion.
</p><p>
The appellant's alibi must fail because of the positive identification 
made by Liberty that he was the culprit and also because it was not 
phy­sically impossible for him to be at the cemetery when the rape was 
com­mitted.
</p><p>
The second assignment of error assumes the guilt of the appellant but seeks to mitigate his liability.
</p><p>
The appellant claims that the use of a bolo had not been legally 
established; hence the aggravating circumstance of use of a deadly 
weapon cannot be considered. Suffice it to say that Liberty 
categorically stated that Egot "used his bolo." (TSN, March 23, 1972, p.
 72.)
</p><p>
The appellant also claims that the aggravating circumstance of <em>despoblado </em>was not present. He asserts:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "By the very evidence of the prosecution, the cemetery was merely 
100 meters away from the house of Siodoras, that is, within the hearing 
distance when one shouts for assistance. This is therefore not an 
uninhabited place in the contemplation of law (<em>People vs. Laoto</em>,
 et al. 52 Phil. 401). As one authority puts it, 'An uninhabited place 
is one where there are no houses at all, a place at a considerable 
distance from town, or where the houses are scattered at a great 
distance from each other' (Reyes, <em>Ibid</em>, page 318). In this 
case, the houses of the Siodoras and the Ramoses are merely 10 meters 
apart from one another and only 100 meters away from the cemetery. What 
the Supreme Court considered as uninhabited is a place about a kilometer
 from the nearest house or other inhabited place (<em>People vs. Aguinaldo</em>, 55 Phil. 610; <em>People vs. Mendoza</em>,
 et al., 100 Phil. 818). The cemetery of Barrio Pangi, Ipil, Zamboanga 
del Sur was therefore not an uninhabited place." (Brief, pp. 13-14.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Pelagia did not say that her house is only 100 meters from the cemetery.
 What she said was that the cemetery is about "100 fathoms more or less 
from our house." (TSN, Feb. 22, 1972, p. 31.) A fathom is equal to 6 
feet so that 100 fathoms is equal to 600 feet which is equal to 200 
yards or 180 meters. A distance of 200 yards to the nearest house is 
sufficient to make the scene of the crime uninhabited. (See <em>People vs. Pulido</em>, 85 Phil. 695 [1950].)
</p><p>
The appellant likewise claims <em>despoblado </em>"is not present even 
if the crime was committed in an uninhabited place, if the offended 
party was casually encountered by the accused and the latter did not 
take advantage of the place or it can not be shown that it facilitated 
the com­mission of the crime (<em>People vs. Luneta</em>, et al., 79 Phil. 815, cited in Reyes, <em>Ibid</em>,
 page 320)." (Brief, pp. 14-15.) He forgets that he did not meet Liberty
 at the cemetery; he purposely brought her there to facilitate the 
commission of the crime.
</p><p>
There is no evidence that the appellant surrendered voluntarily. In 
fact, according to his own testimony, the police went to his house and 
they brought him to the municipal jail. Neither can it be conceded that 
he should be accorded the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender
 because "while the case was already pending in the Court of First 
Instance of Zamboanga del Sur, notwithstanding that he had all the 
opportunity to do so while in the house of provincial guard Minsay." 
(Brief, p. 17.) Suffice it to say that such a claim has no legal or 
jurisprudential basis.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the judgment under review is hereby modified in the sense 
that for lack of the necessary number of votes DIOSDADO EGOT is 
sentenced to suffer the penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua</em> instead 
of death and moral damages to be paid to Liberty Siodora shall be in the
 amount of P20, 000.00. Costs against the appellant.
</p><p>
SO ORDERED.
