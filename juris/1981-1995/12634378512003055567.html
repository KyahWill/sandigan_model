for twice raping a girl not yet in her teens, turns to us for exculpation.  His efforts are in vain.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 19, 1991, two separate criminal complaints were filed
with the RTC of Malolos, Bulacan, against appellant by complainant <b>MARISTELA
F. SANTIAGO</b>,<b> </b>assisted by her mother <b>DIVINA SANTIAGO</b>.  He was accused of <span style="">committing two rapes -- on August, 1990 and December, 1990 -- as
follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"That sometime in the month of August (December), 1990, in the
municipality of Hagonoy, province of Bulacan, Philippines, and within the
jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused by means of
force, violence and intimidation, wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously have
(sic) carnal knowledge of the undersigned complainant, a twelve-year old,
against her will and consent.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Contrary to law."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The resulting cases, docketed as Criminal
Cases No. 1035-M-91 and 1036-M-91, were consolidated and raffled to Branch 11
of the trial court.  Appellant was
arraigned on August 16, 1991.  He
pleaded not guilty to both charges.</p>

<p class="BODY">Five (5) witnesses<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
testified for the prosecution, four (4) for the defense.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a> The
nine (9) are related to one another, and to other individuals mentioned in
their testimonies.  Appellant is the
husband of complainant's cousin, defense witness <b>Liza Rejano</b>.  She is the adopted daughter of <b>Edilberto
Santiago</b>, who is the brother of complainant's late father.</p>

<p class="BODY">Complainant, who was born on January 26, 1978,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
testified as the prosecution's principal witness.  She narrated that she was first raped one evening<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
in August, 1990, in a lonely, open field far from the town proper of San Pedro,
Hagonoy, Bulacan.  She was there to make
her third harvest of small crabs or <i>talangka</i> for the day.  Appellant, who was also <i>namimintol</i> or
catching <i>talangka</i>, was the only other person in the field.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">When complainant finished gathering the last of the <i>talangka</i>
caught in her baited <i>bintols</i> or bamboo-and-net devices, she approached
appellant who had summoned her.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a> He
grabbed her left arm and forcibly took off her garterized shorts and panty.  Complainant vainly fought back by kicking at
appellant.  He, however, managed to push
her to the ground, and used his free arm to pin down her legs.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
She screamed for help, but only the trees in the field heard her.  Nobody came to her rescue.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant then bestraddled complainant.  She felt something round enter her vagina, causing her pain.  "<i>Aray</i>," she screamed.  Again, no one heard her.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Complainant does not
remember how long the sexual violation took place, but when </span><span style="">it </span><span style="">was over, she felt very weak.  Soon after, appellant </span><span style="">left.  </span><span style="">Complainant
stood up, put on her shorts, and went home, leaving her harvest of </span><i>talangka</i>
<span style="">in the field to die.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">When complainant arrived at their house, she did not rouse her
mother, Divina, who was already deep in slumber.  As she lay down beside her two sisters to sleep, complainant
resolved not to tell her mother about what appellant had done to her.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Early the next morning, appellant called to complainant who stood
by the kitchen sink, washing her face.  He was in his house, which is only a few meters from hers.  He threatened her against telling anyone
about what occurred the night before.  <i>"Ine,
huwag kang magsusumbong, kung hindi, </i><i><span style="">bubugbugin kita </span>at papatayin," </i>he warned her.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
Complainant believed the threat, which appellant reiterated time and again
afterwards.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Months passed.  Complainant's fear subsided.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
Soon, it was December, 1990, and the Santiagos were preparing for the Centro
harvest.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
The night before the three-day harvest, complainant went to the house of her Auntie
During Santiago.  Appellant was also
there.  He told complainant that she
could use his bicycle to go to the Centro the following day.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Complainant took the offer to heart.  The next day, she went to appellant's residence to get the <span style="">bicycle.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>She found him standing by the bottom

Complainant remained outside the doorway.  She saw the bicycle parked near the top of the stairs.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Without warning,
appellant grabbed complainant and dragged her into the house and up its
stairs.  Brandishing a "stainless </span><i><span style="">beinte-nueve</span></i><span style="">" </span><span style="">with his right hand, he forcibly removed her shorts with his left, and
made her lie on the floor.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> He mounted and penetrated her.

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After violently
deflowering complainant, he allowed her to take his bicycle.  She rode it to the Centro which is quite far
from their house.  She cried during the
trip.  When she got to the Centro, she
joined her relatives in the harvest.  She kept quiet about the rape, even when appellant arrived later that
morning.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> That night, however, appellant's wife, Liza,
confronted her about the presence in the Rejano residence of a "white
object which could only be the result of the doing of two persons,"
obviously referring to semen.  Appellant
broke the story to Liza who admonished her not to tell anyone about the
incident.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> By late January, 1991, her mother, </span>Divina,

<p class="BODY">On February 4, 1991, complainant underwent a physical examination
conducted by <b>Dr. Ronaldo B. Mendez</b>, Medico-Legal Officer II of the
Bulacan Integrated Provincial Health Office of the Department of Health.  His findings are embodied in his report, as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"CASE NO. <u>G-08_______  <o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>"DATE:  <u>February 4, 1991<o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>"DATE, TIME &amp;
PLACE OF EXAMINATION:  February 4, 1991,
10:00 A.M., Bulacan Provincial Hospital, Malolos, Bulacan.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"ALLEGED DATE,

<blockquote>"GENERAL SURVEY:</blockquote>

<blockquote>HEIGHT:  150 cm.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>WEIGHT:  43.5 kgs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(Exh. "E"; p. 44,
Original Records)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Dr. Mendez testified that the laceration
on complainant's genitalia is old and healed, which means it occurred at least
four (4) months before the examination.<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant mainly put forth the defense of denial and, with
regards the first rape, alibi.  Appellant, and his wife and sister testified that they were visiting his
ailing father in Pinamalayan, Mindoro during the entire month of August,
1990.  They were one in saying they left
Hagonoy on <span style="">July </span>24, 1990, and
returned on September 1, 1990.<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the impugned Decision, dated March 30, 1992, was
promulgated.  Accused was convicted, <i>viz.</i>:<i><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, this Court finds herein accused Jerry Rejano,
GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of two (2) counts of the crime of RAPE as
charged and hereby sentences him to suffer imprisonment of RECLUSION PERPETUA
on each count and to indemnify complainant in the amount of Forty Thousand
(P40,000.00) Pesos.  No pronouncement as
to cost.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SO ORDERED."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appellant now urges -</p>

<blockquote>  "THE TRIAL COURT
OVERLOOKED SOME MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR MISINTERPRETED CERTAIN PIECES OF EVIDENCE
WHICH HAD THEY BEEN CONSIDERED IN THE PROPER LIGHT, IT (SIC) WOULD HAVE
ACQUITTED ACCUSED-APPELLANT."<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">In particular, he argues, <i>viz.</i>:<i><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">“I.</p>

<blockquote>Judge Gabo, who rendered the decision of

<blockquote>Doctor's testimony accords strong basis for
accused (sic) acquittal;</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">“III.</p>

by the accused in August, 1990 deserves scant consideration;</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">“IV.</p>

<blockquote>Failure of complainant to do anything
before, during and after alleged rape and her conduct immediately after the
rape negate its commission.  (People vs.

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">“V.</p>

<blockquote>Accused's defense of alibi, contrary to the
lower court's holding, assumes significance."<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We affirm the impugned decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">Firstly, appellant takes exception to the finding of the trial
court that:</p>

<blockquote>"This Court finds no reason to doubt the credibility of the
offended party.  In her testimony, she
came to lay out, in a clear and simple language, what had happened to her in
the hands of the accused.  She had been
direct and straightforward in describing how the accused committed the crimes
against her chastity <span style="">xxx"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">for the reason that Judge Gabo, Jr., who
penned the impugned Decision was not the one who heard the case.  We find no merit in this argument.</p>

<p class="BODY">Time and again, this Court has held that a decision is not
rendered erroneous by the fact that it was penned by a judge other than the one
who heard the evidence in the case.<a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a> In
such instances, however, the well-settled general rule that the trial court's
findings as to credibility of witnesses be given great weight should not be
applied.<a style="" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a>
This is because, not having heard the testimonies himself, the judge is in no
better position than the appellate courts to make such determinations.</p>

<p class="BODY">After reviewing the entire records of the case at bench, <span style="">we </span>find ourselves in agreement with
Judge Gabo, and accord the mark of credence to complainant's testimony.  The transcript of her testimonies shows <span style="">she </span>was candid in answering the
questions propounded to her.  The story
she presented is credible and consistent.  Particularly impressive, to our minds, are the small details that pepper
her testimony, as exemplified by the following portions of her
cross-examination:</p>

<blockquote>"xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Certainly, the thirteen-year-old
complainant cannot be considered sophisticated enough to falsely and
maliciously attribute the crime of rape to her cousin-in-­law, and to weave
such an intricate and richly detailed story to support it.  Moreover, as we held in the recent case of <b><i><span style="">People v. Guibao</span></i></b><b><span style="">,<i> </i></span>217 SCRA 64 (1993)</b>:</p>

<blockquote>"xxx It would be highly improbable for a barrio girl of tender
age and definitely inexperienced in sexual matters to fabricate charges, for no
reason at all, that will put herself and her family in a very compromising
situation xxx.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>"xxx (N)o woman, especially of tender age, would concoct a
story of defloration, allow an examination of her private parts, and thereafter
pervert herself by being subjected to a public trial, if she was not motivated
solely by the desire to have the culprit apprehended and punished."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">In the present case, the defense failed
to establish ill-motive on complainant's part that would have spurred her to
accuse appellant as her rapist.  The
uncorroborated imputation that the whole rape scenario was concocted by
complainant's mother, to make appellant and his wife pay for intriguing against
her is utterly unbelievable.  No mother
would stoop that low as to subject her daughter to the physical hardships and
shame concomitant to a rape prosecution just to assuage her own hurt feelings.</p>

<p class="BODY">Secondly, appellant seeks refuge behind the results of the
physical examination conducted on complainant.   He argues that the medical findings show that complainant
"could not have been raped in December, 1990."<a style="" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a>
He is wrong.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that Dr. Mendez found a single "old healed
laceration" on complainant's genitalia, which could not have been sustained
less than four (4) months before the examination done on February, 1991.  Nonetheless, it does not follow, as
appellant propounds, that this fact negates the claimed December, 1990 rape.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is well-settled that perfect penetration, rupture of the hymen
or laceration of the vagina are not essential for the offense of consummated
rape.<a style="" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></span></span></a>
Mere penetration of the penis by the entry thereof into the <i>labia majora </i>of
the female organ, even without rupture of <span style="">the
hymen, suffices to warrant a conviction for rape.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Furthermore, in the case at bench, it must
be noted that the very physical examination report adverted to by appellant
contains, </span><i><span style="">inter alia</span></i><span style="">, </span><span style="">the following conclusion:  "(h)ymenal orifice, wide xxx as to allow complete penetration of an
average-sized Filipino male organ in full erection </span><b><i><span style="">without producing </span></i></b><b><i><span style="">any new hymenal injury</span></i></b><i><span style=""> </span></i><span style="">(emphasis supplied).  Thus, it </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">physically possible for complainant to have been raped in December,
1990 without incurring a new laceration in her genitalia.  This was clearly testified to by Dr. Mendez,
on cross-examination, thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"Q  When penetration of a male organ in full
erection could be had without producing hymenal injury, could it be possible
that the complainant had not only (one) sexual intercourse at the time of your
examination?<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Possible,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So, it </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">possible also that
more than one could be had between the period of August and December?<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Possible,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx"</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">(TSN of Sept. 27, 1991, p. 16) <o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's third submission is that:</p>

<blockquote>"If complainant lied in claiming she was raped by the accused
in December, 1990 as proven by the doctor's findings, she likewise lied, or it
cannot be taken as solid basis without infringing accused's constitutional
right to presumption of innocence, when she claimed that she was raped in
August, 1990 <span style="">(sic)."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">In light of our conclusion that Dr.
Mendez's medical findings do not in any way negate the commission of the second
alleged rape, this argument loses all persuasiveness.</p>

<p class="BODY">Penultimately, appellant argues that complainant's charge is
incredulous considering her actions before, during and after the alleged
rapes.  We are not convinced.</p>

<p class="BODY">Regarding complainant's failure to immediately report the two
instances of rape committed against her, we deem it fit to reiterate our
holding in the case of <b><i><span style="">People v.
Yambao</span></i></b><b><span style="">, </span></b><b><span style="">193 SCRA </span>571 (1991)</b>, that:</p>

<blockquote>"xxx (T)he silence of the offended party in a case of rape, or
her failure to disclose her defilement without loss of time to persons close to
her and to report the matter to the authorities, does not perforce warrant the
conclusion that she was not sexually molested and that her charges against the
accused are  all baseless, untrue and
fabricated.  Other relevant facts and
circumstances must be considered to determine the veracity of the
accusation.  xxx Failure to report an
incident immediately does not cast doubt on the credibility of the charge
notwithstanding the fact that the delay is not in any way attributable to the
threats of death and intimidation given by the accused to the victim.  xxx"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">In the case at bench, the complainant is
a twelve-year-old barrio girl with only a Grade IV education.  She cannot be expected to act with the
courage and intelligence of a mature and sophisticated woman, and immediately
report the assaults committed against her.  Threatened and shamed by the experience, she chose to keep mum.  Victims of rapes do not always immediately
go to the rooftop to denounce their assailants.  In fine, silence is not an odd behavior on the part of rape
victims.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant characterizes the resistance offered by complainant in
the field during the first alleged rape as "that of one who was not being
attacked," and her acts at that time as "leav(ing) much to be desired
from one who had just become a victim of an heinous offense."<a style="" href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></span></span></a>
He particularly zeroes in on the facts:  (1) that she "merely tried to kick" him and "merely"
screamed <i>aray</i> at that time; and (2) that she thought of putting on her <span style="">clothes first before going home after the
alleged attack occurred.  We disagree.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the very recent case
of </span><b><i>People v. Ibay</i>, G.R. No. 101631 (June 8, 1993)</b>, <span style="">we held:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"xxx Behavioral psychology teaches us that different people
react to similar situations dissimilarly.  Most women would resist a sexual assault with a wild struggle.  Others become virtually catatonic because of
the mental shock they experience.  Yet,
it can never be <span style="">successfully argued
that the latter are any </span>less <span style="">sexual
victims than the former.  </span>xxx"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Nor do we count against complainant's credibility her act of
going to appellant's house to borrow his bicycle in December, 1990,
notwithstanding her rape four months before.  At that time, she was admittedly no longer afraid of appellant.  It did not cross her simple and unsuspecting
mind that appellant's offer that she use <span style="">his
</span>bicycle to get to the distant Centro <span style="">could </span>be misconstrued.  In her youthfulness, she took appellant's offer at face value.  We do not hold this isolated act as a badge
of falsehood as to reject the total testimony of the complainant.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Finally, appellant
impugns the trial court's disregard of his assertion that he was not in
Bulacan, but in Mindoro, during the entire month of August, 1990.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Alibi is the weakest of all defenses for it <span style="">is </span>easy to fabricate and difficult to
disprove, and cannot prevail where, as in the case at bench, appellant was
positively identified as the perpetrator of the crimes charged.<a style="" href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code enumerates three
circumstances under which carnal knowledge of a woman is considered rape:  (1) when the intercourse is done by the use
of force or intimidation; (2) when the woman is deprived of reason or otherwise
unconscious; and (3) when she is under twelve years of age.  In the case at bench, the prosecution
successfully proved beyond reasonable doubt, that appellant had forced sexual
intercourse with complainant in August and December, 1990.  That is sufficient reason for us to sustain
appellant's conviction for two counts of rape.</p>
