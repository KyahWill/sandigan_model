of Pampanga, and thereafter tried upon his non-guilty plea, Gregorio Romero,
Jr. was found guilty and sentenced "to life imprisonment (reclusion
perpetua), to indemnify the victim Luz F. Medina in the amount of P5,000.00
plus a P100.00 a month-support for the offspring born out of the criminal act
of said accused, and to pay the costs."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Contending that the evidence adduced failed to overcome the
constitutional presumption of innocence, appellant seeks reversal of his
conviction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He assails mainly the credibility
of complainant's judgment of con­viction.</p>

<p class="BODY">The challenged testimony of complainant Luz Medina, a
seventeen-year old maiden, is as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime in mid-June 1970, she was in the house of her aunt Maria
Mallari Medina at Barrio San Pedro, Florida Blanca, Pampanga, to keep the
latter company for the night.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She
usually spent the night with her whenever Edilberto Medina, husband of Maria,
was in Guagua, Pampanga, to sell vegetables.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before retiring that night - neither the information nor
complainant's testimony stated the exact date of the incident - she closed the
glass-jalousy windows and the door of the one-room house and went to sleep with
her aunt Maria and the latter's one year old daughter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At around <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time>,
Luz was awakened by a feeling of heaviness on her chest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She found a man on top of her, embracing and
kissing her, and touching her breast.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>She pushed him away, and while she did not succeed in freeing herself,
she was able to identify him as the appellant, the latter being the compadre of
her aunt and uncle whom she had seen in that house on many occasions.</p>

<p class="BODY">She frantically called for her aunt several times, only to be
told by appellant that Maria was out of the house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He then lifted her dress and removed her
panty, all the while threatening to kill her should she try to resist.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But despite her resistance, the appellant
succeeded in consummating the sexual act.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Having satisfied his lust, he threatened to kill her should she report
the incident to anyone.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then he left the
house, leaving the complainant crying.</p>

<p class="BODY">About ten minutes later, her aunt arrived and asked her why she
was still awake.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Allegedly fearful of
the appellant's threat to kill her, she replied that she had just urinated.</p>

<p class="BODY">Complainant further testified that after this inci­dent,
appellant succeeded in having sexual intercourse with her for several times
more.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While she could not remember the
exact number of times and the specific dates thereof, she narrated the details
of an incident which occurred about five (5) days after the night in
question.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She declared that appellant
entered the house of her aunt in the early evening while her aunt was in the
vegetable garden some 200 meters away; that appellant, then armed with a
'balisong' ordered her to sit on a chair and there­upon kissed and mashed her
breasts; and that with the 'balisong' pointed at her neck, he was able to force
himself on her again.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to complainant, she kept her harrowing experience to
herself because of her fear that appellant would make good her threat to kill
her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even when her father, Conrado
Medina, noticed that her stomach was getting bigger, she did not tell him about
the alleged rape.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was only after her
father had brought her to Dr. Campo, who, after examination, diagnosed her case
as one of pregnancy, that she told her parents for the first time that she had
been sexually abused by the appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime in March 1971, Luz gave birth to a baby boy.</p>

<p class="BODY">For his part, appellant flatly denied the charge.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While he admitted having gone to the house of
the spouses <st1:city><st1:place>Medina</st1:place></st1:city> several times,
they being his compadre and comadre, he insisted that the last of these visits
was in 1968, or two years before the alleged incident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to him, from 1968 to 1971 he was
employed as electrician-helper at Clarkton House Hotel in <st1:place><st1:placename>Angeles</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, going home to Barrio
Cabancalan, which is adjacent to Barrio San Pedro, only three or four times a
month, and mostly on Saturdays.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant also adverted to the rumor circula­ting in that barrio that a
certain Jose Manalansan, Jr., a brother-in-law of the complainant's father, was
the real culprit because of the marked similarities between him and the
complainant's child.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since the entire case against the appellant is based on the
complainant's testimony, the same must be scrutinized with scrupulous and
painstaking care.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And We find a number
of significant and weighty circumstances in the record that impel Us to respond
positively to the appellant's plea.</p>

<p class="BODY">In her statement to the police<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>,
complainant re­counted the details of the incident under inquiry in this wise:</p>

<blockquote>"I could not recall nor remember the exact date, sir, but it
was in the middle part of the month of June, 1970, <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time>,
while I was peacefully sleeping in the house of my aunt, Maria Mallari, in
barrio San Pedro, this town, I was awakened because I felt something heavy on
my breast.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As I opened my eyes I saw a
man lying against me, his lips planted on my face and I can feel his hands
crawling around the different parts of my body.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As I noticed these things, I pushed him and scratched him on the face
and kicked him several times.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I shouted
for help calling the name of my Aunt, Maria Mallari, but this GREGORIO ROMERO,
JR. told me that my screams for help was useless for my aunt was out of the
house according to him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When I learned
this, I exerted all my energy in defending my honor against the vi­cious want
of this man by kicking him and boxing him whenever he embraced me.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Because of the darkness this man was able to
give me a fist blow on the sto­mach which made me unconscious.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"When I gained consciousness, I felt the pains around my body
most especially in my organ.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I lighted
the lamp and found out that my organ was still bleeding and my drawer was full
of blood.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>x x x."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">By her own admission, it would appear that complain­ant was
unconscious at the time of the perpetration of the crime because of the alleged
fist blow delivered by the appellant on her stomach.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Of the same vein is the testimony of her
father, Conrado Medina, with respect to how complainant first narrated the
incident to him following the examination conducted by Dr. Campo.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">However, in her testimony in open court, the picture she depicted
is that she was conscious at the very moment of the consummation of the crime
and therefore fully aware thereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
palpable discrepancy between her testimony in open court and her sworn
statement, Exhibit A, referring as it does to a very material point, casts
doubts as to her motives and seriously impairs her credibility.</p>

<p class="BODY">The complainant's conduct immediately after the alleged rape is
likewise unsettling.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is hardly believable
that a young barrio maiden who had just lost her precious virginity in such a
brutal manner could possibly regain her composure in less than ten minutes and
sedately inform her aunt that she had just urinated to explain why she was
still up in the middle of the night.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Certainly, ten minutes of tear-shedding could not have doused the flame
of hatred that would stir any woman to promptly seek redress for the gravest
humiliation to which she had been subjected.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is even more difficult to imagine how complainant could have
remained silent for eight months, when, according to her, she was raped by the
appellant not once, but several times.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The two incidents related above notwithstanding, she found nothing
objectionable in spend­ing the night in her aunt's house during the times her
uncle was away, despite her awareness of the dangers she was exposing herself
to.</p>

<p class="BODY">Over a period of eight months, complainant had undoubtedly countless
opportunities to come out in the open and bring her abuser to justice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But even when the fruit of the crime had
already become quite apparent, she still refused to open up to the persons
nearest to her, her parents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Needless to
state, such conduct runs counter to the natural reaction of an outraged maiden
despoiled of her honor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The aphorism
that evidence to be believed must not only proceed from the mouth of a credible
witness, but it must be credible in itself in conformity with the common
experience and observation of mankind is nowhere of more relevance than in
cases involving prosecution for rape.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
In fine, the complainant's testimony in the instant case lacks that stamp of
absolute truth and candor necessary to overcome the constitutional presumption
of innocence.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment appealed from is hereby set aside,
and appellant Gregorio Romero, Jr. acquitted of the crime charged.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Costs <u>de</u> <u>oficio</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>
