worsened.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Wracked with cough, fever and

</span>For her more than thirty years of service, she was given a lump sum

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1974" day="30" month="9">September 30, 1974</st1:date>,

against the Division Superintendent of Schools.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Her claim was not <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> by her

<p class="BODY">On January 8, 1975, the Workmen's Compensation Unit of the <span class="SpellE">Dipolog</span> Sub-Regional Office issued an award in favor of
petitioner, ordering respondent Republic of the Philippines [Bureau of Public
Schools] to pay petitioner the amount of P6,000.00 representing disability
benefits under Sections 14 and 18 of the Workmen's Compensation Act; P1,562.90
as medical expense reimbursement under Section 13; as well as P300.00 as
attorney's fees for petitioner's counsel and P61.00 to the Commission through
that Unit as award fees pursuant to Section 55.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On appeal, the Workmen's Compensation Commission <b>en banc</b>
rendered a decision on October 14, 1975 setting aside the aforesaid award and
dismissing the claim on the ground that while petitioner was admittedly
afflicted with PTB as of July 5, 1972, for which reason she went on a two-month
sick leave, she afterwards returned to work <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">until her retirement on June 3, 1974.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>From this set of facts, the Commission concluded that at the time
petitioner retired, she was not clearly suffering from PTB. "That she had
the illness two years prior to retirement does not mean that she had the same
illness during her retirement for there is no evidence to that effect.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In other words, she did not retire due to any
incapacitating disease; she was not suffering any at the time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There being no disability, the claimant
should not be entitled to any compensating benefits.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The claimant had retired on the basis of her <span class="SpellE">retirable</span> age and the length of service."</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Petitioner filed a motion
for reconsideration of the Commission's decision but said motion was denied by
the Compensation Appeals and Review Staff of the Office of the Secretary of
Labor in its order of </span><st1:date year="1977" day="6" month="7"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">July 6, 1977</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> Hence, this recourse.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">There are two principal
issues presented for our resolution, namely:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>[a]<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether or not petitioner is entitled to
disability benefits and refund of medical expenses after having been paid her
full retirement benefits, considering that at the time of her retirement <u>there
was allegedly no substantial evidence</u> to show that petitioner was still
afflicted with tuberculosis; and,</blockquote>

<blockquote>[b]<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether or not the decision of respondent
Workmen's Compensation Commission has become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
in view of petitioner's alleged failure to timely appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The fact that petitioner, as a teacher, had to contend with
classroom work, in addition to supervising the school children in gardening and
cleaning the grounds as well as community work which exposed her to all kinds
of elements, and was thereby compel<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">led </span>to
retire, should have been given weight by respondent Commission.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead, respondent Commission, joined by the
Republic, capitalized on the fact that after a two-week leave petitioner was
able to resume working and to continue doing so until she retired from the
service under the Optional Retirement Law, thus precluding her claim for
compensation benefits.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is utterly
untenable.</p>

<p class="BODY">Contrary to the findings of respondent Commission, there is ample
evidence to support petitioner's contention that she had not fully recovered
from tuberculosis when she opted for an early retirement on <st1:date year="1974" day="3" month="6">June 3, 1974</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A subsequent X-ray examination made on her on
November 9, 1974 by the same Dr. Garcia showed that although the PTB lesion on
her right lung had healed, there was still the presence of fibrosis which meant
that her resistance to any latent tuberculosis infection was still weak, thus
necessitating "maintenance therapy".<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
This proves that petitioner was not completely cured as of <st1:date year="1974" day="9" month="11">November 9, 1974</st1:date>, or more than four months after
her optional retirement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, no
further treatment would have been prescribed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Records disclosed that petitioner was only sixty-two years old
when her application for optional retirement was finally approved by her
employer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That was three years short of
the compulsory age for retirement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is
not therefore accurate to state that she had retired on the basis of her <span class="SpellE">retirable</span> age.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She
retired because in her debilitated state, she could no longer cope with the
arduous tasks of a classroom teacher.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If
she were physically able, she would have waited for three years and thus
receive the maximum benefits of the Retirement Law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, in the case of <b><u>Hernandez</u> <u>vs.</u> <u>WCC</u>,</b>
No. L-20202, May 31, 1965, 14 SCRA 219, we held that an employee, forced to ask
for retirement ahead of schedule, not because of old age, but principally
because of his weakened bodily condition due to illness contracted in the
course of his employment, should be given compensation for his inability to
work during the remaining days before his scheduled retirement, aside from the
retirement benefits received by him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And
in subsequent cases, we have consistently ruled that the receipt of optional
retirement pay does not preclude the claimants from enjoying disability
compensation, for the fact that their application for optional retirement has
been approved places beyond doubt their "physical incapacity to render further
efficient service".<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">It is indeed a sad
commentary on respondent Commission's misplaced zeal that instead of commending
petitioner for her exceptionally dogged determination to continue with her work
of educating the </span>young despite the weakening effects of her illness, it
had the temerity to deny her compensation benefits.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Apparently, respondent is laboring under the
impression that before one can avail herself of disability pay, she must
necessarily be bedridden.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">As to the right of
petitioner to claim repayment of her medical expenses, the law is explicit and
unequivocal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>An employer held liable for
disability compensation should also be ordered to provide the employee with
such medical, surgical and hospital </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">services, appliances and supplies as the nature of her debility and the
process of recovery may require and that which will promote her early
restoration to the maximum level of her physical capacity.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">On the second issue, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">we </span>rule
that the appeal from the decision of respondent Commission to this Court was
seasonably made and the contrary assertion by the Solicitor General is patently
erroneous.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 1, Rule 18 of the Workmen's Compensation Commission Rules
states:</p>

<blockquote>"Time of Appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>- Any
party in interest may appeal from any decision or order of the Commission en
banc to the Supreme Court within ten [10] days from receipt of said decision or
order in the manner provided for under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Section 4, Rule 43 of the Rules of Court in turn provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Period for filing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>-
Appeals from an order, ruling or decision of the x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>; and those from the Court of Industrial Relations, the
Civil Aeronautics <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Board, the Workmen's
Compensation Commission, and the Commission on Elections, within a period of
ten [10] days."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Therefore, with respect
to appeals from respondent Commission, the petition for review must be filed
with the Supreme Court and notice of appeal with the Commission within ten
days, counted from notice of the ruling, order or decision appealed from.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:21.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

claims that inasmuch as petitioner had filed her motion for reconsideration on

than <st1:date year="1977" day="27" month="8">August 27, 1977</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We cannot agree.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There being no finding that petitioner's
motion for reconsideration was merely <b><u>pro</u> <u>forma</u></b>, said
pleading effectively tolled the running of the period for perfecting an
appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, she still had ten
