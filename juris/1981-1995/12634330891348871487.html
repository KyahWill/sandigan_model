				<H3>TRAVEL-ON INC., PETITIONER, VS. COURT OF APPEALS AND ARTURO S. MIRANDA, RESPONDENTS. <br /><br />R E S O L U T I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>FELICIANO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petitioner Travel-On Inc. ("Travel-On") is a travel agency
selling airline tickets on commission basis for and in behalf of different
airline companies.  Private respondent
Arturo S. Miranda had a revolving credit line with petitioner.  He procured tickets from petitioner on
behalf of airline passengers and derived commissions therefrom.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 14 June 1972, Travel-On filed suit before the Court of First
Instance ("CFI") of Manila to collect on six (6) checks issued by
private respondent with a total face amount of P115,000.00.  The complaint, with a prayer for the
issuance of a writ of preliminary attachment and attorney's fees, averred that
from 5 August 1969 to 16 January 1970, petitioner sold and delivered various
airline tickets to respondent at a total price of P278,201.57; that to settle
said account, private respondent paid various amounts in cash and in kind, and
thereafter issued six (6) postdated checks amounting to P115,000.00 which were
all dishonored by the drawee banks.  Travel-On further alleged that in March 1972, private respondent made
another payment of P10,000.00 reducing his indebtedness to P105,000.00.  The writ of attachment was granted by the
court <u>a quo</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">In his answer, private respondent admitted having had
transactions with Travel-On during the period stipulated in the complaint.  Private respondent, however, claimed that he
had already fully paid and even overpaid his obligations and that refunds were
in fact due to him.  He argued that he
had issued the postdated checks for purposes of accommodation, as he had in the
past accorded similar favors to petitioner.  During the proceedings, private respondent contested several tickets
alleged to have been erroneously debited to his account.  He claimed reimbursement of his alleged
overpayments, plus litigation expenses, and exemplary and moral damages by
reason of the allegedly improper attachment of his properties.</p>

<p class="BODY">In support of his theory that the checks were issued for
accommodation, private respondent testified that he had issued the checks in
the name of Travel-On in order that its General Manager, Elita Montilla, could
show to Travel-On's Board of Directors that the accounts receivable of the
company were still good.  He further
stated that Elita Montilla tried to encash the same, but that these were
dishonored and were subsequently returned to him after the accommodation
purpose had been attained.</p>

<p class="BODY">Travel-On's witness, Elita Montilla, on the other hand explained
that the "accommodation" extended to Travel-On by private respondent
related to situations where one or more of its passengers needed money in
Hongkong, and upon request of Travel-On respondent would contact his friends in
Hongkong to advance Hongkong money to the passenger.  The passenger then paid Travel-On upon his return to Manila and
which payment would be credited by Travel-On to respondent's running account
with it.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its decision dated 31 January 1975, the court <u>a quo</u>
ordered Travel-On to pay private respondent the amount of P8,894.91
representing not overpayments by private respondent, moral damages of
P10,000.00 for the wrongful issuance of the writ of attachment and for the
filing of this case, P5,000.00 for attorney's fees and the costs of the suit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court ruled that private respondent's indebtedness to
petitioner was not satisfactorily established and that the postdated checks
were issued not for the purpose of encashment to pay his indebtedness but to
accommodate the General Manager of Travel-On to enable her to show to the Board
of Directors that Travel-On was financially stable.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration that was, however,
denied by the trial court, which in fact then increased the award of moral
damages to P50,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the
trial court, but reduced the award of moral damages to P20,000.00, with
interest at the legal rate from the date of the filing of the Answer on 28
August 1972.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner moved for reconsideration of the Court of Appeals'
decision, without success.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant Petition for Review, it is urged that the
postdated checks are <u>per se</u> evidence of liability on the part of private
respondent.  Petitioner further argues
that even assuming that the checks were for accommodation, private respondent
is still liable thereunder considering that petitioner is a holder for value.</p>

<p class="BODY">Both the trial and appellate courts had rejected the checks as
evidence of indebtedness on the ground that the various statements of account
prepared by petitioner did not show that private respondent had an outstanding
balance of P115,000.00 which is the total amount of the checks he issued.  It was pointed out that while the various
exhibits of petitioner showed various accountabilities of private respondent,
they did not satisfactorily establish the amount of the outstanding
indebtedness of private respondent.  The
appellate court made much of the fact that the figures representing private
respondent's unpaid accounts found in the "Schedule of Outstanding
Account" dated 31 January 1970 did not tally with the figures found in the
statement which showed private respondent's transactions with petitioner for
the years 1969 and 1970; that there was no satisfactory explanation as to why
the total outstanding amount of <u>P278,432.74</u> was still used as basis in
the accounting of 7 April 1972 considering that according to the table of
transactions for the year 1969 and 1970, the total unpaid account of private
respondent amounted to <u>P239,794.57</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">We have, however, examined the record and it shows that the 7
April 1972 Statement of Account had simply not been updated; that if use as
basis the figure as of 31 January 1970 which is P278,432.74 and from it deduct
P38,638.17 which represents some of the payments subsequently made by private
respondent, the figure - P239,794.57 will be obtained.</p>

<p class="BODY">Also, the fact alone that the various statements of account had
variances in figures, simply did not mean that private respondent had no more
financial obligations to petitioner.  It
must be stressed that private respondent's account with petitioner was a <u>running</u>
or <u>open</u> one, which explains the varying figures in each of the
statements rendered as of a given date.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellate court erred in considering only the statements of
account in determining whether private respondent was indebted to petitioner
under the checks.  By doing so, it failed
to give due importance to the most telling piece of evidence of private
respondent's indebtedness - the checks themselves which he had issued.</p>

<p class="BODY">Contrary to the view held by the Court of Appeals, this Court
finds that the checks are the all important evidence of petitioner's case; that
these checks clearly established private respondent's indebtedness to
petitioner; that private respondent was liable thereunder.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is important to stress that a check which is regular on its
face is deemed <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> to have been issued for a valuable
consideration and every person whose signature appears thereon is deemed to
have become a party thereto for value.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a> Thus,
the mere introduction of the instrument sued on in evidence <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u>
entitles the plaintiff to recovery.  Further, the rule is quite settled that a negotiable instrument is
presumed to have been given or indorsed for a sufficient consideration unless
otherwise contradicted and overcome by other competent evidence.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the Court of Appeals, contrary to these
established rules, placed the burden of proving the existence of valuable
consideration upon petitioner.  This
cannot be countenanced; it was up to private respondent to show that he had
indeed issued the checks without sufficient consideration.  The Court considers that private respondent
was unable to rebut satisfactorily this legal presumption.  It must also be noted that those checks were
issued immediately after a letter demanding payment had been sent to private
respondent by petitioner Travel-On.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that all the checks issued by private respondent to
petitioner were presented for payment by the latter would lead to no other
conclusion than that these checks were intended for encashment.  There is nothing in the checks themselves
(or in any other document for that matter) that states otherwise.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are unable to accept the Court of Appeals' conclusion that the
checks here involved were issued for "accommodation" and that
accordingly private respondent maker of those checks was not liable thereon to
petitioner payee of those checks.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the first place, while the Negotiable Instruments Law does
refer to accommodation transactions, no such transaction was here shown.  Section 29 of the Negotiable Instruments Law
provides as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Section 29.  <u>Liability
of accommodation party</u>.  -- An
accommodation party is one who has signed the instrument as maker, drawer,
acceptor, or endorser, without receiving value therefore, and for the purpose
of lending his name to some other person.  Such a person is liable on the instrument to a holder for value,
notwithstanding such holder, at the time of taking the instrument, knew him to
be only an accommodation party.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">In accommodation transactions recognized
by the Negotiable Instruments Law, an accommodating party lends his credit to
the accommodated party, by issuing or indorsing a check which is held by a
payee or indorsee as a holder in due course, who gave full value therefore to
the accommodated party.  The latter, in
other words, receives or realizes full value which the accommodated party then
must repay to the accommodating party, unless of course the accommodating party
intended to make a donation to the accommodated party.  <u>But the accommodating party is bound on
the check to the holder in due course who is necessarily</u> a third party and
is <u>not</u> the accommodated party.  Having issued or indorsed the check, the accommodating party has
warranted to the holder in due course that he will pay the same according to
its tenor.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, Travel-On was payee of all six (6) checks; it
presented these checks for payment at the drawee bank but the checks
bounced.  <u>Travel-On obviously was not
an accommodated party</u>; <u>it realized no value on the checks which bounced</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Travel-On was entitled to the benefit of the statutory
presumption that it was a holder in due course,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a> that
the checks were supported by valuable consideration.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Private respondent maker of the checks did not successfully rebut these
presumptions.  The only evidence <u>aliunde</u>
that private respondent offered was his own self-serving uncorroborated
testimony.  He claimed that he had
issued the checks to Travel-On as payee to "accommodate" its General
Manager who allegedly wished to show those checks to the Board of Directors of
Travel-On to "prove" that Travel-On's account receivables were
somehow "still good." It will be seen that this claim was in fact a
claim that the checks were merely simulated, that private respondent did not
intend to bind himself thereon.  Only evidence
of the clearest and most convincing kind will suffice for that purpose;<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
no such evidence was submitted by private respondent.  The latter's explanation was denied by Travel-On's General
Manager; that explanation, in any case, appears merely contrived and quite
hollow to us.  Upon the other hand, the
"accommodation" or assistance extended to Travel-On's passengers
abroad as testified by petitioner's General Manager involved, not the
accommodation transactions recognized by the NIL, but rather the circumvention
of then existing foreign exchange regulations by passengers booked by
Travel-On, which incidentally involved receipt of full consideration by private
respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, we believe and so hold that private respondent must be held
liable on the six (6) checks here involved.  Those checks in themselves constituted evidence of indebtedness of
private respondent, evidence not successfully overturned or rebutted by private
respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since the checks constitute the best evidence of private
respondent's liability to petitioner Travel-On, the amount of such liability is
the face amount of the checks, reduced only by the P10,000.00 which Travel-On
admitted in its complaint to have been paid by private respondent sometime in
March 1992.<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The award of moral damages to private respondent must be set
aside, for the reason that petitioner's application for the writ of attachment
rested on sufficient basis and no bad faith was shown on the part of
Travel-On.  If anyone was in bad faith,
it was private respondent who issued bad checks and then pretended to have
"accommodated" petitioner's General Manager by assisting her in a
supposed scheme to deceive petitioner's Board of Directors and to misrepresent
Travel-On's financial condition.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the Court Resolved to GRANT due course to the
Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i> and to REVERSE and SET ASIDE the
Decision dated 22 October 1980 and the Resolution of 23 January 1981 of the
Court of Appeals, as well as the Decision dated 31 January 1975 of the trial
court, and to enter a new decision requiring private respondent Arturo S.
Miranda to pay to petitioner Travel-On the amount of P105,000.00 with legal
interest thereon from 14 June 1972, plus ten percent (10%) of the total amount
due as attorney's fees.  Costs against
private respondent.</p>
