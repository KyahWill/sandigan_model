<span style="">under the scheduled </span><span style="">commission rates (Exhibits “A” and “J”).<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>From <span style="">1973 to 1975, Valenzuela solicited </span><span style="">marine </span><span style="">insurance from one of </span><span style="">his

commission which amounted to P1.6</span><span style="">

cause of the termination of the plaintiff <span style="">as

M. Aragon to share with the Delta commission of plaintiff Arturo P.
Valenzuela.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had persistently pursued
the sharing scheme <span style="">to </span>the point
of terminating plaintiff Arturo P. Valenzuela, and to make matters worse,
defendants made it appear that plaintiff Arturo P. Valenzuela had substantial
accounts with defendant PHILAMGEN.</blockquote>

separately the Delta Commission of plaintiff Arturo P. Valenzuela, (b) to
reverse the Delta commission due plaintiff Arturo P. Valenzuela by not
crediting or applying said commission earned to the account of plaintiff Arturo
P. Valenzuela, (c) placed plaintiff Arturo P. Valenzuela’s agency transactions

plaintiff Arturo P. <span class="SpellE">ValenzueIa</span> has substantial

commission” (Decision, p. 9; p. 13, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, 41)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Because of the
conflicting conclusions, this Court deemed it necessary in the interest of
substantial </span><span style="">justice </span><span style="">to scrutinize the evidence and records of the
cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While it is an established
principle that the factual findings of the Court of Appeals are final and may
not be reviewed on appeal to this Court, there are however certain exceptions
to the rule which this Court has recognized </span><span style="">and accepted, among which, are when the </span><span style="">judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts and when the findings

Court of Appeals, 139 SCRA 576 [1986]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where the findings of the Court of </span><span style="">Appeals </span><span style="">and the trial court are contrary to each other, this Court may
scrutinize the evidence on record (Cruz v. Court of Appeals, 129 SCRA 222 [1984];
Mendoza v. Court of Appeals, 156 SCRA 597 [1987]; <span class="SpellE">Maclan</span>
v. Santos, 156 SCRA 542 [1987]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
the conclusion of the Court of Appeals is grounded entirely </span><span style="">and </span><span style="">speculation, surmises <span style="">or

there is grave abuse of discretion, or when the judgment is based on a
misapprehension of facts, and when the findings of facts are conflicting the

conclusions of the </span>trial court on the apparent <u>bad</u> f<u>aith</u>
of the private respondents <span style="">terminating
the General Agency Agreement of petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is axiomatic that the findings of fact of a trial judge are entitled
to great weight (People v. <span class="SpellE">Atanacio</span>, 128 SCRA 22
[1984]) and should not be disturbed on appeal unless for strong and cogent
reasons because the trial court is in a better position </span>to examine the
evidence as well as to observe the demeanor of the witnesses <span style="">while </span>testifying (Chase v. <span class="SpellE">Buencamino</span>, Sr., 136 SCRA 365 [1985]; <span style="">People v. </span>Pimentel, 147 SCRA 25
[1987]; and <span class="SpellE">Baliwag</span> Trans., Inc. v. Court of Appeals,
147 SCRA 82 <span style="">[1987]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case at </span>bar, <span style="">the records show </span>that the findings and
conclusions of the trial court are supported by substantial evidence and there
appears <span style="">to </span>be <span style="">no </span>cogent reason to disturb them
(Mendoza v. Court of Appeals, 156 SCRA 597 [1987]).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the insurance business

much embarrassment, difficulties, and oftentimes frustrations <span style="">in </span>the solicitation and procurement of
the insurance policies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To sell
policies, an agent exerts great effort, patience, perseverance, i<span style="">n</span>genuity, tact, imagination, time and
money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">In the </span><span style="">case of</span><span style=""> Valenzuela, he was able to build up an
agency</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">from scratch in 1965 to a highly productive
enterprise with gross billings of about Two Million Five Hundred Thousand Pesos
(P2<span class="GramE">,500,000.00</span>) premiums per</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">annum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Th</span><span style="">e</span><span style=""> records sustain the

</span><span style="">insurance
business </span><span style="">that Valenzuela had
built up, developed and nurtured to profitability through over thirteen (13)
years of patient </span><span style="">work </span><span style="">and perseverance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When Valenzuela refused to share his
commission in the Delta </span>account, the boom suddenly fell on him.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The private respondents
by the simple expedient of terminating the General Agency Agreement
appropriated the entire insurance business of Valenzuela.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the termination of the General Agency
Agreement, Valenzuela would no longer be entitled to commission on the renewal
of insurance policies </span><span style="">of clients </span><span style="">sourced from </span><span style="">hi</span><span style="">s agency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Worse, despite the termination of the agency,
<span class="SpellE">Philamgen</span> continued to hold Valenzuela jointly and
severally liable with the insured for unpaid </span>premiums. Under these
circumstances, it is clear that Valenzuela had an interest in the continuation
of the <span style="">agency when it was
unceremoniously terminated not only because of the commissions he should continue
to receive from the insurance business he has solici</span><span style="">ted</span><span style=""> and procured but also </span><span style="">for
</span><span style="">the fact that by the very acts
of the respondents, he was made liable to <span class="SpellE">Philamgen</span> </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">the event the insured fail to pay the premiums due. They are <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> by their own positive averments and claims for
damages. Therefore, the respondents cannot state that the agency relationship
between Valenzuela and <span class="SpellE">Philamgen</span> is not coupled with
interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>“There may be cases in which
an agent has been induced to assume a</span> responsibility or incur a
liability, in reliance upon the continuance of the authority under such <span style="">circumstances that, if the authority be
withdrawn, the agent </span><span style="">will </span><span style="">be exposed to personal loss or liability” </span>(See

petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The preponderance of the
authorities <span class="GramE">sustain</span> the preposition that a principal
can be held liable for damages in cases of unjust termination of agency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE"><u>Danon</u></span> <u><span style="">v.</span></u><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Brimo</u></span>, 42 Phil. 133 [1921]),
thi<span style="">s C</span>ourt <span style="">ruled </span>that where no time for the<span style=""> </span>continuance of the contract is fixed
by its terms, <span style="">either party is at
liberty to terminate it at will, subject only to the ordinary requirements of </span><u>good</u>
<u>faith</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">The right of the principal </span><span style="">to
</span><span style="">terminate his authority is
absolute and unrestricted, except only that he may not do so in <u>bad</u> </span><u>faith</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The trial court in its
decision awarded to Valenzuela the amount of Seventy Five Thousand Pesos (P75<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>) per month as compensatory damages from June 1980
until its decision becomes final and executory.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This award is justified in the light of the evidence extant on record
(Exhibits “N”, “N-10”, “O”, “O-1”, “P” and “P-1”) showing that the average
gross premium collection monthly of Valenzuela over a period of four (4) months
from December </span>1978 to <span style="">February
1979, amounted to </span>over P300<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> from which
he is <span style="">entitled to a commission </span>of
P100,000.00 more or less per month.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Moreover, his</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">annual </span>sales
production amounted to P2<span class="GramE">,500,000.00</span> from where he was
g<span style="">iven<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span>32.5% <span style="">commissions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under Article </span>2200 of the new <span style="">Civil Code, </span>“indemnification for
damages shall comprehend <span style="">not only the
value of the </span>loss <span style="">suffered, but
also that of the profits which the <span class="SpellE">obligee</span> failed to
obtain.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The circumstances of the
case, however, require that </span>the contractual relationship between the
parti<span style="">e</span>s <span style="">shall be terminated upon the satisfaction of the judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No more claims </span>arising <span style="">from or </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">a result of the agency
shall be entertained by the courts after that date.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
