<p class="BODY">The facts as gathered from the records and the decision of the
trial court may be summed up as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Victor <span class="SpellE">Boban</span>, then 18 years of age and
a <span class="SpellE"><u>cargador</u></span> at the Asuncion Market, <span class="SpellE">Tondo</span>, Manila, testified that on 6 October 1984, at around
2:00 o'clock a.m. while he was standing near the corner of an alley of the
Asuncion Market at Asuncion Street, waiting for the arrival of the bananas
which he had to unload, he saw his friend, the victim Henry Cortez, also a <span class="SpellE"><u>cargador</u></span>, leaning sideways against a cement wall
facing him, from a distance of about one and <span class="GramE">one-half</span>
arms length.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the place was
well-lighted by two fluorescent lamps, being a public market, he clearly saw
the face of the man who suddenly appeared from behind the victim.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
This man, who turned out to be the appellant, stabbed the victim from behind
with a fan knife at the base or nape of the neck.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without any warning, another man, a companion
of the appellant, approached Victor and also tried to stab him with a knife.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Fortunately, he was able to evade the attack.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He immediately fled the scene of the crime and ran towards the direction
of <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Zaragoza</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>,
fearful of being pursued and further attacked.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After sometime, however, he decided to return to the place of the attack
and on his way back, he saw the appellant and several other unidentified
persons including the one who tried to stab him, running away from the scene of
the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When Victor reached the alley
or <span class="SpellE"><u>pasillo</u></span>, he saw many people gathered around
and viewing the sprawled body of the victim.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He came over and felt the pulse of the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He found him to be already dead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next morning, he informed the police
investigator at the Asuncion Market that he could identify to him the killer.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
In December 1984, he was asked by the police investigators to come to the
Homicide Section of the Western Police District (WPD).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After executing a statement there (Exhibit
E), he was asked by the police investigators to identify the assailant from a
group of about ten (10) detention prisoners.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He pointed out the appellant to the police as the person who had stabbed
Henry Cortez.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Paterno</span> <span class="SpellE">Banawel</span>,
an investigator of the Homicide Section of the WPD testified that at about <st1:time minute="15" hour="15">3:15 o'clock</st1:time> in the morning of <st1:date year="1984" day="6" month="10">6 October 1984</st1:date>, Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Nituliano</span> of Police Station 2 informed his office that a

the Asuncion Market, they came upon the body of the victim in <span class="SpellE">Pasillo</span> 1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
victim's back were five (5) stab wounds.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Later they talked to some of the people in the market and one of them,
Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Castillon</span>, another <span class="SpellE"><u>cargador</u></span>,
informed them that the victim's name was Henry <span class="SpellE">Suniega</span>
which information, however, turned out to be erroneous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Banawel</span>
tried to question some of the vendors in the market but no one wanted to talk
because of fear of reprisal.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a> But

around <st1:time minute="30" hour="0">12:30 a.m.</st1:time>, his office
received a telephone call from an unidentified person informing that the

Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> Garcia and Sergeant <span class="SpellE">Gaudencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Quibuyen</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At around <st1:time minute="30" hour="1">1:30
 a.m.</st1:time>, the group returned with the appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the meantime, Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Banawel</span> had gone back to the scene of the crime to look for
eyewitnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This time he was informed
by some people there that <span class="SpellE">Efren</span> Arroyo and Victor <span class="SpellE">Boban</span> had witnessed the slaying.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This prompted him to request these two (2)
persons to come to <span class="SpellE">Banawel's</span> office at the WPD.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon being questioned, <span class="SpellE">Boban</span>
told him that he would be able to identify the person who stabbed the
victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He brought <span class="SpellE">Boban</span>
to a cell with about ten (10) detention prisoners, one of them being the
appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Boban</span>
pointed out the appellant as the person he had seen <span class="GramE">stab</span>

<p class="BODY">In court, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Cenido</span> testified that the
wounds found on the body of the victim were caused by only one single-edged
pointed knife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He stated that the wounds
were "consistent", all at the backside of the victim, possibly
committed with the assailant behind the victim and that the victim could have
been either standing up or lying down when stabbed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He identified wounds nos. 1 and 3 as the
mortal wounds.</p>

<p class="BODY">The errors assigned by appellant may be discussed together,
considering that they are interrelated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant contends basically that his identification as the culprit was
"tailored-fit and legally defective and sham" since prosecution
witness Victor <span class="SpellE">Boban</span> could not be expected to be able
to register in his mind an accurate picture of what he saw or of events which
might have taken place on the early morning hours of 6 October 1984,
considering that those events were absolutely <span class="SpellE">unforseen</span>
and unexpected, and since that was the first time he had ever seen the
appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court cannot sustain appellant's claim in the light of <span class="SpellE">Boban's</span> positive identification of appellant as the person
who had stabbed the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Boban</span> testified as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">The testimony of a single witness, if credible and positive and
if it satisfies the court beyond reasonable doubt, is sufficient to convict.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
In the case of <u>People vs. <span class="SpellE">Aboga</span></u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
the Court ruled that the testimony of a prosecution witness who was only two
(2) arms length away from the victim at the time of the crime and who had
observed the killing by the light of a wick lamp inside the <span class="GramE">house,</span>
was credible. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>The fact that <span class="SpellE">Boban</span> did not witness the rest of the events did not in any
way affect his credibility as a witness.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was no showing that that prosecution witness was prompted by any
ill motive in testifying against the appellant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The absence of evidence of any improper motive impelling the principal
prosecution witness sustains the conclusion that his testimony was worthy of
full faith and credit.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
In fact, the appellant conceded that he was not at all known to Victor <span class="SpellE">Boban</span> before the fatal morning of <st1:date year="1984" day="6" month="10">6 October 1984</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may also be recalled that the WPD medico-legal officer
testified that the five (5) stab wounds had been inflicted by the same
weapon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This testimony is consistent
with the hypothesis that after <span class="SpellE">Boban</span> had fled from
the <span class="SpellE">situs</span> of the stabbing, appellant continued to
stab at the victim and inflicted the several other wounds upon the victim which
caused the latter's death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any event,
the prosecution's evidence clearly pointed to appellant as having administered
at least one stab wound unto the victim.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense of the appellant was alibi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He claimed that at around <st1:time minute="0" hour="2">2:00 o'clock a.m.</st1:time> of <st1:date year="1984" day="6" month="10">6 October 1984</st1:date>, he was at a construction site in <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Elcano</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street> near <st1:street><st1:address>Recto
  Avenue</st1:address></st1:street>, about ten (10) meters away from the
Asuncion Market.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, he insisted that
he could not have been the assailant of the victim and that he was "framed
up" by the police investigators who simply wanted to dispose of the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">On this point, the trial court aptly observed that:</p>

<blockquote>"Accused defense of alibi deserves scant consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot prevail against positive
identification of him made by witness Victor <span class="SpellE">Boban</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Significant too is the fact that the place
where he was about <st1:time minute="0" hour="14">2:00 o'clock</st1:time> in
the morning of <st1:date year="1984" day="6" month="10">October 6, 1984</st1:date>
is only about 10 meters away from the crime scene, at the Asuncion Market.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was not therefore impossible for him to
have been at the crime scene at the time of its commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Worst still, if he was at the time of the
commission of the crime actually working at <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Elcano</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>, this could have
been easily corroborated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But no
corroboration was offered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
circumstance makes his defense of alibi <span class="GramE">more weak</span> x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Under prevailing doctrine, the trial court's conclusions on the
credibility of witnesses are entitled to great respect and great weight on appeal.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
The Court believes that this doctrine must be applied in the present case.<span style="font-size: 10pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The element of treachery has been adequately shown.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The location of the five (5) stab wounds, all
on the victim's back, and the deadly nature of at least two (2) of these, plus
the suddenness of the stabbing assault, all point to the design to kill the
victim without giving him an opportunity to defend himself.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant assails the legality of his arrest by the police
investigators allegedly for the reason that it "was based solely on the
basis of the tip and say-so from a telephone informant x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> who refused to identify himself."</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court considers that appellant is <span class="SpellE">estopped</span>
from questioning the legality of his arrest.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>An examination of the record reveals that this issue is being raised for
the first time by appellant before this Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He had not moved for the quashing of the information before the trial
court on this ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, any irregularity
attendant to his arrest was cured when he voluntarily submitted himself to the
jurisdiction of the trial court by entering a plea of not guilty "and [by]
participating in the trial".<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, the record does not show that the police investigators
had acted recklessly in arresting the appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The police investigator <span class="SpellE">Paterno</span>
<span class="SpellE">Banawel</span>, to whom the prosecution witness Victor <span class="SpellE">Boban</span> gave a description of the assailant, had encountered
difficulties in tracking down the appellant, a member of the "<span class="SpellE">sigue-sigue</span> commando" gang.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
It is well-known that witnesses to killings usually do not want to undergo the
trouble and inconvenience of going to court and being exposed to reprisal.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
The trial court noted that "nobody wanted to talk because they do not want
to get involved".<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
It took about two (2) months for the caller who refused to be identified to
muster enough courage to inform police investigator <span class="SpellE">Banawel</span>
about appellant's whereabouts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, the prompt action of the police investigators in arresting
appellant must be presumed to have been taken in good faith and in reasonable
fear that appellant would forthwith flee.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, the Court considers that appellant's claim that he was
arrested and exposed to accusatorial proceedings without being informed of his
constitutional <span class="GramE">rights,</span> has not been
substantiated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The booking and information
sheet and progress report marked as Exhibits "G" and "I"
respectively, which were prepared by the police investigators <span class="GramE">explicitly</span> stated that appellant had been properly informed
of his constitutional rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact,
after he was informed of his constitutional rights, appellant chose to remain
silent and requested the assistance of counsel.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It has not been asserted that appellant gave a confession, judicial or
extrajudicial, oral or written.</p>
