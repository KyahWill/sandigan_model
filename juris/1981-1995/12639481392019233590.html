				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">A special civil action for <i>Certiorari</i> with preliminary injunction and restraining order to annul and set aside the Orders, dated 23 October 1987 and 18 November 1987, of the Ninth Division of respondent Court of Appeals<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> denying petitioner's “Urgent Motion for Transfer of Case.”<br><br>Briefly, the background facts, for purposes of this case, may be stated as follows:<br><blockquote><ol type="1"><li> On 30 January 1978, Peru Realty Corporation (PERU) sold to petitioner BENGUET for P6,341,000.00 a property registered in its name located at No. 2 Bauhinia Road, Forbes Park, Makati (the Disputed Property), with the right to repurchase up to August, 1981. The sale was further subject to the right of respondents La’o to reside in the property for the duration of the repurchase period. Fernando G. La’O is the President of PERU.<br><br></li><li> On 3 November 1981, due to the failure of PERU to repurchase within the redemption period, BENGUET filed a Complaint with the Court of First Instance of Rizal at Pasig, Branch XXIV, against PERU and the La’Os, for consolidation of ownership over the Disputed Property, docketed as Civil Case No. 43502 (the Consolidation Case).<br><br><table  ="" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="5%">2.1.</td><td width="95%"> <div align="justify">On 2 March 1982, the parties submitted a Compromise Agreement in the Consolidation Case, the salient conditions of which were (1) extension of the repurchase period to 2 August 1982; (2) BENGUET’s right to automatically consolidate title in case of failure to exercise the repurchase option on or before said date; and (3) obligation of the La’Os to vacate the premises without any need for a Court Order.</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">2.2. </td><td><div align="justify">On 17 March 1982, the Court rendered a Decision approving the Compromise Agreement.</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">2.3. </td><td><div align="justify">Within the stipulated extended period, PERU again failed to redeem the Disputed Property. Accordingly, the titles covering the property in the name of PERU were cancelled and TCT Nos. 117480 and 117481 were issued in the name of BENGUET.</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">2.4.</td><td> <div align="justify">With BENGUET as the new owner, the La’Os leased the Disputed Property from BENGUET at a monthly rental of P5,000.00 for the period 1 May 1983 to 31 July 1983.

Among the reliefs prayed for was the reconveyance of the Disputed Property and the issuance of a Writ of Preliminary Injunction enjoining BENGUET from interfering with their occupation of the Disputed Property (the Reconveyance Case).<br><br><table  ="" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="5%">3.1.</td><td width="95%"> <div align="justify">That Writ of Preliminary Injunction was subsequently issued.</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">3.2. </td><td><div align="justify">On 10 December 1984, BENGUET applied for a Writ of Preliminary Mandatory Injunction ordering the La’Os to vacate the Disputed Property and dissolve the Writ of Preliminary Injunction issued in PERU’s favor.</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">3.3. </td><td><div align="justify">After some intervening incidents, on 26 February 1987, a Writ of Preliminary Mandatory Injunction was issued in favor of BENGUET, ordering PERU and the La’Os to vacate the Disputed Property and to turn over possession to BENGUET. The Deputy Sheriff of Branch 56, Regional Trial Court at Makati, was directed to implement the Writ and to cause eviction of the La’Os from the premises.</div></td></tr></tbody></table><br></li><li> In the meantime, on 24 October 1986, and while the Reconveyance Case (Civil Case No. 5815) was still pending, PERU and the La’Os filed with the Court of Appeals an original Petition for “Declaration of Nullity of Judgment and/or Annulment thereof” wherein they prayed that the Decision based on the Compromise Agreement in the Consolidation Case (Civil Case No. 43502) be declared null and void ab initio. Said case was docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 10387 and assigned to the 10th Division (The 10th Division Case).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> An amended Petition was filed on 7 March 1987 to include the Presiding Judge of Branch 56.<br><br><table  ="" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="5%">4.1. </td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">On 11 March 1987, the 10th Division, acting on the Urgent Motion filed by PERU, issued a Resolution temporarily restraining implementation of the Preliminary Mandatory Injunction issued by the Trial Court in the Reconveyance Case (Civil Case No. 5815) on 26 February 1987.</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">4.2. </td><td><div align="justify">On 29 May 1987, the 10th Division rendered its Decision dismissing the Amended Petition for Declaration of Nullity of Judgment filed by PERU and the La’Os and set aside all Restraining Orders previously issued by it.</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">4.3. </td><td><div align="justify">On 22 June 1987, PERU moved for reconsideration of the Decision, which Motion is still pending resolution before the 10th Division.</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">4.4. </td><td><div align="justify">On 18 June 1987, pursuant to the 10th Division Decision of 29 May 1987, BENGUET filed in the Reconveyance Case (Civil Case No. 5815) an “Ex-parte Motion to Proceed with the Implementation of the Writ of Preliminary Mandatory Injunction” of 26 February 1987 and for the appointment of a Special Sheriff.

That being so, that case is not anymore pending before this court, hence, it would be improper to merge this case with another one already decided.</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify">“The pretensions of private respondent cannot be given due course by us.</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify">“Wherefore, subject motion denied.</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify">“So ordered.” (p. 8, Rollo)</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">5.4.</td><td> <div align="justify">On 18 November 1987, the 9th Division denied BENGUET's Urgent Motion for Reconsideration.</div></td></tr></tbody></table></li></ol></blockquote>Assailing the aforesaid 9th Division Orders of 23 October and 18 November 1987, BENGUET filed, on 15 December 1987, this Petition for Certiorari with Preliminary Injunction and Restraining Order, adducing the following Arguments:<br><br><center>"I</center><blockquote>The Honorable Court of Appeals Ninth Division committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction in denying the motion for transfer of case.<br><br><center>"II</center><br>Refusal to transfer case despite meritorious grounds to do so is indicative of the undue interest of the Honorable Justices in the case at bar.<br><br><center>"III</center><br>The refusal to transfer case to the Tenth Division would work grave injustice to petitioner and there is no appeal, and no other speedy, adequate, and sufficient remedy available to petitioners in the ordinary course of law.” (pp. 8-9, <i>Rollo</i>)</blockquote>On 6 January 1988, upon BENGUET's Urgent Supplemental Motion, we issued a Temporary Restraining Order enjoining respondent 9th Division of the Court of Appeals from rendering a decision on the merits.<br><br>On 11 July 1988, after four (4) Motions for Extension, with a fifth Motion having been denied, private respondents filed their Comment.<br><br>We resolved to give due course.<br><br>The issue before us is whether or not respondent Court of Appeals, 9th Division, can be faulted with grave abuse of discretion in denying BENGUET’s Motion to Transfer Case No. CA-G.R. SP No. 12964 to the 10th Division.<br><br>We are constrained to rule in the affirmative.<br><blockquote><ol type="1"><li> Although the 10th Division had already dismissed the case before it in its Decision of 29 May 1987, PERU’s Motion for Reconsideration filed on 22 June 1987 was still pending thereat when the Motion to Transfer Case was filed on 20 October 1987 and is still so pending. That factor, although brought to the attention of the 9th Division, was not duly considered by it.<br><br></li><li> The matter elevated to the 9th Division, namely, the implementation of the Writ of Preliminary Mandatory Injunction with Break-open Order issued by the Trial Court on 29 September 1987 in favor of BENGUET in the Reconveyance Case (Civil Case No. 5815) was a consequence of the very Decision rendered by the 10th Division. It was, therefore, properly within its competence being intimately related to the very issues raised and resolved by said Division.<br><br></li><li> The rationale for consolidation is to have all cases intimately related acted upon by one Court/Division to avoid the possibility of conflicting decisions in cases involving the same facts and common questions of law. The cases before the 10th Division and the 9th Division of the Court of Appeals are two (2) such intimately and substantially related cases. Consolidation being called for it cannot be justifiably argued, as private respondents do, that BENGUET is estopped from pleading for such consolidation. To deny the transfer could lead to further protracted litigations to the detriment of the efficient and effective determination of actions and proceedings.</li></ol></blockquote><b>ACCORDINGLY,</b> <i>Certiorari</i> is granted.
