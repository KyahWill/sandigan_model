<p>
The inculpatory facts are as follows:  At about 10:00 o'clock in the 
evening of July 2, 1966, while Gorgonio Mosende and his wife, Fausta, 
were preparing to go to sleep in their house in Sitio Suapit, Barrio 
Limot, Mati, Davao, several persons arrived and called:  "Good evening, <em>tiyo</em>."
 Thinking that they were relatives of his wife, Mosende invited the 
callers to come up.  Two men, armed with .45 cal. pistols, later 
identified as the accused Romualdo Raboy and Edgardo Señeres came up and
 demanded:  "<em>hain na ang iyong armas</em>" - where is your firearm? 
 Mosende denied having a firearm, but his wife was so frightened that 
she told the armed men:  "Do not kill my husband, if you want the arm, 
the shotgun is here," and raised the mosquito net covering their 
sleeping mat and pointed to the shotgun.  The accused Edgardo Señeres 
took the gun and asked the couple for money.  Fausta, in fear, opened 
their <em>aparador </em>which the accused Edgardo Señeres then 
ransacked, taking therefrom P170.00 in coins and paper bills.  The two 
accused then left, taking with them the shotgun of Mosende valued at 
P550.00.  Not long thereafter, Mosende heard gunshots coming from the 
direction of the house of George Kalitas, about 25 meters away.  Mosende
 and his wife went down their house and sought cover behind a coconut 
tree.  A few minutes later, Mosende saw a blaze start from the house of 
George Kalitas which spread rapidly until the entire house was engulfed 
in flames and completly burned down.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 
</p><p>
All the inmates of the house of George Kalitas were fast asleep when the
 firing started and were awakened by the gunfire.  George Kalitas, a 
70-year old paraplegic, was sleeping inside their bedroom with his wife,
 Sylvia Mingming, his grandchildren Jessie Renopal and "Bebot" and their
 maid's son, Fortunato "Ato" Malapong.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>  Narciso Bauyot, a nephew of George Kalitas, slept in the dining room, while the maid Babbadon Odal slept in the kitchen.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> 
</p><p>
Upon hearing the fusillade, Babbadon Odal rushed to the master's bedroom
 to get her son, "Ato." But, as she was about to raise the mosquito net 
covering her son, she was hit by a bullet on the left wrist and 
immediately lost consciousness, regaining the same only at the Mati 
Baptist Hospital, where she was brought for treatment of her injury.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> 
</p><p>
Jessie Renopal, the 11-year old granddaughter of George Kalitas, was 
also grazed by a bullet in the head when she stood up upon hearing the 
volley.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>  She felt pain, but
 she did not lose consciousness, thus enabling her to see five robbers 
enter the house while two others remained by the door.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> 
</p><p>
Narciso Bauyot who was sleeping in the dining room, ran to the kitchen 
upon hearing the gunfire and hid in an aparador.  But, when the toilet 
of the main house of George Kalitas was set on fire, he left his hiding 
place and went out of the house, passing through a small window in the 
kitchen.  He landed safely on the ground only to fall into the hands of 
the accused Romualdo Raboy who pointed a gun at his abdomen telling him:
  "you surrender, if you will not surrender, I will kill you." The 
accused Edgardo Señeres also told Narciso to surrender and raise his 
hands, which Narciso did.  Señeres then continued firing at the house of
 George Kalitas.  Another armed man, later identified as the accused 
Saturnino Galliano, also approached Narciso and threatened to pour a can
 of kerosene on him.  But, Narciso pleaded:  "Don’t pour it on me 
because I might be burned," and was spared.  The accused Saturnino 
Galliano, instead, poured the can of kerosene on the walls of the 
kitchen of the house and ignited it with some dried fronds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> 
</p><p>
The robbers then started to break open the main door of the house with an axe.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>
  After the robbers had broken the door and gained access to the, sala, 
George Kalitas fired at them with his "Stevens" 12-gauge shotgun,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>  hitting one of them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>  George Kalitas had crawled with his wife and grandchildren after Jessie Renopal and Babbadon Odal were hit by bullets.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>
  The armed men fired back, hitting George Kalitas, who dropped his 
shotgun.  His grandson, Bebot, picked up the shotgun, but, when the 
robbers shouted:  "surrender, surrender, throw that gun to us; throw the
 gun below, by the stairs," he panicked and threw the shotgun to them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> 
</p><p>
Immediately, thereafter, four (4) armed men, later identified as the 
accused Angel Dy, Romualdo Raboy, Saturnino Galliano, and Abraham Lim 
rushed them.  Angel Dy held Mrs. Kalitas by the neck and kicked the 
wounded George Kalitas, while the others went inside the bedroom of 
George Kalitas and forcibly opened a trunk placed under the bed which 
contained the amount of P40,000.00, in cash, at the last counting two 
months before the incident.  They also took some old coins which Mrs. 
Kalitas had kept in a container inside the trunk.  Saturnino Galliano 
and Angel Dy also got the money of Jessie Renopal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> 
</p><p>
After getting the money, the robbers left.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>
  The inmates of the house also went out because of the fire and brought
 the wounded to the hospital.  But, George Kalitas died before they 
could reach the hospital in Mati.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> 
</p><p>
Meanwhile, the fire continued to spread until the main house of George 
Kalitas and his bodega, including their contents, and a truck parked in 
between the buildings, all valued at P34,545.00, were completely 
destroyed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> 
</p><p>
The crime was reported to the police authorities immediately thereafter 
and Sgt. Jose Blones of the 433rd PC Company stationed at Mati, Davao, 
conducted an investigation.  He learned that a light green Buick Electra
 225 sedan, 1964 model, with Plate No. H-6357-Manila-‘65, is had 
refueled at a Caltex gasoline station in the poblacion of Mati and then 
proceeded towards Barrio Limot at about 9:00 o'clock in the evening of 
July 2, 1966, and was seen again parked at some distance from the house 
of George Kalitas.  PC Sgt. Blones also went to the still smouldering 
house of George Kalitas and recovered twenty-nine (29) spent cartridges 
of various calibers and a mutilated slug, which he turned over to the PC
 Company investigator.  An alarm was, likewise, flashed to intercept the
 Buick car and apprehend its occupants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> 
</p><p>
At about 3:00 o'clock in the afternoon of July 3, 1966, Pat. Bonifacio 
Daño of the Davao City Police Department, received a telephone call from
 the Sasa Police Precinct that the wanted car was spotted going towards 
Davao City.  Pat. Daño and two (2) companions boarded a jeep to 
intercept the car, and at Bajada, near the EMCOR, they saw the car stop 
and a man with a sack alighted therefrom.  They gave chase, but the car 
sped away.  They then tried to run after the man with the sack, but the 
man threw the sack away and disappeared in the tall cogon grasses.  They
 recovered the abandoned sack and found it to contain a pistolized 
carbine, a .45 cal. pistol, with several rounds of ammunition, a barong 
tagalog, four (4) flashlights, and a pair of gloves.  The next day, July
 4, 1966, a police team saw the wanted car parked the in corner of 
Monteverde and Guerrero Streets, in front of the Cosmopolitan Funeral 
Parlor, in Davao City.  They found the accused Angel Dy in­side car who,
 when asked who the owner of the car was, pointed to Onting Biruar at 
the Kingston Hotel.  The policemen went to the hotel and found Onting 
Biruar to­gether with Romualdo Raboy and Edgardo Señeres whom they 
brought to the police headquarters for investigation.  Upon questioning,
 Angel Dy informed the police investigators that the car was driven by 
Abraham Lim on the night of July 2, 1966, and led a police posse to 
Barrios Obrero and Piapi, both in Davao City, in an effort to catch the 
said Abraham Lim.  But, they failed to find him.  Instead, they found 
the accused Ceferino Caturan in Barrio Piapi, who was nursing a bullet 
wound on his left upper leg.  From Piapi, Angel Dy brought the police 
team to a house in Toril, Davao City, where they finally found Abraham 
Lim in the company of Eugene Ruslin.  The policemen found a .45 cal. 
pistol, with seven rounds of ammunition under the pillow used by Abraham
 Lim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> 
</p><p>
Later, the police team arrested the accused Saturnino Galliano who was implicated in the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> 
</p><p>
The Buick sedan was turned over to the PC detachment and PC Sgt. 
Diomedes Cagas, upon inspection of the said car, recovered a .45 cal. 
pistol, with seven rounds of ammunition, hidden under the floor mat, 
near the gas pedal of the said car.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> 
</p><p>
As a consequence, Onting Biruar, Abraham Lim <em>alias </em>Titing Lim, Angel Dy <em>alias </em>Fred, Edgardo Señeres <em>alias </em>Broke, Romualdo Raboy <em>alias </em>Romy,
 Eugene Ruslin, and Saturnino Galliano were charged with Robbery in 
Band, Arson, and Robbery with Homicide and Physical Injuries before the 
Court of First Instance of Davao, in three (3) separate informations 
docketed therein as Crim. Case Nos. 9987, 9988, and 9989, respectively.
</p><p>
All the accused denied the commission of the crimes charged and, except 
for the accused Abraham Lim, interposed the defense of alibi.  The trial
 court summarized the evidence of the defendants, which they claim to be
 substantially correct, as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "1. <em>TESTIMONY OF ACCUSED ONTING BIRUAR </em></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> Defendant Onting Biruar testified that on June 28, 1966 he came 
to Davao City to renew the coastwise license of his motor boat; that he 
rode on his Buick (Electra) car; that he registered in a room at 
Kingston Hotel, Davao City and did not go out until the following day; 
that on June 29, and 30, 1966, he went to the Customs office to renew 
his license, but he failed to obtain his purpose; that on July 1, 1966 
Abraham Lim came to his hotel to borrow his car for the purpose of 
bring­ing his wife to a hospital to deliver; that he consented and gave 
his car; that as the car was not returned he became apprehensive and he 
began looking for it; that on the same day, he met Romualdo Raboy <em>alias </em>Romy and Edgardo Señeres <em>alias </em>Broke
 and one Sammy, driver of the Provincial Governor of Cotabato and asked 
them to help him find his car to which they acceded; that from that day 
they began the search and continued until the next day but in vain; that
 on July 3, he (Onting Biruar) was apprehended by the D.C.P.D. Commando.
  Unit in his hotel on a charge that his car was used in the commission 
of the crimes charged herein at Limot, Mati.  Later, he corrected a 
mistake that it was on July 4 when he was arrested and not July 3.  It 
was explained to him that his involvement with other accused lies solely
 in his being the owner of the car subject of the present inquiry; that 
he admitted that he was taken at the P.C. barracks where he was 
investigated by Sgt. Abalayan. </p>

at the same time he drew his own 22 caliber magnum pistol and pointed at
 the back of Kalitas head and dragged him towards the main door; that

suspected to be the neighbors of Kalitas; that the old man was hit in

latter; that he just met for the first time Silvia Kalitas, Narciso 
Bauyot, Mosende and others on July 12, 1966 in the Muni­cipal Court of 
Mati; that it is not true that he participated in the commission of 
robbery, killing and arson as charged in the information; that he 
resembled the accused Ceferino Caturan. </p>

    8. <em>TESTIMONY OF CEFERINO CATURAN:</em> </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> Ceferino Caturan declared that on the second week of June he was
 brought to Davao City by his employer, co-accused Abraham Lim to assist
 the latter's wife to deliver in the hospital; that they came in Davao 
City in a PU car together with the wife of Abraham Lim, a maid and 
himself; that upon arrival they proceeded to the house of his uncle at 
Piapi, Davao City; that for about six months he was employed as a 
checker of Lim in his motor launch; that before the incident in question
 his master, Abraham Lim was engaged in the business of buying and 
selling coprax, corn and rice; that Lim returned to Cotabato and came 
back on June 29, 1966 and rejoined his wife at Piapi; that on June 30, 
he brought Lim's wife to the hospital; that they rode on a hired taxi 
because he was not able to borrow Onting Biruar's car; that Lim's wife 
delivered on June 30, 1966 at night; that on the follow­ing morning he, 
Abraham Lim and Angel Dy took their breakfast in a restaurant; that on 
the afternoon of July 2, 1966 at about one o'clock he was brought by 
Abraham Lim to Mati; that they have started from a restaurant with three
 (3) companions; that along the way they picked up six other persons at 
Bajada; that he cannot see any of them in the Courtroom;  that at the 
start he did not know the purpose of Lim in going to Mati, now he knows 
that it is to rob a certain house in Mati; that upon reaching Mati they 
refueled in a gasoline station and went to eat in a restaurant; that 
they met one Angelo Montero there who invited Lim to go inside; that 
after eating they left with Montero guiding them until they reached a 
certain place where the car could no longer proceed due to bad road; 
that he received instruction to guard the car; that all the riders left 
and went towards certain direction; that after some time he heard 
successive shots coming from some distance; that at about two o'clock 
the following morning (July 3) two of his companions returned; that one 
of them wounded; that one of them shot him hitting his thigh; that 
half-hour later the bigger group with Abraham Lim arrived; that they 
started for Mati and from there they proceeded to Davao City passing at 
Kingking bridge where two or five of their companions got off the car; 
that they arrived at Davao City on July 3, 1966 at about 3:00 p.m.; that
 on July 4, 1966 he was apprehended by the Commando Police and brought 
to the P.C. barracks, Davao City where his affidavit (Exh. 'HH') was 
taken by Sgt. Almazar; that he did not sign it after it was typewritten 
but only on the following day after his wound was operated in the Davao 
General Hospital; that while he was confined in said hospital, Fiscal 
Angel Matondo arrived, but before he came he has already signed it; that
 he was weak and not feeling well when he signed his affidavit before it
 was explained to him. </p>
    <p>
        On cross examination he declared that one of those 6 men who 
joined them in the car brought a sack wrapped in Manila paper; that 
Abraham Lim is the one who drove the car going to Mati; that he did not 
talk with him during the trip in going to and on return.
    </p>
    <p>
        This witness (Caturan) was confronted with his answer to 
question 17 of his affidavit (Exh. 'HH') wherein he stated that he saw 
six of his companions being armed with pistol of different calibers and 
one carrying carbine and Abraham Lim carried his own .45 caliber pistol.
  Caturan explained that it is true that he saw his companions carry 
firearms, but it was during that time when they returned to the car from
 the place where they went.  (t.s.n., p. 735, Barlaan)
    </p>
    <p>
      This statement refers to that incident when the car stopped to a 
certain place when it could no longer proceed due to bad road, where all
 the riders except Caturan went off the car and came back later after 4 
or 5 hours covering a period from July 2 at about 10:00 at night to 2 or
 3 o'clock early morning of July 3, 1966.

  <p> 9. <em>TESTIMONY OF EDGARDO SEÑERES:</em> </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> Defendant Edgardo Señeres testified that he came from Cotabato 
City and arrived at Davao City on June 28, 1966 riding on a CBC bus; 
that he had no companion; that his purpose in coming to Davao City is to
 deliver shrimps for sale in a place near the public market at 
Bankerohan; that upon arriving he proceeded to his aunt's house at 
Washington Street and stayed there continuously for 5 or 6 days; that he
 knew accused Onting Biruar, but not Romualdo Raboy, Eugene Ruslin, 
Ceferino Caturan, Angel Dy and Saturnino Galliano; that on his way to 
CBC station on July 2, 1966, Onting Biruar saw him passing his hotel and
 called him; that he asked him to help in looking for his car which was 
borrowed by someone and was not returned; that he agreed; that they have
 started the search but they could not find it on that day; that from 
that time he lodged in Kingston Hotel with Onting and Romualdo Raboy; 
that on July 4, 1966 in the morning he was apprehended by the Davao City
 Police together with Onting Biruar and Romualdo  Raboy; that he did not
 know the cause of his arrest; that they were brought to Agdao, then 
transferred to the office of the detective division and finally to the 
P.C. barracks; that he was investigated there; that he was maltreated by
 the P.C. soldiers at the time he signed his affidavit; that he just met
 Ceferino Caturan, Angel Dy and Abraham Lim there; that he met Galliano 
at Mati; that he was detained together with others at the P.C. barracks 
at Mati on July 6, 7 and 8, 1966; that he did not go to Limot, Mati on 
July 2 or July 3, 1966; that he always was in Davao City during those 
days; that he denied statements of Narciso Bauyot; that he was seen in 
the house of Kalitas on the night of July 2, 1966; that he denied the 
statement of Mosende that he was one of the two men who robbed his house
 on same day; that the first occasion he met Romualdo Raboy was in P.C. 
barracks, so also Ceferino Caturan, Angel Dy and Eugene Ruslin; that he 
is known as Broke; that he knows Onting Biruar for he used to deliver 
crabs to him; that he does not know Fiscal Matondo; that his affidavit 
taken by the P.C. (Exh. 'N') has been extracted by force and duress."
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
The trial court, however, rejected the denials and excuses of the 
defendants and found that all of them, except Onting Biruar, the owner 
of the Buick car used in the commission of the crimes, and Eugene 
Ruslin, who was found sleeping with Abraham Lim in Toril, Davao City, 
when the said Lim was arrested by a police team, did, in fact, actively 
participate in the commission of the crimes complained of, and that 
their claims that they were elsewhere when the crimes were committed are
 un­availing against their positive identification by the witnesses for 
the prosecution who testified in a natural and straightforward manner 
and had no motive or reason to pervert or suppress the truth or testify 
falsely against them.
</p><p>
We have examined the record of the cases with great care and found no 
convincing reason to disturb the findings of the trial court that the 
accused were t perpetrators of the offenses charged.  The claim of 
Abraham Lim that he went to the house of George Kalitas to collect what 
the latter allegedly owed him is improbable and not worthy of belief.  
The following observations of the trial judge is more logical and 
consistent with human conduct:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "(3)  Referring to improbabilities and inconsistencies of the 
defendants' statements, Abraham Lim declared that his purpose in going 
to the late Kalitas' house that night in question was to collect 
accounts from the deceased.  If this is true, why did he bring along no 
less than four armed men with him and made demand at about midnight in 
the dwelling of Kalitas?  He admitted in cross examination that by 
chance he met Kalitas in a bus while he was on his way for Mati in 1965;
 that being an old man he could trust Kalitas and he advanced to him 
P15,600.00 as capital for their business. </p>
  <p> "If he could trust the late Kalitas with such big amount, why did 
he make that demand in the presence of armed men who made use of force 
and terror to attain their aim? </p>
  <p> "Again he related that on demanding payment of the debts, Kalitas 
was irked and he drew his pistol and aimed at Abraham Lim but the latter
 in turn grabbed it and drew his own 22 caliber magnum pistol and grazed
 it at the back of Kalitas head and then dragged him outside.  In the 
ensuing scuffle he lost the receipt of the said loan of P15,600.00 and 
also a notebook containing an entry of their transaction. </p>
  <p> "This is another brand of Lim's statements which is not only 
improbable and unnatural but is outright incredible.  Kalitas was an 
old, sickly man who was alone facing a menacing group of armed men who 
shot their way to his bedroom.  Would he, in his senses dare to provoke 
them in that manner? </p>
  <p> "At least two inmates of the house declared that he was already 
shot during the first burst of gunfire coming from outside the house and
 before the defendants came up.  This seem to be true because he was 
carried by two of them towards the main door and Lim admitted that they 
dragged him outside.  How could Kalitas drew his pistol when he was 
severely wounded and could not even talk. </p>
  <p> "Abraham Lim continued his story by stating that when Kalitas was 
brought outside, he was shot at the upper part of his body by others 
whom he suspected to be Kalitas' neighbors and yet he was able to shout 
at his men calling them to surrender and in fact, Mosende, Aguedo and 
four others surrendered to Abraham their respective firearms consisting 
of one carbine and five pistols which he identified in the courtroom.  
If his story is true, then no other logical conclusion can be drawn 
therefrom except that Abraham Lim and his men went to Kalitas' house on 
that night in question to fight, plunder and subdue Kalitas and his 
neighbors and in fact, according to him, they succeeded in forcing them 
to surrender thru Kalitas not only their persons but also their arms, 
but the Court would prefer to believe that a sham story of this nature 
is rather false, exaggerated and unbelievable because if Kalitas was 
really shot at a vital part of his body he could not have talked and 
moved, how then could he shout?  Granting arguendo that Kalitas shouted 
at his men to surrender, the latter, following the natural instinct of 
self-preservation would flee from the scene of the crime and would not 
give up their arms and persons to such ruthless and dangerous foe under 
that horrible circumstances of firing, killing and burning of house.  
There is no evidence that they were cornered or trapped in such a tight 
situation that no other remedy could be availed of except to surrender… 
If Lim's story is to be accepted the Court cannot find good reasons to 
justify him to capture Kalitas and his neighbors if his purpose is only 
to collect debts."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Besides, the attack on the credibility of the witnesses for the 
prosecution is based upon trivial matters.  Thus, counsel for the 
accused claims that the testimony of the prosecution witness Alfredo 
Matiga is not credible since the said witness even failed to recall, 
during his cross-examination, the number of the house where he was 
living and his birthdate.  It should be noted, however, that the said 
witness testified to only one detail, and that is, the fact that he saw 
the Buick car of Onting Biruar refueling at a gasoline station in the 
poblacion of Mati on the night of July 2, 1966, which fact is admitted 
by the accused Abraham Lim and Ceferino Caturan.
</p><p>
The testimony of Narciso Bauyot is also assailed on the ground that he 
signed his sworn statement before the Municipal Judge during the 
preliminary investigation without reading its contents, or without 
having them read and explained to him.  The conviction of the accused, 
however, was not based upon the sworn statement of the witness, but, on 
the collective testimony of Narciso Bauyot and the other prosecution 
witnesses who were subjected to a rigid cross-examination by the defense
 counsel during the trial of the case.  Besides, counsel failed to point
 out how the failure of this witness to understand the substance of his 
affidavit could have cast serious doubt on the guilt of the defendants.
</p><p>
The testimony of Gorgonio Mosende regarding the robbery in his house is 
also impugned as improbable because the said Mosende had testified that 
the accused Romualdo Raboy and Edgardo Señeres had announced their 
presence to Mosende before coining to the house, which they need not 
have done in order to rob the couple.  While it may be true that the 
accused had made known their presence to Mosende and that the latter had
 invited them to come up his house, Mosende did so because he thought 
that the callers were relatives of his wife.  It may have been unwise 
for Mosende to do so, but that does not render his story improbable 
con­sidering that the incident happened in the rural areas where the 
people are generally more hospitable.  Be­sides, Mosende is a poor man 
and he had no reason to expect that he would be robbed.  At any rate, 
the accused failed to impeach the testimony of the said Gorgonio 
Mosende.
</p><p>
Defense counsel also claims that no robbery was committed in the house 
of George Kalitas since there is no positive evidence presented to show 
the existence of the money allegedly taken from George Kalitas as well 
as the act of taking the same.  To support his contention that no money 
was taken from George Kalitas, counsel quoted a portion of the testimony
 of Silvia Mingming Kalitas, the wife of George Kalitas, which shows 
that the trunk where the money was kept was burned without its being 
opened.  Counsel further stated that the accused were apprehended within
 48 hours after the commission of the crime and yet the money stolen or a
 part thereof was not traced to, nor recovered from the accused, much 
less presented in court.
</p><p>
The contention is devoid of merit.  It had been positively established 
that the late George Kalitas had kept money in a trunk placed under his 
bed which the accused took on the night in question.  Martillana Kalitas
 categorically stated in court that her father, George Kalitas, had 
money, amounting to P65,000.00, which he kept in a trunk placed under 
his bed, because he had no trust in banks.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>
  Jessie Renopal testified that the accused broke open the said trunk 
with an axe on the night of July 2, 1966 and took the money placed 
inside.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>  Her testimony is 
corroborated by Silvia Mingming Kalitas, the wife of George Kalitas.  
Silvia Mingming Kalitas declared, however, that the money kept by her 
husband amounted to only P40,560.00 at the last counting.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> 
</p><p>
The testimony of Silvia Mingming Kalitas which was quoted by counsel for
 the accused, does not support his contention that no money was taken 
from George Kalitas on the night in question.  The testimony, adverted 
to, reads, as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "COURT: </p>
  <p>
    Q    Now, the Court wants to know whether that trunk which you have 
mentioned from which they got the P40,560.00 cash was taken before or 
after the house was set on fire.  Which is which?
  </p>
  <p>
    A     The fire was beginning, when it was advancing, that the time when the robbers came up.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q    Was that trunk from which the money was taken burned?
  </p>
  <p>
    A     It was burned; nothing is left, including the clothes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q    Before it was burned, was it already opened?
  </p>
  <p> A     Before it was burned, it was not yet opened.  It was they themselves who opened it."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It is clear therefrom that the accused opened the trunk and took the money placed inside before it was burned.
</p><p>
The argument of counsel that the amount stolen, or a portion thereof, 
should have been presented in evidence in order to make the asportation 
credible, is untenable.  Where the property stolen was not recovered, it
 would be impossible to present it in evidence.  Besides, there is no 
law nor jurisprudence which requires the presentation of the thing 
stolen in order to prove that it had been taken away.  It appears of 
record that there were other persons who participated in the commission 
of the offenses, but have not been charged.  Ceferino Caturan stated 
that there were 9 of them inside the car when they went to the house of 
George Kalitas on the night in question, and Abraham Lim testified that 
one of his companions in going to the house of George Kalitas on the 
said night was one Cesar Go.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>
  However, only 8 persons have been identified and charged and Cesar Go 
is not one of them.  The money could be with him.  Moreover, the accused
 were not apprehended immediately after the commission of the crimes, 
but a day later, or on July 4, 1966.  The accused could have disposed of
 the money before their arrest.  The failure of the prosecution to 
present in evidence the money stolen does not give rise to a reasonable 
doubt as to the guilt of the accused.
</p><p>
It is also contended by the accused that only one offense was committed 
since the robbery in the houses of Gorgonio Mosende and George Kalitas 
is one continuing offense, committed at the same time and on one 
occasion, and arising out of one criminal resolution, and the burning of
 the house of George Kalitas was the means to commit the crime of 
robbery.  Counsel cites the case of <em>People vs. De Leon,</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>  in support of his contention.
</p><p>
The contention is without merit.  In the case cited by counsel the 
defendant entered the yard of a house where he found two fighting cocks 
belonging to different persons and took them.  In this case, however, 
the accused, after committing the crime of robbery in band in the house 
of Gorgonio Mosende, went to the neighboring house of George Kalitas 
where they committed the crimes of Arson and Robbery with Homicide and 
Physical Injuries.  Obviously, the rule enunciated in the cited case 
cannot be made applicable since the herein accused performed different 
acts with distinct purposes which resulted in juridically independent 
crimes.  The Court also rejected the applicability of the cited case of <em>People vs. De Leon</em> in the case of <em>People vs. Enguerro,</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>
  and found the accused therein guilty of three (3) separate crimes of 
Robbery in Band, where the said accused, after committing a robbery in 
band in a store, went to another house where they committed a second 
robbery, and after committing it proceeded to another house where they 
committed a third robbery, all in the same barrio during the period from
 7:00 p.m. to 11 p.m. of the same day.
</p><p>
The burning of the house of George Kalitas was not the means in 
committing the robbery.  The evidence shows that the accused gained 
entry into the house of George Kalitas by breaking down the door with an
 axe and not by Durning the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> 
</p><p>
Finally, the accused Abraham Lim pleads that he had been denied the 
right to be present and defend in person and by attorney at every stage 
of the proceedings against him, that is, from the arraignment to the 
promulgation of the judgment.   He claims that the trial court proceeded
 with the trial of the cases despite his absence therefrom although he 
was charged with a capital offense.
</p><p>
The contention is devoid of merit.  The provisions of the Rules of Court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>
  securing to an accused person the right to be present in all criminal 
prosecutions against him must be understood as securing to him merely 
the right to be present during every stage of his own trial and not at 
the trial of another.  Since the accused Abraham Lim was present during 
his arraignment and jumped bail after giving his testimony in court and 
was absent only when his co-accused were presenting their evidence, none
 of which are prejudicial to the interest of the accused Abraham Lim 
whose attorney was present during all this time, and also present when 
the sentence was read to him, there was no infringement of the said 
defendant's right to be present at every stage of the proceedings 
against him.
</p><p>
The trial court, therefore, did not err in finding the defendants Abraham Lim <em>alias </em>Titing Lim, Ceferino Caturan <em>alias </em>Fred, Romualdo Raboy <em>alias </em>Romy, and Saturnino Galliano guilty of the crimes of Robbery in Band, Arson, and Robbery with Homicide and Physical Injuries.
</p><p>
The trial court found that the commission of the offenses charged was 
attended by the aggravating circumstances of nighttime, dwelling, use of
 motor vehicle, use of unlicensed firearm, and with the aid of armed men
 to ensure or afford impunity.  The use of unlicensed firearm, however, 
cannot be appreciated as an aggravating circumstance in Crim. Case Nos. 
9988 (Arson) and 9989 (Robbery with Homicide and Physical Injuries) 
since the special aggravating circumstance of use of unlicensed firearm 
is solely applicable to robbery in band under Art. 295 of the Revised 
Penal Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> 
</p><p>
This, notwithstanding, the death penalty imposed upon the accused Abraham Lim <em>alias </em>Titing Lim, Ceferino Caturan alias Fred, Romualdo Raboy <em>alias </em>Romy,
 and Saturnino Galliano in Crim. Case No. 9989, for Robbery with 
Homicide and Physical Injuries, is within the range of the penalty 
provided for by law.  However, for lack of the necessary affirmatory 
votes, the penalty imposed upon them by the trial court is hereby 
reduced to reclu­sion perpetua.
</p><p>
We also find that the trial court had inadvertently ordered the 
defendants to indemnify, jointly and severally, the heirs of the 
deceased George Kalitas the amount of P20,000.00 for the money stolen 
from him and not recovered in Crim. Case No. 9988, and the amount of 
P12,000.00 for the death of the said deceased in Crim. Case No. 9989.  
Crim. Case No. 9988, however, is a prosecution for Arson, for the 
illegal burning of the property of George Kalitas valued at P34,545.00, 
while Crim. Case No. 9989 is one for Robbery with Homicide and Physical 
Injuries where the evidence showed that the amount of P40,000.00 was 
taken from the house of George Kalitas.  The Solicitor General 
recommends that the defendants be ordered to indemnify the heirs of the 
late George Kalitas the amount of P34,545.00 in Crim. Case No. 9988, and
 the amounts of P12,000.00, for the death of the said deceased and 
P40,000.00, for the money stolen from him.
</p><p>
We further note that the penalty imposed upon the defendants in Crim. 
Case No. 9987 is less than what the law prescribes for the offense 
committed.  In said case, the defendants were found guilty of Robbery in
 Band, attended, among others, by the aggravating circumstance of use of
 unlicensed firearms and sentenced to suffer an indeterminate penalty of
 from two (2) years and four (4) months of <em>prision correccional</em>, as minimum, to eight (8) years and one (1) day of <em>prision mayor</em>,
 as maximum.  However, Article 295 of the Revised Penal Code, as 
amended, provides that if the robbery mentioned in pars. 3, 4 and 5 is 
committed by a band, the offenders shall be punished by the maximum 
period of the proper penalties, and Article 296 of same Code, as 
amended, also states that when any of the arms used in the commission of
 the offense be an unlicensed firearm, the penalty to be imposed upon 
the malefactors shall be the maximum of the corresponding penalty 
provided for by law.  Hence, the penalty to be imposed upon the 
defendants should be the maximum of the maximum period of the penalty, 
even without the concurrence of any other aggravating circumstance,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>  or an indeterminate penalty of from four (4) years and two (2) months of <em>prision correccional</em>, as minimum, to ten (10) years of <em>prision mayor</em>, as maximum.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the judgment appealed from should be, as it is hereby 
AFFIRMED, with the modification that the defendants Abraham Lim <em>alias </em>Titing Lim, Ceferino Caturan <em>alias </em>Fred, Romualdo Raboy <em>alias </em>Romy,
 and Saturnino Galliano are sentenced:  (1) to suffer an indeterminate 
penalty of from four (4) years and two (2) months of <em>prision correccional</em>, as minimum, to ten (10) years of <em>prision mayor</em>, as maximum, in Crim. Case No. 9987; (2) to suffer the penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua</em>
 in Crim. Case No. 9989; and (3) to indemnify, jointly and severally, 
the heirs of the deceased George Kalitas the amount of P34,545.00 in 
Crim. Case No. 9988, and the amount of P40,000.00 in Crim. Case No. 
9989, for the money stolen from the said deceased.  The indemnity for 
the death of George Kalitas is hereby increased to P30,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>  With costs against the accused Abraham Lim <em>alias </em>Titing Lim, Ceferino Caturan <em>alias </em>Fred, Romualdo Raboy <em>alias </em>Romy, and Saturnino Galliano in this instance.

</p><p>
<em>Fernando, C.J.</em>, in the result.
</p><p>
<em>Teehankee, J.,</em> no part.
</p><p>
<em>Aquino, J., </em>appellant Lim was tried properly because his 
absence at the trial was unjustified (Sec. 19, Art. 14). The minimum of
