				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The small estate left by a young military officer killed in
action on March 12, 1942, shortly after the invasion of the Philippines by the
Japanese armed forces -- consisting of his arrears in pay amounting to P11,377.43,
and the sum of P500.00 due as reimbursement of deposit -- is what has given
rise to the controversy at bar.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That
young man was Lt. Roberto <span class="SpellE">Tamisin</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was survived by his wife, Paula <span class="SpellE">Odejar</span>, whom he had married barely a year earlier.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the misrepresentation of the lieutenant's father (<span class="SpellE">Cecilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tamisin</span>), his brother (<span class="SpellE">Rufino</span>), and his sisters (<span class="SpellE">Eufrocina</span>
and Teresa) -- that he (Lt. <span class="SpellE">Tamisin</span>) had died single
-- the aforesaid amount of P11,377.43 due the latter as arrears in pay was
adjudicated and paid by the Judge Advocate General of the Philippines to the
former, his father and brother and sisters.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the reimbursable sum of P500.00, two (2) claims were filed
with the Office of the Judge Advocate General.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>One was submitted by the <span class="SpellE">Tamisins</span> (the deceased
officer's father, brother and sisters <span class="SpellE">aforenamed</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The other was presented by <span class="SpellE">Ambrocio</span> <span class="SpellE">Odejar</span> and <span class="SpellE">Gliceria</span> <span class="SpellE">Gibas</span>, the parents of
Paula <span class="SpellE">Odejar</span>, the lieutenant's widow.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They alleged that Paula had married Lt. <span class="SpellE">Tamisin</span> on <st1:date year="1941" day="14" month="4">April
 14, 1941</st1:date> and had herself died on <st1:date year="1944" day="8" month="4">April 8, 1944</st1:date> without having borne any children.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon these facts, they laid claim to their
daughter's conjugal share in her husband's estate.</p>

<p class="BODY">What the Judge Advocate General did was to file, on <st1:date year="1951" day="10" month="4">April 10, 1951</st1:date>, an action of <span class="SpellE">interpleader</span> with the Court of First Instance of Laguna,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
to compel the <span class="SpellE">Odejar</span> Spouses and the <span class="SpellE">Tamisins</span> to litigate their conflicting claims among
themselves.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
In this action, the <span class="SpellE">Odejars</span> set up a claim not only
for the P500.00 but also for one-half (1/2) of the deceased lieutenant's
arrears in pay (P11<span class="GramE">,377.43</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">During the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the case, or
more precisely on <st1:date year="1951" day="20" month="6">June 20, 1951</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Cecilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tamisin</span> died.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This prompted the <span class="SpellE">Odejars</span>
to institute a special proceeding, numbered 4492, for the settlement of the
estate of <span class="SpellE">Cecilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tamisin</span>,
so that they could prosecute their claim to recover their daughter's conjugal
share in the money left by Lt. <span class="SpellE">Tamisin</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">interpleader</span> suit resulted in a
judgment rendered on March 23, 1953 favorable to the <span class="SpellE">Odejars</span>,
sentencing the <span class="SpellE">Tamisins</span> to pay them P5,688.71 --
one-half (1/2) of P11,377.43 (Lt. <span class="SpellE">Tamisin's</span> arrears
in salaries) -- with legal interest thereon from March 6, 1951.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1953" day="10" month="4">April 10, 1953</st1:date>,
about two (2) weeks after rendition of the adverse judgment against him and his
co-parties, <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Tamisin</span>
sold to <span class="SpellE">Fermina</span> <span class="SpellE">Maluto</span>,
married to Isidro P. <span class="SpellE">Guico</span>, a parcel of land in
consideration of the price of P3<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Isidro <span class="SpellE">Guico</span> is the brother-in-law of <span class="SpellE">Eufrocina</span> <span class="SpellE">Tamisin</span>, <span class="SpellE">Eufrocina</span> being married to the <span class="SpellE">former's</span>
brother, Mauricio.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And as already
indicated<span class="GramE">,</span> <span class="SpellE">Eufrocina</span> is <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Tamisin's</span> sister.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Guicos</span>
registered the sale under Act 3344 on <st1:date year="1953" day="14" month="4">April
 14, 1953</st1:date>, and entered upon the possession of the lot.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Tamisins</span> then
filed a motion for new trial under date of <st1:date year="1953" day="29" month="4">April 29, 1953</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Whether or not they thereafter took possession of the lot is not
clear.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals says they
did; but the Trial Court found that "(the <span class="SpellE">Guicos</span>')
claim that they have been in possession of the property from the time of its
sale ** is not supported by evidence."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Odejars</span> learned of the sale and
forthwith filed an Omnibus Motion,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
adverting to the sale executed by <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Tamisin</span> in favor of <span class="SpellE">Fermina</span> <span class="SpellE">Maluto</span> and Isidro P. <span class="SpellE">Guico</span>,
describing it as "not only highly suspicious but also made in fraud of
creditors," and contending that that act of <span class="SpellE">Tamisin</span>
in thus disposing of the property "may be considered as one of the causes
for the execution of the judgment during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of this case."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
On these premises, the <span class="SpellE">Odejars</span> prayed that (1) the <span class="SpellE">Tamisins</span>’ motion for new trial be denied, and (2) so that
their rights under the judgment in their favor might be amply protected, that
said decision be forthwith executed against all the property of the <span class="SpellE">Tamisins</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court
granted the motion, by Order dated <st1:date year="1953" day="19" month="6">June
 19, 1953</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Instead of taking an appeal from the decision in the <span class="SpellE">interpleader</span> suit, the <span class="SpellE">Tamisins</span>
opted to file directly with this Court a petition for <i>certiorari</i> (with
application for preliminary injunction).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The step proved disastrous.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By
this Court's Resolution dated <st1:date year="1953" day="8" month="9">September
 8, 1953</st1:date>, the Trial Court's decision was held to have become final
and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> because no appeal, the proper remedy,
had been perfected <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, and the <span class="SpellE">Tamisins</span>' <i>certiorari</i> petition was summarily
dismissed for lack of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Trial Court then ordered execution of the judgment in the <span class="SpellE">interpleader</span> action, on motion of the <span class="SpellE">Odejars</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The provincial sheriff accordingly levied on
five (5) parcels of land belonging to the <span class="SpellE">Tamisins</span>,
including that sold to the <span class="SpellE">Guico</span> Spouses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A last ditch effort by the <span class="SpellE">Tamisins</span> to suspend the execution sale failed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They filed in the Probate Court, in Special
Proceeding No. 4492, a motion to suspend the sale of the five (5) parcels of
land on the ground that they were in <span class="SpellE"><i>custodia</i></span><i>
<span class="SpellE">legis</span></i>, but the Court denied the motion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The auction sale took place on <st1:date year="1954" day="11" month="6">June 11, 1954</st1:date>; the five (5) lots were
awarded to the <span class="SpellE">Odejars</span>, as highest bidders; and the
Sheriff executed in their favor the corresponding Certificate of Sale.</p>

<p class="BODY">More than a year afterwards, or on <st1:date year="1955" day="7" month="9">September 7, 1955</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">Tamisins</span>
betook themselves to the Court of Appeals to ask for the setting aside of the
judgment in the <span class="SpellE">interpleader</span> suit and the enjoinment
of the sale by the provincial sheriff of the properties levied on in
execution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Their action in that Court,
docketed as CA-G.R. No. 14357-R, was however dismissed for lack of merit on <st1:date year="1955" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1955</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Tamisins</span> were
far from finished, however.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 21, 1956, <span class="SpellE">Eufrocina</span> <span class="SpellE">Tamisin</span>, as <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> of the
estate of <span class="SpellE">Cecilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tamisin</span>
(Sp. Proc. No. 4492, <i>supra</i>), filed an action with the same Court of
First Instance of Laguna for the annulment of the execution sale of the <span class="SpellE">Tamisins</span>' five (5) parcels of land, above mentioned, and
for the <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> of the property, the action
being docketed as Case No. <span class="GramE">B-45.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This last action fared no better than the
others.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was dismissed, after
trial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The appeal later perfected to
this Court was also unsuccessful, this Court's judgment promulgated on <st1:date year="1960" day="31" month="5">May 31, 1960</st1:date> being that the <span class="SpellE">administratrix’s</span> action was barred by the prior judgment in
the <span class="SpellE">interpleader</span> suit, Civil Case No. 9401, <i>supra</i>,
and consequently the judgment appealed from should be affirmed.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1960" day="16" month="6">June 16, 1960</st1:date>,
the <span class="SpellE">Tamisins</span> having failed to redeem the five (5)
lots sold on execution to the <span class="SpellE">Odejars</span> within the
12-month <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period,<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a> the Laguna Provincial Sheriff, <span class="SpellE">Cecilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bituin</span>, executed in the <span class="SpellE">Odejars</span>' favor the final Officer's Deed.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">2</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Still the <span class="SpellE">Tamisins</span> refused to concede
defeat.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They filed two (2) other actions
with the Laguna Court of First Instance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">One,</span> instituted on <st1:date year="1960" day="9" month="11">November 9, 1960</st1:date> and docketed as Civil Case No. B-268,
prayed for the declaration of the nullity of the Sheriff’s deed of <st1:date year="1960" day="16" month="6">June 16, 1960</st1:date>, or, alternatively,
that they be allowed to redeem the lots sold.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The other, initiated on May 17, 1967 and numbered B-600, sought the annulment
of the auction sale in Civil Case No. 9401 and the inhibition of the <span class="SpellE">Odejars</span> from the possession of the property in question
pending <span class="SpellE">adjudgment</span> of the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The first was dismissed by the Trial Court,
the dismissal being afterwards affirmed by the Court of Appeals on <st1:date year="1964" day="12" month="3">March 12, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The second was dismissed by the Trial Court
on <st1:date year="1967" day="21" month="9">September 21, 1967</st1:date>, the
dismissal being also affirmed by the Court of Appeals on <st1:date year="1974" day="26" month="2">February 26, 1974</st1:date>, and the appeal thereafter
taken to this Court being also dismissed for lack of merit by resolution dated <st1:date year="1974" day="9" month="8">August 9, 1974</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In all these actions and proceedings, <span class="SpellE">Fermina</span>
<span class="SpellE">Maluto</span> and her husband, Isidro P. <span class="SpellE">Guico</span>,
to whom one of the five (5) lots in controversy was sold by <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tamisin</span> on <st1:date year="1953" day="10" month="4">April
 10, 1953</st1:date>, <i>supra</i>, took no part.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was not until <st1:date year="1975" day="12" month="3">March 12, 1975</st1:date> -- almost twenty-two (22) years
after they had purchased the lot from <span class="SpellE">Rufina</span> <span class="SpellE">Tamisin</span>, and after <span class="SpellE">Fermina</span> <span class="SpellE">Maluto</span> had died -- that Isidro P. <span class="SpellE">Guico</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Fermina’s</span> husband, and their two (2) children,
Emmanuel <span class="SpellE">Guico</span> and Lourdes G. <span class="SpellE">Amoranto</span>,
finally went to Court to vindicate their rights over the land sold to <span class="SpellE">Fermina</span> <span class="SpellE">Maluto</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They filed suit, described by them as one
"for annulment of documents and tax declaration and to quiet title to
property with damages," which was docketed as Case No. 236-C of the Court
of First Instance of Laguna.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Their
complaint named <span class="SpellE">Ambrocio</span> <span class="SpellE">Odejar</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Gliceria</span> <span class="SpellE">Gibas</span> as
defendants, but when it was discovered soon thereafter that these two had
already <span class="GramE">died,</span> the pleading was amended so as to
include said spouses' heirs as defendants, namely:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Ireneo</span> <span class="SpellE">Odejar</span>, <span class="SpellE">Librada</span> <span class="SpellE">Odejar</span> and <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Odejar</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Also named
as defendants were Atty. Juan <span class="SpellE">Baes</span>, the <span class="SpellE">Odejars</span>' counsel, to whom they had conveyed one-half (1/2)
interest <i>pro <span class="SpellE">indiviso</span></i> in the five (5) lots;
the provincial sheriff, <span class="SpellE">Cecilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bituin</span>;
and the Provincial Assessor of Laguna.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The complaint prayed that the sheriff's certificate of sale dated <st1:date year="1960" day="16" month="6">June 16, 1960</st1:date>, and the conveyance to
Atty. Juan <span class="SpellE">Baes</span> of an undivided interest over the
land sold to <span class="SpellE">Fermina</span> <span class="SpellE">Maluto</span>,
be declared null and void.</p>

<p class="BODY">The complaint was however dismissed after trial in a judgment
rendered on <st1:date year="1978" day="23" month="10">October 23, 1978</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Intermediate Appellate Court reversed the Trial Court's
judgment, in a decision promulgated on <st1:date year="1983" day="29" month="12">December
 29, 1983</st1:date>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a> The decision declared that -</p>

nor appellants were parties), and even conceding that the transaction might be <span class="SpellE">rescissible</span> under Art. 1381 (par. 4), Civil Code, still a <span class="SpellE">rescissible</span> contract is VALID TILL RESCINDED (judicially),
and since no action for such rescission was instituted within four (4) years
(in fact, no such action was ever filed) the transaction remains valid, with
consequent beneficial effects on <span class="SpellE">Maluto</span> and her
successors-in-interest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since at the
time of the levy and sale the lot did not belong to <span class="SpellE">Tamisin</span>,

any proceeding or intervene in any of the cases involving the property; they
filed suit to vindicate their rights over the land in question only on March

title and demanding recognition thereof on several occasions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Guicos</span>, for
their part, tacitly acquiesced, at least never presented any opposition, to
such assertions of title by the <span class="SpellE">Tamisins</span> until March
12, 1975, when it had already become apparent that the latter had exhausted
every possible recourse for the recovery of the property from the <span class="SpellE">Odejars</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All
indications, therefore, are that the ostensible conveyance was executed solely
to prevent the property of the <span class="SpellE">Tamisins</span> from being levied
