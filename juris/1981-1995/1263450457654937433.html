<p class="BODY">The principal defense of Roberto <span class="SpellE">Lagtu</span>
who was 31 years old when he testified in December, 1977, consists of his claim
that he is not "<span class="SpellE">Tikboy</span> <span class="SpellE">Lagtu</span>."
He said that his nickname is "Boy," by which he has been known in the
community (Bo. <span class="SpellE">Wawa</span>) since child­hood, and that he
has never been called "<span class="SpellE">Tikboy</span> <span class="SpellE">Lagtu</span>." He further stated that "<span class="SpellE">Tikboy</span> <span class="SpellE">Lagtu</span>" is none other
than his nephew <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Lagtu</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Roberto also offered an alibi.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He claimed that he was sleeping in his house at Bo. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Wawa</span></span><span class="GramE"> from </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="8"><span class="GramE">8:00 o'clock</span></st1:time><span class="GramE"> in the evening of </span><st1:date year="1975" day="19" month="10"><span class="GramE">October 19, 1975</span></st1:date><span class="GramE"> until </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="18"><span class="GramE">6:00 o'clock</span></st1:time><span class="GramE"> the next morning of </span><st1:date year="1975" day="20" month="10"><span class="GramE">October 20, 1975</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">.</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Lagtu</span>
was presented as defense witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
stated that he is the real "<span class="SpellE">Tikboy</span> <span class="SpellE">Lagtu</span>", and the nephew of the accused whose nickname
is "Boy."</p>

<p class="BODY">Rosario <span class="SpellE">Lagtu</span> and Romeo <span class="SpellE">Lising</span>, the wife and close friend of the accused
respectively, corroborated the testimony of Roberto and <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> gave credence to the evidence of
the prosecution, and concluded that Roberto <span class="SpellE">Lagtu</span> was
the "<span class="SpellE">Tikboy</span> <span class="SpellE">Lagtu</span>"
who stabbed and killed <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span>
and sentenced him as aforesaid.</p>

<p class="BODY">On appeal, the errors attributed by the accused-appellant to the
trial court, boil down to the question as to whether or not the identity of the
assailant of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span>
was convincingly and conclusively established.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have to answer the question in the affirmative.</p>

<p class="BODY">Undoubtedly, the ante-mortem statement, Exhibit B, of the victim
was properly admitted as dying declaration.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It referred to the cause and surrounding circumstances of the <span class="SpellE">declarant's</span> death.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And it was made under the consciousness of an impending death,
considering that the <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">declarant</span></span>
who was earlier found bathing in his own blood due to multiple stab wounds, <span style="">must have
naturally sensed the seriousness of his condition </span>which <span style="">eventually caused </span><span style="">his death.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">For the same reason, the revelation made by <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
<span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span> to Jaime <span class="SpellE">Caparas</span>
that "<span class="SpellE">sina</span> '<span class="SpellE">Tikboy</span> <span class="SpellE">Lagtu</span>'" stabbed him, also has the nature of a dying
declaration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both declarations are
therefore admissible in evidence as an exception to the hearsay rule.</p>

<p class="BODY">That "<span class="SpellE">Tikboy</span> <span class="SpellE">Lagtu</span>"
is no other than the accused Roberto <span class="SpellE">Lagtu</span> was
convincingly established by Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Anselmo</span> <st1:state><st1:place>Madrid</st1:place></st1:state>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:state><st1:place>Madrid</st1:place></st1:state>
categorically declared that he had known "<span class="SpellE">Tikboy</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lagtu</span>" personally, and for a long time, and that
"<span class="SpellE">Tikboy</span> <span class="SpellE">Lagtu</span>"
and Roberto <span class="SpellE">Lagtu</span> are one and the same person.</p>

<p class="BODY">Between the testimony of Patrolman <st1:state><st1:place>Madrid</st1:place></st1:state>
and those of Roberto and his witnesses, the former should command
credence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Patrolman <st1:state><st1:place>Madrid</st1:place></st1:state>
was a disinterested witness, and there is no showing that he had any ill motive
in testifying against Roberto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
other hand, the testimony of the defense witnesses, relatives and a close
friend of the accused, were naturally tainted with bias.</p>

<p class="BODY">What adds credibility to <st1:state><st1:place>Madrid</st1:place></st1:state>'s
assertion that he personally <span class="GramE">know</span> Roberto as "<span class="SpellE">Tikboy</span> <span class="SpellE">Lagtu</span>" is the fact
that in small rural communities, everybody knows almost everybody.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And so it was, <span style="">with a policeman who regularly performs his beat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More so, when it is considered that according
to Roberto <span class="SpellE">Lagtu</span> himself, he worked at the Interlink
Resort in Bo. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Wawa</span></span><span class="GramE">.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this connection,
it is significant that Roberto <span class="SpellE">Lagtu</span> even admitted
that he knew Patrolman </span><st1:state><st1:place><span style="">Madrid</span></st1:place></st1:state><span style="">, though he said that he knew </span><st1:state><st1:place><span style="">Madrid</span></st1:place></st1:state><span style=""> as "Max."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Additionally, the difficulty with Roberto <span class="SpellE">Lagtu's</span>
disclaimer is that he signed a manifestation dated <st1:date year="1975" day="3" month="11">November 3, 1975</st1:date>, addressed to the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Nasugbu</span> wherein he requested for a preliminary
investigation proper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Expediente</span>, p. 12.)</span> In that manifestation he
actually admitted that he was "<span class="SpellE">Tikboy</span> <span class="SpellE">Lagtu</span>" by referring to <span class="GramE">himself</span>
as Roberto <span class="SpellE">Lagtu</span> alias "<span class="SpellE">Tikboy</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lagtu</span>."</p>

<p class="BODY">It having been shown that "<span class="SpellE">Tikboy</span> <span class="SpellE">Lagtu</span>" and Roberto <span class="SpellE">Lagtu</span>
were one and the same person, the alibi of the accused has to fall because he
has been positively identified as the assailant of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
<span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> held that treachery attended the
slaying of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records, however, do not show facts upon
which a finding of treachery can be sustained.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And it cannot be presumed merely because the victim sustained 8 stab
wounds.</p>

<p class="BODY">Roberto <span class="SpellE">Lagtu</span> should, therefore, be
held guilty of homicide only.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although nighttime is alleged in the information, there is no evidence
that nighttime was purposely sought to facilitate the commission of the crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">There being no attendant aggravating nor mitigating circumstances
in the commission of the crime of homicide, <span class="GramE">the appropriate
penalty is</span> <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u> in its medium period.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
is hereby modified by finding the appellant Roberto <span class="SpellE">Lagtu</span>
guilty of the crime of homicide only and sentencing him to an indeterminate
penalty of seven (7) years of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <u>mayor</u>
as minimum to fifteen (15) years of <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u> as
maximum; it is affirmed in all other respects.</p>
