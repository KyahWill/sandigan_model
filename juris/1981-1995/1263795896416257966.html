<p>Some agreements deteriorate into misunderstandings, turning close friends 
into irreconcilable adversaries and sweet harmony into bitter discord.&nbsp; This is 
one of them.<br><br>On December 1, 1964, the petitioner through its 
Vice-President, Renato Arevalo, and respondent Andres Lao Hian Liong, executed a 
"Contract of Lease" covering the petitioner's property at Magsaysay Avenue, 
Baguio City, for a term of fifteen years, effective September 1, 1964.&nbsp; The 
monthly rental was fixed at P2,450.00 but in addition to this the respondent 
agreed to construct on the interior portion of the land leased a three-storey 
building of strong materials without right to reimbursement from the 
petitioner.&nbsp; The cost of the building was to be not less than P150,000.00, of 
which the sum of P45,000.00 would be contributed by petitioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>Prior to the expiration of the 
lease on August 31, 1979, and for some time thereafter, the parties entered into 
negotiations to fix a new rental but could not come to any agreement.&nbsp; In the 
end, on October 2, 1979, the petitioner served on the respondent a written 
notice to vacate the leased premises in view of the termination of their 
contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> When the respondent refused 
to comply, the petitioner filed a complaint for ejectment against him in the 
City Court of Baguio City.<br><br>Applying Article 1670 of Civil Code, the trial 
court held in favor of the defendant as follows:</p>
<blockquote>"In the case on hand, it is admitted that the 15-year lease contract 
between the parties expired on August 31, 1979.&nbsp; However, the defendant has 
continued occupying the leased premises thereafter and even to this day.&nbsp; And it 
was only on <em>October 2, 1979</em>, or after more than 15 days after the 
expiration of the original contract of lease, that he was given the requisite 
notice to vacate.&nbsp; It is, therefore, abundantly clear that under the law, an 
implied new lease had already set in when the plaintiff commenced its action for 
ejectment on November 19, 1979.&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>
<p></p></blockquote>
<p>The trial court also extended the period of the lease by five years from 
October 1, 1979, pursuant to Article 1670 in relation to Article 1687 of the 
Civil Code, and fixed the new rentals at P10,406.00 a month.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Both parties appealed.&nbsp; The 
petitioner contended that the original lease had not been impliedly renewed but 
automatically expired on August 31, 1979.&nbsp; The respondent, for his part, prayed 
for a longer extension of fifteen years, considering the nature of his business 
(a bazaar) and his investment therein.&nbsp; He also claimed that, prior to the 
execution of the contract, the petitioner had assured him he could stay 
indefinitely in the disputed premises.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>The Regional Trial Court of Baguio 
City affirmed the implied renewal of the lease but modified the appealed 
judgment by extending the lease for ten years from September 1, 1979, or until 
August 31, 1989.&nbsp; The respondent judge also increased the new rentals to 
P18,600.00 per month, effective September 1, 1979.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> A motion for reconsideration and for new 
trial was filed by petitioner but the same was denied.&nbsp; The petition then came 
to us with the following assignment of errors:</p>
<blockquote>"1) Respondent Judge, as well as the trial judge, erred in deciding 
the case at bar in a way not in accordance with law or with the applicable 
decisions of this Honorable Court, particularly its decision in <em>Roxas vs. 
Alcantara</em>, 113 SCRA 21.<br><br>2) Respondent judge, as well as the trial 
judge, erred in holding that there was implied renewal or <em><em>tacita 
reconduccion</em></em> despite the refusal of respondent Liong to agree to the 
increased rental demanded by petitioner prior to the expiration of the contract 
of lease.<br><br>3) Respondent judge, as well as the trial judge, erred in 
holding that there was implied renewal or <em>tacita reconduccion</em> despite 
the refusal of petitioner to accept payment of rentals from respondent Liong 
after the expiration of the Contract of Lease.<br><br>4) Assuming for the sake 
of argument that Article 1687 of the New Civil Code is applicable, the trial 
judge erred and gravely abused his discretion by extending the lease for five 
(5) years and respondent judge erred and compounded the grave abuse of 
discretion by extending the lease for ten (10) years.
<p></p>
<p>5) Respondent judge, as well as the trial judge, erred in admitting parol 
evidence with respect to the term of the lease.<br><br>6) Respondent judge erred 
in not granting a new trial for the admission in evidence of the building permit 
of the new building of respondent Liong which was issued after the decision of 
the trial court.<br><br>7) Respondent judge erred in not admitting in evidence 
or taking judicial notice of the Central Bank Certification dated August 21, 
1984 showing the three successive devaluations or depreciation of the Philippine 
peso after the decision of the trial court."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></p></blockquote>
<p>We address ourselves first to the submission of the respondent that the 
factual findings of the court <em>a quo </em>cannot be reviewed in these 
proceedings which have been filed under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court.&nbsp; That is 
not exactly correct.&nbsp; We note that, as the caption of the petition indicates, it 
was filed not only under the said rule but also as an appeal by 
<em>certiorari</em> under Rule 45, which, while generally limited to questions 
of law, nevertheless allows review of the judgment <em>a quo </em>when it is 
based on a misapprehension of facts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> 
We shall apply this exception and treat this petition as solely filed under the 
latter rule.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>It is not disputed 
that the original lease contract between the parties was only for fifteen years 
expiring on August 31, 1979.&nbsp; The private respondent nonetheless continued 
occupying the leased premises beyond that date and it was only on October 2, 
1979, that he was formally served with notice to vacate.&nbsp; What is in issue then 
is whether such continued occupancy was with or without the implied acquiescence 
of the petitioner.<br><br>The applicable provisions of Civil Code are the 
following:</p>
<blockquote>"Article 1669. If the lease was made for a determinate time, it 
ceases upon the day fixed, without the need of a demand."<br><br>"Article 1670. 
If at the end of the contract the lessee should continue enjoying the thing 
leased for fifteen days with the acquiescence of the lessor, and unless a notice 
to the contrary by either party has previously been given, it is understood that 
there is an implied new lease, not for the period of the original contract, but 
for the time established in Article 1682 and 1687.&nbsp; The other terms of the 
original contract shall be revived."
<p></p></blockquote>
<p>Under the second article, an implied new lease or <em>tacita 
reconduccion</em> will set in if it is shown that:&nbsp; (a) the term of the original 
contract of lease has expired; (b) the lessor has not given the lessee a notice 
to vacate; and (c) the lessee continued enjoying the thing leased for fifteen 
days with the acquiescence of the lessor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> This acquiescence may be inferred from 
his failure to serve a notice to quit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>The petitioner contends that the 
service of an express notice to quit is not the only way to prevent the implied 
renewal of the lease.&nbsp; Demanding a higher rental is also a manifestation of 
non-acquiescence if the lessee does not accept the rate demanded.&nbsp; In other 
words, failure of agreement on the new conditions of the lease results in an 
automatic notice to vacate upon the expiration of the original lease.<br><br>In 
support of this position, the petitioner relies on the case of <em>Roxas vs. 
Alcantara</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> where this Court 
declared:</p>
<blockquote>"x x x. Petitioner's letter of August 11, 1977 was a reminder to 
private respondent of the impending expiration of the lease contract.&nbsp; Exh. 'A', 
with a statement that was in effect an offer or proposal to renew the contract 
on the terms and conditions, namely:&nbsp; (1) that the rental would be P4,000.00 a 
month; (2) that three years advance rental should be paid by private respondent; 
and (3) that a 15% yearly increase in rental would be imposed.&nbsp; In other words, 
petitioner laid down the foregoing stipulations as conditions sine qua non for 
any subsequent contract that might be negotiated with private respondent.&nbsp; Thus 
clear from the letter, Exh. ‘C’, is that if private respondent were not 
agreeable to any or all of the new stipulations, there would be no renewal of 
the lease.&nbsp; Private respondent was to communicate his reply within fifteen days 
from receipt of Exh. 'C', absent which petitioner would take it to mean that his 
conditions were acceptable to private respondent and their contract renewed on 
the specified terms.&nbsp; However, private respondent's letter, Exh. 'F', evidently 
posted before the expiration of the period allowed within which to decide, did 
not give a categorical affirmative or negative answer to petitioner's 
proposition, and merely manifested the said lessee's desire to study the matter 
until end of the following month of September, 1977, or up to the termination of 
the then existing contract of lease, Exh. 'A'.&nbsp; Petitioner's failure to reply to 
the letter, Exh. 'F', can only be taken to mean that he acceded to the request 
for additional time.&nbsp; For the obvious reason that the lease contract (Exh. 'A') 
was expiring, it became more imperative for private respondent to make a final 
decision within and not later than the extended period which he asked for.&nbsp; 
Thus, when petitioner did not hear from private respondent at the end of the 
aforesaid month of September, private respondent ceased to have any legal right 
to possess and occupy the premises in question commencing the first day of the 
following month of October."
<p></p></blockquote>As we see it, Article 1670 applies only where, before the 
expiration of the lease, no negotiations are held between the lessor and the 
lessee resulting in its renewal.&nbsp; Where no such talks take place and the lessee 
is not asked to vacate before the lapse of fifteen days from the end of the 
lease, the implication is that the lessor is amenable to its 
renewal.<br><br>Where the lessor is unwilling in any event to renew the lease 
for whatever reason, it will be necessary for him to serve on the lessee a 
formal notice to vacate.&nbsp; As no talks have been held between the lessor and the 
lessee concerning the renewal of the lease, there can be no inference that the 
former, by his inaction, intends to discontinue it.&nbsp; In such a case, no less 
than an express notice to vacate must be made within the statutory 15-day 
period.<br><br>Applying these principles, the Court holds that the lease was not 
impliedly renewed in the instant case.<br><br>It is a matter of record that 
weeks before the deadline for the notice to vacate, the petitioner had already 
communicated to the respondent its intention to increase the rental. This 
increase had to be accepted by the respondent if he wanted the lease to be 
renewed.&nbsp; Significantly, in its letter to the respondent on September 18, 
1979,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> the petitioner once again 
rejected the latter's counter-proposal and categorically declared that the 
increased rental of P35,000.00 was "no longer negotiable." Since this was a 
reply to the respondent's letter of September 14, 1979,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> it is obvious that the increase in rental 
was notified to the respondent <em>on an earlier date</em>, and before the 
expiration of the original lease.<br><br>As of that date, the respondent was 
already being informed that he would have to vacate the leased premises on 
August 31, 1979, unless he was willing to pay the increased rental demanded by 
the lessor.&nbsp; Stated otherwise, the respondent was on that date — which was 
clearly before the statutory deadline — being served a conditional notice to 
vacate.<br><br>The formal notice to vacate sent by the petitioner to the 
respondent on October 2, 1984, was thus merely <em>a reiteration </em>of the 
implied demand made to him in its previous communications.&nbsp; The demand was that 
he vacate the leased premises if he could not accept the non-negotiable 
increased rental of P35,000.00 a month.&nbsp; If the petitioner saw fit to write that 
letter on the said date, which admittedly was beyond the 15-day statutory 
period, it was merely to repeat its insistence on the new rate as an 
indispensable condition to the renewal of the lease.&nbsp; The legal consequence of 
its rejection by the respondent was its obligation to vacate the leased premises 
because of the expiration of the lease.<br><br>Even if, as urged by the 
respondent, we should disregard the petitioner's letter of August 31, 1979, 
because it was not submitted at the trial, there nevertheless are the other 
letters which were formally offered in evidence by the respondent himself.&nbsp; 
These are Exhibit "5" and Exhibit "6", dated September 5 and 14, 1979, 
respectively, in which he rejected the petitioner's demand for the increased 
rental of P35,000.00.&nbsp; This could mean only that the demand was made 
<em>earlier</em> as the said letters were merely a <em>reaction</em> to such 
demand.&nbsp; These demands, as conditional notices to vacate if the petitioner's new 
rental was rejected, satisfied the requirement of Article 1670.<br><br>It should 
be noted that, after August 1979, the petitioner refused to accept the 
respondent's payments of the old rentals, demanding, as it had the right to do, 
the increased rate of P35,000.00.&nbsp; Such a stance negates the conclusion that it 
was willing to renew the lease under the original conditions and had, by its 
silence, impliedly agreed to the retention of all its provisions.&nbsp; In fact, far 
from being silent, the petitioner repeatedly insisted on the new rentals, and, 
to suit its actions to its words, flatly refused the tender of the old rentals 
by the respondent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>No less 
worthy of attention is the circumstance that in its letter of September 18, 
1979, the respondent counter-proposed a monthly rental of P27,000.00, which the 
petitioner rejected.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> It could be 
illogical to suppose that, having done this, the petitioner would later agree to 
the implied renewal of the lease for the original rental of only P2,450.00, 
thereby forfeiting the amount of P24,550.00 every month.<br><br>As the original 
lease contract expired on August 31, 1979, and was not legally renewed, it 
follows that the respondent has since then been in illegal possession of the 
leased premises.&nbsp; That unlawful detainer, which has lasted more than seven years 
now, during which he has retained all the rights he originally enjoyed as if the 
lease had been validly renewed, must be terminated immediately.<br><br>Coming 
finally to the monthly rentals to be paid by the respondent, it appears that 
between the rate of P35,000.00 demanded by the petitioner and the respondent's 
counter-proposal of P27,000.00, there is a difference of only P8,000.00.&nbsp; It is 
unfortunate that the disagreement could not be ironed out in the spirit of 
friendship that used to characterize the relations of the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> The respondent judge, for his part, using 
as basis a fair monthly rental value of P50.00 for every square meter of the 372 
square meter floor area of the property leased, fixed the monthly rental at 
P18,600.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Considering all 
the above circumstances, and by way of effecting a reasonable compromise between 
the parties, we hereby rule that the rentals to be paid for the use and 
occupancy of the leased premises beginning September 1, 1979, and until it is 
vacated by the respondent, shall be P30,000.00 per month, with interest at the 
legal rate.&nbsp; From the total amount due shall be deducted the sums judicially 
deposited by the respondent.&nbsp; We shall also fix the attorney's fee in the sum of 
P30,000.00, taking into account the efforts exerted by counsel in prosecuting 
this case, from the city court of Baguio and up to this Court.&nbsp; It is hoped 
that, being an experienced businessman, and with this pending litigation and its 
possible consequences in mind, he has taken the necessary measures to minimize 
the other expenses of his relocation if, as it is now, ordered by this 
Court.<br><br><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the decision of the respondent judge 
dated August 8, 1984, is set aside and a new decision is hereby rendered 
ordering respondent Andres Lao Hian Liong to:&nbsp; a) vacate the leased premises 
immediately; b) pay the petitioner monthly rentals in the amount of P30,000.00 
plus legal interest, from September 1, 1979, until the leased premises are 
surrendered to the petitioner; and c) pay an attorney's fee in the sum of 
P30,000.00 and the costs of this suit.&nbsp; The deposits made by the respondent in 
court shall be deducted from the total amount due from him.&nbsp; This decision shall 
be immediately executory and no motion for reconsideration shall stay its 
execution.
