<p class="BODY">On November 27, 1981, <span class="SpellE">Rey</span>, whose full

violation of Section 4, Article II, in relation to Section 2(<span class="SpellE">i</span>) of Republic Act No. 6425, as amended, in an information
which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about November 25, 1981, in the City of Manila,
Philippines, the said accused, not being authorized by law to sell, deliver,
give away to another or distribute any prohibited drug, did then and there
willfully and unlawfully sell or offer <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">for
</span>sale to another five (5) sticks of marijuana cigarettes, which is a
prohibited drug." (p. 1, Record)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In his defense, accused Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Broqueza</span>
testified that about <st1:time minute="30" hour="14">2:30</st1:time> in the
afternoon of <st1:date year="1981" day="25" month="11">November 25, 1981</st1:date>
while he was gathering wood and scrap iron, a man approached and asked him
where "Connie" was. He pointed to where Connie resides and inquired
of<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt"> </span>the man why he was looking
for Connie. The man requested him to deliver a ten-peso bill to Connie without
telling him what the money was for. He obliged and went to the place of Connie
who, after receiving the money, gave him something wrapped with a piece of bond
paper and instructed him to deliver it to the man. Thereafter, he was placed
under arrest by the policemen whom he had never seen before.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finding the accused Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Broqueza</span>
guilty of the crime of "pushing" marijuana, a prohibited drug, the
trial court <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Exhibit D, which appears to be an
extra-judicial confession of the accused, is not questioned. It contains
details which could not have been known to the investigator who took the
statement. For instance, it is only he who could have known the existence of 'Connie',
the alleged source of the marijuana cigarettes.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>The claim that he was asked to deliver P10.00
to 'Connie' after pointing to the residence of the latter is hardly believable.
He claims that he was engaged in gathering scrap iron. Why would he consent to
deliver P10.00 to 'Connie' when he <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">has </span>already
pointed to 'Connie's' residence and the man who inquired already knew the
place?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3. <span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>Even granting for the sake of argument that he
was not the owner of the marijuana as the defense would want to make it appear,
yet, he is covered under the definition of 'pusher' under Sec. 2(m), Art. II,
R.A. No. 6425, which provides as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘Pusher' refers <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">to </span>any
person who sells, administers, delivers or gives away to another, on any terms
whatsoever, or distributes, dispatches in transit or transports any dangerous
drug or who acts as a broker in any of such transactions, in violation of this
Act.</p>

<blockquote>"In fine, the Court is fully convinced that the prosecution
has established beyond peradventure of doubt that the accused has delivered
without authority from the law, and for purposes of a sale, five sticks of <span class="SpellE">handrolled</span> marijuana cigarettes, which are prohibited
drugs, to P/Woman <span class="SpellE">Opeñano</span> and for which he must be
punished in accordance with law.'' (pp. 6-7, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Not satisfied with the
finding of guilt, <span class="SpellE">Broqueza</span> appealed to Us, claiming
that the trial court committed (1) grave and reversible error in rendering
decision based mainly </span>on the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">weakness
of the evidence for the defense; (2) an error in giving undue credence to the
highly incredible evidence for the prosecution; and, </span>(3) <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">grave error in finding the accused-appellant
guilty as charged and in not acquitting him even on the ground of at least
reasonable doubt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Our review of the records
and of the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses </span>fails <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">to leave that degree of moral certainty
sufficient to overcome reasonable doubt favoring appellant's innocence and to
let the mind rest </span>easy <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">upon the
certainty </span>his <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">guilt. When the
evidence is inconsistent with human experience the same cannot be considered a
sufficient basis upon which to rest a judgment of conviction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">When the Constabulary
Anti-Narcotics Unit (CANU) detachment was informed that a certain "<span class="SpellE">Rey</span>," was a pusher of marijuana cigarettes, a team was
immediately organized and it proceeded to the place at Milagros Street, Sta.
Cruz, Manila, without first conducting <span class="GramE">a surveillance</span>
therein. Policewoman Lolita <span class="SpellE">Opeñano</span> and the informant
walked along the street until they were allegedly met by herein appellant who
asked if they wanted to buy marijuana cigarettes. The policewoman answered in
the affirmative and upon being informed that five (5) sticks would cost P10.00
she immediately gave him the marked ten-peso bill. Appellant allegedly placed
the </span>money <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">inside his pocket and
left, saying he would get marijuana cigarettes from one "Connie."
Considering that CANU members are supposed to be experts </span>in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">apprehending persons selling and/or smokers
of marijuana, it is perplexing why not one of them followed appellant so that
they could apprehend also the supplier thereof. Appellant was back in five
minutes with the five (5) sticks of marijuana cigarettes and upon delivery
thereof to the policewoman, the members of the team closed in and arrested him.
Now, why did they immediately bring appellant to the office for investigation,
instead of ordering him to bring them to the place where he got the marijuana
so that they could arrest its supplier?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">While it is true that
upon laboratory examination of the five (5)</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
17.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">sticks of cigarettes
they were found to be positive for marijuana, why did the team or any member
thereof not recover the marked ten-peso bill which was handed to </span>the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">appellant? Further, why was appellant not
examined regarding the presence of <span class="SpellE">flourescent</span> powder
if he really did receive the marked money? When the team left for Milagros
Street to meet the pusher, they </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">did
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">not </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">know </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">that he would sell five (5) sticks of cigarettes only and that they
would cost ten pesos. </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">How </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">come that they were ready with the marked
ten-peso bill?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Anent
the alleged extra-judicial confession (Exhibit "D"), given by
appellant Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Broqueza</span> during the custodial
police interrogation, the constitutional provision (Section 20, Article IV) was
not followed. Said provision of the constitution states: "no person shall
be compelled to be a witness against himself. Any person under investigation
for the commission of an offense shall have the right to remain silent and </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
