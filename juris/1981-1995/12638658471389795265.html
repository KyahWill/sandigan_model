of which had been submitted <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">since </span>1979

<blockquote>“2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Cases calendared for hearing during the
month of June 1989 to December 1989, show that for the month of October 1989,
only one (1) hearing was conducted; for November, only one (1) hearing also;
for December, also one (1) hearing; for the month of January 1990, only two (2)
days have been set for trial hearing; for the month of February 1990, only one
(1) and for the month of August 1989, it appears that no case has been disposed

records in his office that he has been solemnizing several marriages between
Filipino citizens and Americans or foreigners on an average of about three (3)
marriages a day aside from notarizing public documents for a fee, his monthly
reports for 1989 to the Statistic Division of this Court do not show any
marriage solemnized or document notarized by him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“4.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The accumulated caseload of 182 cases has

was full of intrigue and inaccuracy, which lead me to say I could no longer
stay, and happy working with them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That
even before this controversy, I have nursed the idea of resigning.” (p. 3,

<p class="BODY">Considering all the allegations, issues and arguments raised in
the complaint and in the Comment and the resignation letter of respondent Judge
dated <st1:date year="1990" day="26" month="1">January 26, 1990</st1:date>, the
Court finds Judge <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Lansang</span>
GUILTY of the charges complained of.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His
actuations, practices and conduct are unbecoming of a judicial officer; his
acts of commission and omission having been committed through <u>admitted</u> <u>negligence</u>
on his part, failure to report to the Supreme Court or to the Court
Administrator, his grievances against his own Clerk of Court against whom he
never filed <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">any </span>formal
complaints regarding the latter’s alleged irregularities; his apparent
acceptance of the accuracy of the reports submitted by his Clerk of Court; and
unmitigated failure to ask for administrative remedies from the Supreme Court
and Court Administrator and the existence up to now of 182 pending <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">cases </span>which according to the Court
Administrator had been <u>submitted</u> for decision, and not merely pending
trial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court likewise Resolved <u>not</u>
to accept such resignation (acceptance of resignations from the judiciary being
a prerogative of the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>),
but instead to consider him RETIRED, with all benefits and gratuities
forfeited.</p>
