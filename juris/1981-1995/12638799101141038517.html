duties as Senior Supervisor at the Manila International Airport, Ms. <span class="SpellE">Minda</span> Santiago, a <span class="SpellE">Mabuhay</span> Club
member (Travel Agent) and a long time acquaintance (sic), approached (De <span class="SpellE">Veyra</span>) and inquired about the planned trip of her husband
to the United States.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(De <span class="SpellE">Veyra</span>) informed Ms. Santiago that her husband's trip was
not yet definite since it might <span class="SpellE">distrupt</span> (sic) their
planned vacation tour to Europe sometime in October 1986 where they will both
avail of her trip pass privilege from the Company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A trip pass privilege is a privilege to
travel via the Company's airlines free of charge or at certain discounted rates
granted to qualified employees and their relatives.</blockquote>

<blockquote>5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon learning that (De <span class="SpellE">Veyra's</span>)
husband's trip was still tentative, Ms. Santiago offered to help the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> husband to go on a quick U.S. trip.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She also offered to secure first class <span class="SpellE">accomodation</span> (sic) for both (De <span class="SpellE">Veyra</span>)
and her husband when she found out that the former was only entitled to a
maximum of executive class <span class="SpellE">accomodation</span> (sic) as a
senior supervisor representing that she was close to the Company's top
executives and could easily get the required authorization for the upgrading of
their <span class="SpellE">accomodation</span> (sic).</blockquote>

<blockquote>6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Relying on her representations and it being ac
(sic) common knowledge that she has strong, (sic) influence in the Company and
with high government officials, and aware that upgrading of trip pass <span class="SpellE">accomodations</span> (sic) of even the non-managerial employees is
a common practice in the company, (De <span class="SpellE">Veyra</span>) sent her
trip pass No. 883125 to Ms. Santiago's Office (Sanyo Travel) for her Husband's
(sic) ticket on 18 August 1986.</blockquote>

<blockquote>7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometime in the afternoon of 19 August 1986,
Ms. Santiago phoned to inform (De <span class="SpellE">Veyra</span>) that her
husband's ticket was ready for pick up.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(De <span class="SpellE">Veyra</span>) had the ticket picked-up the
following morning, 20 August 1986.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
the same date (De <span class="SpellE">Veyra's</span>) husband used ticket No.
079-4401 2138460/461 with priority classification Y/F (First Class) on his trip
to the U.S.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, on his return to
Manila on 26 August 1986, he was <span class="SpellE">accomodated</span> (sic)
only in an economy class.</blockquote>

<blockquote>8.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometime after her husband's return to Manila,
(De <span class="SpellE">Veyra</span>) was able to talk to Ms. Santiago where she
narrated to the latter the <span class="SpellE">embarassment</span> experienced
by her husband on his return trip to Manila when he was given only an economy
class <span class="SpellE">accomodation</span> (sic) despite his ticket bearing
the Y/F status.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After having been
informed of this, Mrs. Santiago promised (De <span class="SpellE">Veyra</span>)
that it will not happen again and offered to have her own <span class="SpellE">accomodation</span>
(sic) upgraded to first class for her emergency trip to Washington, U.S.A.</blockquote>

<blockquote>9.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, relying on her representations, (De <span class="SpellE">Veyra</span>) sent her trip pass RRO No. 874047 dated 8 September
1986 to Ms. Santiago's Office as what she had earlier done with respect to
TP/PRO No. 883125 dated 18 August 1986.</blockquote>

for pick up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(De <span class="SpellE">Veyra</span>)
then instructed her driver to get said ticket.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On 14 September 1986, (De <span class="SpellE">Veyra</span>) used her
ticket No. 079-440/2234490/489 to the U.S. and (came) back to Manila on 26
September 1986, both via first class <span class="SpellE">accomodation</span>
(sic).</blockquote>

to the position of Duty Manager <span style="">by </span>higher
management in recognition of her consistent hard work and efficiency despite
the reluctance of her superiors Messrs. <span class="SpellE">Panlilio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Martirez</span> (who) were forced to sign (De <span class="SpellE">Veyra's</span>)
promotion since she was the most qualified among the contenders to the
position.</blockquote>

<blockquote>12.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suddenly, much to (De <span class="SpellE">Veyra's</span>)
surprise, she received a copy of a Notice of Administrative Charge dated 26
August 1987 signed <span style="">by </span>Mr. Pedro <span class="SpellE">Martirez</span>, Jr. informing her that based on an investigation
conducted by the Company's Internal Audit and control (sic) Department, she and
her husband were found to have used trip passes which were falsified to reflect
a higher priority and space classification than what they were entitled to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the same Notice, she was informed that
effective upon <span class="SpellE">rer</span> (sic) receipt of the Notice, she
is being placed on preventive suspension since her continued employment poses a
serious and imminent threat to the life of her other co-employees and/or to the
property of the Company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She actually
received the Notice on 4 September 1987.<span style="">&nbsp;

<blockquote>13.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(De <span class="SpellE">Veyra</span>) was
placed under preventive suspension without giving her the opportunity to be
heard, therefore <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of her fundamental <span style="">righ</span>t<span style=""> </span>to due process and in utter disregard of the pertinent
provisions of the Company's Code of Discipline x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>;</blockquote>

apply <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> by accomplishing an application form
(p. 86, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Tickets are then issued against the trip pass
authorization.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the issuance <span style="">of </span>the ticket, the issuing clerk at
the ticket office writes on the blank portions of the audit coupon certain data
including the priority and travel classification code of the employee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Entries written on the audit coupon are
automatically reproduced by carbon copying on the succeeding flight
coupons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case of De <span class="SpellE">Veyra's</span> tickets, entries written on the audit coupons were
different from the entries written on the flight coupons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The priority code first written on the audit
coupons was Q/G4/F or first class.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
was reproduced on the flight coupons.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, "Y" was superimposed an "F," and
"C" was added after "Y" but only on the audit coupons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, as a result thereof, the priority code
on the audit coupons seemed to be Q/G4/YC to make it appear to the accountants <span style="">of </span>PAL that it conformed <span class="GramE">with</span> the travel priority of De <span class="SpellE">Veyra</span>
appearing on the travel authorization, which was Q/G4/YC or economy class (pp.
86-87, <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Rollo</span></u></span><span style="">).<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>As
regards De <span class="SpellE">Veyra's</span> husband, his priority
classification was S/H5/Y or economy class.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The audit coupons of his tickets did not indicate said code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, on the "Fare Basis" column
on the audit coupons, letter "Y" was written.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In contrast, the flight coupons of said
tickets showed priority code Q/F3/Y/F or first class written on the "Tour
Code" column.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the "Fare
Basis" column, a capital letter "F" was written following letter
"Y" and therefore read "Y/F." Priority Code Q/F3/Y/F
corresponds to the travel and space classification of employees and their
dependents <span class="GramE">who</span> were given a seventy-five percent (75%)
discount of the regular fare.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since his
tickets reflected an "FOC" or free of charge, this was an indication
that he did not pay the discounted fare corresponding to the priority code
Q/F3/Y/F which he used in his travel (p. 13, <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Rollo</span></u></span><span style="">).<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Now, upgrading of priority and space classification, such as from
economy class to first class, must be authorized by designated company
officials through the issuance of a form referred to as special airport
concession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, in the said
authorized upgrading, entries on the tickets are not altered to reflect a
higher space entitlement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ticket
would still bear economy class entitlement but during the boarding process, the
upgrading would be effected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Special
airport concessions are issued only for valid reasons, namely, in favor of high
government officials and severely inconvenienced revenue paying passengers (pp.
25-26, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>According to De <span class="SpellE">Veyra</span>, a certain <span class="SpellE">Minda</span> Santiago of Sanyo Travel secured their first class
accommodations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Minda</span>
Santiago represented to them that she was close to <span class="SpellE">PAL's</span>
top executives and can easily get the required authorization for the upgrading
of their accommodations (p. 5, <u><span style="">supra</span></u><span style="">).<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Yet,
this defense was never substantiated by De <span class="SpellE">Veyra</span>
either by presenting <span class="SpellE">Minda</span> Santiago personally to
testify or submitting her affidavit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>More importantly, there was no <span style="">authorization
</span>for the upgrading of their accommodations, at all.</p>

<p class="BODY">The administrative charge against De <span class="SpellE">Veyra</span>
was based on her and her husband's <u>use</u> of trip passes which were <u><span style="">falsified</span></u><span style=""> </span>to reflect a higher priority and space classification than what
they were entitled to on vacation travel when the trip passes were issued (p.
91, <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Rollo</span></u></span><span style="">).<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>It
is an established fact that the De <span class="SpellE">Veyras</span> used first
class trip passes, but what is disputed is whether or not their trip
passes/tickets were falsified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The NLRC
and De <span class="SpellE">Veyra</span> limit the definition of the word
"falsify" either to tamper with or alter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is not so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The word refers likewise <span class="GramE">either
to</span> represent falsely, distort or violate the truth (Webster's Third New
International Dictionary, 1986 Edition, p. 820; see Black's Law Dictionary,
1987 Edition, p. 542).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch as their
tickets did not speak the truth, those were undoubtedly falsified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having been employed with the company for
twenty (20) years and familiar with its policies and procedures, De <span class="SpellE">Veyra</span> was, therefore, aware that in accordance with <span class="SpellE">PAL's</span> policy and in the absence of a valid authorization
for upgrading of priority and space classification, she and her husband were
entitled to economy accommodation only.</p>

<p class="BODY">Mention may be made of another circumstance which proves the
falsity of De <span class="SpellE">Veyra's</span> tickets.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In relation to her entitlement to travel
benefits, she secured a Philippine Tourism Authority Reduced Travel Tax
Certificate (p. 87, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>) entitling her to
pay a reduced travel tax of only P810.00.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This amount represents payment for economy travel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The certificate itself provided that it
referred only to economy class travel and not first class passage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The certificate was purportedly presented for
the purpose of <span class="SpellE">availment</span> of the reduced travel tax
privilege of airline employees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However,
the entries appearing on the bottom left portion of her tickets reflected a
travel tax payment of P1<span class="GramE">,350.00</span>, corresponding to
first class passage (pp. 86-87, <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Rollo</span></u></span><span style="">).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">In ruling that PAL has not proven the culpability of De <span class="SpellE">Veyra</span>, the NLRC ignored <span class="SpellE">PAL's</span>
ample evidence before it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It resolved
the controversy based on a shallow analysis thereof, which was supported by the
Solicitor General (p. 62, <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Rollo</span></u></span><span style="">):<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"At this point, it is necessary to discuss the procedures on
how plane tickets are actually issued by (PAL) x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A ticket booklet
consists of the audit coupon as the first page, and the succeeding coupons <span style="">constitute </span>the passenger coupon and
the agent's coupon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All entries in the
audit coupon are automatically reproduced in the succeeding coupons of the
ticket booklet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon issuance of the
ticket, the audit coupon is detached by the issuing clerk, which coupon goes to
the Company's Auditing Department.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
other coupons are given to the passenger and are detached upon checking in at
the counters for the particular flight and leg of journey involved.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Records reveal that what was tampered with was the audit
coupon by superimposing the letter "Y" over the letter "F"
and adding the letter "C" thereto.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, the other parts of the tickets given to (De <span class="SpellE">Veyra</span>)
were not tampered with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="">is, </span>therefore, misleading for (PAL) to
allege that (De <span class="SpellE">Veyra</span>) used tampered tickets.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As senior supervisor at the Manila
International Airport (De <span class="SpellE">Veyra</span>) had no participation
in the issuance of plane tickets.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
was not even personally present when the tickets were being issued by the
Company's ticket clerks and therefore could not have had any knowledge of the
alleged tampering of the Audit coupon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering also that there is not an iota of
evidence to establish (De <span class="SpellE">Veyra's</span>) participation in the
tampering of the audit coupons, her dismissal by (PAL) is illegal."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">While De <span class="SpellE">Veyra</span>
may not have known about the alteration performed on the audit coupons, she
cannot feign ignorance about the falsity of their tickets, as discussed
previously.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, it is not even
necessary to prove De <span class="SpellE">Veyra's</span> participation in the
falsification of their tickets.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is
material is their <u>use</u> of trip passes which were <u>falsified</u> to
reflect a higher priority and space classification than what they were entitled
to on vacation travel when the trip passes were issued, <u>supra</u>, which
served as the basis for PAL to have lost its trust and confidence on De <span class="SpellE">Veyra</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By and large,
this Court has continually recognized the right of the employer to dismiss an
employee on the ground of loss of confidence or breach of trust (Atlas
Consolidated Mining and Development Corporation v. NLRC, et al., G.R. No.
75755, November 24, 1988, 167 SCRA 758; San Miguel Corporation v. NLRC, et al.,
G.R. No. 50321, March 13, 1984, 128 SCRA 180; Central Textile Mills, Inc. v.
NLRC, et al., G.R. No. 50150, May 3, 1979, 90 SCRA 9; Valladolid v. <span class="SpellE">Inciong</span>, etc., et al., G.R. No. 52364, March 25, 1983, 121
SCRA 205; Dole Philippines, Inc. v. NLRC, et al., G.R. No. 55413, July 25,

85).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the mere existence of a
basis for believing that the employee has breached the trust and confidence
reposed on him by his employer is sufficient ground for dismissal (Sea-Land
Service, Inc. v. NLRC, et al., G.R. No. 68212, May 24, 1985, 136 SCRA
544).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More so, in the case of a
supervisor or other personnel occupying positions of responsibility, the loss
of the trust and confidence by their employer may justify their termination
(Associated Citizens Bank v. <span class="SpellE">Ople</span>, etc., et al., G.R.
No. L-48896, February 24, 1981, 103 SCRA 130; New Frontier Mines, Inc. v. NLRC,

<p class="BODY">Aside from finding that there was no legal cause for De <span class="SpellE">Veyra's</span> dismissal from employment, the NLRC also ruled that
her dismissal was arbitrary because she was not granted a hearing on the charge
against her, in total disregard of <span class="SpellE">PAL's</span> Code of
Discipline which, <u><span style="">inter</span></u><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>,
provides that (p. 65, <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Rollo</span></u></span><span style="">):<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As stated earlier, sometime in August, 1987, the Internal Audit
and Control Department of PAL conducted a review of the tickets issued by the
Interline Ticket Counter because of the uncovering of widespread fraud and
manipulation of tickets by several of <span class="SpellE">PAL's</span> employees
that resulted to their eventual termination from the firm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was on this occasion that said department
was able to confirm cases of tampering and fraudulent manipulation of official
documents, some of which involved the travel documents of De <span class="SpellE">Veyra</span> and her husband.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A memorandum was issued by the Vice President of the Internal Audit and
Control Department to this effect addressed to the Senior Vice President for
Customer Services Group.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On August 26,
1987, the Notice of Administrative Charge was sent to De <span class="SpellE">Veyra</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On September 11, 1987, she requested
additional time within which to study and evaluate her defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On September 18, 1987, her request was
granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was allowed until September
29, 1987 to file her answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
September 24, 1987, De <span class="SpellE">Veyra</span> submitted her sworn
statement wherein she admitted having used tickets bearing the upgraded
priority classification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She mentioned <span class="SpellE">Minda</span> Santiago as the person who arranged the upgrading of
their trip passes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On October 16, 1987,
De <span class="SpellE">Veyra's</span> services were terminated by PAL.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Taking into account these circumstances, it
cannot be said that De <span class="SpellE">Veyra</span> was denied
administrative due process of law simply because the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>
provision was not observed by PAL.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
is no violation of due process even if no hearing was conducted where a chance
to explain a party's side of the controversy was accorded to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is frowned upon is the denial of the
opportunity to be heard (Eden, et al. v. Ministry of Labor and Employment, et
al., G.R. No. 72145, February 28, 1990, 182 SCRA 840; <span class="SpellE">Asprec</span>

April 30, 1966, 16 SCRA 921).</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Since De <span class="SpellE">Veyra</span> admitted in her sworn statement
having used tickets bearing the upgraded priority classification; the
documentary evidence of PAL already proved the falsity of the tickets; and De <span class="SpellE">Veyra</span> was aware of this falsity, there was no necessity for
the parties to undergo the ritual of holding a hearing.</p>

<p class="BODY">To reiterate, there was a legal ground for <span class="SpellE">PAL's</span>
termination of the services of De <span class="SpellE">Veyra</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are not persuaded by the opinion advanced
by the NLRC that (p. 63, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>):</p>

<blockquote>"Even assuming, <span class="SpellE"><u>arguendo</u></span>,
that (De <span class="SpellE">Veyra</span>) was guilty still, the supreme penalty
of dismissal was greatly disproportionate to the offense imputed to her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After working for twenty (20) years with
(PAL), and receiving numerous commendations and promotions at that, (De <span class="SpellE">Veyra</span>) does not deserve the penalty of dismissal for the
violation of a company rule which, after all, is a common practice in the
company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This <span style="">is </span>not to condone the alleged misstep committed by (De <span class="SpellE">Veyra</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is merely
to point out that in the light of the surrounding <span class="GramE">circumstances,</span>
dismissal is too severe <span style="">a </span>penalty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</span></span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">In the first place, the statement that De
<span class="SpellE">Veyra's</span> violation of <span class="SpellE">PAL's</span>
rule is a common practice in the company is misleading because of lack of
proof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the second place, the fact
that De <span class="SpellE">Veyra</span> has worked with PAL for twenty (20)
years, if it is to be considered at all, should be taken against her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The infraction that she committed, <span class="SpellE"><u>vis-a-vis</u></span> her long years of service with the
company, reflects a regrettable lack of loyalty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Loyalty that she should have strengthened
instead of betrayed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If an employee's
length of service is to be regarded as a justification for moderating the
penalty of dismissal, it will actually become a prize for disloyalty,
perverting the meaning of social justice and undermining the efforts of labor
to cleanse its ranks of all undesirables (see Philippine Long Distance
Telephone Company v. NLRC, et al., G.R. No. 80609, August 23, 1988, 164 SCRA
