<p class="BODY">The issue in this petition is whether notices to adjoining owners

registered owner of a parcel of land located in <span class="SpellE">Canubing</span>,

Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>, filed a petition for the

She alleged therein that she is in possession "of the title subject matter
of" the petition but she, however, did not allege the reason why she asked
for the reconstitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its Order of <st1:date year="1986" day="4" month="11">4
 November 1986</st1:date> the trial court set the petition for hearing and
required its publication in the Official Gazette, which was done.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Required notices, <u>except</u> <u>to</u> <u>the</u>

<span style="">were given.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon prior authority of the trial court, reception of private
respondent's evidence <span style="">was </span>made
by the OIC-Branch Clerk of Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, on <st1:date year="1987" day="17" month="6">17 June 1987</st1:date>,
the trial court handed down an Order<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
which made the following findings of facts:</p>

<blockquote>"From the evidence adduced by the petitioner, it appears that
she <span style="">is </span>one of the vendees of a certain
parcel of land situated in <span class="SpellE">Malamig</span>, <span class="SpellE">Calapan</span>, <span class="GramE">Oriental</span> <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>, containing an area of 33,294 square meters, <span style="">embraced in and covered by Transfer
Certificate of Title No. T-66062 and registered in the name of <span class="SpellE">Epifania</span> <span class="SpellE">Alcano</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "B") as evidenced by a document of sale
executed by the registered owner (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
"I").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The original copy of
said title which </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">usually kept in the Office of the Register of

</span>It appears further that there are no co-owner's, mortgagee's, lessee's
duplicate copy of said certificate of title which had been previously issued by
the Register of Deeds of this province; that the petitioner is in actual
possession of the area of 16,647 square meters which was sold to her and that
she is <span class="SpellE">benefitting</span> from the produce of the
improvements existing on the area belonging to her."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

of this province and the Commissioner of the Land Registration Commission, on
the basis of the existing owner's duplicate copy thereof."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The appeal was docketed as C.A.-G.R. CV No. 15163.</p>

<p class="BODY">In support of the first assigned error, petitioner maintained
that the requirement of Section 13 of R.A. No. 26 is not only mandatory but

respondent Court of Appeals brushed aside the arguments of petitioner and held

"requires the sending out of notices to the adjoining owners and actual
occupants to <span style="">vest </span>jurisdiction,"

No. 1529" because it is inconsistent with Section 23 of said Decree which
provides that in original registration cases publication of notices of initial
hearing in the Official Gazette is sufficient to confer jurisdiction on the
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 110 of said Decree
provides:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q"><span class="GramE">"SEC. 110.</span> <u>Reconstitution</u> <u>of</u>

for in the former both the original and the owner's duplicate copies of the
certificate of title were claimed to be lost, unlike in the instant case where
the duplicate copy is intact; it was not shown that the original copy in the
custody of the Register of Deeds was destroyed; the copies of the titles
alleged to have been lost were later found intact in the names of other persons;
and, more importantly, the Petition was not published in the Official Gazette
but in the Manila Daily Bulletin, unlike in the instant case.</blockquote>

latter.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>4)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, in the instant case, the private
respondent cannot be blamed for the loss of the original copy of the transfer<span style=""> </span>certificate of title; it was lost by
reason of the burning of the <st1:place><st1:placename>Capitol</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Building</st1:placetype></st1:place>;
she <span style="">should not, therefore, be put to

doctrine:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The publication of the petition in two successive issues of
the Official Gazette, the service of the notice of hearing to the adjoining
owners and actual occupants of the land, as well as the posting of the notices
in the main entrance of the provincial and municipal buildings where the
property lies at least 30 days prior to the date of the hearing, as prescribed
by Section 13 of the law, are mandatory and jurisdictional requisites."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This re-affirmation is clear enough as to leave no room for any
convoluted logic to support a sophistic distinction between said case and the
instant case and an implausible interpretation of the law.</p>

<p class="BODY">We further find <span style="">to </span>be
totally unfounded the view of the Court of Appeals that Section 13 of R.A. No.
26 "appears to have been at least impliedly amended by Presidential Decree
No. 1529." There is absolutely nothing in P.D. No. 1529 which intimates or
suggests, indirectly or even remotely, an intention to amend said Section
13.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals either
misapprehended or read <span style="">out of context
that portion of Section 23 of P.D. No. 1529 reading as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE"><span style="">"x </span><span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> that the publication in the
Official Gazette shall be sufficient to confer jurisdiction upon the
court."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Worse, it committed a serious blunder when it used this clause to
support its proposition of implied amendment of Section 13 of R.A. No. 26 by
virtue of Section 110 of the Decree.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 23 of P.D. No. 1529 is entitled <u>Notice</u> <u>of</u><span style=""> <u>initial</u> </span><u>hearing</u>, <u>publication</u>,
<u>etc</u>. and provides, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>,
that:</p>

<blockquote>"The public shall be given notice of initial hearing of the
application for land registration by means of (1) publication; (2) mailing; and
<span style="">(3) </span>posting."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As regards publication, it specifically provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Upon receipt of the order of the court setting the time for
initial hearing, the Commissioner <span style="">of </span>Land
Registration shall cause a notice of initial hearing to be published once in
the Official Gazette and once in a newspaper of general circulation in the
Philippines:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Provided, however, that
the publication in the Official Gazette shall be sufficient to confer
jurisdiction upon the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This proviso was never meant to dispense with the requirement of
notice by <u>mailing</u> and by p<u>osting</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What it simply means is that in so far as publication is concerned,
there is sufficient compliance if the notice is published in the Official
Gazette, although the law mandates that it be published "once in the
Official Gazette and once in <span style="">a </span>newspaper
of general circulation in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>."
However, publication in the latter alone would not suffice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is to accord primacy to the official
publication.</p>

<p class="BODY">That such proviso was never meant to dispense with the other
modes of giving notice, which remain mandatory and jurisdictional, is obvious
from Section 23 itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the intention
of the law were otherwise, said section would not have stressed in detail the
requirements of mailing of notices to all persons named in the petition who,
per Section 15 of the Decree, include owners of adjoining properties, and
occupants of the land.</p>

<p class="BODY">The above view of the Court of Appeals negates one of the
principal purposes of the Decree, which is clearly expressed in its exordium,
namely, to strengthen the Torrens System through safeguards to prevent
anomalous titling of real property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
opens wide the doors to fraud and irregularities in land <span style="">registration proceedings and in proceedings
for the </span><span style="">reconstitution </span><span style="">of certificates of title.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judicial notice may be taken of the fact that
only very few have access to or could read the Official Gazette, which comes
out in few copies only per issue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
publication in the Official Gazette of the notice of hearing in both
proceedings would be sufficient to confer jurisdiction upon the court, owners
of both unregistered and </span>registered lands may someday painfully find out
that others have certificates of title to their land because scheming parties
had caused their registration, or secured reconstituted certificates of title
thereto and sold the property to third parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">The belabored argument of respondent Court of Appeals that it
would be unfair to impose upon the private respondent the duty to <span style="">c</span>omply with the requirement of service
of notice because it was not through her fault that the original copy of the
Transfer Certificate of Title was lost is unacceptable since the law does not
make any exception or<span style=""> </span>exemptions;
besides, it is, to say the least, a ludicrous proposition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Equally unacceptable is the opinion of said
Court that it was the duty of the trial court to serve the required notices and
private respondent should not be prejudiced if it failed to do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It suggests, quite unfortunately, and gives
the wrong impression that mandatory requirements of notices may be dispensed
with if the failure to comply with them <span style="">is
</span>attributable to the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
likewise negates the principles of responsibility, integrity, loyalty and
efficiency which the Constitution directs public officials and employees to
faithfully observe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">We </span>should
stress here that lapses on the part of courts or their personnel cannot be made
a reason or a justification for non-observance of laws.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By the very nature of their functions, they
should be the first to obey the laws.</p>
