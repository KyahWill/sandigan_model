				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On 8 May 1965, Petitioner Mutual Security Insurance Corporation
(thereafter "Mutual") put up a <span class="SpellE">counterbond</span>
in the amount of P55, 000.00 in favor of Manila Investment Co. Inc., for the
dissolution of a writ of attachment issued by the Court of First Instance of
Manila in a collection suit<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
against Manila Investment. On or about that same date, in consideration of <span class="SpellE">Mutual's</span> putting up the <span class="SpellE">counterbond</span>,
an indemnity agreement was executed by Manila Investment and respondent <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> Alias where the latter signed not only as
President of Manila Investment but also in his personal and individual
capacity. Under this agreement, the <span class="SpellE">indemnitors</span> bound
themselves jointly and severally to indemnify Mutual whatever it might incur or
suffer by virtue of issuance of the <span class="SpellE">counterbond</span>.
Manila Investment lost in that collection case and being unable to pay the
amount of the judgment, petitioner Mutual paid the judgment debt in the sum of
P55, 000.00. When the <span class="SpellE">indemnitors</span>, despite several
demands, failed to reimburse Mutual, the latter commenced an action on 4 May
1967 in the Court of First Instance of Manila against <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Allas</span> and his wife <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span>
M. <span class="SpellE">Allas</span> to enforce the indemnity Agreement and
sought attachment of the spouses' conjugal properties.</p>

<p class="BODY">In her answer to the complaint, <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span>
<span class="SpellE">Allas</span> alleged that she was not a party to the
indemnity agreement and had no knowledge thereof; that whatever obligation her
husband had incurred in said indemnity agreement was his personal obligation
for which the conjugal properties could not be held liable. Respondent <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> Alias, on the other hand, alleged that his
obligation to Mutual had already been extinguished by a compromise agreement.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color:windowtext">On 26 July 1968, the Court of
First Instance of Manila, then presided over by Judge <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Solidum</span>, rendered its</span> decision<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
finding respondent <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> alone liable under the
indemnity agreement and, accordingly, dismissing the complaint with respect to
respondent <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span> upon the grounds that she was not
a party to the indemnity agreement and that “there was absolutely no evidence
that the obligation contracted by her husband and co-defendant - was for the
benefit of the conjugal partnership, consequent[<span class="SpellE">ly</span>]
she cannot be held personally liable therefore.” The dispositive part of said
decision read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, judgment is hereby rendered ordering
defendant <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Allas</span> to
pay to the plaintiff, Mutual Security Insurance Corporation, the sum of P55,
000.00, with interest thereon at the rate of 12% per annum from the dates of
payment of said amount by plaintiff to Antonio V. Fernandez in Civil Case No.
29356, plus 15% thereof as attorney’s fees, and the costs of the suit.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The complaint with respect to the other defendant, <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span> <span class="SpellE">Allas</span>, dismissed without
costs.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From the above decision, only respondent <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Allas</span> appealed to the Court of Appeals, which appeal
was docketed as CA-G.R. No. 43278-R.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Mutual in the meantime moved for the execution of the
trial court’s decision, which motion was granted by the trial court in its
order of 14 September 1968. Respondent <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> moved
for the reconsideration of this order while his wife and co-respondent <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span>, in a separate motion, prayed that execution of
the decision ren<span style="color:windowtext">dered by Judge <span class="SpellE">Solidum</span> be issued only against her husband's personal or
separate property and not against their conjugal partnership properties. Both
motions were resolved by the trial court by an order dated 28 September 1968
denying respondent <span class="SpellE">Cipriano's</span> motion for
reconsideration while granting that of respondent <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span>
by ordering that the writ of execution be specifically issued against her
husband's personal and separate properties only.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On 24 March 1976, the Court of Appeals<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
rendered its decision in CA-G.R. No. 43278-R affirming the decision of the
trial court. Respondent <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> thereafter brought a
petition for review on certiorari of this decision before this Court. The
petition was denied due course by this Court's resolution of 20 August 1976. <span class="SpellE">Cipriano's</span> motion for reconsideration, was likewise denied
and the denial was made final by resolution dated <st1:date year="1976" day="20" month="10">20 October 1976</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 3 January 1977, petitioner Mutual moved for the immediate
execution of the trial court's decision. Respondent <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span>
again filed a motion praying that their conjugal properties be specifically
excluded from execution and that the writ of execution be issued instead
against the separate properties of her husband and co-respondent <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span>. </p>

<p class="BODY">On 22 February 1977, the Court of First Instance of Manila, this
time with Judge E.L. Peralta presiding, granted petitioner <span class="SpellE">Mutual's</span>
motion for execution and denied the motion of respondent <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span>.
The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of the order read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"PREMISES CONSIDERED, let a writ of execution issue against
such property of <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> Alias as is not exempt from
execution, <u>including his interest in the assets of his conjugal partnership
with his wife <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span> Alias which are not exempt
from execution, provided that the writ shall be enforced against the assets of
said partnership only should the private property of <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span>
Alias be insufficient to satisfy the judgment,</u> and provided, further, that
no prior lien in respect the debts under Article 161 of the Civil Code are
subsisting. The writ shall contain the foregoing proviso and the officer
implementing it shall strictly comply with its terms. x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
(Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Remedios</span> <span class="SpellE">Allas</span>
asked for reconsideration of the order urging that the levy on the conjugal
properties was null and void not being in conformity with the decision rendered
by Judge <span class="SpellE">Solidum</span>, which had long become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>. In an order dated 25 April 1977, Judge Peralta
denied <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span>' motion for reconsideration and
directed the issuance of a writ of execution enforceable against the <span class="SpellE">leviable</span> assets of <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Allas</span> and those of his conjugal partnership with his wife <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On appeal by respondent <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span>, the
Court of Appeals rendered a decision<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
on 25 August 1977 setting aside the <span style="color:windowtext">two orders
of Judge Peralta issued on 22 February 1977 and 25 April 1977 respectively. The
dispositive portion of the Court of Appeals' decision read as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the writ prayed for is hereby granted. The orders
of the respondent Court dated February 22, 1977 and April 25, 1977 are set
aside. In the issuance of writs of execution satisfy the judgment against <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Allas</span> in Civil Case No.
69389, no levy shall be made on the conjugal partnership properties of said
defendant and his spouse <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Allas</span>. The restraining order issued May 23, 1977 is made a
permanent injunction. No costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the present petition for review on certiorari assailing
the above decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition is clearly without merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">By issuing the two (2) questioned orders, Judge Peralta, as
correctly pointed out by the Court of Appeals,</p>

<blockquote><u>"(did) not merely implement a final decision of his court.</u>
The major portions of the two questioned orders of [Judge Peralta] are
dedicated to justifying why the conjugal properties of <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Allas</span> and <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span> <span class="SpellE">Allas</span> should answer for obligations incurred by the husband
in his regular business. [Judge Peralta] discusses Articles 161 and 163 of the
Civil Code, cites Professor <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> on how the
conjugal property answers even for debts incurred before marriage, and analyzes
cases on the liability of the conjugal partnership for debts incurred by the
husband. <u>He is rewriting the lower Court's decision. The non-liability of
conjugal properties which was already decided in 1968 has been reopened and <span class="SpellE">relitigated</span> in 1977.</u> x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> What private respondent asked and what respondent Judge
granted was a correction of the lower Court's 1968 decision and rulings that
the conjugal properties should not answer for the obligation."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The two questioned orders, in effect, made respondent <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span>, in respect of whom the complaint had been
dismissed, and the conjugal partnership, liable for an obligation for which the
respondent husband alone had been held answerable. This kind of amendment
obviously entailed a very substantial modification of a judgment which had long
become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>. The law in this
jurisdiction is that once a decision becomes final, even the court which
rendered it cannot lawfully alter or modify the same, especially when, as in
this case, the alteration or modification is material or substantial. This rule
is peremptory even if the judgment is erroneous in the view of the judge
looking back at it. As this Court held in <span class="SpellE"><u>Maramba</u></span><u>
vs. Lozano</u>:<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"a decision which has become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
can no longer be amended or corrected by the court except for clerical errors
or mistakes and however erroneous it may be, cannot be disobeyed, otherwise,
litigations would be endless and no questions could be considered finally
settled."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, it is elementary that the writ of execution must
conform to the judgment which is to be executed and that where the writ of
execution is not in harmony with and exceeds the judgment which gives it life,
the writ has pro-<span class="SpellE">tanto</span> no validity.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In seeking, however, to justify the orders in question, Mutual
argued that what was amended was not the trial court's decision of 26 July 1968
but its subsequent interlocutory order which granted petitioner's motion for
execution pending appeal; that the dispositive portion of the decision sought
to be executed did not prohibit execution of the decision against the conjugal
partnership properties and that, respondent <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span>
must bear the consequences of not having filed a motion for clarification of
the decision rendered by Judge <span class="SpellE">Solidum</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Mutual's</span> above argument was correctly
rejected by the respondent appellate court:</p>

<blockquote>"[t]he power of the lower court to control its interlocutory
orders and to modify or amend the same is subject to the condition that said
orders must conform to the decision being enforced. A decision which had long
become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> cannot be further amended
or changed through the simple expedient of issuing interlocutory orders
contrary to it."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Mutual also contended that Judge <span class="SpellE">Solidum's</span>
finding that there was absolutely no evidence that the transaction contracted
by respondent <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> was for the benefit of the
conjugal partnership, was simply a statement of fact in the body of the
decision and that, since in the dispositive portion of the decision, nothing
was said with respect to the liability of the conjugal partnership, a
subsequent order making the said partnership liable was proper. We <span style="color:windowtext">find no discrepancy whatsoever between the findings of
fact and the dispositive portion of Judge <span class="SpellE">Solidum's</span>
decision. And if there were any ambiguity or uncertainty in the dispositive
portion thereof, the body of the opinion may be referred to for purposes of
construing the dispositive part of the judgment. The dispositive part of the
decision must find support in the body of the decision spelling out the <u>ratio
<span class="SpellE">decidendi</span></u></span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style="color:windowtext">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In any case, as the respondent appellate court carefully
demonstrated, the liability of the conjugal partnership of <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span> <span class="SpellE">Allas</span> had been
squarely put in issue by <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span> and expressly
passed upon by Judge <span class="SpellE">Solidum</span> both in his decision
where he held that -</p>

<blockquote>--- "there is absolutely no evidence that the obligation
contracted by her husband and co-defendant <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span>
Alias --- was for the benefit of the conjugal partnership: consequent[<span class="SpellE">ly</span>] she cannot be held personally liable <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">and in his order of <st1:date year="1968" day="28" month="9">28
 September 1968</st1:date>:</p>

<blockquote>"As regards the motion of the defendant, <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span>
Alias, to the effect that the writ of execution against her co-defendant, <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> Alias, be enforced only against his personal or
separate property and not against the conjugal partnership inasmuch as his
right therein is merely inchoate in the sense that pending the liquidation of
said conjugal partnership he does not have absolute right in the property and
considering the manifestation of counsel for the plaintiff that he is agreeable
that said writ of execution be only limited to the separate property of
defendant <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> Alias, the said writ should be
executed only against the separate property of <span style="font-size:12.0pt;
color:windowtext">the defendant, <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Allas</span>, and not against whatever right he may have in the
conjugal partnership."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
