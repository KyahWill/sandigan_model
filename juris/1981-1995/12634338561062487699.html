of a public official to engage in the practice of his profession while employed
in the Government.</p>

<p class="BODY">Attorney Erwin B. Javellana was an elected City Councilor of Bago
City, Negros Occidental.  On October 5,
1989, City Engineer Ernesto C. Divinagracia filed Administrative Case No.
C-10-90 against Javellana for:  (1)
violation of Department of Local Government (DLG) Memorandum Circular No. 80-38
dated June 10, 1980 in relation to DLG Memorandum Circular No. 74-58 and of
Section 7, paragraph b, No. 2 of Republic Act No. 6713, otherwise known as the
"Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and
Employees," and (2) for oppression, misconduct and abuse of authority.</p>

<p class="BODY">Divinagracia's complaint alleged that Javellana, an incumbent member
of the City Council or Sanggunian Panglungsod of Bago City, and a lawyer by
profession, has continuously engaged in the practice of law without securing
authority for that purpose from the Regional Director.  Department of Local Government, as required
by DLG Memorandum Circular No. 80-38 in relation to DLG Memorandum Circular No.
74-58 of the same department:  that on
July 8, 1989.  Javellana, as counsel for
Antonio Javiero and Rolando Catapang, filed a case against City Engineer
Ernesto C. Divinagracia of Bago City for "Illegal Dismissal and
Reinstatement with Damages" putting him in public ridicule:  that Javellana also appeared as counsel in
several criminal and civil cases in the city, without prior authority of the
DLG Regional Director, in violation of DLG Memorandum Circular No. 80-38 which
provides:</p>

<blockquote>"MEMORANDUM CIRCULAR
NO. 80-38</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SUBJECT:  AMENDING MEMORANDUM CIRCULAR NO. 80-18 ON
SANGGUNIAN SESSIONS, PER DIEMS, ALLOWANCES, STAFFING AND OTHER RELATED MATTERS</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"In view of the issuance of Circular No. 5-A by the Joint
Commission on Local Government Personnel Administration which affects certain
provisions of MC 80­-18, there is a need to amend said, Memorandum Circular to
substantially conform to the pertinent provisions of Circular No. 9-A.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">"C. <u>Practice</u> <u>of</u> <u>Profession</u></p>

<p class="2Q">"The Secretary (now Minister) of Justice in an Opinion No. 46
Series of 1973 stated <u>inter</u> <u>alia</u> that ‘<u>members</u> <u>of</u> <u>local</u>
<u>legislative</u> <u>bodies</u>, other than the provincial governors or the
mayors, do not keep regular office hours.’ ‘They merely attend meetings or
sessions of the provincial board or the city or municipal council’ and that
provincial board members are not even required ‘to have an office in the
provincial building.’ Consequently, they are not therefore required to report
daily as other regular government employees do, except when they are delegated
to perform certain administrative functions in the interest of public service
by the Governor or Mayor as the case may be.  For this reason, they may therefore, <u>be</u> <u>allowed</u> <u>to</u> <u>practice</u>
<u>their</u> <u>professions</u> <u>provided</u> <u>that</u> <u>in</u> <u>so</u>
<u>doing</u> <u>an</u> <u>authority</u> <u>x</u> <u>x</u> <u>x</u> <u>first</u>
<u>be</u> <u>secured</u> <u>from</u> <u>the</u> <u>Regional</u> <u>Directors</u>
<u>pursuant</u> <u>to</u> <u>Memorandum</u> <u>Circular</u> <u>No</u>. <u>74-58</u>
provided, however, that no government personnel, property, equipment or
supplies shall be utilized in the practice of their professions.  While being authorized to practice their
professions, they should as much as possible attend regularly any and all
sessions, which are not very often of their Sanggunians for which they were
elected as members by their constituents except in very extreme cases, e.g.,
doctors who are called upon to save a life.  <u>For</u> <u>this</u> <u>purpose</u> <u>it</u> <u>is</u> <u>desired</u>
<u>that</u> <u>they</u> <u>always</u> <u>keep</u> <u>a</u> <u>calendar</u> <u>of</u>
<u>the</u> <u>dates</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>sessions</u>, <u>regular</u> <u>or</u>
<u>special</u> <u>of</u> <u>their</u> <u>Sanggunians</u> <u>so</u> <u>that</u> <u>conflicts</u>
<u>of</u> <u>attending</u> <u>court</u> <u>cases</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>case</u>
<u>of</u> <u>lawyers</u> <u>and</u> <u>Sanggunian</u> <u>sessions</u> <u>can</u>
<u>be</u> <u>avoided</u>.</p>

<p class="2Q">"As to members of the bar the authority given for them to
practice their profession shall always be subject to the restrictions provided
for in Section 6 of Republic Act 5185.  In all cases, <u>the</u> <u>practice</u> <u>of</u> <u>any</u> <u>profession</u>
<u>should</u> <u>be</u> <u>favorably</u> <u>recommended</u> <u>by</u> <u>the</u>
<u>Sanggunian</u> <u>concerned</u> <u>as</u> <u>a</u> <u>body</u> <u>and</u> <u>by</u>
<u>the</u> <u>provincial</u> <u>governors</u>, <u>city</u> <u>or</u> <u>municipal</u>
<u>mayors</u>, <u>as</u> <u>the</u> <u>case</u> <u>may</u><b> </b><u>be</u>."

<p class="BODY">On August 13, 1990, a formal hearing of the complaint was held in
Iloilo City in which the complainant, Engineer Divinagracia, and the
respondent, Councilor Javellana, presented their respective evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, on September 10, 1990, Javellana requested the DLG for
a permit to continue his practice of law for the reasons stated in his
letter-request.  On the same date,
Secretary Santos replied as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 25, 1991, Javellana filed a Motion to Dismiss the
administrative case against him on the ground mainly that DLG Memorandum
Circulars Nos. 80-38 and 90-81 are unconstitutional because the Supreme Court
has the sole and exclusive authority to regulate the practice of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">In an Order dated May 2, 1991, Javellana's motion to dismiss was
denied by the public respondents.  His
motion for reconsideration was likewise denied on June 20, 1991.</p>

<p class="BODY">Five months later or on October 10, 1991, the Local Government Code
of 1991 (RA 7160) was signed into law, Section 90 of which provides:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 90.  <i>Practice</i>
<i>of</i> <i>Profession. - </i>(a) All governors, city and municipal mayors are
prohibited from practicing, their profession or engaging in any occupation

<p class="BODY">Administrative Case No. C-10-90 was again set for hearing on
November 26, 1991.  Javellana thereupon
filed this petition for <i>certiorari</i> praying that DLG Memorandum Circulars
Nos. 80-38 and 90-81 and Section 90 of the new Local Government Code (RA 7160)
be declared unconstitutional and null and void because:</p>

<p class="BODY">(1)  they violate Article
VIII.  Section 5 of the 1987
Constitution, which provides:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 5.  The Supreme
Court shall have the following powers:</blockquote>

<blockquote>  "xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(5) Promulgate
rules concerning the protection and enforcement of Constitutional rights,
pleading, practice, and procedure in all courts, the admission to the practice
of law, the Integrated Bar, and legal assistance to the underprivileged.  Such rules shall provide a simplified and
inexpensive procedure for the speedy disposition of cases, shall be uniform for
all courts of the same grade, and shall not diminish, increase, or modify
substantive rights.  Rules of procedure
of special courts and quasi-judicial bodies shall remain effective unless
disapproved by the Supreme Court."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">(2) They constitute class legislation, being discriminatory
against the legal and medical professions for only sanggunian members who are
lawyers and doctors are restricted in the exercise of their profession while
dentists, engineers, architects, teachers, opticians, morticians and others are
not so restricted (RA 7160. Sec. 90 [b-1]).</p>

<p class="BODY">In due time, the Solicitor General filed his Comment on the
petition and the petitioner submitted a Reply.  After deliberating on the pleadings of the parties, the Court resolved
to dismiss the petition for lack of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">As a matter of policy, this Court accords great respect to the
decisions and/or actions of administrative authorities not only because of the
doctrine of separation of powers but also for their presumed knowledgeability
and expertise in the enforcement of laws and regulations entrusted to their
jurisdiction (Santiago vs. Deputy Executive Secretary, 192 SCRA 199, citing
Cuerdo vs. COA, 166 SCRA 657).  With
respect to the present case, we find no grave abuse of discretion on the part
of the respondent.  Department of
Interior and Local Government (DILG), in issuing the questioned DLG Circulars
Nos. 80-30 and 90-81 and in denying petitioner's motion to dismiss the
administrative charge against him.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the first place, complaints against public officers and
employees relating or incidental to the performance of their duties are
necessarily impressed with public interest for by express constitutional
mandate, a public office is a public trust.  The complaint for illegal dismissal filed by Javiero and Catapang
against City Engineer Divinagracia is in effect a complaint against the City
Government of Bago City, their real employer of which petitioner Javellana is a
councilman.  Hence, judgment against
City Engineer Divinagracia would actually be a judgment against the City Government.  By serving as counsel for the complaining
employees and assisting them to prosecute their claims against City Engineer
Divinagracia, the petitioner violated Memorandum Circular No. 74-58 (in
relation to Section 7[b-2] of RA 6713) prohibiting a government official from
engaging in the private practice of his profession, if such practice would
represent interests adverse to the government.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's contention that Section 90 of the Local Government
Code of 1991 and DLG Memorandum Circular No. 90-81 violate Article VIII.  Section 5 of the Constitution is completely
off tangent.  Neither the statute nor
the circular trenches upon the Supreme Court's power and authority to prescribe
rules on the practice of law.  The Local
Government Code and DLG Memorandum Circular No. 90-81 simply prescribe rules of
conduct for public officials to avoid conflicts of interest between the
discharge of their public duties and the private practice of their profession,
in those instances where the law allows it.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 90 of the Local Government Code does not discriminate
against lawyers and doctors.  It applies
to all provincial and municipal officials in the professions or engaged in any
occupation.  Section 90 explicitly
provides that sanggunian members "may practice their professions, engage
in any occupation, or teach in schools except during session hours." If
there are some prohibitions that apply particularly to lawyers, it is because
of all the professions, the practice of law is more likely than others to
relate to, or affect, the area of public service.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is DENIED for lack of merit.  Costs against the petitioner.</p>
