<p class="BODY">The prosecution's version of the killing is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">based </span>mainly on the testimony of Marcos
Fuentes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He testified, <u>inter</u> <u>alia</u>,
that he knew the spouses Bertito and Alicia Trigo because he bought from them
their house located at Sitio Umigon, Brgy. Tincupon, Panitan, Capiz, in 1982;
that at about nine o'clock in the morning of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">May </span>30, 1983, he was at the market of the town of Pontevedra;
that he met Alicia Trigo at the said market and even greeted her; that he did
not notice at the time whether Alicia was with a companion or not; that after
awhile, a commotion took place; that when he stood up he saw Bertito Trigo
stabbing Alicia; that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">he </span>saw
blood spurting from Alicia's left chest; that Bertito Trigo was at the time in
front of Alicia and holding the latter with one of his arms; that there were no
other persons near Alicia when he saw the latter bleeding; that Alicia later
fell on the ground; and that he was about 50 meters from where the incident
took place.</p>

<p class="BODY">The body of Alicia Trigo was examined by Dr. Ma. Roselle B.
Gedang, resident physician of the <st1:place><st1:placename>Provincial</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place> at Bailan, Pontevedra,
Capiz.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The medical certificate dated <st1:date year="1984" day="4" month="2">February 4, 1984</st1:date> indicated the
following pertinent physical findings, to wit:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">Cardio respiratory arrest secondary to hemorrhage."</span> (p.

<p class="BODY">Accused, upon the other hand, denied that he killed his wife
Alicia.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to him, he and his
wife were at the market to buy some goods for their store; that while they were
walking, he saw Orline Buaco draw from his waist a weapon; that Buaco tried to
stab him but he (accused) was able to evade the blow; that it was his wife <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">who </span>got hit by the blow delivered by
Buaco; and after his wife was hit, Buaco successively stabbed her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He also claimed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">that </span>Orline Buaco is also a resident of Barangay Tincupon; that
Buaco had previously fir<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">e</span>d shots
at the house of accused and his family on November 19, 1982 because the accused
had not paid his debt to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Buaco </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">in </span>the sum of P1<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>;
that such incident was recorded at the police department and a complaint was
filed by him against Buaco with the Municipal Court of Panitan (TSN, February
13, 1985, pp. 51-62, Records).</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant submits that the trial court should not have relied on the
testimony of the prosecution witness Marcos Fuentes in view of the
inconsistencies and improbabilities found in his testimony.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appellant also asserts that there is no
evidence in the records to show that he had a motive to kill his wife.</p>

<p class="BODY">After a careful review of the records, <span class="GramE">We</span>
find the a<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">ppeal </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to be without me</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">rit</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

</span>It is a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">well-</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">established rule that in criminal prosecutions
on the matter of credibility of witnesses, the findings of the trial court are
given weight and the highest degree of respect by appellate courts because the
former is in a better position to decide the question, having heard the
witnesses themselves and observed their deportment and manner of testifying
during the trial (People vs. Kintuan, G.R. 84100, December 3, 1987, 156 SCRA
195).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We find no strong and cogent
reason to depart from this established rule.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The testimony of Marcos Fuentes which stated that he saw appellant stab
his wife (p. </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">4, TSN, March </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">4, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">1984) was clear and positive.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>There was no showing of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">any
ulterior </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">motive on his part to
falsely charge the accused-appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The testimony of only one witness, if credible and positive and if it
satisfies the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">court </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">beyond reasonable doubt is sufficient to
convict (see People v. Luces, L-60744, </span><st1:date year="1983" day="25" month="11"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">November 25, 1983</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">, 125 SCRA 813).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">We affirm the trial
court's finding when it declared that even as Marcos Fuentes sort of wavered at
the outset in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">his </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">testimony, his declaration was
straight-forward even during the cross-examination; and that his court
testimony is a reiteration of his </span>declaration in his sworn statement
supporting the complaint (p. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">29, </span><u>Rollo</u>).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Appellant also submits
that the prosecution did </span>not prove<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">
the motive of appellant for killing his wife.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span></span>The <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">law </span>is
well-settled that motive is relevant only where the identity o<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:21.0pt">f</span> person accused of having <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">committed the crime is in dispute, where
there are no eyewitnesses, and where suspicion is likely to fall </span>upon a
number of persons.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar,
the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">identity of the accused was
positively proved by the eyewitness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, motive is irrelevant (People v. </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
6.0pt">Dueño, </span>G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-31102, </span><st1:date year="1979" day="5" month="5"><span class="GramE">May 5, 1979</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 90 SCRA 23).</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Further, <span class="GramE">We</span> are not persuaded by appellant's claim that it was not
him but a certain Orline Buaco who stabbed his wife.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In rejecting this defense, the </span>trial
court correctly observed significant <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">factors/circumstances
surrounding the incident which belie appellant's defense that it was not he who
stabbed and killed Alicia Trigo.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Firstly</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">, </span>there is great improbability <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">of Orline Buaco's alleged first attack hitting his wife if the said
attack were aimed at accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span><u>Secondly</u>,
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">there is greater improbability of the
deceased Alicia Trigo sustaining multiple stab wounds if it were the appellant
whom Buaco wanted to stab as then the latter would have aimed all the five
other thrusts of the weapon at the accused and not at the deceased Alicia
Trigo.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span><u>Thirdly</u>, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">there was failure </span>not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">only to shield her from the attack but also
failure to retaliate within the duration of the next five attacks upon the
deceased.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span><u>Fourthly</u>, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">knowing that his wife was already seriously
wounded, the appellant would not have left her alone in the care of a policeman
especially after Buaco had already fled, and there was no more danger that the
latter might attack him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>Fifthly</u>,
after appellant had secured police protection at the police station, appellant
never returned to personally attend to his wife and to ascertain if she
received timely medical attention at the provincial hospital at Bailan, <span class="GramE">Pontevedra.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All these
facts and circumstances were considered by the trial court to bolster one thing
- that accused was really estranged from his wife and it was he who killed her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The direct and
circumstantial evidence established at the trial sufficiently prove the guilt
of accused-appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As aforestated,
the trial court's findings of fact are generally given due respect.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appellant has the burden, therefore, to
convince this Court that a departure from this rule is justified upon
satisfactory showing that the trial court misapplied some facts of weight and
substance as would alter the result of the proceedings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He failed to do so.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The court <u>a</u> </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">quo</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

the accused the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We do not agree with this finding.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused himself testified that he went to
the police station to report that his wife was stabbed by Buaco and to seek
protection </span>as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">he feared that
Buaco would also stab him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Clearly, his
action cannot in any manner be considered as amounting to voluntary
surrender.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In any event, the penalty of <u>reclusion</u>

<p class="BODY">The indemnity in the amount of P12<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
