				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The architectural and construction firm, C.T. Serna
 and Associates, was responsible for the design and planning of Phase 1 
of the Engineering Building of the Pangasinan State University (PSU) in 
1983. Following approval of its request for a supplemental budget for 
the construction and extension of the building in December of 1986, 
authorities of the University, represented by its President, petitioner 
Rufino O. Eslao, entered into a contract for the preparation of 
perspective and detailed plans, specifications, bills of materials and 
estimates, programs of work and structural designs for the extension.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> C.T. Serna Consultants was particularly chosen because of its role in the design of the existing building.<br><br>Cost
 estimates for the extension were pegged at P1 Million (P1,000,000.00), 
equal to the agency estimate made by the Regional Office of the Ministry
 of Public Works and Highways (now DPWH).&nbsp; During the process of 
negotiating the design and specification contract, C.T. Serna 
Consultants offered its services for a fee equivalent to 6% of the 
amount actually released for the project.&nbsp; However, in a letter 
addressed to the firm dated December 18, 1986, petitioner made a 
counteroffer equivalent to 3% of the released amount, an offer which the
 firm accepted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>The 
completed plans and specifications were turned over to the university on
 December of 1986.&nbsp; Said plans were subsequently approved by the 
Department of Public Works and Highways on March 11, 1987.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>
 On the basis of the approval of the plans and specifications, the 
Pangasinan State University prepared Voucher No. 8703204, in the amount 
of Thirty Thousand Pesos (P30,000.00), for the payment of the 
professional services rendered by the firm.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>
 C .T. Serna Consultants received Twenty Seven Thousand Pesos 
(P27,000.00) of the amount released after deduction of the 10% 
Withholding Tax.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>At 
the first quarter of 1987, the Pangasinan State University, with an 
approved budget of Two Million Pesos (P2,000,000.00), began construction
 of Phase Three of its Engineering Building.&nbsp; As stipulated in the 
contract for services entered into between the university and C.T. Serna
 Consultants in 1986, the latter also prepared the plans and 
specifications for the building, for which it was paid the amount of 
Sixty Thousand Pesos (P60,000.00), less 10% withholding tax.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>On
 March 16, 1988, almost to the year after the last payment was made by 
the university to C.T. Serna Consultants, a letter from the Commission 
on Audit, signed by Auditor-in­-Charge Cornelia M. Espanol, was received
 by petitioner, informing him 1) that the COA disallowed the 
professional (architectural) fees paid to C.T. Serna Consultants; 2) 
that petitioner, C.T. Serna Consultants and Atty. Gil A. Madrid, 
Administrative Officer of the university were jointly and severally 
liable for the amount paid to the architectural and construction firm; 
and that, 3) petitioner, C.T. Serna Consultants and Atty. Madrid were 
required to "adopt the necessary measures to enforce settlement 
thereof."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Responding
 to the Commission on Audit's letter of March 16, 1988, petitioner on 
March 17, 1988 requested that said disallowance be lifted.&nbsp; He stressed 
that:&nbsp; 1) the architectural fee paid to C.T. Serna Consultants was not 
disadvantageous to the government; 2) there was lack of material time 
for the Ministry of Public Works and Highways to prepare the engineering
 papers because the project had to be obligated not later than January 
30, 1987; 3) the contract was entered into after a discussion with Mr. 
Santos Guiang, the resident auditor who gave his full consent thereto; 
and 4) the said architectural fee was for preparation of the plan of 
Engineering Building No. 2 in Urdaneta which was part of the 1986 
capital outlay but which was subject to very late release by the 
Ministry of Budget.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>However,
 on March 25, 1988, the Commission on Audit, through Auditor-in-Charge 
Bonifacio B. Ico, wrote another letter-notice increasing the amount 
disallowed to Ninety Thousand Pesos (P90,000.00) by including the first 
payment of Thirty Thousand Pesos (P30,000.00) covered by Voucher No. 
8703204.&nbsp; The letter likewise included PSU's Chief Accountant, Ms. Ma 
Heda H. Co and its Cashier Ms. Marlene S. Bernabe as among those jointly
 and severally liable for the disbursements.&nbsp; Said letter was, however, 
returned to Auditor-in-Charge Ico on April 5, 1988 by petitioner with 
the information that the disallowance indicated in the March 25, 1988 
letter was the subject of a request by the petitioner to the National 
Office of the Commission on Audit after the same was disallowed by the 
Regional Director, COA Region I.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>
 In returning the letter-notice, petitioner requested that the 
disallowance be temporarily shelved pending resolution of the issue by 
COA's national office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> 
Petitioner, likewise requested for a ruling on the liability of Auditor 
Santos Guiang for his earlier concurrence to petitioner's acceptance of 
the contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> The last 
request, seeking a ruling on the liability of Auditor Guiang, was the 
subject of a separate letter dated April 5, 1988 to the Regional 
Director of the Commission on Audit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>On February 9, 1989, the Commission on Audit issued Decision No. 765<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>
 clearing Auditor Santos Guiang of any liability, stating that his 
concurrence was made three years after the contract for the construction
 of the proposed Engineering Building No. 2 was perfected. Following our
 decision in G.R. No. 89745 dated April 18, 1991,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>
 petitioner wrote a letter-request dated June 5, 1991 seeking a lifting 
of the disallowance of the disbursements covered by Vouchers Nos. 
8703204 and 8706430 in view of this Court's April 8, 1991 decision 
overturning COA's disallowance of the construction costs of the 
building. In a second indorsement addressed to the Chairman of the 
Commission on Audit dated July 19, 1991, Auditor Ico recommended denial 
of petitioner's letter-request.&nbsp; On April 15, 1993, the Commission on 
Audit denied petitioner's request, hence, the instant petition.<br><br>In
 lieu of Comment because he took the side of petitioner, the Solicitor 
General submitted a Manifestation and Motion urging that the vouchers 
subject of the instant controversy be allowed in audit.&nbsp; Consequently, 
the public respondent filed its own Comment wherein it asserts its 
constitutionally mandated duty to promulgate and implement "accounting 
and auditing rules and regulations including those for the prevention 
and disallowance of irregular, unnecessary, excessive, extravagant, or 
unconscionable expenditures, or uses of government funds and 
properties,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> and urges the
 disallowance of the vouchers in question, for being made in violation 
of COA Circular No. 82­-191, dated July 5, 1992, equivalent to — in the 
public respondent's&nbsp; words — "a palpable display of defiance against the
 mandate of the Constitution to which the public respondent is duty 
bound to uphold and protect."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>The pertinent portion of said circular states:<br><br>This
 commission believes that the present practice of stating the fees for 
architectural, engineering design, and similar professional services in 
terms of percent of the Project Cost is inconsistent with our national 
goal of economy in fiscal operations because the percentage fee 
motivates the architect/designer to design a project so as to maximize 
its cost since his fee will be computed as a direct proportion to the 
resulting project cost.<br><br>The settlement of percentage fees has 
often been the subject of disagreement between the contractor and the 
government especially in contracts where the definition of the project 
cost is so broad to allow inclusion into the computation the costs of 
equipment as package type air-conditioning, hospital, kitchen and 
laundry equipment and other similar equipment which were not covered by 
the architect's/designer's services.<br><br>In order to prevent and 
avoid these effects which are detrimental to the government's interests 
contracts for architectural, engineering design, and similar 
professional services should invariably specify the fees in monetary or 
peso amount.&nbsp; The fee may be computed as a percent of the estimated 
project cost in accordance with the schedule of rates in the Architects'
 National Code or similar accepted schedule of rates for professional 
services, but the amount should then be stipulated in pesos in the 
contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>The 
public respondent's contentions are untenable.&nbsp; While finding that 
respondent Commission's rulings on the disbursements made by petitioner 
on the main construction contract were "not without cogent basis," in <b><i>Eslao vs Commission on Audit</i></b>, G.R. No. 8975<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>
 we nonetheless upheld petitioner's disbursements therein valid for 
several reasons.&nbsp; First, petitioner secured the construction contracts 
in question in good faith and for the benefit of the university.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>
 Second, the construction of the buildings in question ultimately 
redounded to the benefit of the government.&nbsp; Finally, the project, at 
that time was already 95% complete, and we allowed recovery by the 
contractor on the basis of <i style="font-weight: bold;">quantum meruit</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>
 Although the contracts subject of the instant controversy involve a 
different aspect of the project, we find no reason to deviate from our 
earlier holding.&nbsp; The fact that the design contract and the construction
 contract involve different sets of accounting and auditing rules cannot
 be utilized as reason to altogether ignore the overwhelming evidence of
 the good faith exhibited by petitioner not only in respect to the 
construction of the latter phases of the engineering building but also 
in procuring the best terms possible for the building's design.&nbsp; It was 
logical, given the time constraints, that the original design contractor
 be utilized for the plans for the extensions of the engineering 
building. Nothing in the design and planning contracts eventually drawn 
by the university and C.T. Serna could be characterized as unnecessary, 
extravagant, irregular, unconscionable or excessive. The amounts covered
 by Vouchers No. 8703204 and 8706340 were, at P30,000.00 and P60,000.00 
respectively, well within — if not way below — the amounts of 
P80,000.000 and P120,000.00, if the usual trade practice of charging an 
average of 8% of the value of the construction or amount released were 
followed.&nbsp; Furthermore, a reasonable construction of Circular No. 
82-191, which belongs to the class of audit rules and regulations 
designed to implement COA's constitutional mandate to stem "unnecessary,
 excessive, extravagant or unconscionable expenditures"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>
 would reveal nothing which would absolutely disallow the pegging of the
 amount involved in such contracts at a reasonable value consistent with
 established trade practices because even the said circular allows 
computation of the fee on the basis of "estimated project cost" provided
 that the said computation could be expressed in a sum certain and were 
based on values consistent with the values proposed by the National Code
 for Architect's Services.&nbsp; As stated earlier, the payments made to 
C.T.&nbsp; Serna Consultants — based on 3% of the amount released — were way 
below the 8% floor recommended by the National Code of Architect's 
Services, and was a compromise amount, agreed upon by the parties, which
 was below the 6% (of amount released) originally proposed by the design
 firm.&nbsp; From all indications, the government clearly emerged the winner 
in the contract in question.<br><br>We are aware of the fact that the 
practice of pegging the contract value on the basis of the amount 
released could lead to a pernicious practice of bloating the value of 
the amount released by including other costs, such as cost of equipment 
in the latter. However, there is no allegation, much less proof, here 
that the project costs were "so broad as to include into the 
computation" other costs not covered by the designer's/architect's 
services.&nbsp; In fact, while the exact peso value was not expressed or 
specified in the contract, it was definitely capable of being expressed 
or stipulated in a sum certain.&nbsp; Even within the parameters of Circular 
82-191, which do not absolutely proscribe the method of computation 
utilized by petitioner and C.T.&nbsp; Serna Consultants in the assailed 
design contract, the expenditures were hardly irregular, unnecessary, 
extravagant nor unconscionable.&nbsp; Moreover, the contract in question was 
first impliedly authorized by the Ministry of Public Works when it 
approved, on March 11, 1987,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>
 the details and plans of the extensions prepared by C.T. Serna 
Associates and by later expressly, by COA's auditor Mr. Santos Guiang.<br><br>In
 fine we agree with the Solicitor General's submission that the vouchers
 in question should be allowed in audit.&nbsp; As he states:<br><br>At this 
point in time, phases 2 and 3 of Engineering Building 2 of the 
Pangasinan State University has long been completed.&nbsp; It is now being 
used by the university for classrooms and teaching purposes.&nbsp; The 
university, the studentry and the government has benefitted and is 
benefitting from its construction.<br><br>In allowing the payment of the
 construction cost of the Engineering Building No. 2 (which was earlier 
disallowed by COA), this Court found and held that petitioner acted in 
good faith in entering into contracts with the construction companies 
for the good and interest of the university and the government.<br><br>Considering
 the foregoing, there is no justifiable reason why the professional fees
 of C.T. Serna Consultants should not be compensated for its 
architectural services consisting in the drawing of the perspective 
plan, design, estimates and specifications for phases 2 and 3 of said 
Engineering Building No. 2.&nbsp; After all, as constructed, Engineering 
Building No. 2 conformed to such architectural design, plan etc. 
prepared by C.T. Serna Consultants.<br><br>Following the ruling in the 
earlier case, since the services of C.T. Serna Consultants redounded to 
the benefit of the general public, it should be compensated because to 
deny the payment to the contractor x x x would be to allow the 
government to unjustly enrich itself at the expense of another.&nbsp; Justice
 and equity demand compensation."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>In
 the instant case, the Court finds that the expenditures in question 
were plainly for the benefit of the university, the government and the 
public.&nbsp; Nothing in the circumstances of the case at bench even remotely
 suggests that the disbursements were irregular or excessive, 
unnecessary or unconscionable. As equity and justice follow law, 
allowing the public respondent's rigid and unbending interpretation of 
its circular would amount to sanctioning unjust enrichment on the part 
of the government at the expense of its well-meaning public servants and
 in defiance of the purpose and intent of the fundamental law.<br><br>Finally,
 there is no question that the disallowances involving the construction 
cost and the cost of design are intimately related, although both 
involve different contracts subject to different audit rules.&nbsp; Believing
 in good faith that the disallowances were connected to each other, 
petitioner requested that the disallowance on the design contract be 
temporarily shelved until questions involving the construction cost were
 resolved with finality.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> 
This request was never answered by respondent. Given this Court's 
eventual decision in G.R. No. 89745, petitioner had every reason to 
either assume that his request was not denied or was still pending.&nbsp; The
 fact of the matter is that prior to respondent's last denial of 
petitioner's request to lift the disallowance of the design cost of 
April 15, 1993, respondent had made no definitive ruling on the matter, 
except to exonerate (its) Auditor Santos Guiang in COA Decision No. 765 
dated February 9, 1989.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Said decision never resolved the question of the design cost's disallowance, hence, petitioner's action never prescribed.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE, </b>PREMISES
 CONSIDERED, the instant petition is GRANTED. The decision of respondent
 Commission on Audit dated April 15, 1993 is REVERSED and SET ASIDE, and
 said Commission is directed to pass in audit the amounts covered by
