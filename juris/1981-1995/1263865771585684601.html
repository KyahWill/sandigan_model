<p class="BODY">The petitioner, Francisco I. Chavez<a style="mso-footnote-id:

is a taxpayer and an owner of three parcels of land.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He alleges the following:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>that Executive Order No. 73 accelerated the
application of the general revision of assessments to January 1, 1987 thereby
mandating an excessive increase in real property taxes by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">100% </span>to 400% on improvements, and up to
100% on land; that any increase in the value of real property brought about by
the revision of real property values and assessments would necessarily lead to
a proportionate increase in real property taxes; that sheer oppression is the
result of increasing real property taxes at a period of time when harsh
economic conditions prevail; and that the increase in the market values of real
property as reflected in the schedule of values was brought about only by
inflation and economic recession.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> Realty Owners
Association of the Philippines, Inc. (ROAP), which is the national association
of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">owners-<span class="SpellE">lessors</span>,
j</span>oins Chavez in his petition to declare unconstitutional Executive Order
No. 73, but additionally alleges the following:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>that Presidential Decree No. 464 is unconstitutional insofar as it
imposes an additional one percent (1%) tax on all property owners <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">to </span>raise funds for education, as real
property tax is admittedly a local tax for local governments; that the General
Revision of Assessments does not meet the requirements of due process as
regards publication, notice of hearing, opportunity to be heard and insofar as
it authorizes "replacement cost" of buildings (improvements) which is
not provided in Presidential Decree No. 464, but only in an administrative
regulation of the Department of Finance; <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">and
that the Joint Local Assessment/Treasury Regulations No. 2-86</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> is even more oppressive and unconstitutional
as it imposes successive increase of 150% over the 1986 tax.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Office of the Solicitor General argues against the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition is not impressed with merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Chavez and <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> ROAP
question the constitutionality of Executive Order No. 73 insofar as the
revision of the assessments and the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
thereof are concerned.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It should be
emphasized that Executive Order No. 73 merely directs, in Section 1 thereof,
that:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SECTION 1.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Real property values as of December 31, 1984
as determined by the local assessors during the latest general revision of
assessments <u>shall</u> <u>take</u> <u>effect</u> <u>beginning</u> <u>January</u>
<u>1,</u> <u>1987</u> for purposes of real property tax collection." (<span class="GramE">underscoring</span> supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">The general revision of assessments
completed in 1984 is based on Section 21 of Presidential Decree No. 464 which
provides, as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">21.</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>General
Revision of Assess­ments.- Beginning with the calendar year 1978, the
provincial or city assessor shall make a general revision of real property
assessments in the province or city to take effect January 1, 1979, and once
every five years thereafter:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Provided;
however, That if property values in a province or city, or in any municipality,
have greatly changed since the last general revision, the provincial or city
assessor may, with the approval of the Secretary of Finance or upon his
discretion, undertake a general revision of assessments in the province or
city, or in any municipality before the fifth year from the <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">effectivity</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> of the last general revision."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thus, <span class="GramE">We</span> agree with the Office of the
Solicitor General that the attack on Executive Order No. 73 has no legal basis
as the general revision of assessments is a continuing process mandated by
Section 21 of Presidential Decree No. 464.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>If at all, it is Presidential Decree No. 464 which should be challenged
as constitutionally infirm.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, Chavez
failed to raise any objection against said decree.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was ROAP which questioned the
constitutionality thereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore,
Presidential Decree No. 464 furnishes the procedure by which a tax assessment
may be questioned:</p>

who is not satisfied with the action of the provincial or city assessor in the

him of the written notice of assessment as provided in this Code, appeal to the
Board of Assessment Appeals of the province or city, by filing with it a
petition under oath using the form prescribed for the purpose, together with
copies of the tax declarations and such affidavit or documents submitted in
support of the appeal."</blockquote>

Central Board of Assessment Appeals shall become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
after the lapse of fifteen days from the date of receipt of the decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">Chavez argues further that the unreasonable increase in real
property taxes brought about by Executive Order No. 73 amounts to a
confiscation of property repugnant to the constitutional guarantee of due
process, invoking the cases of <span class="SpellE">Ermita-Malate</span> Hotel,
et al. v. Mayor of Manila (G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-24693, </span><st1:date year="1967" day="31" month="7"><span class="GramE">July 31, 1967</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 20 SCRA 849) and <span class="SpellE">Sison</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Ancheta</span>, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">et </span>al.
(G.R. No. 59431, July 25, 1984, 130 SCRA 654).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The reliance on these two cases is certainly misplaced because
the due process requirement called for therein applies to the "power to
tax." Executive Order No. 73 does not impose new taxes nor increase taxes.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, the government recognized the financial burden to the
taxpayers that will result from an increase in real property taxes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, Executive Order No. 1019 was issued on
<st1:date year="1985" day="18" month="4">April 18, 1985</st1:date>, deferring
the implementation of the increase in real property taxes resulting from the
revised real property assessments, from <st1:date year="1985" day="1" month="1">January
 1, 1985</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1988" day="1" month="1">January 1, 1988</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Section 5 thereof is quoted herein as
follows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 5.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The increase in real property taxes resulting
from the revised real property assessments as provided for under Section 21 of
Presidential Decree No. 464, as amended by Presidential Decree No. 1621, shall
be collected beginning January 1, 1988 instead of January 1, 1985 in order to
enable the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Local Government to
establish the new systems of tax collection and assessment provided <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">herein and <u>in</u> <u>order</u> <u>to</u> <u>alleviate</u>
<u>the</u> <u>condition</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>people,</u> <u>including</u>
<u>real</u> <u>property</u> <u>owners,</u> <u>as</u> <u>a</u> <u>result</u> <u>of</u>
<u>temporary</u> <u>economic</u> <u>difficulties</u>." (<span class="GramE">underscoring</span>
supplied)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The issuance of Executive Order No. 73 which changed the date of
implementation of the increase in real property taxes from January 1, 1988 to
January 1, 1987 and therefore repealed Executive Order No. 1019, also finds
ample justification in its "whereas" clauses, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREAS, the collection of real property taxes based on the
1984 real property values was deferred to take effect on January 1, 1988
instead of January 1, 1985, <u>thus</u> <u>depriving</u> <u>the</u> <u>local</u>
<u>government</u> <u>units</u> <u>of</u> <u>an</u> <u>additional</u> <u>source</u>
<u>of</u> <u>revenue</u>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREAS, there is an <u>urgent</u> <u>need</u> <u>for</u> <u>local</u>
<u>governments</u> <u>to</u> <u>augment</u> <u>their</u> <u>financial</u> <u>resources</u>
<u>to</u> <u>meet</u> <u>the</u> <u>rising</u> <u>cost</u> <u>of</u> <u>rendering</u>
<u>effective</u> <u>services</u> <u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>people</u>; (underscoring
supplied)</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The other allegation of ROAP that Presidential Decree No. 464 is <span class="GramE">unconstitutional,</span> is not proper to be resolved in the
present petition.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As stated at the
outset, the issue here is limited to the constitutionality of Executive Order
No. 73.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Intervention is not an
independent proceeding, but an ancillary and supplemental one which, in the
nature of things, unless otherwise provided for by legislation (or Rules of
Court), must be in subordination to the main proceeding, and it may be laid
down as a general rule that an intervention is limited to the field of
litigation open to the original parties (59 Am. <span class="SpellE">Jur</span>.
950; Garcia, etc., et al. v. David, et al., 67 Phil. 279).</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the observation of the Office of the Solicitor General
that without Executive Order No. 73, the basis for collection of real property
taxes will still be the 1978 revision of property values.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, to continue collecting real
property taxes based on valuations arrived at several years ago, in disregard
of the increases in the value of real properties that have occurred since then,
is not in consonance with a sound tax system.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Fiscal adequacy, which is one of the characteristics of a sound tax
system, requires that sources of revenues must be adequate to meet government
expenditures and their variations.</p>
