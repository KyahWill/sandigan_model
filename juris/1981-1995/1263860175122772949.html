Commission (NLRC) which affirmed the labor arbiter's decision ordering herein
petitioner, Hydro Resources Contractors Corporation to reinstate Rogelio A. <span class="SpellE">Aban</span> to his former position without loss of seniority
rights, to pay him <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">12 months <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> in the amount of P18<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
and to pay attorney's fees in the amount of P1,800.00.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

 24, 1978</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">, <span class="GramE">petitioner corporation</span> hired the private respondent <span class="SpellE">Aban</span> as its "Legal Assistant." He received a
basic monthly salary of P1<span class="GramE">,500.00</span> plus an initial
living allowance of P50.00 which gradually increased to P320.00.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1980" day="4" month="9">September 4, 1980</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Aban</span> received a letter from the corporation informing
him that he would be con­sidered terminated effective <st1:date year="1980" day="4" month="10">October 4<span class="GramE">,1980</span></st1:date> because
of his alleged failure to perform his duties well.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1980" day="6" month="10">October 6, 1980</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Aban</span> filed a complaint against the petitioner for
illegal dismissal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The labor arbiter ruled that <span class="SpellE">Aban</span> was
illegally dismissed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This ruling was
affirmed by the NLRC on appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Hence, this present
petition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The only issue raised by
the petitioner is whether or not there was an employer-employee relationship
between the <span class="GramE">petitioner corporation</span> and <span class="SpellE">Aban</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">petitioner questions the jurisdiction of the public respondents
considering the alleged absence of an employer-employee relationship.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The petitioner contends
that its relationship with <span class="SpellE">Aban</span> is that of a client
with his lawyer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is its position that
"(a) lawyer as long as he is acting as such, as long as he is performing
acts constituting practice of law, can never be considered an employee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His relationship with those to whom he
renders services, as such lawyer, can never be governed by the labor laws.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For a lawyer to so argue is not only
demeaning to himself (sic), but also his profession and to his brothers in the
profession." Thus, the petitioner argues that the labor arbiter and NLRC
have no juris­diction over the instant case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The contention is without
merit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">A lawyer, like any other
professional, may very well be an employee of a private corporation or even of
the government.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is not unusual for a
big corporation to hire a staff of lawyers as its in-house counsel, pay them
regular salaries, rank them in its table of organization, and otherwise treat
them like its other officers and employees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>At the same time, it may also contract with a law firm to act as outside
counsel on a retainer basis.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The two
classes of lawyers often work closely together but one group is made up of
employees while the other is not.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A
similar arrange­ment may exist as to doctors, nurses, dentists, public
relations practitioners, and other professionals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">This Court is not without
a guide in deciding whether or not an employer-employee relation exists between
the contending parties or whether or not the private respondent was hired on a
retainer basis.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">As stated in the case of </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Tabas</span></u></span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> v. California Manufacturing Co</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">., </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

26, 1989):<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"This Court has consistently ruled
that the determination of whether or not there is an employer-employee relation
depends upon four standards: (1) the manner of selection and engagement of the
putative employee; (2) the mode of payment of wages; (.3) the presence or
absence of a power of dismissal; and (4) the presence or absence of a power to
control the putative employee's conduct.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Of the four, the right-of-control test has been held to be the decisive
factor."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Aban</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> was employed by the petitioner to be its
Legal Assistant as evidenced by his appointment paper (Exhibit
"A").<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner paid him
a basic salary plus living allowance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Aban</span> was dismissed on his alleged
failure to perform his duties well.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(Exhibit "B")<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Aban</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> worked solely for the petitioner and dealt
only with legal matters involving the said corporation and its employees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He also assisted the Personnel Officer in
processing appointment papers of employees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This latter duty is not an act of a lawyer in the exercise of his
profession but rather a duty for the benefit of the corporation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The above-mentioned facts
show that the petitioner paid <span class="SpellE">Aban's</span> wages, exercised
its power to hire and fire the respondent employee and more important,
exercised control over <span class="SpellE">Aban</span> by defining the duties
and functions of his work.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> lies against the
petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It may no longer question
the jurisdiction of the labor arbiter and NLRC.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner presented documents (Exhibits "2" to
"19") before the Labor Arbiter to prove that <span class="SpellE">Aban</span>
was a managerial employee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Now, it is
disclaiming that <span class="SpellE">Aban</span> was ever its employee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The proper procedure was for the petitioner
to prove its allegations that <span class="SpellE">Aban</span> drank <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">heavily, violated company policies, spent
company funds and properties for personal ends, and otherwise led the employer
to lose trust and confidence in him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
real issue was due process, not the specious argument raised in this petition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The new theory presented
before this Court is a last-ditch effort by the petitioner to cover up for the
unwarranted dismissal of its employee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This Court frowns upon such delaying tactics.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The findings of fact of
the Labor Arbiter being supported by substantial evidence are binding on this
Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(See Industrial
Timber Corp. v. National Labor Relations Commission, G.R. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">No. </span>83616, January 20, 1989).</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="tab-stops:1.0in"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Considering
that the private respondent was illegally dismissed from his employment in
1980, he is entitled to reinstatement to his former or similar posi­tion
without loss of seniority rights, if it is still feasible, to <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> without qualification or deduction for three
years, (D.M. <span class="SpellE">Consunjo</span>, Inc. v. <span class="SpellE">Pucan</span>,

reinstatement prove no longer feasible, the petitioner will pay him separation
pay in lieu of <span class="GramE">reinstatement.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(City Trust Finance Corp. v. NLRC, 157 SCRA

provided by law or the collective bargaining agreement is to be computed based
on the period from 24 October 1978 (date of first employment) to 4 October 1983
(three years after date of illegal dismissal).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
