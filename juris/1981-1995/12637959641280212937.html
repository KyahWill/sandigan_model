				<H3>IN THE MATTER OF THE TESTATE ESTATE OF WILLIAM C. OGAN, DECEASED. NECITAS V. BINAMIRA, EXECUTRIX-APPELLEE, ISABELO V. BINAMIRA, CLAIMANT, VS. NECITAS OGAN-OCCENA, FEDERICO OGAN, NANCY OGAN GIBSON, LIBORIA OGAN GARCIA, OPPOSITORS-APPELLANTS. <br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>GANCAYCO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p align="justify">This is an appeal from the Orders of April 18, 1966 and July 
16, 1966 of the Court of First Instance of Bohol in Special Proceedings No. 423, 
interposed by the executrix and the heirs of William C. Ogan.<br><br>From the 
records of the case, it appears that on February 20, 1961, William C. Ogan, a 
resident of Tagbilaran, Bohol now deceased, executed a will providing among 
others for the institution of his natural children, namely:&nbsp; Lily Paz Ogan, 
Federico Milani Ogan, Nancy Paparan, Liboria Pocoy Ogan, Necitas Pocoy 
Ogan-Occena, William Loserena Ogan and Ruth Alcordo Ogan, appellants herein, as 
his heirs and the apportionment of their respective shares; the designation of 
Necitas Ogan Occena as executrix and Atty. I. V. Binamira, appellee herein, as 
co-executor, both without bond.&nbsp; On March 28, 1961, while the testator was still 
alive, said will was duly admitted to probate.&nbsp; In the proceedings the testator 
was assisted by Atty. Felimon Barria.<br><br>On February 1, 1963, after the 
testator's death, on an <em>ex-parte</em> petition, Atty. I.V. Binamira assisted 
by Attys. Barria and Doron, was appointed Special Administrator of the estate of 
the late William C. Ogan.&nbsp; The executrix filed a motion for reconsideration and 
asked for the immediate issuance of letters testamentary in her favor and her 
co-executor, but it was denied.&nbsp; On March 17, 1963, after due hearing and 
compliance with the required publication, letters testamentary issued in favor 
of the designated executors.&nbsp; On the same date the court <em>a quo</em> issued 
notice to the creditors requiring them to file their respective claims against 
the estate within six (6) months from the first publication.&nbsp; It appears that 
the notice was published in the newspaper of general circulation of the place on 
March 17, 24 and 31, 1963.<br><br>On March 19, 1963, Binamira filed a Motion for 
Approval of his fees as special administrator for thirty five (35) days in the 
amount of P190,000.00 representing 7% of the gross estate in the amount of 
P2,782,799.40 as per his submitted inventory of the estate.&nbsp; On March 30, 1963, 
Binamira's lawyers, Barria and Doron, filed an opposition to the approval of the 
fees and a manifestation asking that they be excused from defending Binamira's 
claim, alleging that although they acknowledge the great and diligent efforts, 
and dedication executed by Binamira, they believe the claim to be excessive.&nbsp; 
After the parties filed their respective evidence and memoranda, the case was 
deemed submitted for decision.<br><br>On July 10, 1963, Binamira filed a motion 
indicating among others that aside from his pending claim, he may file 
additional claims for not more than P300,000.00 between July 8 to September 12, 
1963, the last day for the expiration of the six months period.&nbsp; On September 
16, 1963, Binamira filed a claim for 33% of the gross estate, and a claim 
against the lot of the deceased in Puerto Princesa, Lot No. 5806, covered by TCT 
No. RT-2223, alleging that said lot was given to him by the testator as 
acknowledgment of the services he rendered particularly during the Japanese 
times, and Â½ of the shares of stock of the testator in Bohol Land Transportation 
consisting of 2,363 shares, for alleged various services he rendered in favor of 
the testator dating back in 1923 for acting as guardian in fact; family 
consultant; caretaker; business, financial and legal adviser; and as attorney of 
the testator.&nbsp; The executrix filed an answer setting up Statute of Frauds, bad 
faith, and due compensation and denied allegation of guardianship.&nbsp; Previous to 
Binamira's claim it appears that his wife, Dr. Leocadia Binamira filed a claim 
for P180,000.00 for alleged medical services rendered in favor of the testator 
since 1945, whereas, Attys. Barria and Doron filed their claims for P160,000.00 
and P17,600.00 respectively.<br><br>On the other hand, it appears that on 
September 1, 1964, some of the heirs namely Lily Ogan-Peralta, William Ogan, 
Jr., Ruth Ogan, and the aforesaid claimants entered into a compromise for the 
release of the estate against claims.&nbsp; However, said compromise did not 
materialize.&nbsp; On October 27, 1965, the instituted heirs and the executrix 
desiring to expedite the settlement of the estate of their late father, entered 
into a settlement with various claimants against the estate, including Atty. 
Binamira and his wife, Atty. Barria, and Atty. Doron.&nbsp; The agreement provided 
among others for the release of P820,000 of the estate's fund, P240,000.00 of 
which is for the claimants, P100,000.00 for the protection of the estate's 
interest in Bohol Land Transportation, and the rest for partial distribution of 
the heirs' shares.&nbsp; In the joint motion dated October 27, 1965, the parties 
submitted the compromise to the court for its approval and prayed among others 
that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"x x x upon acknowledgment of Atty. I.V. Binamira of the amount 
due him under the agreement, an order issue confirming his resignation as 
co-executor."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">On October 28, 1965, the Court issued a resolution providing 
among others the approval of the compromise and the release of P820,000.00 and 
requiring each heir to give a bond of P75,000.00 conditioned for the payment of 
the inheritance tax and estate tax.&nbsp; On October 29, 1965, Atty. Binamira and his 
wife acknowledged the receipt of P141,000.00 and P40,000.00 respectively, as 
full payment of their claims and fees against the estate pursuant to the 
agreement dated October 27, 1965.&nbsp; On November 29, 1965, the court, upon joint 
manifestation of the executrix and Atty. Binamira, issued a resolution 
confirming the approval of the resignation of Binamira as co?executor.<br><br>On 
December 18, 1965, the court issued a resolution requiring Atty. Binamira to 
submit the final and closing account of the estate.&nbsp; On January 14, 1966, 
Binamira submitted his final report together with a manifestation and motion 
praying among others for the payment of P23,000.00 as full settlement of his 
claim, P2,000.00 as compensation for services rendered from October 27, 1965 to 
January 14, 1966 and for the annotation of his 40% individual interest over Lot 
5306 or for the cancellation of the title and the issuance of a new one in his 
name and the estate.&nbsp; On February 24, 1966, the executor and the heirs filed an 
opposition praying that the motion for additional fees be denied on the ground 
that it is already barred by the compromise agreement.&nbsp; Binamira filed a reply 
alleging among others that the compromise refers only to past services rendered 
and not to those subsequently rendered.&nbsp; On April 18, 1966, the court <em>a 
quo</em> granted the claim and later denied the motion for 
reconsideration.<br><br>Hence, the present appeal before Us, on pure questions 
of law, raising the following assignment of errors:</p>
<p align="center">"FIRST ERROR</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN GRANTING FORMER CO-EXECUTOR-APPELLEE 
I. V. BINAMIRA'S NEW CLAIM OF P2,000.00 FILED UNDER DATE OF JANUARY 14, 1966, 
DESPITE THE COMPROMISE AGREEMENT INVOLVING THE HEREIN PARTIES DATED OCTOBER 27, 
1965, EMBODIED IN A LONG FINAL AND EXECUTORY JUDGMENT OF THE LOWER COURT DATED 
OCTOBER 28, 1965 x x x. </p></blockquote>
<p align="center">SECOND ERROR</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN PROVIDING IN ITS ORDER OF APRIL 18, 
1966 THAT FORMER CO-EXECUTOR I. V. BINAMIRA'S 'OTHER CLAIMS BE PRESENTED IN 30 
DAYS FROM RECEIPT OF COPY' OF THE QUESTIONED ORDER OF APRIL 18, 1966 'OR IN 30 
DAYS FROM THE DATE THE ACCOUNT BECOMES ACTUALLY DUE AND DEMANDABLE' DESPITE THE 
COMPROMISE AGREEMENT OF OCTOBER 27, 1965, x x x AND DESPITE THE FACT THAT SUCH 
PERIOD WAS NOT EVEN SOUGHT BY CLAIMANT-APPELLEE.</p></blockquote>
<p align="center">THIRD ERROR </p>
<blockquote>

FOR RECONSIDERATION AND IN HOLDING x x x THAT 'CLAIMS ORIGINATING FROM 
TRANSACTIONS AFTER THE DEATH OF DECEDENT ARE ALLOWABLE AS EXPENSES OF 
ADMINISTRATION AND ARE NOT BARRED BY STATUTE OF NON-CLAIMS..'</p></blockquote>
<p align="center">FOURTH ERROR</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">IN THE LIGHT OF THE PREVIOUSLY-DISCUSSED ERRORS, THE LOWER 
COURT ERRED IN NOT DENYING OR STRIKING OUT FORMER CO?EXECUTOR-APPELLEE'S NEW 
CLAIM OF JANUARY 14, 1966, WITH DOUBLE OR TREBLE COSTS AGAINST 
CLAIMANT."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">(Note:&nbsp; During the pendency of this appeal, Atty. Binamira died 
and he was substituted by his heirs as appellees)<br><br>Appellants contend that 
it is an error for the lower court to approve the additional claim of Atty. I. 
V. Binamira for P2,000.00 representing his compensation for services rendered in 
filing the final accounts of the estate of the deceased William C. Ogan, as 
directed in the order of April 18, 1966, of the court <em>a quo</em>, and 
directing Binamira to present other claims within thirty (30) days from receipt 
of the aforesaid order, despite approval and finality of the compromise 
agreement of October 27, 1965, and the receipt by Binamira of P141,000.00, which 
serves to bar not only re-assertion of all claims against the estate and that 
the order directing Binamira to present other claims was issued in excess of 
jurisdiction as it was never prayed for in his motion for additional fees of 
P2,000.00.<br><br>The appeal is meritorious.&nbsp; A close examination of the 
compromise agreement of October 27, 1965 will disclose that claims against the 
estate existing at the time of its execution and all future claims of the 
parties to the compromise including that of Binamira, are barred by the 
compromise when it provided:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">'5.&nbsp;xxx That all lawyers of the claimants and of the 
CO-EXECUTOR, AS WELL AS THE CO-EXECUTOR, <em>WAIVE WHATEVER RIGHTS, IF ANY, TO 
COLLECT FROM THE ESTATE AND/OR THE HEIRS ANY AMOUNTS OTHER THAN THOSE MENTIONED 
IN PAR. 1 ABOVE</em>; EXCEPT THE REIMBURSEMENT DUE THE CO-EXECUTOR I. V. 
BINAMIRA FOR ALL LEGITIMATE EXPENSES HE INCURRED UP TO THE FINAL APPROVAL OF 
THIS COMPROMISE by the Court;' (underscoring ours)</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">In the case at bar, it would be seen and as admitted by 
appellee himself (p. 3, Appellee's brief) that the second compromise agreement 
(Oct. 27, 1965) was entered into by the appellants to expedite settlement of 
claims.&nbsp; Thus, the essence of compromises being mutual concessions by the 
parties to avoid or end litigation, it is to be expected that neither will be 
able to maintain his initial demands wholly unaltered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>Hence, the well-settled rule that 
"a compromise, once approved by final orders of the court has the force of 
<em>res judicata</em> between the parties and should not be disturbed except for 
vices of consent or forgery"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> none of 
which is alleged herein, is applicable and thus bars the claims of Atty. 
Binamira.<br><br>The lower court ruled that the payment of the additional 
P2,000.00 is allowed under paragraph 5 of the compromise as reimbursement for 
expenses of administration incurred by Binamira and accordingly not barred under 
the statute of non-claims.&nbsp; It ruled further that the compromise cannot be 
considered as final due to the absence of approval of all concerned.<br><br>We 
do not agree.&nbsp; First, the compromise was signed by Atty. I.V. Binamira and he 
duly acknowledged receipt of the P141,000.00 as full consideration of his claim 
and it was the very reason why he acceeded to the compromise.&nbsp; He even joined 
the appellants in their motion to approve his resignation as co-executor.&nbsp; Thus, 
the right to impugn the finality of the compromise, if ever, may be availed of 
by the heirs who have not signed the compromise and not by Binamira, who by 
virtue of his acts is estopped to contest the finality of the compromise, hence, 
the statute of non-claims finds no room for application.<br><br>Second, the 
provision regarding the allowable reimbursement refers only to legitimate 
expenses incurred from the time Binamira was appointed co-executor up to the 
final approval of the compromise, hence, considering that his claim is for 
compensation of services rendered from October 27, 1965 up to January 14, 1966, 
it is crystal clear that it does not fall within the ambit of the exception 
neither as to the nature nor as to the time frame.<br><br>Lastly, the finality 
of the compromise should not be taken to mean that, it in effect terminates 
Binamira's obligation as co-executor.&nbsp; Under the Revised Rules of Court, Rule 
85, Section 8, Atty. Binamira is obliged to render further accounts as the court 
may require until the estate is wholly settled.&nbsp; Thus, it has been held 
that,</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"x x x <em>the duty of an administrator to render an account is 
not a mere incident of an administration proceeding which can be waived or 
disregarded when the same is terminated, but that it is a duty&nbsp; that has to be 
performed and duly acted upon by the court before the administration is finally 
ordered closed and terminated</em>.&nbsp; x x x."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> (underscoring ours)</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Hence, the award of the additional amount of P2,000.00 to Atty. 
Binamira for the submission of the final accounts of the estate of the late 
William C. Ogan, is contrary to law.<br><br>With the doctrine of <em>res 
judicata</em> at hand, the act of the lower court in incorporating in the 
questioned order the right of Binamira to file other claims against the estate 
within the period of thirty (30) days, is in excess of jurisdiction and without 
jurisdiction considering that Binamira did not seek authority to file other 
claims against the estate and the matter was never raised as an issue by the 
claimant, hence the court <em>a quo</em> could not legally grant the same.&nbsp; It 
is a well-known principle in proceedings that courts of justice have no 
jurisdiction or power to decide a question not in issue<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>.<br><br><strong>IN VIEW OF THE 
FOREGOING</strong>, the orders of the court <em>a quo</em> dated April 18, 1966 
and July 16, 1966, in Special Proceedings No. 423, are hereby set aside, with 
double the costs against appellees.<br><br><strong>SO ORDERED</strong>. </p>
