				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The issue in this murder case is whether <span class="SpellE">Cayetano</span>
Rodriguez, 37, a former policeman, accidentally shot Domingo <span class="SpellE">Balisi</span>, as claimed by the said accused, or maliciously shot
the victim, as claimed by the prosecution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Between eight and <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">nine o'clock</st1:time>
in the evening of <st1:date year="1972" day="1" month="2">February 1, 1972</st1:date>,
a shot from Rodriguez's rifle wounded his neighbor and alleged friend, Domingo <span class="SpellE">Balisi</span>, 31.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
victim was then in the yard of his father, <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span>,
located at Barrio San Jose, San Pablo, <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was conversing with his father and his
neighbors, Ventura <span class="SpellE">Cammayo</span>, Cesar <span class="SpellE">Fulugan</span>
and Vicente <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They were squatting on the ground in a
semi-circle.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Cammayo</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> were facing the gate.</p>

<p class="BODY">Domingo had an entrance gunshot wound in the back, at a point
opposite the left side of his chest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
bullet exited below his right nipple.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Although seriously wounded, he managed to enter his father's house,
followed by <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cammayo</span>
and Rodriguez himself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">gunwielder</span> was silent when <span class="SpellE">Cammayo</span>
asked him why he shot Domingo.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Olimpia</span> <span class="SpellE">Balisi</span>,
the wife of Domingo, who was summoned to her father-in-law's house after the
shooting, asked her husband what happened.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Domingo replied that he was shot by Rodriguez.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He gave the same reply to the barrio captain.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was brought in a jeep hired by <span class="SpellE">Cammayo</span> to the emergency hospital at <span class="SpellE">Cabagan</span>
where a Constabulary investigator took down his <span class="SpellE">antemortem</span>
declaration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In that statement, he again
identified Rodriguez as his assailant.</p>

<p class="BODY">Domingo died on that same night while he was being transferred to
the provincial hospital.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The chief of
police confiscated from the wife of Rodriguez the rifle used in the
shooting.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Rodriguez was not in his
house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He went into hiding.</p>

<p class="BODY">The version of Rodriguez was that while he was pursuing a dog
that was running with his kettle of cooked fish, he allegedly fired at the dog
when it was about to enter <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> <span class="SpellE">Balisi's</span> yard.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
was only during the commotion which ensued after the shooting that Rodriguez
supposedly came to know that Domingo <span class="SpellE">Balisi</span> was
wounded.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Rodriguez claimed that the
wounding was accidental and unintentional.</p>

<p class="BODY">He and the victim were like brothers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He entered <span class="SpellE">Quirino's</span>
house and when he saw Domingo suffering from <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">the gunshot wound, he (Rodriguez) extracted the slug from the exit
wound below Domingo's right nipple.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Rodriguez said that he
was the one who procured the jeep that brought Domingo to the emergency
hospital but he did not go with the jeep because he was afraid that he might be
harmed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He allegedly reported the
shooting to the barrio captain but not to the police because he assumed that he
had not committed a crime.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">He said that he attended Domingo's funeral but this was denied by
his witness, <span class="SpellE">Fulugan</span>, and by the barrio captain.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He testified that when he was informed that
there was a warrant for his arrest, he surrendered to the chief of police
(38-39 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span> Feb. 1974).</p>

<p class="BODY">However, the record shows that the warrant dated <st1:date year="1972" day="12" month="2">February 12, 1972</st1:date> was served upon him
in March, 1972 and he posted his bail bond on the 15th of that month.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He appeared before the Constabulary
detachment at <st1:city><st1:place>San Jose</st1:place></st1:city> only after a
release order was issued by the municipal court <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">(p. </span>28, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the prosecution's version was that Rodriguez
suddenly appeared near the open gate of <span class="SpellE">Quirino's</span>
yard and, at a distance of fifteen meters, feloniously shot Domingo whose back
was turned against Rodriguez and while Domingo was conversing with his father
and three other persons.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The shooting
occurred when there was a full moon.</p>

<p class="BODY">As testified by Domingo's widow, <span class="SpellE">Olimpia</span>,
the motive for the cold-blooded assassination was Rodriguez's infatuation for
her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She testified that before she
married Domingo and when Rodriguez was already married to her first cousin, <span class="SpellE">Geronima</span> <span class="SpellE">Balisi</span>, he courted her (<span class="SpellE">Olimpia</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She
rebuffed his advances.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After she married
Domingo, Rodriguez persisted in making immoral proposals to her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She spurned them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Rodriguez denied that he courted <span class="SpellE">Olimpia</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The learned trial judge
gave credence to the prosecution's version and rejected the fish-and-dog story
of Rodriguez.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It convicted Rodriguez of
murder, sentenced him to <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>
and ordered him to pay an indemnity of twelve thousand pesos to the victim's
heirs </span>(Criminal Case No. 51, <span class="SpellE">Cabagan</span>, Branch
III, <span class="GramE">CFI</span> of <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>From that judgment, Rodriguez appealed to
this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">He contends that the
trial court erred in giving probative value to the testimony of the victim's
widow and in finding him guilty of murder beyond reasonable doubt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">These contentions cannot be sustained.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trial court correctly found that
Rodriguez liquidated Domingo in order to eliminate any legal and moral
impediment to his winning the love of Domingo's wife.</p>

<p class="BODY">It did not err in holding that Rodriguez's guilt was proven
beyond reasonable doubt because his testimony that the shooting was accidental
appears to be a palpable fabrication.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> and his son-in-law, <span class="SpellE">Cammayo</span>,
were telling the truth when they testified that they saw Rodriguez deliberately
firing his rifle at the back of Domingo.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>What hit Domingo was not a stray bullet but a bullet that was fired at
him point-blank by Rodriguez.</p>

<p class="BODY">For that same reason, appellant's alternative contention that
lack of intent to commit so grave a wrong should be appreciated as a mitigating
circumstance is untenable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Rodriguez
intended to kill Domingo.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He used a
deadly weapon in consummating the killing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The means which he employed were adequate to bring about the evil which
was caused and intended.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is not a
case where <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the wrongful act was
different from that which was intended.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Nor can voluntary
surrender to the authorities be appreciated in appellant's favor, as argued by
his counsel and as recommended by the Solicitor General.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appellant surrendered only after a warrant
for his arrest was issued and he had found it futile to continue being a
fugitive from justice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court did not err in holding that the crime committed
was murder qualified by treachery.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Rodriguez made a sudden, deliberate and surprise attack on the unwary
and unarmed victim whose back was turned and who did not expect that he would
be assaulted.</p>

<p class="BODY">The testimony of <span class="SpellE">Olimpia</span> <span class="SpellE">Balisi</span> that in a prior incident Rodriguez shot Domingo with
the same rifle, while Domingo was attending to his <span class="SpellE">carabao</span>
but no grave wound was <span class="GramE">inflicted,</span> is not sufficient to
prove evident premeditation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Olimpia</span> did not give any details as to the circumstances surrounding
that incident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No criminal action was
taken against Rodriguez for his alleged attempt against Domingo.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the trial court's judgment is affirmed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against the
appellant.</span></p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>
