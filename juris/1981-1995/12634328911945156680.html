				<H3>JUDGE JOSE A. GALAN, COMPLAINANT, VS. EVELYN NAPASE, CLERK OF COURT AND SALVACION STA. ROSA, STAFF ASSISTANT II, MTC, SIRUMA, CAMARINES SUR, RESPONDENTS. <br /><br />R E S O L U T I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In a sworn letter-complaint (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p.
1), Judge Jose A. <span class="SpellE">Galan</span>, MTC, <span class="SpellE">Siruma</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, charged
Evelyn <span class="SpellE">Napase</span> and <span class="SpellE">Salvacion</span>
Sta. Rosa, Clerk of Court and Staff Assistant II, respectively, of the said
court with gross misconduct and falsification of their Daily Time Records (<span class="SpellE">DTRs</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">As required by this Court, respondents filed their comment and/or
answer to the sworn letter-complaint (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 36).</p>

<p class="BODY">The case was thereafter referred to Executive Judge Jose V. <span class="SpellE">Nepumoceno</span>, RTC, Branch 23, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Naga</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Camarines</span></span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> for investigation, report and recommendation (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 57).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, in a subsequent communication (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 58) dated 25 March 1991, Executive Judge Edgar S. <span class="SpellE">Surtida</span>,
RTC, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Naga</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
was designated to conduct the investigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his investigation, report and recommendation dated <st1:date year="1991" day="15" month="5">15 May 1991</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
pp. 80-84), Judge <span class="SpellE">Surtida</span> made the following
findings:</p>

<blockquote>"The complainant recounted that a verification of the
Municipal court's record (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. -I, I-1, -K to -T and
<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">-U, including its <span class="SpellE">submarkings</span>) and record of the Leave Section of the Supreme
Court (the originals of <span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>.</span> -KK to -TT,
including its <span class="SpellE">submarkings</span>) made by the former on
account of the numerous absences of the respondents revealed to his surprise
that the respondents had failed to reflect in their daily time records
submitted to the Leave Section (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. -KK to -TT)
their actual absences making it appear therein that they rendered services on
all working days without absences when in truth and in fact, they had numerous
absences as clearly reflected in their daily time records submitted to the
complainant (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">-K to -T).</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The complainant in other words, maintained that the correct or
genuine daily time records of the respondents were those submitted to him (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. <span class="GramE">-K to -T and its <span class="SpellE">submarkings</span>) which were based on the log book (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> U) and summary report of absences of court
employees, while the falsified or forged daily time records were those
submitted by the respondents to the leave section of the Supreme Court (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. <span class="GramE">-KK to -TT including its <span class="SpellE">submarkings</span>) which reflect no absences and are not borne
out by the entries in the log book and summary report of absences of personnel.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The complainant recalled that the frequent and numerous absences of
the respondents prompted him to issue several memoranda to the latter (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. <span class="GramE">-B to -H, including its <span class="SpellE">submarkings</span>, folio for exhibits).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The inquiries made by the complainant
revealed that the respondent Evelyn <span class="SpellE">Napase</span> have (sic)
incurred 540 days of absences from the year 1984 up to 1989, while the respondent
Salvation Sta. Rosa incurred a total of 347 days of absences from the year 1985
up to Sept. 1989 (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. -I and I-1).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complainant immediately requested for
certified copies of the respondentsâ€™ daily time records for the years 1988 and
1989 submitted to the Leave Section of the Supreme Court after his discovery of
the falsification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Despite his request
for certified copies of the daily time records, the complainant was issued only
simple <span class="SpellE">xeroxed</span> copies of the falsified daily time
records by the Leave Section which he attached to his complaint.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Due to the frequency of the absences of respondent Evelyn <span class="SpellE">Napase</span> the complainant as early as the year 1986 verbally
withdrew from her the authority to sign daily time records of court personnel,
a task which he himself since then undertook.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The complainant explained that it was some of the entries and his
signatures that were forged or falsified by the respondent Evelyn <span class="SpellE">Napase</span> in <span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. -KK to -NN
because that were made to appear as his signatures over the typewritten names
Jose A. <span class="SpellE">Galan</span> in the said daily time records were not
really his signatures.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">The other falsifications that the complainant referred to in <span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>.</span> -KK to -NN were those entries therein that
were made to appear that Evelyn <span class="SpellE">Napase</span> rendered
service and was present on all working days, when in truth and in fact, she
incurred absences as reflected in <span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. -K to -N and
its <span class="SpellE">submarkings</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Judge <span class="SpellE">Galan</span> maintained that his real or
genuine signatures were those appearing over his typewritten names in <span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. -K to -N.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Judge <span class="SpellE">Galan</span> further contended that some
entries of <span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. -OO to -TT were likewise falsified
because it was made to appear therein that the respondent <span class="SpellE">Salvacion</span>
Sta. Rosa rendered services and was present on all working days, whereas, in <span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. -O to -T her absences or leaves were duly
reflected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, respondent Evelyn <span class="SpellE">Napase</span> signed or approved the originals of <span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. -OO to -TT at a time when she was no longer
authorized to sign or approve daily time records of court personnel considering
that her authority was withdrawn by the complainant since the year 1986.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Upon his discovery of the forgeries Judge <span class="SpellE">Galan</span>
confronted the respondents in the presence of the other staff members of the
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Evelyn <span class="SpellE">Napase</span> promised not to repeat the infraction, while
respondent <span class="SpellE">Salvacion</span> Sta. Rosa just remained silent
although her facial expression revealed that she was a little bit shocked at
the confrontation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Despite the
complainant's leniency and compassion the respondents failed to reform.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complainant claimed to have been scolded
by Deputy Court Administrator <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Bernad</span> when he consulted the latter regarding the
respondents' grave misconduct and falsifications and right there and then <span class="GramE">was</span> directed to file charges against the respondents. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>The complainant out of compassion, allowed
three (3) more months to elapse before he finally filed this administrative
case.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On the other hand, the respondents Evelyn <span class="SpellE">Napase</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Salvacion</span> Sta. Rosa denied the charges against
them calling the same as lies, merely designed to harass and eventually force
them (respondents) to resign from the service (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>.
-1, 1-A and 1-B, p. 36-40, record).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Evelyn <span class="SpellE">Napase</span>
recalled having been appointed on <st1:date year="1970" day="15" month="8">August
 15, 1970</st1:date> as clerk-stenographer and on <st1:date year="1979" day="1" month="7">July 1, 1979</st1:date> as clerk of court with a total of twenty (20)
years, continuous service without having been charged administratively except
in the instant case (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. -2, p. 41, Record).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Evelyn <span class="SpellE">Napase</span>
identified the service records of her co-respondent <span class="SpellE">Salvacion</span>
Sta. Rosa which showed that she was appointed as staff assistant II on July 15,
1985 and served up to the present, or five (5) years continuous (sic) service (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 3, p. 42, Record).</blockquote>

<blockquote>As of <st1:date year="1990" day="31" month="5">May 31, 1990</st1:date>
respondent Evelyn <span class="SpellE">Napase</span> claimed to be still credited
with 12 days vacation leave and 116 days sick leave (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>.
<span class="GramE">-4, 4-A, 4-B, 4-C and 4-D, p. 39, folio of <span class="SpellE">exhs</span>.).</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Evelyn <span class="SpellE">Napase</span> claimed that she always filed an
application for leave whenever she goes on leave of absence.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Evelyn <span class="SpellE">Napase</span> denied having falsified the
signatures of the complainant on the questioned daily time records; maintaining
that it was impossible considering that she has no special skills to enable her
to forge signatures and that she is left-handed while the complainant is
right-handed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She likewise denied the existence
of the originals of <span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. -KK to -TT.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Evelyn <span class="SpellE">Napase</span>
contended that she was the one who signed or approved the daily time records of
court personnel up to the year 1989 when the complainant Judge <span class="SpellE">Galan</span> took it up himself to approve and sign the daily time
records of all court personnel up to the present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She also recounted that before the year 1989,
she was the one who submitted copies of <span class="SpellE">DTRs</span> to the
leave section of the Supreme Court but after 1989 it was Judge <span class="SpellE">Galan</span> who then asked someone in the staff to mail it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent, Evelyn <span class="SpellE">Napase</span>
also admitted that the summary report of absences of personnel (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. I-1) was based on the logbook (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
U) and the <span class="SpellE">DTRs</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The records show that the respondent <span class="SpellE">Salvacion</span>
Sta. Rosa was originally an employee of the Provincial Government of Cam. <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> before she was appointed to her present position as
Staff Assistant II of the Municipal Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Siruma</span>,
<st1:place>Cam</st1:place>. <st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Sur</span>.</st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the year 1980 she was an <span class="SpellE">awardee</span> as an outstanding employee of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>province</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span></st1:placename></st1:place>
by then Provincial Governor Felix <span class="SpellE">Fuentebella</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. <span class="GramE">-5, 5-A and 5-B, p. 44, Record).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The application for leave of absence by
respondent <span class="SpellE">Salvacion</span> Sta. Rosa approved by the
complainant was identified by respondent Evelyn <span class="SpellE">Napase</span>
(<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. -6 to 6-D, folio for <span class="SpellE">exhs</span>.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sta. Rosa's application for leave of absence
was duly granted partially with pay and partially without pay (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. -7, 7-A and 7-B, p. 46), Record).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sta. Rosa had leave credits amounting to
42,442 days in her favor by way of vacation and sick leave credits from the <st1:place><st1:placetype>province</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span></st1:placename></st1:place>
by the time of her assumption of office as court Staff Assistant II.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Despite the fact that Sta. Rosa still had
accrued leave credits, the complainant on Aug. 10, 1990 returned to the
accounting section of the Supreme Court two (2) of her salary checks (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. -9, 9-A and 9-B, p. 48, Record).</blockquote>

<blockquote>The respondent <span class="SpellE">Salvacion</span> Sta. Rosa did
not appear and testify in her behalf on account of her being physically
indisposed according to her defense counsel.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It will be noted from the evidence adduced that the respondent
Evelyn <span class="SpellE">Napase</span> who had been in the service for twenty
(20) years, since the year 1970, can only accumulate a maximum of six hundred
(600) days accrued leave credits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
record also shows that from the year 1984 to 1989 respondent Evelyn <span class="SpellE">Napase</span> incurred a total of 540 days absences or 390 days in
excess of the 150 days that she could have earned as leave credits for said
period of time (1984 to 1989 or a period of 5 years).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is likewise noteworthy that respondent <span class="SpellE">Salvacion</span> Sta. Rosa who had been in the service as court
employee for only 5 years (from July 15, 1985) with 42 days accrued leave
credits at the time of her transfer from the Provincial Government of Cam. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Sur</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span>
could have only accumulated a total of 192 days accrued leave credits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet, the record reveals that <span class="SpellE">Salvacion</span> Sta. Rosa from the year 1985 to September 1989 or
a period of only 4 years had incurred a total of 347 days absences or 155 days
in excess of her accrued leave credits of only 192 days.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is clear therefore from the foregoing that between the
complainant and the respondents, it is the latter who quite obviously have a
strong motive to perpetrate the falsification of the questioned documents (<span class="SpellE">DTRs</span>) and who actually benefited from the said
forgeries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In falsiÂ­fication or forgery,
the person or persons who are or were in possession of, made use of, or beneÂ­fited
from the forged or falsified documents are legally presumed to be the forgers.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">A careful comparison of the specimen signatures
of the complainant Judge A. <span class="SpellE">Galan</span> presented by him in
evidence (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>.</span> <span class="GramE">K-2 to N-2
in -K to -N) on one hand and the questioned signaÂ­tures on the daily time
records of the respondent <span class="SpellE">Napase</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>.</span>
-KK-2 to NN-2 in -KK to -NN), on the other hand, would readily convince any
impartial observer that there are significant differences or discrepancies in
the structure, strokes, form, and general appearance of the two (2) sets of
signatures, so that the inevitable conclusion is that the two (2) sets of
signatures were not written or signed by only one and the same person, namely,
Judge Jose A. <span class="SpellE">Galan</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="GramE">and</span> concluded
that:</p>

<blockquote>"As the evidence stand, it is clear that the complainant has
established by a preponderance of evidence the charge of grave misconduct and
falsification of daily time records against the herein respondents."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="GramE">with</span> the
following recommendations:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, it is respectfully recommended that the
respondents Evelyn <span class="SpellE">Napase</span> and <span class="SpellE">Salvacion</span>
Sta. Rosa, Clerk of Court and Staff Asst. II, respectively, of the Municipal
Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Siruma</span>, <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, be found guilty of grave misconduct and
falsification of daily time records and be accordingly penalized with
suspension for one (1) year with forfeiture of salary and other benefits for
the same period of time."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court, after a thorough and careful examination of the
records of the case, holds that the findings and conclusion of Judge <span class="SpellE">Surtida</span> are supported by the evidence and agrees with his
conclusion that respondents are guilty of grave misconduct and falsification of
daily time records.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the Court
does not agree with his recommendation as to the penalty.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under Memorandum Circular No. 30, series of 1989, issued by the
Civil Service Commission, the respondents' misconduct falls within the
classification of grave offenses, such as for Dishonesty, Grave Misconduct and
Falsification of Official Document.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
corresponding penalty prescribed for such offenses is Dismissal from the Service.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the Court holds respondents Evelyn <span class="SpellE">Napase</span> and <span class="SpellE">Salvacion</span> Sta. Rosa
guilty of gross misconduct and falsification of daily time records and orders
their DISMISSAL from the service with forfeiture of all retirement benefits
except validly accrued leaves, and with prejudice to re-employment in any
government office or agency including government owned or controlled
corporations.</p>
