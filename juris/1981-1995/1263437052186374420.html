reconsideration of the Resolution of the Court dated 27 July 1994 denying its
Petition for Review for failure to show reversible error on the part of
respondent Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class=BODY>The background facts need to be set out in fairly extended form.</p>

<p class=BODY>On 9 May 1991, Civil Case No. 91-57097 was instituted by private
respondent Maximo B. Palarca against Captain Arturo Y. Capada in the latter's
official capacity as Commander, First Coast Guard District, Philippine Coast
Guard.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn1' href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Civil Case No. 91-57097 was basically an action for recovery of personal
property.  In his complaint, Mr. Palarca
alleged ownership over two (2) barges which had been sequestered and detained
by the Coast Guard, i.e., the &quot;Bangsi&quot; and the &quot;Dangsol.&quot;</p>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:"Courier New"'>Ten
(10) days later, on 19 May 1991, petitioner Sawmill</span> filed an
&quot;Urgent Motion for Intervention,&quot; in Civil Case No. 91-57097 claiming
that it was owner<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'> </span>of the two (2)
barges involved.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn2' href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"

On 30 May 1991, the trial court granted the Urgent Motion for Intervention.<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn3' href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Sawmill, as defendant-intervenor, filed an answer-in-intervention.  It is noteworthy that defendant CG Captain
Capada took the position that he was merely a formal party or forced defendant,
and opted not to file an answer to the complaint.</p>

<p class=BODY>The case was then set for pre-trial.  At the pre-trial conference held on 15 October 1991, only
plaintiff's (Palarca's) counsel with proper authority from his client, and
defendant's (CG Captain Capada's) counsel, appeared.  Neither defendant-intervenor Sawmill nor its counsel
appeared.  On the same day,
defendant-intervenor Sawmill was declared as in default for failure &quot;to
appear despite due notice through its counsel.&quot; The trial court then
ordered the <u>ex-parte</u> reception of plaintiff Palarca's evidence.<span
style='font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:"Courier New"'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY>On 7 November 1991, the trial court rendered its decision
declaring Palarca the owner of the two (2) barges.<span style='font-size:13.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-family:"Courier New"'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY>On 15 November 1991, defendant-intervenor Sawmill and its counsel
learned, for the first time, about the order of default and as well the
judgment by default rendered by the trial court.</p>

<p class=BODY>Sawmill filed on 18 November 1991 a motion for reconsideration of
the order of default.  The motion was
denied by the trial court eleven (11) months later on 23 October 1992.</p>

<p class=BODY>On 16 November 1992, a Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> was filed
by Sawmill with the Court of Appeals assailing the order of default as well as
the judgment by default rendered by the trial court.</p>

<p class=BODY>On 22 January 1993, the Court of Appeals dismissed the
Petition.  In a Resolution dated 28
April 1994, the appellate court denied petitioner Sawmill's motion for
reconsideration.</p>

<p class=BODY>Petitioner Sawmill then went to the Supreme Court on Petition for
Review on 15 July 1994.  On 27 July
1994, the Court denied this Petition for Review for failure of petitioner to
show that a reversible error had been committed by the Court of Appeals.  This Resolution was received by petitioner
Sawmill on 12 August 1994.</p>

<p class=BODY>As already noted, petitioner Sawmill moved for reconsideration of
our Resolution of denial.  The Court
required private respondent Palarca to comment on Sawmill's motion for
reconsideration and at the same time required petitioner Sawmill to submit a
certified true copy of the &quot;Pre-trial Order&quot; of the respondent trial
court.  Sawmill complied by submitting a
certified true copy of the Notice of Pre-trial dated 7 October 1991 issued by
the Regional Trial Court, which was actually the document sought by this
Court.  On 19 October 1994, Palarca
filed through counsel an &quot;Opposition to Petitioner's Motion for
Reconsideration.&quot;</p>

<p class=BODY>Preliminarily, we note that in Sawmill's Petition for Review for <i>Certiorari</i>,
it, on the one hand, assailed the entire proceedings had before the Regional
Trial Court of Manila, Branch 3, in Civil Case No. 91-57097.  Upon the other hand, Sawmill appealed the
decision of the trial court on the merits of the case as well as of the
ancillary matters brought before it.  It
appears to us that this two&#8209;pronged position of petitioner Sawmill, and
the variety of unpersuasive arguments made in that connection, may be attributed
to the fact that it was not only assailing the order of default, but was also,
at the same time, seeking a review of the ensuing judgment against it by
default.  It may be recalled that
petitioner Sawmill and counsel learned of both the trial court's order of
default and its judgment by default on 15 November 1991<a style='mso-footnote-id:
ftn4' href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a> and
thereafter assailed these before the Court of Appeals by Petition for <i>Certiorari</i>.</p>

<p class=BODY>In its present Motion for Reconsideration, petitioner Sawmill has
finally managed to focus its and our attention on its most important
contention:  that the court <u>a quo</u>
had acted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to excess or lack of
jurisdiction when it issued an order of default against defendant-intervenor
Sawmill for its failure to appear at the scheduled pre-trial conference in the
Regional Trial Court.  The Motion for
Reconsideration states:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;<u>This is the very crux of the matter.  There was no notice sent to Petitioner
directly, and there was even no separate notice sent to it through counsel</u>.  And <u>this is evidenced by the notice of
the pre-trial conference itself</u>, x x x.  One does not need to look further than this to determine whether there
was any notice sent in any manner to Petitioner, whose name does not even
appear on the face of the notice.  <u>The
records do not show that separate notices were sent to Petitioner's counsel,
one intended for the counsel and the other for the Petitioner, as in fact there
was only one notice sent</u>.  <u>In the
absence of such separate notice therefore, there is in law and in fact no
notice to the petitioner</u>, and the Respondent Court committed grave abuse of
discretion in so finding that there was due notice, contrary to the ruling laid
down in the Taroma case it itself cited.&quot;<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn5'

style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a> the
mandatory requirement to serve separately notices of pre-trial upon the parties
and counsel of record was amplified:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;x x x, the Court in <u>reaffirming the ruling  that notice of pre-trial must be served  separately upon the party and his counsel
of  record</u>, restates that while
service of such notice to party may be made directly to the party, it is best
that the trial courts uniformly serve such notice to party <u>through or care
of his  counsel at counsel's address</u>
with the <u>express imposition upon counsel of the obligation of</u><u><span
style='mso-bidi-font-family:"Courier New"'> </span>notifying the party</u> of
the date, time and place of the pre-trial conference <u>and assuring that
the  party either appear thereat or deliver

represent the party with power to compromise the case, <u>with the warning that
a party who fails to do so may be non-suited  or declared in default</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Thus, the <u>notice of pre-trial</u> stating the date, time and
place thereof <u>shall be addressed not only to counsels of record but also to
the parties themselves who </u><u><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>shall
be </span>expressly named</u>, care of their counsel at counsels address of
record.  To take the present case as a
model, the pre-trial notice to respondent and to counsel should read:  ‘Mr. Inocencio Crisostomo, defendant, c/o or
through counsel, Atty. Castor Raval, Laoag City and Atty. Castor Raval, counsel
for defendant, Laoag City' <u>and should contain the express notice that
counsel is charged with the obligation of notifying his client(s)</u>  (plaintiff/defendant) x x x <u>of the date,

appear at the pre-trial conference or deliver to him a written authority to

(Underscoring partly in the original and partly supplied)</blockquote>

<p class=BODY>The rationale of the mandatory character of the service of
separate notices of pre-trial upon (a) the parties and (b) their respective
counsel of record is the recognition by the Court of the</p>

<blockquote>&quot;x x x importance of pre-trial as a means of facilitating the
disposal of cases by simplifying or limiting the issues and avoiding
unnecessary proof of facts at the trial, (or exploring the possibility of an
amicable settlement or of submission to arbitration), and generally to do
whatever may reasonably be necessary to facilitate and shorten the formal
trial.&quot;<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn10' href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10"

<p class=BODY style='text-indent:0in'>Furthermore, in <u>Pineda v. Court of
Appeals</u>,<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn11' href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
the Court reasoned:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Reason and justice ordain that the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
should have notified the parties in the case at bar.  Otherwise, said parties without such notice would not know when
to proceed or resume proceedings.  With
due notice of the proceedings, the fate of a party adversely affected would not
be adjudged <u>ex-parte</u> and without due process, and he would have the
opportunity of confronting the opposing party, and the paramount public
interest which calls for a proper examination of the issues in any justiciable
case would be subserved.  x x x.&quot;</blockquote>

<p class=BODY>Prior to pre-trial therefore, in particular, before a party is
considered non-suited or declared as in default, it must be shown that such
party and his counsel were <u>each</u> duly served with a <u>separate notice</u>
of pre-trial.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn12' href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
Should an order declaring a party non-suited or as in default be issued
notwithstanding failure to serve the required notice of pre-trial upon the
party, <u>or</u> his counsel of record, <u>or</u> upon both, against whom the order
of default is directed, the party declared in default is effectively denied his
constitutional right to due process.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn13'
href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a> The
declaration of default without the requisite notices of pre-trial under Rule 20
of the Revised Rules of Court constitutes grave abuse of discretion.<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn14' href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
The absence, therefore, of the mandatory notices of pre-trial nullifies the
order of<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:"Courier New"'>
</span>default which suffers from a serious procedural vice.  Under such circumstances, the grant of
relief to the party declared in default becomes a matter of right; and the
proceedings beginning from the order of default down to the default judgment
itself should be considered null and void and of no effect.<a style='mso-footnote-id:
ftn15' href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, upon a showing that a separate notice of pre-trial was not served either
upon a party or his counsel of record or upon both, the Court has consistently
nullified and set aside the order of default.  In addition, the Court remands the case for pre-trial and trial before
the trial court, ordering the latter thereafter to render judgment accordingly.<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn16' href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
In e.g., <u>Samson v. Court of Appeals</u>, <u>supra</u>, upon a showing that a
party was not served a notice of pre-trial, the Court remanded the case for
&quot;a full-dress hearing on the merits&quot; although the judgment by default
had already been reviewed (and the petition dismissed) by the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class=BODY>The Notice of Pre-trial in Civil Case No. 91-57097 was addressed
to, and only to, the following parties and counsel:  (a) Max[imo] B. Palarca, plaintiff; (b) Atty. Felix E. Serina,
counsel for plaintiff; (c) Atty. Juan Reynaldo, counsel for the Philippine
Coast Guard; (d) Capt. Arturo Capada, Philippine Coast Guard; and (e) Atty.
Datu Firdausi I. Y. Abbas, counsel for defendant-intervenor (herein petitioner)
Sawmill.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn17' href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
The Notice clearly shows that one Limboy Sangcoran received the Notice of
Pre-trial for Atty. Abbas, counsel for defendant-intervenor.  The Notice is likewise clear that no
separate Notice of Pre-trial was<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-family:"Courier New"'> </span>served on defendant-intervenor
Sawmill directly or through its counsel; for <u>Sawmill was not among the listed
addressees of the Notice</u>.  The
patent absence of service of the Notice of Pre-trial upon defendant-intervenor
Sawmill leaves the Court no other choice but to declare null and void the order
of default of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> as well as the proceedings beginning
from that order of default up to the default judgment itself.</p>

<p class=BODY>Moreover, we note that the Notice of Pre-trial actually sent out
did <u>not</u> contain the express instruction required by <u>Taroma</u> when
notice is served through or care of counsel, i.e., the express imposition upon
counsel of the obligation to notify his client of the date, time and place of
the pre&#8209;trial conference and to assure that his client either appear
thereat or deliver to counsel a written authority to represent him with the
power to compromise the case, with the warning that a party who fails to do so
may be non-suited or declared in default.  In other words, the Notice of Pre-trial here fell very far short of the
requirements laid down in <u>Taroma</u> and subsequent cases.</p>

<p class=BODY>It seems scarcely necessary to note that the circumstance that
petitioner Sawmill was <u>defendant-intervenor</u> rather than an <u>original
defendant</u> in Civil Case No. 91-57097, is immaterial so far as our
conclusion is concerned.  Section 1 of
Rule 20 of Rules of Court provides that the trial court &quot;shall direct <u>the
parties</u> and their attorneys to appear before it for a conference ---;&quot;
in doing so, Section 1 does <u>not</u> distinguish between the original parties
and those who shall have been allowed to intervene by the trial court.  Sawmill, having been granted leave to
intervene, was, as defendant-intervenor, as much a party to Civil Case No.
91-57097 as the original defendant therein, CG Captain Capada who, per his own
admission, was merely a nominal party to the case.</p>

<p class=BODY>In disposing of the issue of whether there was effective service
of the Notice of Pre-trial on defendant­-intervenor Sawmill, the Court of
Appeals said:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;The Rules, however, <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>do
not require </span>that separate notices be sent to client and to counsel.  It is enough that a separate notice to the
client is sent through counsel (citing Taroma v. Sayo, 67 SCRA 508
[1975]).&quot;</blockquote>

<p class=BODY>It is true enough that Section 1 of Rule 20 does not, in <u>expressis
verbis</u>, require that <u>separate</u> notices be sent to client and to
counsel.  What <u>Taroma</u> did was to construe
Section 1 of Rule 20 as requiring such separate notices to client and to
counsel.  <u>Taroma</u> did say that the
separate notice intended for the client need not be sent directly to the client
but could be sent through his counsel along, of course, with the separate
notice to such counsel.  What was
lacking in the instant case is the separate notice to the Golden Flame Sawmill
which, as already noted, was not an addressee of the Notice of Pre-trial.<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn18' href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
This lack of a separate notice addressed to Sawmill was aggravated by the
woefully deficient Notice which had been sent to Sawmill's counsel:  that Notice did not explicitly require that
counsel to inform his client of the details of the scheduled conference.</p>

<p class=BODY>What the Court of Appeals apparently did here was to apply the
general rule set out in Section 2 of Rule 13 of the Rules of Court that
&quot;notice to counsel is notice to parties.&quot; What <u>Taroma</u> and
other cases in effect did was to render such general rule inapplicable to this
specific case of notice of pre-trial conference and to require that separate
notices of pre-trial be served on the parties and the counsel of record.  Accordingly, in <u>Sagarino v. Pelayo</u>,<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn19' href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court said:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;<u>We agree with the counsel of the plaintiff-appellant that
notice of a pre-trial conference should be sent not only to the attorneys but
also to the parties</u>.  The contention
of the defendant-appellee is that notice to counsel is notice to the party,
citing <u>Section 2, Rule 13</u> of the Rules of Court.  There is no question that under the cited
Section and Rule, a notice to counsel is a notice to the party.</blockquote>

<blockquote>This Court, in a long line of decisions, has sustained this
rule.  <u>This particular section is the
general rule governing the filing and serving of papers and orders of courts
upon parties affected thereby</u>.  However, since <u>there is a specific provision of the Revised Rules of
Court governing service of notice specifically for pre­trial conference,
Section 1, Rule 20 thereof</u>, there is no reason for applying the general
rule as the court <u>a quo</u> had done.&quot;<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn20'

<p class=BODY>The Court is not unaware of the &quot;Affidavit of Service&quot;
dated 2 December 1994, i.e., shortly before filing of the present Motion for
Reconsideration, executed by Antero S. Mariano as process server of Branch 3 of
the Regional Trial Court of Manila.  In
that Affidavit, Mariano declared that in the official performance of his

Pre-trial Conference set on October 15, 1991 at 8:30 A.M., x x x:  one Notice for defendant-intervenor Golden
Flame Sawmill Corporation c/o Atty. Datu Firdausi I.Y. Abbas, Suite 203 S.

Datu Firdausi I. Y. Abbas, also at his address; and</blockquote>

<p class=BODY style='text-indent:0in'>The Affidavit obviously collides
frontally with the Notice of Pre-trial, an official court document.  As between the Notice of Pre-trial and the
Affidavit of Mariano (a document first filed at this very late stage), we
consider the Notice of Pre-trial as a much more reliable document.  We note that the Notice of Pre-trial took
pains expressly to indicate that notices were to be given to plaintiff Max[imo]
B. Palarca and his counsel of record Atty. Serina while the same Notice did not
even mention the defendant-intervenor nor name such party, although it named
(almost as an afterthought) petitioner Sawmill's attorney of record, Atty.
Abbas, as an addressee of the Notice.</p>

The Rules of Court does not provide any specific form for the notice of
pre-trial. Justice Bellosillo, in <u>Effective Pre-Trial Technique</u>, <i><u>supra</u>,</i>
proposes certain matters that should be contained in a notice of
pre-trial.  He further provides a model
&quot;Notice of Pre-Trial Conference.&quot; See pp. 103-109.</p>
