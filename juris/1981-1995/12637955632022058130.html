<p class="BODY">&nbsp;Subject of the petition in this case is the decision, dated 
<st1:date year="1985" day="11" month="9">September 11, 1985</st1:date>, of the 
then Intermediate Appellate Court, in AC-G.R. No. 08296, entitled<em> Claudia P. 
Suarez, versus Hon. Felipe Villajuan, Jr., et al.&nbsp; </em>Petitioners seek from 
this Court, by way of <i>Certiorari</i>, the review, annulment and setting aside 
of:</p>
<blockquote>(a) The decision of said Intermediate Appellate Court in the 
aforementioned case, remanding the subject <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> 
case to the Municipal Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Meycauayan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, for reopening of trial and introduction of 
additional evidence by both parties; and<o:p></o:p></blockquote>
<blockquote>(b) The resolution dated <st1:date year="1985" day="10" month="10">October 10, 1985</st1:date>, denying petitioners' motion for 
reconsideration for having been allegedly filed out of time and for lack of 
merit.</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">In this Court's resolution of <st1:date year="1986" day="29" month="1">January 29, 1986</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> 
petition was given due course and the parties were required to file their 
respective Memoranda.</p>
<p class="BODY">There is no dispute as to the factual and procedural antecedents 
which led to the institution of this case.<span>&nbsp; </span>From the records, it 
appears that on September 1, 1975, the petitioners herein leased their property 
with an area of 3,303 square meters, located at <span class="SpellE">Libtong</span>, <span class="SpellE">Meycauayan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> to the private respondent Claudia P. Suarez and her 
late husband for a monthly rental of P150.00; that private respondent faithfully 
paid the rentals for the first two years, that is from September, 1975 to 
September, 1977, but thereafter, private respondent desisted from continuing 
such payments; that on January 19, 1982, petitioners sent a letter of demand to 
private respondent pressing for the payment of the rentals in arrears and also 
the surrender to the <span class="SpellE">lessors</span> of the said property; 
that private respondent refused to comply with petitioners' demands.</p>
<p class="BODY">Consequently, petitioners-<span class="SpellE">lessors</span> filed 
an <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case in the Municipal Trial Court of 
<span class="SpellE">Meycauayan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> against 
the private respondent on account of the alleged non-payment of rentals by the 
latter.<span>&nbsp; </span>Answering the complaint, private respondent alleged that 
her non-payment of rentals is justified because petitioners refused to execute a 
contract of lease which would include therein and grant to the lessee an option 
to buy the leased property to be exercised by the respondent within five (5) 
years from the inception of said lease.<span>&nbsp; </span>Petitioners, however, deny 
having agreed to or granted such alleged option to buy to private 
respondent.<span>&nbsp; </span>In fact, petitioners aver that their understanding was 
that private respondents would vacate the premises in <span>case 
</span>petitioners would need the leased premises.</p>
<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">During the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> 
proceedings in the Municipal Trial Court, the children of the defendant Claudia 
<span class="SpellE"><em>Vda</em></span><em>.</em></span> <span class="GramE"><em>de</em></span> Suarez were made defendants-<span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> in the case.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is, however, 
significant to note that after judgment was rendered by the Regional Trial Court 
affirming the decision of the Municipal Trial Court, the defendants-<span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> no longer joined the defendant Claudia Suarez in 
the latter's petition for review filed with the Intermediate Appellate Court in 
AC-G.R. SP No. 05296.</p>
<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="27" month="9">September 27, 
1985</st1:date>, petitioners filed with the Intermediate Appellate Court a 
motion praying therein for an extension of twenty (20) days time from <st1:date year="1985" day="1" month="10">October 1, 1985</st1:date>, within which to file 
a Motion for Reconsideration and on <st1:date year="1985" day="14" month="10">October 14, 1985</st1:date>, filed their Motion for Reconsideration 
without awaiting the resolution <span>of </span>their motion for extension.</p>
<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="12" month="10">October 12, 
1985</st1:date>, petitioners' counsel received a copy of the resolution of the 
respondent court, dated <st1:date year="1985" day="10" month="10">October 10, 
1985</st1:date>, denying petitioners' motion for extension of time based on the 
earlier pronouncements of this Court in the case of <span class="SpellE"><em>Habaluyas</em></span><em> Enterprises vs. Japson</em>, L-70895, 
<st1:date year="1985" day="8" month="8"><span class="GramE">August</span> 8, 
1985</st1:date>.<span>&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1985" day="23" month="10">October 23, 1985</st1:date>, petitioners filed a "Motion for 
Reconsideration of the Denial of the Motion for Extension of Time to File Motion 
for Reconsideration".<span>&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1985" day="4" month="11">November 4, 1985</st1:date>, petitioners' counsel received respondent 
court's <st1:date year="1985" day="25" month="10">October 25, 1985</st1:date> 
order, deny<span>ing petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration for having been 
filed out of time and for lack of merit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">The issues raised by petitioners in the instant case pertain to 
the respondent appellate court's denial of petitioners' motion for 
reconsideration on the ground that it was filed out of time and its decision 
remanding the case to the lower court for further proceedings.</p>
<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">The initial ruling of this Court in the 
mentioned case of<em> Habaluyas vs. Japson,</em> G.R. No.</span> L-70895, dated 
August 5, 1985 (138 SCRA 46), which was relied upon by the Intermediate 
Appellate Court has, however, now been clarified and/or modified by our 
subsequent resolution in the very same <span class="SpellE"><em>Habaluyas</em></span> case.<span>&nbsp; </span>In a <span class="SpellE">clarificatory</span> resolution, dated May 30, 1986, this Court 
decreed in the same <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> case (142 SCRA 208), 
that no motion for extension of time to file a motion for new trial or 
reconsideration may be filed in the Metropolitan and <span>Municipal Courts, 
Regional Trial Courts, and Intermediate Appellate Court, except in cases pending 
in the Supreme Court, and that this rule would be strictly enforced only after 
one month from May 30, 1986, or effective </span>June 30, 1986.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>This Court stated that, "the interest of justice would be better served 
if the ruling in the original decision were applied prospectively from the time 
herein stated.<span>&nbsp; </span>The reason is that it would be unfair to deprive 
parties of their right to appeal simply because they availed themselves of a 
procedure which was not expressly prohibited or allowed by the law or the 
rules." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE"><em>Habaluyas</em></span><em> 
Enterprises, Inc. vs. Judge Japson</em>, Resolution, May 30, 1986,<em> 
Ibid,</em> pp. 211-212).</span></p>
<p class="BODY">As the herein petitioner's motion for extension of time to 
<span>file </span>their motion for reconsideration <span>was </span>filed on 
September 27, 1985, to sustain the denial thereof made by respondent 
Intermediate Appellate Court, will not be proper.<span>&nbsp; </span>There should be 
no drastic application of a judicial ruling which had not yet become final and 
even later clarified and modified.</p>
<p class="BODY">The remaining issue in the instant case is centered on the 
respondent appellate court's decision remanding the case to the trial court for 
introduction of evidence by both parties regarding the alleged verbal option to 
buy the leased property which private respondent claims was granted to her by 
the petitioners-<span class="SpellE">lessors</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>This issue 
arose because of the continuous objections of petitioners to the introduction by 
the private respondent of <span class="SpellE">parol</span> evidence intended to 
establish the alleged option to purchase the leased property.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Petitioners base their opposition on the ground that admission of <span class="SpellE">parol</span> evidence to prove such option is not allowed by the 
Statute of Frauds.<span>&nbsp; </span>The municipal trial court, in Civil Case No. 
997 for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>, sustained the petitioners and ruled 
that the alleged agreement to purchase could not be utilized as a ground to 
resist the suit filed against the private respondent herein who was the 
principal defendant in the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> case.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>The trial court stressed the absence of any written agreement, note or 
memorandum to support the alleged agreement to buy.<span>&nbsp; </span>The trial 
court further considered the fact that the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, Branch III, in Civil Case No. 1693-V-32, where the 
same issue was previously raised in an action for specific performance involving 
the same parties and the same subject matter, in its Order dated July 4, 1983, 
already resolved this issue in favor of the petitioners herein.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>The portion of the decision of the Court of First Instance of Civil Case 
No. 1693-V-32, which was quoted by the Municipal Trial Court, reads as 
follows:</p>
<blockquote>"Defendants further raised the defense of non-compliance with the 
Statute of Frauds.<span>&nbsp; </span>The point is well taken.<span>&nbsp; </span>To 
compel defendants to execute in plaintiffs favor a deed of sale over real 
property admittedly on the basis of an oral contract cannot be judicially 
enforced.<span>&nbsp; </span>An agreement for the sale of real property or of an 
interest therein must be evidenced by some kind of writing or memorandum (Art. 
1403 (2-e), Civil Code).<span>&nbsp; </span>Absent the requisite note or memorandum, 
the claim on which this action is founded is unenforceable under the Statute of 
Frauds (<span class="SpellE"><em>Yuvienco</em></span><em>, et al vs. Hon. A. 
Dacuycuy,</em> L-55048, May 27, 1981)".<span>&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 57)</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">Regarding the claim of partial performance which private 
respondent herein argues take the case out of the coverage of the Statute of 
Frauds, the trial court in its decision ruled that ".... the construction of the 
buildings was made by virtue of the oral lease agreement and not as partial 
execution on the alleged option to <span class="GramE">buy.</span><span>&nbsp; 
</span>Said construction was made after the plaintiffs (petitioners herein) 
offer to lease to the defendant and her deceased spouse, if they are interested 
in engaging in poultry and piggery business.<span>&nbsp; </span>Defendant thereafter 
merely asked plaintiffs for a contract, the latter have at that point in time, 
not agreed to give defendant any option to buy.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(p. 5, TSN, October 17, 1983)."</span> [<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, pp. 57-58; parenthesis supplied].</p>
<p class="BODY">It would thus seem that <span>even </span>assuming that private 
respondent had verbally asked for an option to buy, nevertheless, 
petitioners-<span class="SpellE">lessors</span> had not signified their agreement 
to the same and there is no evidence in writing that such option or privilege 
was ever granted to the private respondent herein.</p>
<p class="BODY">Regardless of the issue of whether private respondent is entitled 
to prove an alleged option to buy, it is evident from the manifestations of 
herein petitioners that the private respondent ceased paying the rentals after 
September 1977, but <span>still </span>continue to be in possession of the 
premises.<span>&nbsp; </span>Such non-payment provides sufficient cause for the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> of the lessee.<span>&nbsp; </span>Private respondent 
herein cannot be justified in unilaterally withholding payment of the rentals 
due.<span>&nbsp; </span>If she <span>was </span>acting in good faith, she should have 
tendered payment of the rentals accrued and accruing and if such are refused by 
petitioners, private respondent should have made a consignation thereof or at 
least deposited the rentals due during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of 
the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case, with notice to petitioners.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>But what appears is that private respondent instituted an unsuccessful 
case for specific performance, which was Civil Case No. 1693-V-32, to compel 
petitioners to execute in private respondent's favor a deed of sale over the 
same real property involved in the instant case (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 57), and yet refused to pay the rentals 
for the property occupied by her for the poultry business.</p>
<p class="BODY">The respondent appellate court gravely erred and abused its 
discretion by directing the remand to the trial court of the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case for further reception of additional evidence 
on an issue which apparently has already been foreclosed in the aforementioned 
related Civil Case No. 1693-V-82.</p>
<p class="BODY">The remand of the instant <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case 
is, in the considered view of the court, <span class="GramE">not proper nor</span> 
justified.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Ejectment</span> cases should be 
expeditiously resolved and terminated.<span>&nbsp; </span>Since the commencement of 
this case in 1982, many years have already elapsed.<span>&nbsp; </span>The municipal 
trial court and the regional trial court which acted on the case all ruled in 
favor of the <span class="SpellE">lessors</span>-petitioners.<span>&nbsp; </span>There 
is lack of any legal basis justifying the remand of the case to the municipal 
trial court for further proceedings in order to resolve anew an issue which, as 
indicated, was already ruled upon in favor of the petitioners in a previous 
civil case before the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>.</p>
<p class="BODY">To remand the case therefore, to the <span class="SpellE">Meycauayan</span> Municipal Court for further proceedings will 
undoubtedly be only a waste of effort and time and to the continuing prejudice 
of the petitioners.<span>&nbsp; </span>It will only prolong the already unjustified 
stay of the private respondent and provide her an unwarranted excuse to remain 
in the leased premises, notwithstanding her non-payment of the corresponding 
rentals for the past several years.<span>&nbsp; </span>This Court should not 
countenance and allow such an unjust and unfair situation to continue.</p>
<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is granted.<span>&nbsp; </span>The 
decision of the then Intermediate Appellate Court is hereby REVERSED and SET 
ASIDE.<span>&nbsp; </span>The decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch XIV, <span class="SpellE">Malolos</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, in Civil Case 
No. 997, affirming the decision of the Municipal Trial Court, but with 
modification, as to the award for attorney's fees, is reinstated and made the 
judgment in this case.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against the private 
respondent, Claudia P. Suarez.</span><span>&nbsp; </span>This decision is immediately 
<span class="SpellE">executory</span>.</p>
