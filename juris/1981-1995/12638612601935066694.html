				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The first impression this
case </span>creates is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">one of shock and
disgust that the National Investment and Development Corporation (or NIDC), </span>a
large government financial <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">institution </span>serviced
by a staff of government lawyers, was declared in default and thereby lost the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">right to contest the private
respondents-debtors' action to write off the balance of their multi-million
debt because <span class="SpellE">NIDC's</span> lawyers </span>were chronically
incapable <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">of meeting <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> <span class="GramE">deadlines</span> and </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">habitually </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">addicted to filing motions for extension of time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">However,
the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">untold story, which has now
come to light, </span>reveals that this case was filed at an extremely
difficult time for NIDC when it was in the throes of being dissolved - in <span class="SpellE"><u>articulo</u></span> <u>mortis</u> so to speak.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As generally happens in such a situation,
with employees and officers separated from the service, and records bundled up
and shipped to the PNB office in Manila, the task of preparing a timely answer
to the complaint was rendered unusually difficult.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The problem of locating the records of the
Victoria Poultry Farm's account was compounded by the fact that the employees
and officers who were familiar with the account had been retired from the
service.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This fortuitous circumstance
was completely ignored by the trial court and the Court of Appeals when they
declared NIDC in default for failure to comply strictly with the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period for filing its answer.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the middle of 1979, Victoria Farms, Inc. applied to NIDC for a
P6.6 million loan to finance its poultry breeder/hatchery project in <st1:place><st1:placename>San
  Pablo</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On December 20, 1979, NIDC granted the
borrower a P7 million loan in the form of U.S. dollars at a conversion rate of
P7.297 to US$1.00 to be amortized according to an amortization table prepared
by NIDC, plus a sub-loan of P2<span class="GramE">,060,000</span>, at interest
rates of 6% and 12% per annum, respectively, payable up to August 1986
according to the amortization schedule.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>To secure the loans, the debtors executed and delivered to the
petitioner on February 18, 1980 a Deed of Mortgage, Credit Agreement, Joint and
<span class="SpellE">Solidary</span> Agreement, Deed of Assignment of Voting
Rights, a Pledge Agreement, and on September 29, 1981, a Deed of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Supplemental Mortgage and consolidated
Amendment/Supplement to Security/Device Agreement which were renewed on
November 19, 1984 upon restructuring the loans.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

books of account still carried an outstanding indebtedness of Victoria Farms,
the private respondents on November 11, 1986, demanded in writing from NIDC

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="19" month="1">January 19, 1988</st1:date>,
the Court of Appeals denied petitioner's motion for reconsideration of the
decision (Annex B, p. 35, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>), hence, this
petition for review.</p>

<p class="BODY">The only issue in this case is whether NIDC was given its day in
court before the default judgment was rendered against it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After deliberating on the records of the
case, we are persuaded that it was a victim of an <span class="SpellE">overspeeding</span>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">administration </span>of justice by the
trial <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">court which, with inordinate
haste, denied it due process of law which would have enabled it to present its
defenses to the plaintiffs' action, foreclosed its right to prove the balance
of the plaintiffs' indebtedness, and effectively extinguished its right to
collect the same.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">A motion for extension of
the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period </span>for filing a pleading
is addressed to the sound discretion of the court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Generally, a <u>first</u> motion for
extension, stating a valid ground <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, is not
denied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Considering that, in this case,
the defendant is a government financial institution which had granted a
multi-million-peso loan to the plaintiffs, that its records were disorganized
and its personnel had dispersed as a result of the dissolution of the
corporation (presumably from having extended too <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">many </span>bad loans), that its defense was
being handled by overworked government lawyers, and, that the Government stands
to lose a sizable chunk of the multiÂ­-million-peso debt if only the debtors'
side were heard, the court should have been reasonably liberal, instead of
unduly strict, in dealing with <span class="SpellE">NIDC's</span> motion for
extension of time to file its answer (<span class="SpellE">Lina</span> vs. CA,
135 SCRA 637; <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Gunigundo</span>,
89 SCRA 178; <span class="SpellE">Amante</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">SuÃ±ga</span>,
64 SCRA 192).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">We, therefore, hold that
the trial court acted with grave abuse of discretion resulting in the loss of <span class="SpellE">NIDC's</span> right to answer and assert its defenses to the
complaint.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The court's error in
computing the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period for filing <span class="SpellE">NIDC's</span> answer, and its arbitrariness in denying <span class="SpellE">NIDC's</span> reasonable motion for extension of that period,
tainted all the proceedings, as well as the default judgment that followed </span>thereafter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">NIDC's</span>
one-day-delay in seeking a reconsideration of the judgment is inconsequential
because the judgment is a nullity.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition for review is granted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The decision of the Court of Appeals in
CA-G.R. SP No. 12332, the judgment by default and the order of execution issued
by the trial court in Civil Case No. 54086 are hereby annulled and set
aside.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trial court is ordered to
admit the answer of NIDC and thereafter to conduct a pre-trial and trial on the
merits of the case in accordance with the Rules of Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against the private
