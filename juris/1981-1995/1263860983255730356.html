<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">The Secretary of </span>Labor
issued the pertinent rules implementing the provisions of Republic Act No.
6640.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Section 8 thereof provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Section 8.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>Wage Increase <span class="GramE">Under</span>

such wage increase was granted in anticipation of the legislated wage increase
under the act.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such increases shall not
include anniversary wage increases provided on collective agreements."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In sum, Section 8 of the implementing rules prohibits the
employer from crediting anniversary wage increases negotiated under a
collective bargaining agreement against such wage increases mandated by
Republic Act No. 6640.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, petitioner credited the first year increase of
P200.00 under the CBA and added the difference of P61.66 (rounded to P62.00)
and P31.00 to the monthly salary and the 13th month pay, respectively, of its
employees from the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of Republic Act No.

<p class="BODY">In sum, the Assistant Regional Director ordered petitioner to pay
the deficiency of P200.00 in the monthly salary and P231.00 in the 13th month
pay of its employees for the period stated.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner protested the Order of the Regional Director on the
ground that the anniversary wage increases under the CBA can be credited
against the wage increase mandated by Republic Act No. 6640.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, petitioner contended that inasmuch as
it had credited <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">the </span>first year
increase negotiated under the CBA, it was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">liable
</span>only for a salary differential of P62.00 and a 13th month <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">pay </span>differential of P31.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner argued that the payment of the differentials
constitutes full compliance with Republic Act No. 6640.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Apparently, the protest was not entertained.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner brought the case immediately to this Court without
appealing the matter to the Secretary of Labor and Employment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1988" day="9" month="5">May
 9, 1988</st1:date>, this Court issued a temporary restraining order enjoining
the Assistant Regional Director from enforcing his Order dated <st1:date year="1988" day="7" month="4">April 7, 1988</st1:date>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The thrust of the argument of petitioner is that Section 8 of the
rules implementing the provisions of Republic Act No. 6640 particularly the
provision excluding anniversary wage increases from being credited to the wage
increase provided by said law is null and void on the ground that the same
unduly expands the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:39.0pt">p</span>rovisions of
the said law.</p>

<p class="BODY">This petition is impressed with merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Public respondents aver that petitioner should have first
appealed to the Secretary of Labor before going to court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is fundamental that in a case where <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">only </span>pure questions of law are raised,
the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies cannot apply because
issues of law cannot be resolved with finality by the administrative <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">officer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span></span>Appeal to the administrative officer of orders involving
questions of law would be an exercise <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">in
</span>futility since administrative officers cannot decide such issues with
finality.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
The questions raised in this petition are questions of law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:19.0pt">the
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">failure to exhaust </span>administrative
remedies cannot be considered fatal to this petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the issue of the validity of Section 8 of the rules
implementing Republic Act No. 6640, which prohibits the employer from crediting
the anniversary wage increases provided in collective bargaining agreements, it
is a fundamental rule that implementing rules cannot add or detract from the
provisions of law it is designed to implement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The provisions of Republic Act No. <span class="GramE">6640,</span> do not
prohibit the crediting of CBA anniversary wage increases for purposes of
compliance with Republic Act No. 6640.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The implementing rules cannot provide for such a prohibition not
contemplated by the law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Administrative regulations adopted under legislative authority by
a particular department must be in harmony with the provisions of the law, and
should be for the sole purpose of carrying <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">into </span>effect its general provisions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The law itself cannot be expanded by such
regulations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>An administrative agency
cannot amend an act of Congress.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus petitioner's contention that the salary increases granted by
it pursuant to the existing CBA including anniversary wage increases should be
considered in determining compliance with the wage increase mandated by
Republic Act No. <span class="GramE">6640,</span> is correct.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the amount that should only be
credited to petitioner is the wage increase for 1987 under the CBA when the law
took effect.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The wage increase for 1986
had already accrued in favor of the employees even before the said law was
enacted.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> correctly credited
its employees P62.00 for the differential of two (2) months increase and P31.00
each for the differential in 13th month pay, after deducting the P200.00
anniversary wage increase for 1987 under the CBA.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, it is stipulated in the CBA that in case any wage
adjustment or allowance increase decreed by law, legislation or presidential
edict in any particular year <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">shall </span>be
higher than the foregoing increase in that particular year, then the company
(petitioner) shall pay the difference.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is hereby GRANTED.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Order of the respondent Assistant
Regional Director dated <st1:date year="1988" day="7" month="4">April 7, 1988</st1:date>
is modified in that petitioner is directed to pay its 208 employees so entitled
the amount of P62.00 each as salary differential for two (2) months and P31.00
as 13th month pay differential in full compliance with the provisions of Republic
Act No. 6640.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Section 8 of the rules
implementing Republic 6640, is hereby declared null and void in so far as it
excludes the anniversary wage increases negotiated under collective bargaining
agreements from being credited to the wage increase provided for under Republic
Act No. 6440.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This decision is
