Captain Emmanuel <span class="SpellE">Manzano</span> formed a group composed of
C1C Leo <span class="SpellE">Quevedo</span>, A2C <span class="SpellE">Serafin</span>

waiting for Susana <span class="SpellE">Napat</span>-a.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The latter soon reappeared carrying a brown

<span class="SpellE">Artizona</span> and Peralta, executed a joint affidavit (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. H) <span class="GramE">narrating</span> the
circumstances leading to the arrest of the appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The contents of the brown
carton box were </span>referred to Lt.

<p class="BODY">In her defense, the appellant claimed that she was a vegetable
vendor in the market; that on <st1:date year="1985" day="3" month="2">February
 3, 1985</st1:date> at about <st1:time minute="30" hour="10">10:30 A.M.</st1:time>

who was also a vegetable vendor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Naty</span> <span class="SpellE">Doguiwen</span> was holding a small
box.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While they were waiting for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">a </span>ride, a man <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">approached <span class="SpellE">Naty</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The two talked (which appellant could not
hear), then <span class="SpellE">Naty</span> handed </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">the man the box she was holding.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Suddenly two men approached <span class="SpellE">Naty</span> who speedily
ran away.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The two men gave chase but
were unable to catch her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To Susana's
surprise, the two men </span>came back and arrested her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She was brought to headquarters where she was
investigated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She submitted <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">her counter-affidavit to the City Fiscal (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 1).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On cross-examination, appellant admitted she signed Exhibit
"I" for the prosecution which shows that her rights were read to her
before the investigation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She was
informed of her right to remain silent and to have counsel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All this took place on <st1:date year="1985" day="3" month="2">February 3, 1985</st1:date> in the presence of her counsel,
Atty. Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Tangalin</span>, of the IBP Legal Aid
Office.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>During the investigation, she
signed a receipt for the property that was seized from her and marked as
Exhibit "J".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She admitted that
the brown carton box containing four bundles of dried marijuana leaves weighing
about three (3) kilos, were seized from her at M. <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>,

investigation, she waived her rights under Article 125 of the Revised Penal
Code, so the investigation could continue (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. K).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In this appeal, appellant
impugns the receipt (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. J) <span class="GramE">she</span>
signed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She alleges that the receipt is
inadmissible as evidence against her because her constitutional right against
self-incrimination was violated when she was made to sign it without being
informed of her rights to counsel and to remain silent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">This contention has no
merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appellant admitted at the trial

non-presentation of the poseur-buyer (<span class="SpellE">Quevedo</span>) who
died before the trial, and the informer, as witnesses at the trial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But, as the trial court pointed out, the
death of <span class="SpellE">Quevedo</span> did not destroy the case of the
prosecution, for the sale and actual delivery of the marijuana by appellant to <span class="SpellE">Quevedo</span> were witnessed by Pat. <span class="GramE">Peralta
and A2C <span class="SpellE">Artizona</span>, who testified at the trial (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>. </span></span><st1:date year="1986" day="7" month="11"><span class="GramE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Nov. 7,

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In support of her denial,
appellant cited the testimony of A2C <span class="SpellE">Artizona</span> that he

</span>However, Peralta testified </span>that he saw her give the illegal
package to the poseur-buyer (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>. <st1:date year="1986" day="7" month="11">November 7, 1986</st1:date>, p. 5).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The positive identification of the accused as
the seller of the marijuana prevails over her denials.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Her defense that she was
framed up by the NARCOM team is the usual story of drug pushers or sellers,
which does not impress us (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Agapito</span>, 154

presumed to have performed their duties regularly in the absence of proof to
the contrary (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Natipravot</span>, 145 SCRA 483;
People vs. <span class="SpellE">Asio</span>, G.R. No. 84960, September 1, 1989).</p>

taken.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Carlos V. Figueroa, Forensic
Chemist of the PC Crime Laboratory, testified that the box and its contents
were presented, identified and marked as exhibits in court (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.

had described the evidence in the records (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>. <st1:date year="1988" day="13" month="4">April 13, 1988</st1:date>, p. 2).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In <u>People vs. Mate</u>, 103 SCRA 484, we
ruled that "(e<span class="GramE">)<span class="SpellE">ven</span></span>
without the exhibits which have been incorporated into the records of the case,
the prosecution can still establish the case because the witnesses properly
identified those exhibits and their <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">testimonies
are recorded." Furthermore, in this case, appellant's counsel had
cross-examined the prosecution </span>witnesses who testified on those exhibits
(<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>. <st1:date year="1985" day="6" month="11">November
