				<BR><STRONG>MELENCIO-HERRERA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is a petition for <i>Habeas Corpus</i> filed by the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP), the Free Legal Assistance Group (FLAG); and the Movement of Attorneys for Brotherhood, Integrity and Nationalism (MABINI) on behalf of Attorneys Laurente C. Ilagan, Antonio B. Arellano, and Marcos Risonar, Jr.<br><br>The facts follow:<br><br>On May 10, 1985, Attorney Laurente C. Ilagan was arrested in Davao City by elements of the PC-INP and detained at Camp Catitipan on the basis of a Mission Order allegedly issued by the Ministry of National Defense.&nbsp; On that same day, fifteen lawyers from the IBP Davao Chapter visited Atty. Ilagan.&nbsp; One of the visiting lawyers, Atty. Antonio Arellano, was also arrested and detained on the basis of an unsigned Mission Order.&nbsp; On May 13, 1985, the military sent word to the IBP Davao Chapter that Attorney Marcos Risonar would likewise be arrested.&nbsp; The latter went to Camp Catitipan to verify his arrest papers and was detained on the basis of a Mission Order signed by General Echavarria, Regional Unified Commander.<br><br>This petition for <i>habeas corpus</i> was then filed by and on behalf of the three arrested lawyers hereinafter referred to as the detained attorneys on the ground that their arrests were illegal and violative of the Constitution, since arrests cannot be made on the basis of Mission Orders, and that there appears to be a military campaign to harass lawyers involved in national security cases.<br><br>On May 16, 1985, the Court issued the Writ, required a Return, and set the petition for hearing on May 23, 1985.<br><br>In their Return, respondents contended that the detained attorneys were arrested on the basis of a PDA issued by the President on January 25, 1985; that the Writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> is suspended as to them by virtue of Proclamation No. 2045-A; and that pursuant to the ruling in <i>Garcia-Padilla vs. Ponce Enrile, et al.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>, Courts lack the authority to inquire into the cause and validity of detention of persons held pursuant to the suspension.&nbsp; Respondents further expounded on the state of rebellion in Davao City on the basis of seized subversive documents, implying that the detained attorneys played active roles in organizing mass actions of the Communist Party of the Philippines and the National Democratic Front.&nbsp; Respondents then prayed for the denial of the petition.<br><br>During the hearing on May 23, 1985, the detained attorneys narrated to the Court the circumstances of their arrest and detention.&nbsp; Counsel for the respondents, on the other hand, presented evidence of subversive activities in Davao, but due to lack of evidence linking the detained attorneys with the alleged subversive activities, the Court, on the same day, resolved to order the temporary release of the detained attorneys on the recognizance of the principal counsel of petitioners, namely, retired Chief Justice Roberto Concepcion and retired Associate Justice J.B.L. Reyes.&nbsp; The Court further resolved to give petitioners ten days within which to file a traverse to the Return of the Writ and the respondents ten days to file a Reply thereto.<br><br>The next day, or on May 24, 1985, petitioners filed a Manifestation and Motion stating that the detained attorneys had not yet been released and praying that they be released to the custody of the principal counsel of petitioners at the Supreme Court.<br><br>On May 27, 1985, respondents filed an Urgent Motion for Reconsideration of this Court's Order of Release reiterating that the suspension of the Writ of <i>Habeas Corpus</i> has the effect of ousting the Court of its jurisdiction to hear the case, and attached thereto classified documents consisting of the Report of respondent Brig. Gen. Tan-Gatue stating that the detained attorneys "were arrested not on thee basis of their 'lawyering' but for specific acts of rebellion and economic sabotage as well as for their leadership in the CPP" x x x" even to the extent of attending CPP and NPA rites and using their profession as lawyers as cover-up for their activities in furtherance of CPP goals and objectives;" and that the detained attorneys were involved in the Welgang Bayan in Davao City, a mass action "with demands for the armed overthrow of the government." Sworn statements of several persons also implicated the detained attorneys in alleged subversive activities.&nbsp; Respondents added that, while there is a Court Order directing release, they, too, are under orders, pursuant to the PDA, to hold in custody the detained attorneys until ordered released by the President or by his duly authorized representative, and that the PDA, when issued, constitutes authority to preventively detain them for a period not exceeding one year.<br><br>On May 28, 1985, respondents filed an Urgent Manifestation/Motion stating that an Information for Rebellion was filed on May 27, 1985 against the detained attorneys before the Regional Trial Court of Davao City, Branch X, docketed as Criminal Case No. 12,349; that a Warrant of Arrest had been issued against them; and praying that this Petition be dismissed for having been rendered moot and academic.<br><br>On May 30, 1985, petitioners filed an Opposition to respondents' Urgent Motion/Manifestation contending that since the detained attorneys were not given the benefit of preliminary investigation, they were denied their constitutional right to due process; consequently, the Information for Rebellion filed against them is void.&nbsp; Respondents, on the other hand, filed on the same day a Comment to petitioners' Manifestation and Motion reiterating their prayer for the dismissal of the petition on the ground of mootness by virtue of the proceedings before the Regional Trial Court of Davao.<br><br>On June 3, 1985, petitioners filed a Consolidated Comment and Traverse contending that the "Welgang Bayans" were in legitimate exercise of the constitutional right of expression and assembly to petition the government for redress of grievances; that the detained attorneys' participation was limited to serving in the legal panel and the negotiating panels; that Proclamation No. 2045 is unconstitutional because there exists no factual or legal basis for the suspension of the Writ of <i>Habeas Corpus</i> as provided for in the Constitution; that the evidence presented by respondents against the detained attorneys are of a doubtful and flimsy nature; and that the PDA is unconstitutional because it violates Section 3, Article IV, of the Constitution prohibiting unreasonable searches and seizures.<br><br>On July 1, 1985, petitioners filed a Manifestation and Motion praying that the Court immediately resolve the issues raised as the case affects not only the detained attorneys but the entire legal profession and the administration of justice as well.<br><br>Finally, after two extensions granted by the Court, on July 8, 1985, respondents filed a Consolidated Reply, reiterating first, the validity of Proclamation No. 2045, as amended by Proclamation No. 2045-A and of the PDA issued against petitioners as an incident to the suspension of the privilege of the Writ of <i>Habeas Corpus</i>; secondly, the ruling in <i>Garcia-Padilla vs. Ponce Enrile, et al</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>; and thirdly, its prayer for the dismissal of the petition on the ground of mootness by virtue of the filing of an Information for Rebellion against the detained attorneys before the Regional Trial Court of Davao City.<br><br>As contended by respondents, the petition herein has been rendered moot and academic by virtue of the filing of an Information against them for Rebellion, a capital offense, before the Regional Trial Court of Davao City and the issuance of a Warrant of Arrest against them.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> The function of the special proceeding of <i>Habeas Corpus</i> is to inquire into the legality of one's detention.&nbsp; Now that the detained attorneys' incarceration is by virtue of a judicial order in relation to criminal cases subsequently filed against them before the Regional Trial Court of Davao City, the remedy of <i>Habeas Corpus</i> no longer lies.&nbsp; The Writ had served its purpose.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><blockquote>"SEC. 4.&nbsp; When writ not allowed or discharge authorized.&nbsp; — If it appears that the person alleged to be restrained of his liberty is in the custody of an officer under process issued by a court or judge or by virtue of a judgment or order of a court of record, and that the court or judge had jurisdiction to issue the process, render the judgment, or make the order, the writ shall not be allowed; or if the jurisdiction appears after the writ is allowed, the person shall not be discharged by reason of any informality or defect in the process, judgment or order.&nbsp; Nor shall anything in this rule be held to authorize to discharge of a person charged with or convicted of an offense in the Philippines, or of a person suffering imprisonment under lawful judgment." (Rule 102)</blockquote>If the detained attorneys question their detention because of improper arrest, or that no preliminary investigation has been conducted, the remedy is not a petition for a Writ of <i>Habeas Corpus</i> but a Motion before the trial court to quash the Warrant of Arrest, and/or the Information on grounds provided by the Rules, or to ask for an investigation/reinvestigation of the case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> <i>Habeas Corpus</i> would not lie after the Warrant of commitment was issued by the Court on the basis of the Information filed against the accused.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> So is it explicitly provided for by Section 14, Rule 102 of the Rules of Court, reading:<br><blockquote>"SEC. 14.&nbsp; When person lawfully imprisoned recommitted, and when let to bail.&nbsp; — If it appears that the prisoner was lawfully committed, and is plainly and specifically charged in the warrant of commitment with an offense punishable by death, he shall not be released, discharged, or bailed.&nbsp; If he is lawfully imprisoned or restrained on a charge of having committed an offense not so punishable, he may be recommitted to imprisonment or admitted to bail in the discretion of the court or judge.&nbsp; x x x "</blockquote>But petitioners submit that because of the absence of a preliminary investigation, the Information for Rebellion filed against the detained attorneys is void and the Court below could not have acquired jurisdiction over them, and consequently, they are entitled to release.<br><br>On the other hand, respondents contend that a preliminary investigation was unnecessary since the detained attorneys were lawfully arrested without a warrant.<br><br>Pursuant to the 1985 Rules on Criminal Procedure, no Information for an offense cognizable by the Regional Trial Court shall be filed without a preliminary investigation having been first conducted, except as provided for in Section 7 of Rule 112.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> The Information filed by the City Fiscal before the Regional Trial Court of the City of Davao fell within the exception Thus, the Verification reads:<br><br><blockquote><center>"VERIFICATION</center><br>I HEREBY CERTIFY that I am filing this Information in pursuance with Rule 112, Section 7 of the 1985 Rules on Criminal Procedure, wherein after examining the affidavits of the government witnesses and other documents attached to the records, I found sufficient ground to hold respondents for trial.<br><br><div align="right">(SGD.) EMMANUEL E. GALICIA<br>City Fiscal"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></div></blockquote><br>Section 7, Rule 112, of the 1985 Rules on Criminal Procedure above referred to provides:<br><blockquote>"SEC. 7.&nbsp; <i>When accused lawfully arrested without warrant.</i>&nbsp; — When a person is lawfully arrested without a warrant for an offense cognizable by the Regional Trial Court the complaint or information may be filed by the offended party, peace officer or fiscal without preliminary investigation having been first conducted, on the basis of the affidavit of the offended party or arrested officer or person.<br><br>"However, before the filing of such complaint or information, the person arrested may ask for a preliminary investigation by a proper officer in accordance with this Rule, but he must sign a waiver of the provisions of Article 125 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, with the assistance of a lawyer and in case of non-availability of a lawyer, a responsible person of his choice.&nbsp; Notwithstanding such waiver, he may apply for bail as provided in the corresponding rule and the investigation must be terminated within fifteen (15) days from its inception.<br><br>"If the case has been filed in court without a preliminary investigation having been first conducted, the accused may within five (5) days from the time he learns of the filing of the information, ask for a preliminary investigation with the same right to adduce evidence in his favor in the manner prescribed in this Rule."</blockquote><br>Section 5, Rule 113 of the same Rules enumerates the instances when an arrest without warrant is lawful.<br><br>"SEC. 5.&nbsp; <i>Arrest without warrant; when lawful. </i> — A peace officer or a private person may, without a warrant, arrest a person:<br><blockquote>"(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When, in his presence, the person to be arrested has committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to commit an offense;<br><br>"(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When an offense has in fact just been committed, and he has personal knowledge of facts indicating that the person to be arrested has committed it; and<br><br>"(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the person to be arrested is a prisoner who has escaped from a penal establishment or place where he is serving final judgment or temporarily confined while his case is pending, or has escaped while being transferred from one confinement to another.</blockquote>"In cases falling under paragraphs [a] and [b] hereof, the person arrested without a warrant shall be forthwith delivered to the nearest police station or jail, and he shall be proceeded against in accordance with Rule 112, Section 7.&nbsp; (Rule 113)<br><br>Paragraphs (a) and (b) refer to cases when a suspect is caught in <i>flagrante delicto</i> or immediately thereafter, while paragraph (c) refers to escaping prisoners.&nbsp; As to whether the detained attorneys fall under either of the first two instances enumerated is a question of fact, which will need the presentation of evidence and is more properly within the province of the trial Court.<br><br>The question of absence of a proper preliminary investigation is also better inquired into by the Court below.&nbsp; When so raised, this Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Claudio Teehankee, has held that the trial Court is called upon "not to dismiss the information but hold the case in abeyance and conduct its own investigation or require the fiscal to hold a reinvestigation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> As stressed in <i>People vs. Casiano</i>, 1 SCRA 478[1961], this is the proper procedure since the "absence of such investigation did not impair the validity of the Information or otherwise render it defective.&nbsp; Much less did it affect the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance".<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> The right to a preliminary investigation, being waivable, does not argue against the validity of the proceedings, the most that could have been done being to remand the case in order that such investigation could be conducted.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><blockquote>"x x x the proper forum before which absence of preliminary investigation should be ventilated is the court of First Instance, not this Court.&nbsp; Reason is not wanting for this view.&nbsp; Absence of preliminary investigation does not go to the jurisdiction of the court but merely to the regularity of the proceedings.&nbsp; It could even be waived.&nbsp; Indeed, it is frequently waived.&nbsp; These are matters to be inquired into by the trial court, not an appellate Court."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></blockquote><br>The <i>Nolasco</i> case, which petitioners invoke<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>, wherein this Court ordered the release of two of the accused, is not on all fours with the case at bar as, in the case, the accused were charged only with Illegal Possession of Subversive documents under Presidential Decree No. 33, which is punishable by <i>prision correccional</i> in its minimum period, and the trial Court had granted bail; whereas in this case, petitioners are charged with the capital offense of Rebellion, and the trial Court has not allowed bail.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, this petition for <i>Habeas Corpus</i> is hereby dismissed for having become moot and academic.&nbsp; Petitioners are now detained by virtue of a Warrant of Arrest issued by the Regional Trial Court of Davao City in relation to the criminal case for Rebellion filed against them before said Court.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Makasiar, C.J., Plana, Escolin, Relova, Gutierrez, Jr., De la Fuente, Cuevas,</i> and <i>Alampay, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><i>Teehankee, Concepcion, Jr.,</i> and <i>Abad Santos, JJ.,</i> see dissenting opinion.<br><br><i>Patajo, J.,</i> joins J.

it has been experience.&nbsp; Thus the early Roman law was ritualistic and highly formal.&nbsp; Gradually, however, it evolved and form was replaced by substance.&nbsp; The development of the law did not stop there.&nbsp; The Roman praetorian law enlarged, supplemented and over-rode law which became narrow and rigid in scope.&nbsp; Finally common law produced equity jurisprudence.&nbsp; It is a formal set of legal and procedural rules and doctrines to aid and even override common and statute law in order to protect rights and enforce duties fixed by substantive law.<br><br>The majority opinion appeals to the mind for it appears to be logically constructed.&nbsp; It leans heavily on the letter of the law.&nbsp; Upon the other hand the dissenting opinion of Justice Teehankee which is his article of faith appeals both to the mind and the heart for it is based not only on law but on equity also.<br><br>I believe that Justice Teehankee's opinion better serves the ends of justice and I gladly subscribe to it.&nbsp; I also subscribe to Justice Concepcion's separate opinion.<br><br><br><hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%" align="center"><br><center><b>SEPARATE OPINION</b></center><br><br>CONCEPCION, Jr., J.:<br><br>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; I dissent.&nbsp; The petition is not moot and academic.<br><br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Petitioners should be set free immediately because they were arrested unlawfully, and the information filed against them dismissed for being null and void.&nbsp; However, the authorities may, if they choose to do so, file a case against petitioners in the Fiscal's Office of Davao.&nbsp; The fiscal should conduct a preliminary investigation as required by law.&nbsp; If he finds the existence of a <i>prima facie</i> case, then he should file the necessary information in court.&nbsp; After the court issues a warrant of arrest against petitioners, only then may they be placed in custody.<br><br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Petitioners have a right to a preliminary investigation, and infringement of this right is a denial of due process.<br><br>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; The instances when a person may be arrested without a warrant are clearly laid down by Rule 113 of the 1985 Rules on Criminal Procedure as follows:<br><blockquote>"SEC. 5. <i> Arrest without warrant; when lawful</i>.— A peace officer or a private person may, without a warrant, arrest a person:<br><blockquote>“(a)&nbsp; When, in his presence, the person to be arrested has committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to commit an offense;<br><br>“(b)&nbsp; When an offense has in fact just been committed, and he has personal knowledge of facts indicating that the person to be arrested has committed it; and<br><br>“(c)&nbsp; When the person to be arrested is a prisoner who has escaped from a penal establishment or place where he is serving final judgment or temporarily confined while his case is pending, or has escaped while being transferred from one confinement to another.</blockquote><br>"In cases falling under paragraphs (a) and (b) hereof, the person arrested without a warrant shall be forthwith delivered to the nearest police station or jail, and he shall be proceeded against in accordance with Rule 112, Section 7.&nbsp; (6a, 17a)."</blockquote><br>5.&nbsp;&nbsp; From the facts brought out by the pleadings and at the hearing, petitioners' arrest does not fall under any of the instances enumerated above.&nbsp; Their arrest without a warrant is therefore patently and undeniably illegal and contrary to law.<br><br>6.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as a spring polluted at its source cannot produce a flow of clean water, the unlawful arrest of petitioners cannot give rise to a valid information.&nbsp; The information filed in court against them necessarily is and must remain null and void.<br><br>7.&nbsp; In <i>Morales</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> this Court cautioned against arrests without warrant in this wise:<br><blockquote>"14.&nbsp; Care should be exercised in making an arrest without a warrant.&nbsp; Where there is no justification for the arrest, the public officer could be criminally liable for arbitrary detention or unlawful arrest or for some other offense."</blockquote>8.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is the responsibility of the judiciary to define and maintain the delicate balance between individual freedom and the security of the State.&nbsp; In the fulfillment of this mission, the active participation and assistance of dedicated human rights lawyers are indispensable.&nbsp; They sacrifice time and effort, and take grave risks to defend the rights of their clients.&nbsp; I salute them and say, "May their tribe increase."<br><br>9.&nbsp;&nbsp; At a time when the Armed Forces of the Philippines has to play a salient role in our affairs of government in view of the existence of a rebellion in our midst, there is all the more a greater need for lawyers to defend the rights of individuals against actual or possible abuses of agents of the State.<br><br>10.&nbsp;&nbsp; We must strengthen and solidify the Rule of Law.&nbsp; It is the only way to the survival of democracy in our land.<br><br><br><hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%" align="LEFT"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> G.R.

Presidential Decree No. 1974 did not reduce the penalty for Rebellion under Article 135 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Presidential Decree No. 1834, but merely "tempered" the penalties for "conspiracy or proposal or inciting to commit such crimes," limiting the amended provisions to Articles 136, 138, 141, 142, 142-B, 143, 144, 146, and 147, but not to Article 135 of the Revised Penal Code.<br><br>Considering, therefore, that the detained attorneys are not entitled to bail as a matter of right before the prosecution is heard on its evidence, and observing fealty to the Constitutional mandate that "all persons, except those charged with capital offenses when evidence of guilt is strong shall before conviction, be bailable by sufficient sureties" (Section 18, Article IV, 1973 Constitution), the Regional Trial Court of Davao City, Branch X, should be directed in Criminal Case No. 12,349, to determine whether the evidence of guilt against the detained attorneys is strong, and considering the gravity of the offense charged, it should likewise be required to hear the case to completion with deliberate speed so that their guilt or innocence may be determined without delay.<br><br>Furthermore, pending resolution by this Court of the crucial issues raised in <i>Garcia-Padilla and in Integrated Bar of the Philippines, et al. vs. Min. Juan Ponce Enrile, et al.</i> (G. R. No. 66610) consolidated with <i>National Bar Association of the Philippines, et al. vs. Min. Juan Ponce Enrile, et al.</i> (G. R. No. 66706), it is my view that individuals against whom PDAs have been issued should be furnished with the original, or the duplicate original, or a certified true copy issued by the official having official custody of the PDA, at the time of apprehension.&nbsp; Pursuant to the Rules and Regulations Implementing Presidential Decree No. 1877, as amended by Presidential Decree No. 1877-A, the PDAs should also be enforced within 24 hours in the Metro Manila area or within 48 hours outside Metro Manila, upon receipt by the unit concerned.&nbsp; In this case, although the record does not show such date of receipt, the fact is that the PDA was issued on January 25, 1985 but the detained attorneys were arrested only on May 10 and 13, 1985, respectively.&nbsp; The four-month gap can give room for doubt as to its authenticity and whether, in fact, the detained attorneys posed "any appreciable danger to national security and public order."<br><br>The paramount consideration should be that the Constitutional "right of the people to be secure in their persons x x x against unreasonable searches and seizures of whatever nature and for any purpose shall not be violated" (Section 3, Article IV, 1973 Constitution).&nbsp; Until the issue of the validity of the PDA is finally resolved, PDAs applied for on the basis of militancy alone in national security cases, of insufficient surveillance, or unsupported deductions and inferences, contravene the Constitutional mandate that "no warrant of arrest shall issue except upon probable cause to be determined by the Judge, or such other responsible officer as may be authorized by law, after examination under oath or affirmation of the complainant and the witnesses he may produce" (<i>ibid</i>.).&nbsp; Adherence to Constitutional mandates could ease the current discontent and growing insurgency gripping the nation today.&nbsp; The objective should be to fight for the hearts and minds of the people by observing the rule of law.<br><br>Lastly, I venture to invite attention, particularized for this case, that the Constitution provides for the vesting of judicial power not only in this Court but also in inferior Courts established by law.&nbsp; While this Court can reverse and modify, on appeal or <i>certiorari</i>, actuations of inferior Courts, the latter, as wielders of judicial power, can not only invoke, but also be entitled to, "procedural due process".&nbsp; Without a hearing, howsoever formal, the involved Regional Trial Court branch in Davao City should not be deprived of jurisdiction, substantial or even initial, over persons it has ordered, or confirmed as, arrested.<br><br><br><hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%" align="center"><br><center><b>DISSENTING OPINION</b></center><br><br>TEEHANKEE, J.:<br><br>More than four (4) agonizing months<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[*]</sup> after this Court issued its near-unanimous Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of May 23, 1985, after hearing the parties in oral argument in the morning, ordering the immediate release of the three petitioners-detainees, Attys.

Reyes, President Emeritus of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines, as well as the president and officers of their own IBP Davao chapter, which release it had <i>expressly ordered</i> to be "<i>immediately executory</i>", this Court has now refused to enforce its own release order.&nbsp; Repeated motions for enforcement of this Court's "immediately executory" order of release as against respondents' "brazen disrespect and contemptuous disregard"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> thereof were filed in vain.&nbsp; It has instead dismissed the petition for <i>habeas corpus</i> for having become "moot and academic," because of the <i>arbitrary filing of precipitate, vindictive and oppressive charges against them for the capital crime of rebellion without hearing or preliminary investigation and in gross violation of their constitutional right and rudimentary requirements of due process and fair play.</i><br><br>I.&nbsp; <i>Antecedent Facts</i>.&nbsp; — The three lawyers, Attys. Ilagan, Arellano and Risonar, Jr., FLAG (Free Legal Assistance Group) human rights lawyers of Davao City, were illegally arrested and brought to the military stockade at Camp Catitipan, Davao City one after the other on <i>May 10, 11 and 13, 1985</i>, upon mission orders issued by the prime mover and initiator of the operations, respondent General Dionisio S. Tan-Guate, Jr. (hereinafter referred to as respondent general).&nbsp; The mission orders (which are military orders for carrying out a specific mission or military operation) are not warrants of arrest, much less Preventive Detention Actions (PDA's).&nbsp; The orders did not state what were the offenses allegedly committed, although indicating that they were being issued pursuant to a PDA, which was <i>never shown nor produced</i> by respondent general until a xerox copy thereof dated as early as <i>January 25, 1985</i> was submitted with the respondents' return to the writ.&nbsp; No copy thereof was given the petitioners nor were they given any reason for which the three lawyers were taken into military custody.<br><br>The first lawyer, Atty. Ilagan, was picked up at 10:45 a. m. on May 10<sup>th</sup> while taking a snack with some friends at a place in front of his office at C. M. Recto St. His military arrestors denied his request to be allowed to go to his office "a few meters away" so he could give instructions to his associates about a case scheduled for hearing that afternoon.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> The second lawyer, Atty. Arellano, a law professor at the Ateneo de Davao law school, was one of fifteen IBP. Davao Chapter lawyers who insisted on visiting Atty. Ilagan at the military camp on May 11<sup>th</sup> despite the military custodians' initial refusals that no visitors could be allowed "unless first cleared by R-2 (intelligence) or Gen. Tan -Guate's aide." After the visit, he was told that he was under arrest under the mission order which was merely shown to him and he was no longer allowed to leave the camp.&nbsp; As he told the Court: "I just (went) to visit my colleague, a member of the IBP, to render legal assistance as I'm supposed to do as an officer of the Court.&nbsp; I came to visit, I came to render legal assistance.&nbsp; I was arrested and detained."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> On May 13th, the third lawyer, Atty. Risonar, Jr., having received word from the military that he was wanted, presented himself at Camp Catitipan.&nbsp; He was not shown even the mission order, much less a PDA or warrant of arrest.&nbsp; He was so shaken up by the traumatic experience of being himself wanted and arrested by the military (not having been given even a traffic violation ticket in his whole life) instead of his accustomed role of helping hapless persons who have come across their path and assisting as a member of the Human Rights Committee "not only political detainees, but workers, students, teachers and urban community" that he almost broke down at the hearing and had to be asked to take firm hold of himself.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>After the filing of the petition at bar and the issuance of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> to produce in court the persons of the three lawyers at the scheduled May 23<sup>rd</sup> hearing, they were transferred at 10 p.m. of the night of May 20th to the Metro-Discom stockade in Davao City and herded with a fourth person in a cramped cell, "<i>a very small cell, good only for 2 people</i>." The next day, they were picked up by "2 PC jeeps loaded with fully armed men" and in the words of Atty. Arellano, "in the presence of the detainees in the stockade, …. many of whom are my clients and in the presence of their visitors, …. and in the presence of our wives, …. <i>we were handcuffed like ordinary criminals</i>, and we were transported from that stockade up to the airport and from the airport we were brought to Manila and then we were brought to Camp Bicutan."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> They have been since detained there, their lives shattered, uprooted from their homes and families, and deprived of their livelihood and their families left to fend for themselves.<br><br>The Integrated Bar of the Philippines and other petitioners complain in their verified petition that "(B)eyond the harassment and the illegal arrest and detention of these three advocates, are grave implications for the craft.&nbsp; Their arrest appears to be a prelude to a campaign to ultimately deprive the accused in national security cases of the services of counsel in violation of the Constitution," citing "a readily discernible pattern from events in the recent past" including the killings of FLAG Atty. Zorro C. Aguilar and newsman Jacobo Amatong who gave an ante-mortem statement "that it was the military that shot them" in Dipolog City on September 23, 1984 and the killing of Atty. Romraflo R. Taojo in his own home in Tagum, Davao del Norte on April 2, 1985, who had been allegedly warned by the military about the nature of the cases he was handling.&nbsp; The petition further cited the case of petitioner MABINI trustee and co-founder Atty. Jojo Binay who was successful in having several criminal cases against his client Dr. Nemesio Prudente dropped, but in April this year "found himself a co-respondent with his client Dr. Prudente in a new subversion charge filed by the military with the provincial fiscal of Rizal." Also cited were the cases of Attys. Romeo Astudillo and Alberto Benesa, both former IBP Abra chapter presidents and Abra FLAG chairman and member, respectively, who in the same month of April this year "were arrested by the miliary, charged with subversion, and presently confined at the Constabulary stockade in Bangued, Abra.&nbsp; Since 1979, they were the only human rights lawyers in Bangued, Abra.&nbsp; Since their arrest, there are no lawyers anymore handling such cases."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Between the two of them, they reportedly handled a total of about 120 subversion cases and "not one of their clients was even convicted due to 'lack of evidence.'"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>The petition quoted respondent general's press statement issued on May 10<sup>th</sup> that "x x x the arrest of Ilagan, 'who had lately been engaged in human rights lawyering for suspected persons detained for subversion, rebellion and other charges' was '<i>long overdue</i>.’ (Business Day, May 13, 1985, p. 11)"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> and the exertion of pressure upon other Davao human rights lawyers in this wise:<br><blockquote>"The tension mounted when another lawyer Silvestre Bello III, BAYAN national organizing committee member, got word from Jesus Dureza, president of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines, Davao del Sur chapter, that Estares was 'inviting' Bello to Camp Catitipan.&nbsp; Bello, in an earlier interview, said they were assured by Estares that in case they would be slapped with a PDA, they would not be picked up like what happened to Ilagan but instead just 'be invited' to Camp Catitipan as in Arellano case.<br><br>"Estares, on the other hand, told Business Day they were just 'inviting' Bello to 'visit his friends,' PC-INP regional commander, Dionisio Tan-Gatue also told newsmen, in a phone interview that he was just inviting Bello to visit him.&nbsp; Tan-Gatue, however, declined to comment on whether or not there will be more arrests in the next few days.&nbsp; 'Just wait and see,' he said.&nbsp; (Business Day, May 13, 1985)<br><br>"The aforesaid report has been confirmed by the IBP Davao Chapter."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></blockquote><br>The petition, noting that "(T)hese trends are ominous for members of the Bar especially those who are engaged in <i>pro bono publico</i> work who have incurred the ire of the military,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> invoked the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> as the great writ of liberty on behalf of the three lawyers.&nbsp; IBP President Emeritus J.

The Court therein reminded the police (and the military for that matter) of their <i>duty to extend protection to the demonstrators/participants </i>"staying at a discreet distance, but ever ready and alert to perform their duty."

The good motive but misplaced overzealousness of the military, particularly as headed by respondent general in the Davao area, may be noted, obsessed as they are with keeping peace and order.&nbsp; But it seems appropriate and timely to cite the pointed reminder of the late Mr. Justice William Douglas as reproduced in the <i>PBM</i> case, as follows:<br><blockquote>"The challenge to our liberties comes frequently <i>not</i> from those who <i>consciously seek to destroy our system government</i>, but from men of goodwill – good men who allow their proper concerns <i>to blind them</i> to the fact that what they propose to accomplish involves an <i>impairment of liberty.</i><br><br>"x x x The Motives of these men are often commendable.&nbsp;

and respect their constitutional rights as otherwise there would be no difference as against the outlaws or rebels.&nbsp; For as Brandeis called it, "<i>Crime is contagious.&nbsp; If the government becomes the lawbreaker, it breeds contempt for the law, it invites every man to become a law unto himself; it invites anarchy.</i>" The record again underscores the utter lack of evidence to support the unlawful arrest and detention of the three petitioners-lawyers, thus:<br><blockquote>&nbsp; <br><table  ="" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2">"JUSTICE TEEHANKEE:</td></tr><tr><td width="10%">&nbsp;</td><td width="90%">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q </td><td>All right, I will ask one more question on that.

The same cannot be construed as subversive activities <i>per se</i> or as evidence of membership in a subversive organization" in the absence of proof that "such discussion was in furtherance of any plan to overthrow the government through illegal means;" and that "the judge or fiscal, therefore, should not go on with the prosecution in the hope that some credible evidence might later turn up during trial for this would be a flagrant violation of a basic right which the courts are created to uphold.&nbsp;

This question is better resolved in the separate case filed by the Integrated Bar of the Philippines for the declaration of unconstitutionality of the Presidential Decrees authorizing, among others, the issuance by the President of PDA's without the constitutional requirement that any officer issuing a warrant of arrest must personally examine the complainant and the witnesses he may present.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> Suffice it to state that the PDA against petitioners was already <i>inoperative and stale</i>.&nbsp;

The fiscal misinvoked and misapplied the cited rules.&nbsp; <i>The petitioners are not persons "lawfully arrested without a warrant."</i> The fiscal could not rely on the stale and inoperative PDA of January 25, 1985.&nbsp; Otherwise, the rules would be rendered nugatory, if all that was needed was to get a PDA and then serve it at one's whim and caprice when the very issuance of the PDA is premised on its imperative urgency and necessity as declared by the President himself.&nbsp; The majority decision then relies on <i>Rule 113, sec. 5</i> which authorizes arrests without warrant by a citizen or by a police officer who witnessed the arrestee <i>in flagrante delicto, viz. in the act of committing the offense</i>.&nbsp; Quite obviously, the arrest was not a citizen's arrest nor were they caught in <i>flagrante delicto</i> violating the law.&nbsp; In fact, this Court in promulgating the 1985 Rules on Criminal Procedure have tightened and made the rules more strict.&nbsp; Thus, the Rule now requires that an offense "has in fact <i>just</i> been committed."&nbsp; This <i>connotes immediacy in point of time</i> and excludes cases under the old rule where an offense "has <i>in fact</i> been committed" no matter how long ago.&nbsp; Similarly, <i>the arrestor must have "personal knowledge of facts</i> indicating that the [arrestee] has committed it" (instead of just "reasonable ground to believe that the [arrestee] has committed it" under the old rule).&nbsp; Clearly, then, <i>an information could not just be filed against the petitioners without due process and preliminary investigation.</i><br><br>C.&nbsp; The majority decision's rationale that the <i>Nolasco</i> case invoked by petitioners is not applicable here since the trial court had granted bail to Nolasco for a number of non-capital offenses, whereas in this case petitioners are charged with the capital offense of rebellion and the trial court has not allowed bail.&nbsp; This is erroneously premised.&nbsp; As already emphasized above, the instant information for rebellion against petitioners is null and void for denial of due process.&nbsp; What remains is the PDA, just like in the <i>Nolasco</i> case.&nbsp; There, the trial court granted bail.&nbsp; Here, it is this Court that has granted bail in the form of its May 23<sup>rd</sup> "immediately executory" release order.&nbsp; It certainly would be judicial anathema that this Court ordered compliance with the bail order of the trial court in the <i>Nolasco</i> case and <i>yet feel impotent</i> to enforce <i>its own "immediately executory" release order</i> of the petitioners-lawyers upon their counsel's recognizance.&nbsp; More so, when the petitioners are members of the Philippine Bar and officers of this Court.<br><br>The irony of the situation can be thus depicted.&nbsp; Had this Court simply ordered the <i>immediate enforcement</i> without delay of its May 23<sup>rd</sup> order, by May 24<sup>th</sup>, <i>the petitioners would have not been under detention</i>.&nbsp; There would be no basis to claim that they were "lawfully arrested without warrant" and therefore could be <i>instantly charge</i> for the most heinous crimes <i>without preliminary investigation</i>.<br><br>D.&nbsp; As stressed by the writer in <i>German vs. Barangan</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> "<i>to require the citizen at every step to assert his rights and to go to court is to render illusory his rights</i>." Here, the flaunting and disregard of the Court's immediately executory May 23<sup>rd</sup> release order by not releasing the petitioners-lawyers so that it could be claimed that they fell under Rule 112, section 7 and considered as "<i>lawfully</i> arrested without warrant" wherein "the information may be filed by the .... fiscal without preliminary investigation having been first conducted, on the basis of the affidavit of the offended party or arresting officer or person" (which affidavit had long been executed since January, 1985 while the unlawful arrests were made on May 10-13 and in <i>no way</i> could be termed as <i>in flagrante delicto</i>) would render illusory petitioners' right to due process and preliminary investigation.&nbsp; The majority decision should properly apply the case of <i>Abejuela</i> cited by it<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> that the trial court is called upon "not to dismiss the information but <i>hold the case in abeyance and conduct its own investigation or require the fiscal to hold a reinvestigation</i>." Meanwhile, this Court's release order should be complied with without one moment's delay.&nbsp; Respondents' filing two days later on May 25<sup>th</sup> of an "urgent motion for reconsideration" could in no way cause or justify suspension or non-compliance with this Court's release order.<br><br>15.&nbsp; <i>Same standard in Galman case of not jeopardizing accused's constitutional rights should be applied</i>.&nbsp; — In the recent case of <i>Galman vs. Pamaran</i>, the majority held that "the <i>only way to cure the law of its unconstitutional effects is to construe it in the manner as if IMMUNITY had in fact been offered</i> [by the prosecution] .... (hence) the testimonies compelled thereby are deemed immunized under Section 5 of the same law.&nbsp; The applicability of the immunity granted by P.D. 1886 <i>cannot be made to depend on a claim of the privilege against self-incrimination</i> which the same law practically strips away from the witness." The <i>same standard and concern of not</i> placing the accused "<i>in jeopardy of their constitutional rights" through denial of due process and their right to preliminary investigation should be applied here</i>.&nbsp; The only way is to <i>construe it in the manner as if this Court's release order had in fact been immediately complied with </i>and petitioners could in no way be deemed as "lawfully arrested without warrant." Otherwise, the Rule on preliminary investigation would not be "cured of its unconstitutional effects" by allowing the railroading on May 27<sup>th</sup> of the instant information for rebellion without preliminary investigation thru respondent general's <i>contumacious and unlawful act of disobeying the Court’s May 23rd release order</i>.&nbsp; This was the <i>same standard</i> that would have been applied in the Court's aborted decision in <i>Eastern Broadcasting Corp. (DYRE) vs. Hon. Dans, Jr.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> There, this Court brushed aside respondents' procedural arguments to dismiss the petition as "moot and academic" because of the non-renewal of the petitioner’s radio broadcasting station's license from the time of its summary closure in 1980 up to the time of the Court's determination in July this year.&nbsp; Instead, as noted in the writer's separate opinion therein, this Court "serve(d) notice that in the exercise of the judicial power vested in it by the Constitution, it will issue the equitable writs of <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus to do substantial justice and restore the status quo.</i>&nbsp; In this case, the summary closure of petitioner's radio station in 1980 having been declared null and void and no valid ground for non-renewal of its license having been shown, it is as if the said license has been duly extended up to the end of the current term or year.&nbsp; It is expected that respondents will forthwith return the crystal of the transmitter and place no further obstacle to the prompt reopening of the radio station so that petitioner may pick up the broken pieces and rightfully resume its operations (after almost five years of closure) in accordance with the judgment at bar." Applying this standard to the case at bar, would simply mean that the clock would simply be turned back to the day of this Court's immediately executory release order of May 23<sup>rd</sup> this year, as if the same order had been faithfully and lawfully complied with.&nbsp; Only thus could substantial and not paper justice be done and the petitioners be not deprived of their constitutional right to due process and be secured by preliminary investigation against hasty, oppressive and vindictive prosecution.<br><br>16.&nbsp; "<i>The preservation of freedom, like its perfection, is a never ending struggle.</i>" — This was the exhortation of President Ferdinand Edralin Marcos at the observance at Fort Bonifacio last May 27<sup>th</sup> of American Memorial Day.&nbsp; He admonished the people that "democracy is a condition requiring constant vigilance.&nbsp; Neither totalitarianism nor authoritarianism can by themselves triumph over the democratic ideal.&nbsp; But when free men shirk from their duties to society, as well as to themselves, they imperil their own liberty.&nbsp; When the citizens of a democracy allow themselves to be lulled into indifference, they seal their own doom.&nbsp; x x x If we are to remain free at all, we must show ourselves to be capable and willing to fight in defense of our way of life."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>Former Chief Justice Roberto Concepcion, who with IBP President Emeritus J.
