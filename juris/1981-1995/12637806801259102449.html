conducted seizure proceedings for the avowed purpose of bringing about the forfeiture to the Government of the foreign currency subject of the unsuccessful prosecution in Court, culminating in the rendition by the Acting Collector of a "Decision" on <em>March 7, 1984</em> decreeing such forfeiture, this, despite their full awareness that the currency sought to be forfeited had already been brought out of the country by its owner as early as February 17, 1984 and therefore was no longer within the jurisdiction of the Customs authorities<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> ---</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br>they now assail in this Court the actuations of the Trial Judge as constituting "grave abuse of discretion" deserving of administrative sanction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>It is beyond question that by the filing of the information charging a violation of Central Bank rules, involving specifically identified currency, the Court acquired jurisdiction of the offense as well as of the res, the money.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> It acquired plenary power not only to try and decide the Chief issue of whether or not a crime had been committed by the accused, but also in the light of the resolution of that chief issue, to make such disposition of the property subject of or otherwise involved in the alleged crime as was needful and proper.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>It is also beyond question that after invoking the juris­diction of the Regional Trial Court and actively participating in the prosecution of the case before it, the Customs officials cannot now be permitted to repudiate that jurisdiction or divest the Court of authority over the currency involved in the supposed offense by a subsequent claim of exclusive jurisdiction over the same currency, specially where the Court has already adjudged, after due trial, that the money, not being subject of any crime, should be returned to the owner.&nbsp; Settled is the doctrine that<br><blockquote>" x x x a party can not invoke the jurisdiction of a court to secure affirmative relief against his opponent and, after obtaining or failing to obtain such relief, repudiate or question that same jurisdiction (Dean vs. Dean, 136 Or. 694, 86 A.L.R. 79).&nbsp; In the case just cited, by way of explaining the rule, it was further said that the question whether the court had jurisdiction either of the subject-matter of the action or of the parties was not important in such cases because the party is barred from such conduct <i>not because the judgment or order of the court is valid and conclusive as an adjudication, but for the reason that such a practice can not be tolerated</i> -- obviously for reasons of public policy.<br><br>"Furthermore, it has also been held that after voluntarily submitting a cause and encountering an adverse decision on the merits, it is too late for the loser to question the jurisdiction or power of the court (<i>Pease vs. Rathbun-Jones, etc.,</i> 243 U.S. 273, 61 L. Ed. 715, 37 S. Ct. 283; <i>St. Luis, etc. vs. McBride,</i> 141 U.S. 127, 35 L. Ed. 659).&nbsp; And in Littleton vs. Burgess, 16 Wyo. 58, the Court said that it is not right for a party who has affirmed and invoked the jurisdiction of a court in a particular matter to secure an affirmative relief, to afterwards deny that same jurisdiction to escape a penalty."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></blockquote>The case in question is readily distinguishable from those adverted to by the Customs authorities in which this Court had upheld the exercise by them of exclusive jurisdiction in the matter of seizure and forfeiture of goods involved in alleged infringements of customs or tariff laws or regulations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> In the latter cases, the Customs authorities had from the outset asserted jurisdiction over the goods claimed to have been imported or attempted to be brought out in violation of customs and tariff laws (or laws or rules for the enforcement of which the Customs authorities are charged) and courts had tried to themselves assume jurisdiction over the same goods.&nbsp; But in the case now before this Court, it was the Customs authorities who had invoked the jurisdiction of the Regional Trial Court and laid squarely before it the matter of the determination of the existence of the offense and the disposition of the property involved; and it was only after they had failed to obtain the judgment they obviously expected that they bethought themselves to take over the case by instituting seizure and forfeiture proceedings in their own office.<br><br>Their cause is not enhanced, parenthetically, by their having avowedly conducted proceedings which they clearly knew to be nothing but an empty ritual.&nbsp; They went through the motions of setting for hearing the seizure case instituted by them for the confiscation of the currency in question, of issuing a declaration of default, and of rendering a "Decision" thereon on March 7, 1984<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> although they were fully aware that, as already pointed out, the money sought to be forfeited had already long since been brought out of the country by its owner and hence was no longer within their ju­risdiction or that of any court or entity in the Philippines.<br><br>Finally, reference must be made to the findings of the Hon. Justice Bienvenido Ejercito of the Intermediate Appellate Court, to whom this Court referred the proceedings at bar for investigation and report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>, to the effect that<br><blockquote>" x x x&nbsp; The undersigned Investigator therefore, concludes that respondent honestly believed that her action in ordering the return of the foreign exchange to the accused was correct and that she did not have to allow the customs lawyer an opportunity to elevate the ruling to the proper appellate court. x x x.&nbsp; Considering x x x the pressing circumstances under which respondent had to labor at the time in her belief that it was a tourist case and that it was too late for the Customs to file the warrant of seizure and detention after the decision of the respondent judge had already been promulgated, the undersigned believes that there was no malice or bad faith in the actuations of the respondent judge in not giving time for the customs law­yer to appeal her order of release.&nbsp; The undersigned therefore recommends that the charges against respond­ent for misconduct be dismissed."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the charges against respondent Judge are dismissed.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Teehankee, C.J., Abad Santos, Feria, Yap, Fernan, Melencio-Herrera, Alampay, Gutierrez, Jr., Cruz</i>, and <i>Paras, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%" align="left"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> The information and the evidence leading to the filing thereof, submitted by the Customs officers or employees concerned, are found at pp. 109 (2) (69) to (86) of the <i>rollo.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> The foreign currency was marked as Exhibits F-1 to F-471 and submitted to and admitted by the Trial Court in evidence.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> The judgment of respondent Judge is found at pp. 67-75 of the <i>rollo.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> SEE "Manifestation of Intervention and Opposition to Order", p. 109 (163), rollo.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> SEE TSN, February 17, 1984, pp. 109 (286) et seq,<i> Rollo</i> and Order of respondent Judge promulgated on the same day, February 17, 1984, pp. 109 (169)-(170), rollo.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Pp. 109 (142)-(145), <i>rollo.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Exh."I", Folder of Exhibits for complainant.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> The letter of the Solicitor General dated March 27, 1984, drawing attention of this Court to respondent Judge's osten­sible "grave abuse of discretion," is found at p. 5 <i>rollo.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> <i>U.S. vs. Narvas</i> 14 Phil 410, 411, 412; <i>U.S. vs. Castañares</i> 18 Phil 210, 213, 214; <i>U.S. vs. Ortiz and Regalado</i> 19 Phil 174, 175; <i>U.S. vs. Dela Cruz and Reyes</i> 20 Phil 363, 366-367; <i>U.S. vs. De los Santos</i> 21 Phil 404, 406; <i>U.S. vs. Garcia</i> 27 Phil 254, 255-256; <i>Banco Espanol Filipino vs. Palanca</i> 37 Phil 921, 927-928; <i>People vs. Manaba</i> 58 Phil 665, 667-668; <i>Caluag vs. Pecson</i> 82 Phil 8, 12-13; <i>Layosa vs. Rodriguez</i> 86 SCRA 300, 303; <i>Villa. vs. Ibanez</i> 88 Phil 402, 405; <i>People vs. Santos</i> 101 Phil 798, 800-801; <i>People vs. Bangalao</i> 50 O.G. 4860, 4862; <i>Astero vs. Chief of Police</i> 28 SCRA 1078, 1081-1082; <i>People vs. Zurbano</i> 37 SCRA 565, 567-568.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Art. 45, Revised Penal Code; 21 C.J.S. 121-122; <i>U.S. vs. Bertocio</i> 1 Phil 47,50; <i>U.S. vs. Surla</i> 20 Phil 163, 167-168; <i>U.S. vs. Ga­cutan</i> 28 Phil 100, 104; <i>U.S. vs. Bruhez</i> 28 Phil 305, 309-310; U.S. vs. Hermosilla 31 Phil 405, 411; <i>Villaruz vs. CFI</i> 71 Phil 72, 77; <i>Commissioner vs. Encarnacion and Sadia</i> 95 Phil 439, 442-443; <i>People vs. Exconde</i> 101 Phil 1125, 1132-1134; Collector vs. CTA 102 Phil 244, 254-255; <i>People vs. Jollife</i> 105 Phil 677, 688; <i>Commissioner vs. Capistrano</i> 108 Phil 694, 696-697; <i>People vs. De Leon</i> 109 Phil 574; <i>People vs. De Ocampo</i> 20 SCRA 984, 986; <i>People vs. Doria </i>55 SCRA 436,449.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> <i>Tijam v.
