<p class="BODY">Briefly, the facts which led to the filing of the information
against the accused are <span style="">as </span>follows:</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">At around ten o'clock in
the evening of 26 August 1989, the complainant, Estrella C. Alesna, was asleep
in her room at their house in Siana, Mainit, Surigao del Norte.  The only other persons with her that night
were her younger brother and sister.  While she was asleep, she was surprised to notice accused-appellant
Mario Galve beside her.  The accused
covered her mouth with a pillow, pointed a five (5)-inch knife to her throat
and ordered her to remove her underwear.  The victim, at first, was hesitant but fearing </span><span style="">for </span><span style="">her life, she did as ordered, after which accused-appellant succeeded
in raping her.  As a result of the rape,
the victim became pregnant and she delivered a baby boy nine </span><span style="">(9) months </span><span style="">later.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Accused-appellant's
defense is alibi.  He alleges that being
then </span>a <span style="">gold panner working in
Maputi, Sta Cruz, Agusan del Sur, he was working until six o'clock in the
evening of 26 August 1989.  On 27 August
1989, he attended religious services of the Iglesia ni </span><span style="">Kristo at </span><span style="">Sta Cruz, Agusan del Sur, after which he attended the birthday party of
the brother of a co-worker, Rodolfo Gosun.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In </span><u><span style="">People v. Pascual</span></u><span style="">,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">this
Court stated:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"A rule deeply embedded in our jurisprudence is that when a
woman testifies that she has been raped, she says in effect all that is to be
said<span style=""> to constitute the commission of
the crime.  No</span> <span style="">young Filipina of decent repute would
publicly admit that she has been ravished and abused unless it is the
truth."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the case at bench, the
attempt of accused-appellant to establish his presence at another place at the
time the offense was committed, fails to engender belief.  The clear, positive and credible testimony
of the victim to whom the defense failed to impute any motive except to bring
her ravisher to justice, establishes the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable
doubt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The alibi presented by
accused-appellant leaves much to be desired.  He attempted to establish his presence in Sta Cruz, Agusan del Sur on 27
August 1989 where he allegedly attended religious services of the Iglesia ni
Kristo.  How足ever, it is undisputed that
the distance between the <u>locus</u> <u>criminis</u> and Sta Cruz, Agusan del
Sur can be negotiated in five (5) hours.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Accused-appellant presented a certifi足cate
of attendance signed by officials of the Iglesia ni </span>Kristo.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Even assuming that accused-appellant indeed attended the church services of the
Iglesia ni Kristo on 27 August 1989 in Sta. Cruz, Agusan del Sur, it has not
been shown that it was physically impossible for him to have been at the place
where the victim was raped at the time the rape was committed.  The testimonies of the witnesses for the
defense, at best, were able to establish accused-appellant's presence in Agusan
del Sur before and after the commission of the offense.  Considering that the victim's testimony
positively identifying accused-appellant as her assailant <span style="">was given full credence by the trial court,
the defense of alibi carries no weight and should as </span>a <span style="">consequence fail to exonerate
accused-appellant.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the trial court rendered the judgment of conviction
based on the finding that the victim's testimony deserved credence over the
testimonies of the witnesses for the defense.  Absent any showing that the trial court's findings on the credibility of
witnesses should be dis足regarded, this Court will not reject the same since the
settled rule in this jurisdiction is that findings on the credibility of
witnesses are properly within the province of the trial court which had ample
opportunity to observe and evaluate the demeanor of the witnesses while on the
stand.</p>

of the crime of rape is AFFIRMED.  Costs
