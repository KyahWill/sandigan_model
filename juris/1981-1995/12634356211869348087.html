				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Does the dismissal of the complaint for nonappearance of
plaintiff at the pre-trial, upon motion of defendants, carry with it the
dismissal of their compulsory counterclaim?</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner BA Finance Corporation brought this action as
plaintiff in the court below to recover a sum of money arising from a credit
accommodation in the form of a discounting line which it granted to defendant
Rufino Co, and from certain suretyship agreements executed in its favor by his
co-defendants Highline Mercantile, Inc., Lucita Veloso Yap, Cloverleaf
Supermarket, Inc., and San Andres Commercial.</p>

<p class="BODY">After defendants' Amended Answer to Complaint with Compulsory
Counterclaim was admitted, the case was set for Pre-Trial Conference.  For various reasons, however, the conference
was repeatedly reset.  On 19 December
1989, counsel for plaintiff, petitioner herein, failed to attend the Pre-Trial
Conference.  Consequently, defendants
moved for dismissal of the case without prejudice.  The motion was granted thus ?</p>

<blockquote>“The plaintiff's representative and counsel having failed to appear
for today's setting, Atty. Luis Vera Cruz, Jr., for the defendants moved that
the above-entitled case be dismissed, without prejudice.  Finding merit in said motion, the same is
hereby granted."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On 22 January 1990, private respondents moved to set the
reception of their evidence in support of their counterclaim.  Petitioner opposed the motion.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 2 April 1990, the trial court denied the motion of private
respondents, prompting them to elevate the order of denial to the Court of
Appeals which, on 18 December 1991, reversed the questioned order and directed
the trial court to set the reception of their evidence on their
counterclaim.  Its motion for
reconsideration having on 2 June 1992 been denied, petitioner instituted the
instant petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner contends that the dismissal of the complaint carries
with it the dismissal of the counterclaim.  Private respondents, on the other hand, claim that their compulsory
counterclaim should not have been included in the dismissal.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is merit in the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="tab-stops:153.0pt">The counterclaim of private respondents
is not merely permissive but compulsory in nature:  it arises out of, or is necessarily connected with, the
transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party's
claim; it does not require the presence of third parties of whom the court
cannot acquire jurisdiction; and, the trial court has jurisdiction to entertain
the claim.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The counterclaim of private respondents is denominated “compulsory" and
consists of claims for alleged overpayments and damages.  They assert that they are no longer indebted
to petitioner and are in fact entitled to reimbursement for overpayments.  They ask for damages for expenses incurred
and inconveniences suffered by them as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">a
</span>result of the filing of the present action.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Clearly, the same evidence needed to sustain the counterclaim of
private respondents would also refute the cause of action in petitioner's
complaint.  For, if private respondents
could successfully show that they actually made overpayments on the credit
accomodations extended by petitioner, then the complaint must fail.  The counterclaim is therefore compulsory.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The rule is that a compulsory counterclaim cannot "remain
pending for independent adjudication by the court."<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a> This <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">is </span>because a compulsory counterclaim is
auxiliary to the proceeding <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">in </span>the
original suit and merely derives its jurisdictional support therefrom.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, it necessarily follows that if the trial court no <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">longer possesses </span>jurisdiction to
entertain the main action of the case, as when it dismisses the same, then the
compulsory counterclaim being ancillary to the principal controversy, must
likewise be similarly dismissed since no jurisdiction remains for the grant of
any relief under the counterclaim.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Indeed, as Justice Vicente Abad Santos succinctly puts it -</p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">"x x x x </span>The
petitioner does not object to the dismissal of the civil case but nonetheless
wants her counterclaim therein to subsist.  Impossible.  A person cannot eat
his cake and have it at the same time.  If the civil case is dismissed, so also is the counterclaim filed
therein."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">More recently, this Court ruled that the dismissal of the
complaint on defendant's own motion operated likewise to dismiss the
counterclaim questioning the complaint.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class="BODY">The Rules of Court provides a remedy to recover on defendant's
counterclaim if plaintiff moves to dismiss the case.  Under Sec. 2, Rule 17, defendant may raise objection to the
dismissal of the complaint; in such case, the trial court may not dismiss the
main action.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant petition, private respondents themselves moved for
the dismissal of the complaint.  They
could have simply asked the trial court to declare petitioners to be
"non-suited" on their complaint, and "as in default" on
their compulsory counterclaim, for their failure to appear at the pre-trial
despite due notice.  But private
respondents did not.  Neither did they
reserve their right to maintain their counterclaim.  Consequently, the dismissal of the complaint carried with it the dismissal
of the compulsory counterclaim.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may also be stressed that private respondents moved to set for
hearing the reception of evidence to support their counterclaim more than a
month after the case was dismissed, i.e., they filed their motion after the
lapse of thirty-three (33) days.  By
then, the order of dismissal had already become final.  Thereafter, it was error for the appellate
court to set it aside, there being no ground to warrant it.  Only error of judgment, not error of
jurisdiction, was involved.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, we are not unaware of the seeming unfairness, if not
harshness, of the application of the Rule herein enunciated -- that dismissal
of the complaint for failure to prosecute automatically carries with it
dismissal of the compulsory counterclaim -- to a defendant who may be compelled
to hire counsel to protect him in a frivolous complaint.  Equity and justice dictate that he be
accorded adequate relief under the circumstances.</p>

<p class="BODY">Henceforth, for the guidance of Bench and Bar, if any of the grounds
to dismiss under Sec. 3, Rule 17, of the Rules of Court arises,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
the proper recourse for a defendant who desires to pursue his compulsory
counterclaim in the same proceeding is not to move for the dismissal of the
complaint; instead, he should only move to have plaintiff declared <u>non-suited</u>
on the complaint so that the latter can no longer present his evidence thereon,
and simultaneously move that he be declared <u>as</u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt"> <u>in</u> </span><u>default</u> on the compulsory counterclaim, and
reserve the right to present evidence <i>ex parte </i>on his counterclaim.  This will enable defendant who was unjustly
haled to court to prove his compulsory counterclaim, which is intertwined with
the complaint, because the trial court retains jurisdiction over the complaint
and of the whole case.  The
non-dismissal of the complaint, the non-suit notwithstanding, provides the
basis for the compulsory counterclaim to remain active and subsisting.</p>

<p class="BODY">But the procedure above stated, unfortunately, was not adopted by
private respondents herein in the court below, hence, we reverse the Court of
Appeals and sustain the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the instant petition is <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">GRANTED</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="OTHERHEADING">SEPARATE OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">REGALADO, <i>J</i>.:</p>

<p class="BODY">I concur in the result, whereby the <i>ponencia </i>sustains the
order of the trial court dismissing herein petitioner's complaint and
consequently barring private respondents from introducing evidence on their
compulsory counterclaim by reason of such dismissal, but only for this reason
stated therein, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"It may also be stressed that private respondents moved to set
for hearing the reception of evidence to support their counterclaim more than a
month after the case was dismissed, i.e., they filed their motion after the
lapse of thirty-three (33) days.  By
then the order of dismissal had already become final.  Thereafter, it was error for the appellate court to set it aside,
there being no ground to warrant it.  Only error of judgment, not error of jurisdiction was involved."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">I take exception, however, to so much of the ratio­cinations
therein, although supportive of the same disposition, insofar as they are at
variance with the observations in this separate opinion which I hope may yield
some clarifications applicable to the present controversy.</p>

<p class="BODY">Involved in this case are the issues on the propriety and effects
of the application of Sections 2 and 3, Rule 17 of the Rules of Court to
Section 2, Rule 20 which provides that "(a) party who fails to appear at a
pre-trial conference may be non-suited or considered as in default." We
have heretofore held that the provisions of Section 3 of Rule 17, whereby a
plaintiff may be nonsuited and the dismissal of the complaint has the effect of
an adjudication upon the merits unless otherwise provided by the trial court,
shall have the same equivalent effect on a plainfiff who fails to appear at a
pre-trial conference.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a> We
have perforce to now resolve whether Section 2 of Rule 17 is likewise
applicable to that plaintiff who is nonsuited for non-appearance at such
pre-trial conference.</p>

<p class="BODY">For referential facility, the aforesaid provisions of Rule 17 are
hereunder reproduced, with pertinent emphases supplied:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 2.  <i>Dismissal
by</i> <i>order of the court.  – </i>Except
as provided in the preceding section, an action shall not be dismissed <i>at
the plaintiff's instance </i>save upon order of the court and upon such terms
and conditions as the court deems proper.  If a counterclaim has been pleaded by a defendant prior to the service
upon him of the <i>plaintiff's motion to dismiss</i>,<i> </i>the action shall
not be dismissed against the defendant's objection unless the counterclaim can
remain pending for independent adjudication by the court.  Unless otherwise specified in the order, a
dismissal under this paragraph shall be <i>without prejudice</i>."<i><o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Sec. 3.  <i>Failure to
prosecute.  – </i>If <i>plaintiff </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">fails </span>to appear</i> at the time of the
trial, or to prosecute his action for an unreasonable length of time, or to
comply with these rules or any order of the court, the action may be dismissed <i>upon
motion of the defendant or upon the court's own motion</i>.<i>  </i>This dismissal shall have the effect of
an <i>adjudication upon the merits</i>,<i> </i>unless otherwise provided by the
court."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Also, the concept of nonsuit which we have adopted from American
procedural law<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
is that it is a term broadly applied to a variety of terminations of an action
which do not adjudicate issues on the merits.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> </span>More specifically, it is the name of
a judgment given against plaintiff when he is unable to prove a case, or when
he refuses or neglects to proceed to trial and leaves the issue undetermined.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> </span>In our jurisdiction, a declaration of
nonsuit necessarily involves the rendition of a final order or judgment which
terminates plaintiff's cause of action or right of recovery under his complaint
which is thereby dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Turning back to Rule 17, it is readily apparent that Sections 2
and 3 thereof envisage different factual and adjective situations.  The dismissal of the complaint under Section
2 is at the instance of plaintiff, for whatever reason he is minded to move for
such dismissal, and, <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as a </span>matter
of procedure, </i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">is </span>without
prejudice unless otherwise stated in the order of the court or, for that
matter, in plaintiff's motion to dismiss his own complaint.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a> By
reason thereof, to curb any dubious or frivolous strategy of plaintiff for his
benefit or to obviate possible prejudice to defendant, the former may not
dismiss his complaint over the defendant's objection if the latter has a
compulsory counterclaim since said counterclaim would necessarily be divested
of juridical basis and defendant would be deprived of possible recovery thereon
in that same judicial proceeding.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Section 3, on the other
hand, contemplates a dismissal not procured by plaintiff, albeit justified by
causes imputable to him and which, in the present case, was petitioner's
failure to appear at the pre-trial.  This situation is also covered by Section 3, as extended by judicial
interpretation, and is ordered upon motion of defendant or </span><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">motu proprio </span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">by the court.  Here, the issue of whether defendant has a pending counterclaim,
permissive or </span>compulsory, is not of determinative significance.  The dismissal of plaintiff's complaint is
evidently a confirmation of the failure of evidence to prove his cause of
action outlined therein, hence the dismissal is considered, <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as a matter of </span>evidence, </i>an
adjudication on the merits.  This does
not, however, mean that there is likewise such absence of evidence to prove
defendant's counterclaim although the same arises out of the subject matter of
the complaint which was merely terminated for lack of proof.  To hold otherwise would not only work
injustice to defendant but would be reading a further provision into Section 3
and wresting a meaning therefrom although neither exists even by mere
implication.  Thus understood, the
complaint can accordingly be dismissed, but relief can nevertheless be granted
as a matter of course to defendant on his counterclaim as alleged and proved,
with or without any reservation therefor on his part, unless from his conduct,
express or implied, he has virtually consented to the concomitant dismissal of
his counterclaim.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, in <i>Sta. Maria, Jr., et al. vs. Court of Appeals, et al.,</i><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
plaintiff having been declared nonsuited for his failure to appear at the
pre-trial, his complaint was dismissed without prejudice and the deputy clerk
of court was commissioned to receive defendant's evidence on their compulsory
counterclaim.  This action of the trial
court was later reconsidered and the case was reset for hearing but since
neither plaintiffs nor their counsel appeared despite due notice, they were
again nonsuited, the case was dismissed without prejudice, and plaintiffs were
declared in default on the counterclaim.  Defendants adopted the evidence they had earlier presented and the trial
court rendered judgment on their counterclaim.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiffs therein raised virtually the same objections and
arguments as those which herein petitioner now relies upon to impugn the order
of the trial court.  That case
eventually reached this Court which, speaking through Justice J.B.L. Reyes,
disposed of plaintiffs' contentions in this wise:</p>

<blockquote>"Also pointed out as error is the hearing of the counterclaim
after the plaintiffs were nonsuited, the argument being that the issues in the
counterclaim are so inseparable with those in the complaint that the former may
not be heard unless the latter is also heard.  Petitioners misapply the doctrine; first, because in the instant case,
the adjudication of the counterclaim does not depend upon the adjudication of
the claims made in the complaint, since they were virtually abandoned by the
non-appearance of the plaintiffs themselves; and, second, the doctrine invoked
is not available to plaintiffs like the petitioners, who prevent or delay the
hearing of their own claims and allegations.</blockquote>

<blockquote><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">"The doctrine that
the complaint may not be dismissed if the counterclaim cannot be independently
adjudicated is not available to, and was not intended for the benefit of, a
plaintiff who prevents or delays the prosecution or hearing of his own
complaint.  </span></i>Otherwise, the
trial of counterclaims would be made to depend upon the maneuvers of the
plaintiff, and the rule would offer a premium to vexing or delaying tactics to
the prejudice of the counterclaimants.  <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">It is in the same spirit that we have ruled
that a complaint may not be withdrawn over the opposition of the defendant
where the counterclaim is one that arises from, or is necessarily connected
with, the plaintiff's action and cannot remain pending for independent
adjudication </span></i>[Ynotorio vs. Lira, L-16677, 27 November 1964]."
(Emphasis mine.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The cases of </span><i>Dalman
vs. The City Court of Dipolog, etc., et </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt">al.</span></i><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> and </span><i>International Container
Terminal Services, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals, et al.,</i><a style="mso-footnote-id:

involved the application of the rule in Section 2, not Section 3, of Rule
17.  In </span><i>Dalman</i>, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the dismissal of the complaint was at the
instance of therein plaintiff, which dismissal was ordered by the trial court
despite defendant's compulsory counterclaim therein since, as noted by this
Court on appeal, defendant did not object to such dismissal hence her
counterclaim was also dismissed.  </span><i>In
International Container Terminal Services, Inc</i>., <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">the complaint of private respondent Sharp, Inc. in the court </span><i>a
quo</i> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">was dismissed and petitioner
itself, as defendant therein, joined in moving for such dismissal which
likewise resulted in the dismissal of its compulsory counterclaim.  In effect, petitioner consented to or, at
least, did not object to the dismissal of its counterclaim for, as stated by
the Court, "(i)f it wanted the counterclaim to subsist, it should have
objected to the dismissal of the complaint or at least reserved its right to </span>prosecute
it, x x x" which it could have done by invoking the provisions of Section
2, Rule 17.  As earlier explained, a
different procedure obtains under Section 3 of said Rule which is the provision
applicable to the case at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">All told, my concurrence in the dispositive portion of the
judgment in this case is founded only upon the fact that the assailed order of
the trial court was already final and executory, hence petitioner's present
recourse is indisputably time-barred.  However, it is my respectful submission that in determining whether or
not the dismissal of a complaint <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">ipso
jure</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>results in the
dismissal likewise of a compulsory counterclaim thereto, the distinctions
between the situations contemplated in and provided for by Sections 2 and 3 of Rule
17 should <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">be </span>observed, with the
difference in effects <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>explained
in the foregoing disquisition.  Otherwise, we may be indulging in judicial legislation although,
ironically, it is within the power of the Court itself to change or revise the
aforesaid provisions should the same be considered inadequate to meet its
normative perceptions of what the rules should be.</p>
