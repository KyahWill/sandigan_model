accused the penalty of Reclusion Perpetua or Life Imprisonment and a fine of
Twenty Thousand (P20,000.00) pesos.  With costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The facts as established by the prosecution are summarized in the
decision as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The evidence in the record shows that prior to April 24,
1991, the NARCOM Agents assigned at Meycauayan, Bulacan detachment received
reports from their confidential agents and concerned citizens of Nagbalon,
Marilao, Bulacan, that the accused Juanita Marcelo Y Andrade alias Baby Tsina,
is engaged in selling Metamphetamine Hydrochloride known as shabu.  Operation casing and surveillance was
conducted by the Agents on the activities of the accused and their surveillance
gave positive results.</blockquote>

<blockquote>A team was organized by the Commander of the Unit composed of CIC
Buenaventura Lopez, M/Sgt. Lamberto Hernandez, Staff Sgt. Maong and CIC Efren
Labios, to conduct a buy-bust operation at Nagbalon, Marilao, Bulacan where the
accused resides to entrap and arrest her.  That CIC Lopez was to act (sic) as the poseur-buyer to whom M/Sgt.
Hernandez gave the One Hundred <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">(P100.00)
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">peso </span>marked money to buy
the stuff.</blockquote>

<blockquote>At 4:30 in the afternoon on April 24,
1991, the team riding in a jeep proceeded to Nagbalon, upon arriving at the
place CIC Lopez was dropped by his companions at the corner of Zulueta Street
where Lopez saw the accused and one alias Mike in front of the residence of the
former.  Then Lopez walked casually
towards the accused and Mike, while the other team members positioned
themselves in strategic places.  When
Lopez had approached the two he asked the accused if she have (sic) the stuff
and the accused asked him how much he would buy and he replied, One Hundred
(P100.00) pesos then the accused gave the stuff to Mike who in turn gave it to
Lopez then he gave the One Hundred (<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">P100.00)
</span>pesos, marked money, to the accused.  (Mike is the alias of Danilo Sarmiento).  Then Lopez gave the pre-arranged signal to his companions by
scratching his head and they came out of their places and introduced themselves
to the accused as NARCOM Agents then they arrested the suspects.  According to Hernandez he talked to the
accused after her arrest and she admitted that she still, have (sic) in her
possession shabu which he confiscated weighing 4 grams contained in a plastic
bag (Exhibit K).  The shabu which Lopez
bought from the accused is also contained in a plastic bag (Exhibit J).</blockquote>

<blockquote>After the accused and Mike were arrested, they were brought to the
NARCOM Headquarter at Camp Alejo Santos, Malolos, Bulacan, where they were
investigated inside the Office of the NARCOM in the presence of Sgt. Hernandez,
CIC Lopez, Sgt. Paras and Capt. Huevos.  During the investigation, the accused were not assisted by a counsel,
this fact was admitted by CIC Lopez and Sgt. Hernandez, the investigating
officer.  In the course of the
investigation, Sgt. Hernandez prepared Exhibit C, the list of the property
seized and confiscated from the accused, the document was signed by the accused
without the assistance of a counsel.  The list mentions one small plastic bag of metamphetamine
hydroc(h)loride (shabu) buy-bust, more or <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">less
</span>4 grams and metamphetamine hydroc[h]loride (shabu) confiscated.  One Hundred <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">(P100.00) </span>pesos marked money bearing Serial No. CT751335 Exhibit
D.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The specimen[s] were submitted to Camp Olivas for laboratory
examination to determine whether the specimen[s] are positive for shabu.  As per report of Lt. Alma G. Dumalaog
Technical Report No. NB-235-91 dated April 30, 1991, Exhibit H, the One (1)
small plastic bag containing another one (1) small bag with white crystalline
substance 0.35 gram and the one (1) small plastic bag containing white
crystalline substance weighing 2.4 grams are positive and contained
metamphetamine hydrocloride (shabu) a regulated drug.</blockquote>

<blockquote>During the trial Lt. Dumalaog failed to appear in Court to testify
and identify Exhibit H because she was attending a seminar, upon motion of the
prosecution the Court ordered the re-examination of the specimen by Lt. Daisy
P. Babor, a forensic chemist at Camp Olivas.  The results of the examinations of Lt. Babor appears on the Technical
Report No. NB-235-91 she submitted in Court marked Exhibit L which confirms
that the specimen, one small plastic bag with white crystalline substance
weighing 0.30 grams and one plastic bag containing white crystalline substance
weighing 2.35 grams are positive for metamphetamine hydrocloride (shabu) a
regulated drug."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

it was Capt. Huevos who gave her the alias 'Baby Tsina' because Capt. Huevos

identified themselves as NARCOM Agents whom she identified as Dondon Lopez or
CIC Lopez, one alias Dabo, Efren and Joel; that the agents tried to bring her
along to their detachment at Meycauayan, Bulacan but she refused because the
agents were not armed with a warrant of arrest so the agents handcuffed her
hands and when she resisted CIC Lopez boxed her on the stomach; that she stayed

11.0pt;color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></sup></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Under the first assigned error, the appellant cites several
points which the trial court allegedly failed to consider and which, if
considered, would not have led it to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">conclude
that the accused </span>had engaged in an illegal drug transaction as contended
by the prosecution.  First, it was
unnatural for her, if she was indeed an illegal drug dealer as the prosecution
pictured her to be, to enter into a shady deal with the NARCOM agents using
layman's language; the Court may take judicial notice of the fact that genuine
drug pushers and true drug buyers, including poseur-buyers, transact with the
use of their own "drug language." Second, in the joint affidavit of
arrest (Exhibit "A"), prosecution witness Lopez asserted that he
dealt with a certain alias Mike and not with the appellant; however, during the
trial, he maintained that the appellant was the seller of the regulated
drug.  Third, the inconsistent testimony
of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">C1C </span>Lopez as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to when the sketch </span>illustrating the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">place of transaction (Exhibit "F") </span>was
prepared:  he first declared that he
prepared it "after the arrest of the appellant (TSN, Aug. 9, 1991, p.
19)," then later on he said that the sketch was made before the
team-members proceeded to the target area.  Fourth, if it was true that M/Sgt. Hernandez was present when the
transaction was going on, he would have testified that he saw the transfer of
the shabu and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">the
marked money instead of merely saying that he saw "something" pass
from the hands of Baby Tsina to Mike and finally to C1C Lopez and another
"something" pass from C1C Lopez to Mike then to Baby Tsina.  Finally, according to C1C Lopez, the pre?</span>arranged
signal was to scratch his head twice, but in open court, he demonstrated the
same by scratching his head several times.</p>

<p class="BODY">All these points which the trial court allegedly failed to
consider are directed at the credibility of the main prosecution witnesses, C1C
Lopez and M/Sgt. Hernandez, and the veracity of their claim that the appellant
was caught while selling the regulated drug commonly known as
"shabu."</p>

<p class="BODY">When the issue of credibility of witnesses is raised, appellate
courts will generally not disturb the findings of the trial court, considering
that the latter is in a better position to decide the question, having heard
the witnesses themselves and observed their deportment and manner of testifying
during the trial, unless certain facts of substance and value have been plainly
overlooked which, if considered, might affect the result of the case.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
This is the settled rule.  We have no
reason to depart therefrom in this case, for We do not doubt the findings of
the trial court that the members of the NARCOM conducted the buy-bust operation
on 24 April 1991 to entrap the appellant, and that the latter was caught <i>in
flagrante</i> selling shabu, a regulated drug.  The principal prosecution witnesses are all law enforcers and are
presumed to have regularly performed their duty <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">in the absence of proof to the
contrary.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

appellant failed to show that these NARCOM agents were actuated by any improper
motive in testifying against her.  Where
there is no evidence, and nothing to indicate, that the principal witnesses for
the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">prosecution were
actuated </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Courier New&quot;">by improper motives, the presumption is that they were not and
their testimony is entitled to full faith and credit.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">In any event, the points raised by the appellant do not impress
or convince this Court.  Whether the
appellant and prosecution witness Lopez used "drug language" or not
during the transaction is entirely irrelevant.  What is important is that such a transaction took place.  This Court cannot take judicial notice of
the "drug language" of drug pushers and drug buyers for none has been
shown to exist.  The suggestion of the
appellant that this Court ought to, may only indicate her familiarity with what
she claims to be "drug language" or passwords between drug pushers
and drug buyers.  Moreover, it has not
been established that there is a fixed rule among drug dealers, for their
security, to deal only with customers who use "drug language."</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant's assertion that C1C Lopez and M/Sgt. Hernandez had
stated in their Joint Affidavit of Arrest that they dealt only with Mike is
misleading.  This is what they stated
therein:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Tahoma"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On cross-examination, he further clarified that the marked
P100.00 bill used to pay for the shabu was, in fact, thereafter seized from the
appellant:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Who confiscated this

<p class="BODY">Therefore, even if the first joint affidavit was not precise in
describing the participation of the appellant in the transaction, the
testimonies of the above prosecution witnesses indubitably show her as a seller
of the regulated drug.  Between the
joint affidavit and the testimony given in open court, the latter prevails
because affidavits taken <i>ex-parte</i> are generally considered to be
inferior to the testimony given in open court.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant deliberately misleads this <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">Court in asserting that </span>on page 19 of the transcript of the
stenographic notes of Lopez's testimony taken on 9 August 1991, Lopez declared
that he prepared the sketch (Exhibit "F") after the arrest of the
appellant.  On the contrary, Lopez
categorically stated that he prepared the same before they proceeded to the
target area:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How
many days after the arrest of the accused was affected (sic) did you prepare

<p class="BODY">We find nothing unusual or alarming in the fact that Hernandez
did not categorically state in his testimony that what he saw were the shabu
and the marked money.  He was at a
distance of eight (8) to ten (10) meters from where the transaction was
actually taking place.  From that
distance, he could only see the motions of the suspects and the poseur-buyer
and could not exactly see that it was shabu and the marked money which changed
hands.  When he thus testified that what
he noticed from that distance was "something" handed to Mike by the
appellant and "something" handed by Mike to Lopez, he was just being
candid and truthful.  These <u>somethings</u>
were, however, proven to be the shabu and the marked money.  In any event, the testimony of Hernandez
merely corroborated that of the principal witness -- the poseur-buyer, C1C Lopez.  It was the latter's testimony that
established the selling transaction which, coupled with the presentation in
court of the <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">corpus delicti</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">,<i> </i></span>was sufficient proof of the
commission of the offense.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The matter of whether the pre-arranged signal consisted of only
two (2) or of more scratchings of the head is too trivial to affect the
credibility of C1C Lopez.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the second assigned error, the appellant submits that there
was a material variance between the information and the testimonies of the
witnesses in court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The information states that the appellant "without authority
of law, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously sell, deliver,
dispatch <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">in </span>transit and
transport the following, to wit:  one
(1) plastic bag of metamphetamine hydrochloride (shabu) and Four (4) grams,
more or less of metamphetamine hydrochloride (shabu), which is a regulated
drug," while the evidence of the prosecution shows that there was only one
(1) plastic bag containing shabu (Exhibit "J") which the appellant
sold to C1C Lopez.  The other four (4)
grams of shabu (Exhibit "K") were not part of the "stuff"
sold to Lopez but were recovered from the appellant when she was apprehended.  This variance, however, did not alter the
substance of the charge against her.  The appellant, under these circumstances, can still be validly convicted
for violation of Section 15, Article III of R.A. No. 6425, as amended, since
all the elements of the offense charged in the information were proven in
court.  As in the offense of illegal
sale of marijuana, a prohibited drug, what is required is the consummation of
the transaction.  The important fact is
that the poseur-buyer received the shabu from the appellant and the same was
presented in court.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn23" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a> The
quantity of the regulated drug sold is not material.  It may be pointed out that she could have been separately
prosecuted for illegal possession of the four (4) grams of shabu found in her
possession after her arrest under Section 15, Article III of R.A. No. 6425, as
amended.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn24" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

<p class="BODY">There is, as well, no unexplained gap in the chain of custody of
the drugs (Exhibits "J" <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">and
"K") </span>as alleged by the appellant.  The same was kept by M/Sgt. Hernandez and delivered by him
personally to Sgt. Mones of the PNP Crime Laboratory Service at Camp Olivas,
San Fernando, Pampanga on 29 April 1991 for examination.  Exhibit "E" of the prosecution,
which is the request for examination, shows that the drugs taken from the
appellant was received by Sgt. Mones of the PNP Crime Laboratory from M/Sgt.
Hernandez himself.  The latter explained
that it took him five (5) days after the arrest to submit the same for
examination because there was no other person who could do it as all their
agents were on <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">a </span>mission.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn25" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

Lt. Babor, on the other hand, received the same for examination upon order of
the court on 13 September 1991 from Lt. Dumalaog<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn26" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a> who
conducted the examination of the specimen on 30 April 1991 but whose findings
had to be re-confirmed by Lt. Babor because Lt. Dumalaog was on schooling and
could not be presented in court at the time of the trial.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">Under
the third assigned error, the appellant contends that </span>trial court erred
in (a) believing the claim of the prosecution witnesses that they acted <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">on a </span>tip from an informant who,
however, was not presented in court thus raising the presumption that evidence
wilfully suppressed would be adverse if produced; and in (b) denying the
appellant's right <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">to </span>meet the
accuser and to have him examined.</p>

<p class="BODY">This assigned error is without merit.  Informers are never presented in court because of the need to
preserve their invaluable service to the police.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn28" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
Moreover, the testimony of the informer is not essential to this case because
the said informer was not present during the buy-bust operation and had no
participation therein or in the entrapment of the appellant.<b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class="BODY">Under the fourth assigned error, the appellant claims that the
evidence concerning the marking of the P100.00 bill is unsatisfactory, hence,
the trial court should not have admitted it in evidence.  This is incorrect.  Lopez satisfactorily identified this piece of evidence as the
buy-bust money.  Besides, its
presentation in evidence was not even indispensable as the consummation of the
sale was sufficiently established by the testimony of Lopez, the poseur-buyer.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fifth assigned error, which assails the court <i>a quo </i>for
admitting evidence in violation of the appellant's contitutional rights, is
misplaced.  The trial court convicted
the appellant on the basis of the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses and
the presentation in court of the shabu taken from her during the buy-bust
operation.  No extrajudicial admission
or confession in violation of her constitutional rights was considered by the
trial court.  As a matter of fact, the
trial court even disregarded Exhibit "C," the list of property seized
from her, thus:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Tahoma"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The court disregarded Exhibit C and it's <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">(sic) </span>sub-markings because the
document, an extra-judicial admission, was signed in violation of the
constitutional right of the accused to be assisted by a counsel.  However, the disregard and inadmissibility
of Exhibit C did not create a gap in the chain of evidence against the
accused."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn29" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the last assigned error, the appellant faults the trial court
for allowing the reinvestigation of the case upon the motion of a mere witness,
M/Sgt. Hernandez.  Citing <i>Caes vs.
Intermediate Appellate Court</i>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn30" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a> she
contends that the police officer cannot, in behalf of the prosecutor,
particularly when the case is already pending in court, move for
reinvestigation without the conformity of the prosecutor.  While the appellant has a strong point here
since the complainant in a criminal case is merely a witness and not a party to
the case and cannot, by himself, ask for the dismissal or the reinvestigation
of the case after the information had been filed in court -- the proper party
for that being the prosecutor who has the control of the prosecution of the
case<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn31" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>
-- the matter is already moot and academic.  She is now estopped to question the propriety of the grant of the motion
by the trial court.  She did not object
to the motion, the reinvestigation and the filing of a new information against
her.  She voluntarily entered a plea of
not guilty to and was tried under the new information.  Moreover, the appellant has not shown that
any of her rights had been prejudiced by the reinvestigation.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">The
decision appealed from must then be affirmed.  However, the term </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;

imprisonment.  We have pronounced in
