				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Nelson Mendoza was charged with the crime of violation of Section
4, Article II, Republic Act No. 6425 as amended.  The information dated June 14, 1989, read:</p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">That on or about June 14,
1989, in the </span>Municipality of Navotas, Metro Manila, and within the
jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, without having <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">been authorized by law, did then and there
willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously sell, deliver and give away to another
two (2) small transparent plastic bags containing marijuana dried flowering
tops and also found in his possession thirty (30) small transparent plastic
bags containing dried marijuana flowering tops, which are prohibited drugs, in
violation of the above-cited law.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After arraignment and trial, he was found guilty and sentenced as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered finding accused Nelson
Mendoza y Lopez guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Violation of Section 4,
Article II, Republic Act No. 6425 as amended, sentencing him to suffer the
penalty of life imprisonment, and to pay a fine of P20,000.00 and the costs.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution presented Pat. Emmanuel Mendoza as its lone
witness.  He testified that on June 14,
1989, at seven o'clock in the morning, a confidential informant reported to
P/Cpl. Rolando Mabbun of the Navotas Police Station that a man wearing denim
shorts and an undershirt was selling marijuana at Leongson Street, San Roque,
Navotas.  A buy-bust team was
immediately organized with P/Cpl. Mabbun as team leader and Pfc. Rolando
Domingo, Pat. Emmanuel Mendoza, and Pat. Conrado Evangelista as members.  Pat. Mendoza was designated as the
poseur-buyer.  Two ten-peso bills to be
used for the operation were marked by P/Cpl. Mabbun and Pat. Mendoza with their
initials.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The team, accompanied by the informant, arrived in the area at
nine o'clock in the morning.  Pat.
Mendoza approached Nelson Mendoza, who fitted the description given by the
informant, and asked him if he was selling marijuana.  Nelson said he was and Pat. Mendoza gave him the marked ten-peso
bills in exchange for two teabags of marijuana, which the latter took from a
plastic container kept in his back pocket.  Pat. Mendoza then identified himself as a policeman and retrieved the
marked bills from his quarry.  His other
teammates, who had been watching from a distance of about ten meters,
approached and arrested Nelson.  The
marked money was retrieved from him.  He
consented to a body search, resulting in the discovery of thirty more teabags
from the back pocket of his shorts by Mabbun.  The accused-appellant was then taken to police headquarters for
investigation.  The thirty-two teabags
seized from him were initialed and sent for examination to the National Bureau
of Investigation where they were found to be positive for marijuana.  These teabags were later presented in
evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Taking the stand in his defense, Nelson testified that on June
14, 1989, he reported for work in a construction <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">firm, </span>where he had been employed for three months.  He was not able to work that day because
there were no materials available.  He
then proceeded to Leongson Street to look for a tricycle that he could drive
but did not find any.  It was in that
place that an owner-type jeep suddenly stopped in front of him and three
persons in civilian clothes arrested him.  He identified two of them as "Sir Mabbun" and "Sir
Mendoza." He asked them why he was being arrested and they replied,
"Huli ka na.  Huwag ka na kikilos
ng masama." He was then taken to the municipal building for questioning,
after which he was locked up and charged with drug-pushing.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense did not present any other witness.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this appeal, the conviction is faulted with the following
errors:</p>

<blockquote>I.  THE COURT <u>A</u> <u>QUO</u>
ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE CONFIDENTIAL
INFORMANT WAS NOT PRESENTED AS A WITNESS IN COURT.</blockquote>

<blockquote>II. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING THE ACCUSED GUILTY BEYOND
REASONABLE DOUBT OF THE CRIME OF DRUG-PUSHING.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The accused-appellant contends that the failure of the
prosecution to put the confidential informant on the witness stand has given
rise to the presumption that evidence willfully suppressed would be adverse if
produced.  He cites Sec. 3 (e), Rule
131, Rules of Court, in this regard.  He
also says that it was improbable that he would have sold marijuana to a person
whom he had only met for the first time, and just a few meters away from his
house at that.  A careful person would
not sell marijuana openly, in the early morning on a busy street, when passers-by
are all potential witnesses for the prosecution.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is further contended that the presumption of regularity of
performance of duty upon which the trial court rested its conviction must yield
to the rule that the guilt of the accused must be proved beyond reasonable
doubt.  The accused-appellant also
points to certain inconsistencies in Pat. Mendoza's testimony, particularly
with regard to how he was able to determine that one teabag of marijuana would
cost <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">P10.00.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The appeal is devoid of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">As correctly pointed out by the Solicitor General, the testimony
of the informant was not indispensable to the successful prosecution of the
offense charged.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Pat. Mendoza testified in detail on the sale of the marijuana to the
accused-appellant.  The marijuana
actually sold was submitted in evidence and properly identified without
objection from the defense.  The
non-presentation of the informant, whose testimony would have been merely
corroborative or cumulative, did not impair the cause of the prosecution.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The allegation that the accused met Pat. Mendoza for the first
time only on that fateful day is immaterial because familiarity between the
seller and the buyer is not an essential element of drug - pushing.  When the police officer went through the
motions by buying the prohibited drug and his offer to buy was accepted by the
seller, the crime was consummated by mere delivery of the drug purchased.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We have repeatedly held that the fact that the parties are in a
public place and in the presence of other people does not necessarily
discourage drug pushers from plying their trade, as these circumstances may
even serve to camouflage their illicit operations.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a> This
Court has <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">sustained the conviction of
drug pushers caught selling illegal drugs in a billiard hall, in front of a
store, at a basketball court, in a bus terminal, in broad daylight in the car
of a stranger, along a busy street at 1:45 in the afternoon, and near the house
of the accused.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> Drug pushing, when done on a small scale, as
in this case, belongs to that class of crimes that may be committed at any time
and at any place.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Lastly, the inconsistencies in the testimony of the prosecution
witness cited by the appellant are not substantial enough to impair his
credibility.  There is also nothing in
the record to suggest that the police officers were compelled by any motive
other than to pursue their campaign against the distribution and use of
dangerous drugs.  It is a settled rule
that greater weight is given to the positive identification of the accused by
the prosecution witness than the mere denial by the accused of his
participation in the commission of the crime.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We are satisfied that the evidence of the prosecution has
overturned the constitutional presumption of innocence in favor of the accused-appellant,
who must therefore be denied the relief he seeks.  His guilt beyond reasonable doubt having been proved, he must be
prepared to suffer the consequences of his unlawful act.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed judgment of the trial court is
AFFIRMED <u>in</u> <u>toto</u>, with costs against the accused-appellant.</p>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>
