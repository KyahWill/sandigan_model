<p>Miguel Lasac was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt by the then Court of 
First Instance of Oriental Mindoro, Eighth Judicial District, Branch II*, of the 
crime of parricide committed against his wife, Maria Consolacion Garcia, 
sentenced to life imprisonment and to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the 
amount of P12,000.00 without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> His appeal, erroneously transmitted to the 
then Intermediate Appellate Court, is now before Us.<br><br>He seeks a reversal 
of the judgment on the following assignment of errors:</p>
<p align="center"><em>I</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>THAT THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT OF THE 
CRIME OF PARRICIDE ON THE BASIS OF HIS AFFIDAVIT [EXHIBIT B] 
BECAUSE:<br><br>[a].-THE AFFIDAVIT WAS MADE WITHOUT THE ASSISTANCE OF ANY 
COUNSEL;<br><br>[b].-THE ADMINISTERING OFFICER (JUDGE ZACARIAS GARCIA) DID NOT 
APPRISE HIM OF HIS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS;<br><br>[c].-THE AFFIDAVIT WAS SECURED 
THROUGH MALTREATMENT, FORCE, DURESS AND INTIMIDATION; AND,<br><br>[d].-THE 
SIGNATURE OF THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT IN THE AFFIDAVIT WAS SECURED THROUGH THREAT 
SPECIALLY BY THE POKING OF A GUN</em>.</p></blockquote>
<p align="center"><em>II</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>THAT THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT OF THE 
CRIME OF PARRICIDE ON PURELY CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE AND IN SENTENCING HIM TO 
RECLUSION PERPETUA AND TO INDEMNIFY THE HEIRS OF THE DECEASED IN THE SUM OF 
P12,000.00</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></p></blockquote>
<p>In the Manifestation and Motion dated November 7, 1986 filed in lieu of an 
appellee's brief, the Solicitor General joined appellant's prayer for acquittal 
based on reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>The 
antecedent facts are as follows:<br><br>Braulio Dipasupil and the deceased Maria 
Consolacion Garcia lived together as common-law husband and wife for about six 
<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> months.&nbsp; Six <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> months after they separated, or on January 
19, 1980, Consolacion married accused-appellant Miguel Lasac.<br><br>On March 
15, 1980, Consolacion was found dead atop a big stone in the middle of a creek 
about 70-150 meters away from the conjugal dwelling.&nbsp; An autopsy conducted by 
Dr. Edgardo Hernandez, a private practising physician, disclosed that she 
suffered sixteen <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> stabbed, incised 
and hacked wounds in different parts of her body.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>No one witnessed the killing, but 
suspicion fell on accused-appellant in view of a number of circumstantial 
evidence which were later testified to by the prosecution witnesses, 
thus:<br><br>Flaviano Mauro, a 53-year-old farmer, testified that a week before 
the incident at bar, accused-appellant told him that if Consolacion did not 
change her ways, something would happen to her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Rufo Garcia, the 70-year-old father 
of the victim, testified that at around 8 o'clock in the morning of March 15, 
1980, he went to the house of the accused and the victim to request the latter 
to tend his store as he wanted to attend a ball game.&nbsp; Accused-appellant refused 
for Consolacion, stating that they were going to gather vegetables.&nbsp; Rufo then 
left the spouses' house to tether his carabao as he had nevertheless decided to 
attend said ball game.&nbsp; After he had done this, he saw accused-appellant going 
to the scene of the crime.<br><br>At around 1 o'clock in the afternoon, Rufo 
went to the ball game, where accused-appellant followed him to report that 
Consolacion could not be found.&nbsp; He advised accused-appellant to look for her.&nbsp; 
At twilight, he proceeded to his store where accused-appellant informed him that 
Consolacion had not been found despite the search conducted by the barrio 
captain and other residents of the <em>barrio</em>.&nbsp; Rufo requested several 
barriomates to help look for Consolacion.&nbsp; When the group suggested that they 
search by the creek and its surroundings, accused allegedly told them not to 
pass there as they had already gone to said place before.&nbsp; Notwithstanding, the 
search team, separated into two <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> 
groups, passed by the creek and found the corpse.&nbsp; When the body was brought to 
the couple's house, accused-appellant was observed to be restless, going up and 
down the house and consuming a large amount of water.&nbsp; Because of this behavior, 
Rufo suggested that the barrio captain detain the accused-appellant.&nbsp; On this 
suggestion, the barrio captain requested somebody to fetch the police.&nbsp; After 
the police had arrived, Dr. Hernandez was called in for the autopsy.&nbsp; A 
one-night wake was held, during which time the police started their 
investigation.<br><br>Accused-appellant was asked by the police to produce his 
bolo and was invited for questioning in the police headquarters.<br><br>The 
following morning, the police asked Rufo and his wife to look for the clothes 
accused-appellant was wearing at the time of the incident in question.&nbsp; Rufo's 
wife found a T-shirt and short pants hanging between the "<em>aparador</em>" and 
the wall.&nbsp; These pieces of wearing apparel were "<em>malumigmig</em>" [a bit 
wet].<br><br>Rufo surmised that accused-appellant killed his wife out of 
jealousy as Consolacion used to tell him and his wife that she was being 
maltreated by accused-appellant because she dressed up nicely.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Sgt. Justino Salagubang, Station 
Commander of the Integrated National Police of Bongabong, Oriental Mindoro, 
testified that in the evening of March 15, 1980, he, together with Sgt. Rudy 
Guerra, Pfc. Matibay and Csc. Faltado, went to Barrio Magupit, Bongabong, to 
investigate a killing reported in behalf of one Rufo Garcia.&nbsp; They went to the 
house of accused-appellant, then to the creek where the body was.&nbsp; They searched 
the area for evidence, but did not find any.&nbsp; He ordered the corpse to be 
brought to accused-appellant's house and called in Dr. Hernandez for the 
autopsy.&nbsp; He noted that Lasac did not show any remorse over Consolacion's death, 
neither crying nor embracing the cadaver of his wife.&nbsp; He likewise observed 
Lasac's going up and down the house and frequent drinking of water.&nbsp; Because of 
this behavior, he suspected Lasac of having killed the deceased.&nbsp; He therefore 
asked Lasac to produce his bolo.&nbsp; The latter got the bolo from above the cooking 
place.&nbsp; Sgt. Salagubang examined it and found it a little wet.&nbsp; The blade was 
clean but smelled somewhat "<em>malansa</em>" [fishy].&nbsp; He also asked Lasac to 
bring him the clothes Lasac was wearing that morning.&nbsp; Lasac handed him a 
T-shirt and short pants which he observed to be a little bit wet.<br><br>He 
invited Lasac to the police headquarters for questioning.&nbsp; Lasac was released 
but was re-arrested.&nbsp; On March 24, 1980, Lasac allegedly executed an 
affidavit,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> admitting his guilt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Sgt. Rudy Guerra of the INP of 
Bongabong, Oriental Mindoro, corroborated Salagubang's testimony as regards 
accused-appellant's behavior at the night of the incident and the observation on 
the condition of the bolo and the clothes.&nbsp; He further testified that Lasac 
voluntarily executed the affidavit of admission<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> after he had informed the latter of his 
constitutional rights and that the same was voluntarily signed before Municipal 
Judge Zacarias Garcia.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>On the 
basis of the affidavit of admission,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> 
which the trial court found to have been voluntarily executed, together with the 
circumstantial evidence consisting of accused-appellant having tried to mislead 
the search team from going to the creek, his restlessness during the time the 
body was brought to his house as well as during the vigil, the fact that his 
bolo smelled "fishy" [<em>malansa</em>] which to the trial court's mind 
indicated the smell of blood and the fact that the apparel worn by the accused 
on that fateful day was found to have been recently laundered and still wet,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> the trial court rendered the judgment 
under review on December 11, 1981.&nbsp; The lower court likewise observed that 
during accused-appellant's testimony, "he never showed any sign of remorse, 
regret or even sorrow for his wife having met her untimely demise.&nbsp; His demeanor 
in the witness chair x x x was of a character emanating from a person who was 
satisfied with what he did as a measure or act of revenge.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>We agree with both 
accused-appellant and the Solicitor General that Exhibit B, accused-appellant's 
affidavit of admission, is inadmissible in evidence for having been obtained in 
violation of Section 20, Article IV of the 1973 Constitution, which 
provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>Sec. 20.&nbsp; No person shall be compelled to be a witness against himself.&nbsp; 
Any person under investigation for the commission of an offense shall have the 
right to remain silent and to counsel, and to be informed of such right.&nbsp; No 
force, violence, threat, intimidation or any other means which vitiates the free 
will shall be used against him.&nbsp; Any confession obtained in violation of this 
section shall be inadmissible in evidence</em>."</p></blockquote>
<p>The affidavit in question contained the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>PAHIWATIG</em>: "<em>lpinaaalam ko saiyo [sic] Mr. Miguel Lasac na ikaw 
ay nasa ilalim ng pag-uusig tungkol sa isang kasalanan na iyong kinasasangkutan, 
at ipinaalam ko rin sa iyo na sa ilalim ng ating Saligang batas ay may karapatan 
ka na magsawalang kibo at magkaroon ng sarili mong piling manananggol tungkol sa 
gagawing imbestigasyong ito ang lahat bang ito ay nauunawaan 
mo</em>?</p></blockquote>

<tr>
<td>" S -</td>
<td><em>Opo."</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><br>However, this "advice" given to accused-appellant did not satisfy the 
requirements of Section 20, Article IV of the 1973 Constitution.&nbsp; While 
accused-appellant was informed of his right to remain silent, he was not 
accordingly informed that anything he might say could and would be used against 
him in court.&nbsp; Neither was he informed that if he was indigent, a lawyer would 
be appointed for him.&nbsp; Furthermore, accused-appellant was not made to understand 
that if, at any time during the interrogation, he would wish to have the 
assistance of counsel, the interrogation would cease until an attorney is 
present.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Another factor adding 
to Exhibit B's legal insufficiency is that the waiver by the accused-appellant 
of his right to counsel was made without the assistance of counsel.&nbsp; This fact 
was admitted by Sgt. Rudy Guerra himself during his cross-examination, thus:</p>
<table align="center" border="0" width="80%">

<p>We have ruled in <em>Morales v. Ponce Enrile</em>, 121 SCRA 538, <em>People 
v. Galit</em>, 135 SCRA 465 and <em>People v. Sison</em>, G.R. No. 70906, May 
30, 1986 that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>The right to counsel may be waived but the waiver shall not be valid 
unless made with the assistance of counsel.&nbsp; Any statement obtained in violation 
of the procedure herein laid down, whatever exculpatory or inculpatory, in whole 
or in part, shall be inadmissible in evidence.</em>"</p></blockquote>
<p>Having cast aside Exhibit B as inadmissible for the reasons above-stated, We 
see no need to further dwell on accused-appellant's allegation of torture and 
maltreatment.<br><br>We now weigh the sufficiency of the circumstantial evidence 
relied upon by the trial court, viz:&nbsp; that appellant misled the persons 
searching for his wife by telling them that he had already looked for his wife 
at the creek; that appellant's bolo smelled of fish [<em>malansa</em>] and a 
little bit wet indicating it was washed; that appellant's wearing apparel was 
also a bit wet [<em>malumigmig</em>] indicating it was washed to remove 
bloodstains; and that during the wake, appellant appeared restless, drank a 
large amount of water and showed no signs of sorrow or remorse over his wife's 
death.<br><br>After a thorough study of the testimonial evidence from which the 
aforecited circumstantial evidence was drawn by the trial court, it is our 
holding that standing alone, said circumstantial evidence is not sufficient to 
support a judgment of conviction since they consist primarily of unsubstantiated 
suspicions on the part of the witnesses for the prosecution.<br><br>The tests of 
sufficiency for circumstantial evidence to support conviction under Section 5, 
Rule 133 of the Revised Rules of Court, <em>i.e.</em>, that there is more than 
one circumstance; that the facts from which the inferences are derived are 
proven; and that the combination of all the circumstances is such as to produce 
a conviction beyond reasonable doubt, have not been ably met.<br><br>On the 
prosecution's charge that appellant intentionally misled the persons searching 
for his wife by claiming he had already looked for her at the creek but did not 
find her there, there is nothing in the record to support such allegation nor 
any other indication that would totally negate the veracity of appellants' claim 
that he, indeed, looked for his wife in said area.<br><br>Appellant explained 
that his bolo was a little bit wet because its scabbard was wet.&nbsp; He did not 
testify that his bolo was wet because he kept it near the faucet of the water 
jar.&nbsp; His testimony<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> is to the effect 
that he usually tucked his bolo in its scabbard on the post near the faucet of 
the water jar.&nbsp; It is not beyond the natural course of events that by the 
proximity of the water jar to the post where appellant usually tucked his bolo 
in its scabbard, if the water jar's faucet is opened, water could be splashed in 
a manner as to wet the bolo's scabbard, and thus, the bolo itself.&nbsp; Also, since 
the appellant used the bolo to cut bamboo, the bolo's wetness could have been 
caused by his perspiration.<br><br>Appellant has, likewise, explained why his 
wearing apparel were "a bit wet" [<em>malumigmig</em>].&nbsp; He said they were wet 
of perspiration because he wore them when he cut bamboo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Besides, even if, as the 
prosecution sought to prove, that the appellant's bolo and wearing apparel were 
indeed washed, such fact does not warrant the conclusion nor are they proof that 
appellant killed his wife.<br><br>As to the appellant's alleged queer behavior 
during the wake, it must be realized that people react differently to death.&nbsp; 
Appellant's behavior on that fateful day may have been caused by the trauma of 
his wife's sudden and brutal death.<br><br>We agree with the Solicitor General 
that appellant's explanations have indubitably cast a reasonable doubt as to the 
sufficiency of the circumstantial evidence to convict him beyond reasonable 
doubt of the crime of killing his wife.<br><br>As held in <em>People vs. 
Tolentino</em>, G.R. No. 50103, November 24, 1986, it facts or circumstances 
apparently inculpatory, may equally be explained showing innocence, the evidence 
does not fulfill the moral certainty to support conviction.<br><br>In an earlier 
case, US vs. Gutierrez, 4 Phil. 493, this Court had occasion to rule that 
"<em>since circumstantial evidence is as strong as its weakest link, if the same 
does not fulfill the test of moral certainty sufficiently strong to offset the 
presumption of innocence, the accused has the right to be acquitted even if his 
innocence be doubtful</em>.&nbsp; [Underscoring supplied]<br><br>That the 
circumstantial evidence upon which the prosecution anchored its case fails to 
meet the standard of moral certainty is underscored by said evidence's inability 
to exclude every other reasonable hypothesis but the single one of guilt.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>Before a conviction can be had upon circumstantial evidence, the 
circumstances proven should constitute an unbroken chain which leads to but one 
fair and reasonable conclusion which points to the defendant to the exclusion of 
all others as the guilty person</em>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>"<em>No general rule can be laid 
down as to the quantity of circumstantial evidence which in any case will 
suffice.&nbsp; All the circumstances proved must be consistent with each other, 
consistent with the hypothesis that the accused is guilty, and at the same time 
<u>inconsistent with the hypothesis that he is innocent and with every other 
rational hypothesis except that of guilt</u></em>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>"<em>It is indispensable that the 
evidence be derived from interrelated facts and duly proven in a manner that 
will lead to the logical and rational conclusion, beyond all reasonable doubt 
that the accused is the author of the crime; because if his guilt is not 
satisfactorily established, there always arises a presumption of his innocence 
until the contrary is proved and in such a case, he is unquestionably entitled 
to be acquitted.</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></p></blockquote>
<p>Under the premises, the circumstantial evidence cited by the trial court is 
not sufficient to produce a moral certainty as to the guilt of the appellant for 
the crime charged.<br><br>Moreover, as the affidavit of admission executed by 
the appellant, being the prosecution's basic evidence, is not admissible against 
him because he was not assisted by counsel, all other evidence which tend to 
support this basic evidence become useless.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>Where the principal basic evidence upon which the prosecution rests its 
case fails, all evidence intended to support or corroborate it must likewise 
fail</em>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the judgment of conviction appealed from is 
hereby reversed, and accused-appellant Miguel Lasac is ACQUITTED of the crime 
charged.<br><br><strong>SO ORDERED</strong>. </p>
