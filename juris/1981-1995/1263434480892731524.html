<p class="BODY">The facts, as culled from the pleadings, are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 18, 1988, petitioner Bank discovered a cash shortage
in the vault of its Binondo Branch in the amount of P100,000.00.  Private respondent, as Assistant Branch
Manager or "official custodian of the vault", together with the Bank
Manager, Roberto D. Ilagan, was implicated in the said shortage.  After an investigation by the Bank regarding
the matter, both officers were dismissed on the grounds of violation of the
Bank's Code of Offenses and loss of trust and confidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Both private respondent Natale Jemina and Bank Manager Roberto D.
Ilagan assailed their dismissal for being illegal in two separate complaints
filed before the Labor Arbiter.  The
Labor Arbiter sustained the dismissal of Roberto D. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">Ilagan, </span>while she declared Natale Jemina's dismissal <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as illegal.  </span>From the latter decision, petitioner Bank appealed to the NLRC,
which affirmed the decision of the Labor Arbiter.  Hence, this petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not disputed that private respondent was the Assistant
Manager of the Binondo Branch at the time of the shortage.  On November 17,1986, the Branch Manager was
absent, and complainant took over the duties of the Branch Manager for that
day.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Bank and private respondent, however, have conflicting
stories <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>regards the events
that led to the loss of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">P100,000.00 in </span>the
vault of petitioner Bank's Binondo Branch.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Bank's version of the incident is as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">As the Official Custodian of the vault, "complainant <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">was </span>gravely <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<blockquote>2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Complainant made no formal turnover of cash
accountabilities on November 17, 1986.  <u>This

<blockquote>3.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With the absence of a turnover, there was no

<blockquote>4.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Complainant does not dispute the fact that he
failed to follow the vital turn-over procedure of accountabilities on November
17, 1986;</blockquote>

asserted that he cannot be held liable for non-compliance with the Joint

<blockquote>Complainant (private respondent herein) started sorting the day's
collection earlier than the usual time due to the announcement received from
the Head Office allowing the Branch's employees to go home early because of
on-going strike of passenger's (sic) jeeps and buses in Metro-Manila.  In such sorting out, complainant was
assisted by the Current Account Bookkeeper and distributing clerk and at about
4:00 o'clock in the afternoon, the teller turned over to him all her remaining
cash holdings together with the supporting slips and tickets for verification
of all turn-overs made during that day which are also the basis of
Cash-In-Vault Daily Report.  They found
the total cash balanced with the distributing clerk's blotter.  Then complainant put the remaining cash and
picos boxes inside the cash safe.  Thereafter, complainant conducted bundle counts after sorting the cash,
in the presence of the Current Account Bookkeeper and distributing clerk, not
only once but several times until he was sure that his bundle count tallies
with the entries of the cash-in-vault report.  Then he deposited all the cash inside the vault and his staff saw the
actual act of depositing all the cash sorted and bundle counted.  Afterwards, he summoned the bank's security
guard to witness the actual closing of the vault, record the time at the
guard's log book and subjected himself to body search by the guard in
compliance with the bank's policy."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent also pointed out the fact that the
Cash-In-Vault Report for November 17, 1986 was duly verified by no less than
the Branch Manager, Mr. Roberto Ilagan on the following day, November 18,
1986.  This meant that the amount
indicated in the Cash-In-Vault tallied with that of the actual cash he
deposited in the bank's vault on November 17, 1986.  The alleged shortage was discovered only at 11:00 o'clock in the
morning of the following day, or two hours after the bank opened for business
transactions.  <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">Significantly, private respondent was absent from work on that
particular day as he was assigned to attend </span>a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">meeting at the Head Office.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The issue before Us </span>is
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">whether in the light of the foregoing,
private respondent.  Natale Jemina, </span>was
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">gravely remiss in his duties, which
dereliction resulted in the Bank's loss of </span>P100,000.00.  <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Or
stated differently, was private respondent </span>grossly <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">negligent in the performance of his duties
warranting thereby his dismissal?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">We rule in the negative.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Bank failed to present an iota of evidence directly
showing Jemina's participation in the loss of P100,000.00.  It was not even able to pinpoint the exact
date when the loss occurred.  All it
tried to establish was that Jemina was negligent in the performance of his
duties in that he did not observe the joint custodial requirement of counter-verification
of the amount of the cash in the vault on November 17,1986, or the day before
the loss was discovered.  And on this
basis, petitioner dismissed Jemina on the alleged grounds of loss of confidence
and violation of the Bank's Code of Offenses.</p>

<p class="BODY">But Jemina's failure to counter-verify the cash in the vault was
sufficiently explained by him to be due to the Bank Manager's absence on that
particular day.  Left alone without the
Manager's appointing a substitute in his behalf, and his co-employees rushing
to go home because of the on-going transportation strike, Jemina did the most
prudent thing under the circumstances by asking the Current Account Bookkeeper
and the distributing clerk to assist him in the sorting out of the cash in the
vault; by doing the bundle count in the latter's presence and letting his staff
witness his depositing all the cash inside the vault.  The actual closing of the vault was likewise witnessed by the
security guard on duty.  Before leaving
the bank's premises, Jemina subjected himself to body search by the guard.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
All these disprove the presence of negligence.</p>

<p class="BODY">We also note, with significance, the fact that the Bank Manager
himself verified the Cash-In-Vault Report of November 17, 1986 when the latter
reported for work the following day.  The verification meant that the amount indicated in the Report tallied
with that of the actual cash private respondent deposited in the bank's vault
the day before.  Granting that there was
indeed a shortage of P100,000.00 despite such verification, the Bank Manager
was negligent.  But as correctly
observed by the Labor Arbiter, Jemina cannot be made responsible for the
negligence of said Bank Manager.  <i>Res
inter alios acta.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">We cannot also discount the significant fact that the shortage
was discovered only two hours, or at 11:00 o'clock in the morning, after the
bank opened for business transactions on November 18, 1986.  Jemina was not in the office on that day as
he went direct to the Head Office to attend a meeting.  Between the afternoon of November 17, 1986,
when Jemina deposited all the bank's cash inside the vault, and November 18,
1986 at 11:00 o'clock in the morning, when the loss was discovered, there
existed a plethora of possibilities regarding the loss of the money inside the
vault.  But we do not dwell on
possibilities, suspicion and speculation.  We rule based on hard facts and solid evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have consistently held that loss of confidence <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">is<i> </i>a<i> </i></span>recognized ground
for the discharge of an employee from employment.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a> But
such ground must be founded on facts established by substantial evidence.  The burden of establishing such facts as
reasonably cause loss of confidence in an employee - such facts as reasonably
generate belief by the employer that the employee was connected with some misconduct
and the nature of his participation therein is such as to render him unworthy
of trust and confidence demanded of his position - is on the employer.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
In this case, the records are bereft of any showing that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">private </span>respondent <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Jemina is responsible, solely or partly, </span>for
the loss of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">P100,000.00 </span>in
the vault of petitioner Bank's Binondo Branch.  Both the Labor Arbiter and the NLRC analyzed the employer's proofs and
came to the reasoned conclusion that they did not adequately demonstrate
Jemina's connection with the said loss.  True, Jemina is a possible suspect.  After all, the cash operations of the branch were under his control and
supervision.  He had joint custody with
the Branch Manager over all cash and properties inside the vault.  He had access to the vault where the monies
of the bank were kept.  Indeed,
petitioner Bank has every reason to suspect Jemina for the P100,000.00 shortage
in its vault.  But suspicion has never
been a valid ground for the dismissal of an employee.  The employee's fate cannot, in justice, be hinged upon
conjectures and surmises.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The employer's evidence, although not required to be of such
degree as is required in criminal cases, i.e., proof beyond reasonable doubt,
must be substantial.  The same must
clearly and convincingly establish the facts upon which loss of confidence in
the employee may be made to rest.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a> Here,
Jemina's dismissal cannot justifiably be sustained since the findings in this
case, and the investigation made by the employer, failed to establish either
complicity or culpability on his part.  There was nothing in the record to show who, as between the Bank Manager
and his Assistant, was responsible for the loss.  While dishonesty or disloyalty of an employee is not to be
condoned, neither should a condemnation on that ground be tolerated based on
suspicion spawned by speculative inferences.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is the avowed policy of the law<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a> to
protect labor.  So that, unless based on
a ground provided by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">law </span>and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">is </span>supported by substantial evidence,
dismissal will be disallowed, for what is at stake is not only the employee's
position, but also his means of livelihood.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, there being no basis in law or in fact for Jemina's
dismissal, We hereby affirm the order of the public respondent NLRC for the
payment to Jemina of his backwages starting from the period of his dismissal
but not to exceed three (3) years, without qualification and deduction; and
severance pay equivalent to one month's salary for every year of service.  This is the more equitable disposition than
reinstatement, considering the strained relations between Jemina and petitioner
Bank.  This way, (Jemina) can be spared
the agony of having to work anew with the (petitioner Bank) under an atmosphere
of antipathy and antagonism, and the latter does not have to endure the
continued service of the former in whom it has lost confidence.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
