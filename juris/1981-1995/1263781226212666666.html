<p class="BODY"><span style="">Atty. <span class="SpellE">Aquilina</span>
<span class="SpellE">Araneta</span> was charged with violation of Section 3,
Subsection B of Republic Act No. 3019, otherwise known as the "Anti-Graft
and Corrupt Practices Act" in an information which reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">"That on or about the 26th day of August, 1971, in the City of
<span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span>, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction
of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, being then employed as
Hearing Officer in the Department of Labor, with station at <span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span>
City, and therefore, a public officer, did then and there <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>,
unlawfully, and feloniously demand and receive for herself the amount of One
Hundred Pesos (P100.00), Philippine Currency, from one Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Gertrudes</span>
M. <span class="SpellE">Yoyongco</span>, as <span style="">a

compensation benefits filed by the said Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Gertrudes</span>
M. <span class="SpellE">Yoyongco</span> pertaining to the death of her husband,
which claim was then pending in the office wherein the above-named accused was
employed and in which, under the law, she has the official capacity to
intervene."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The evidence for the
prosecution is summarized by the respondent appellate court in its decision as
follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">"Complainant <span class="SpellE">Gertrudes</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Yoyongco</span> is the widow of Antonio <span class="SpellE">Yoyongco</span>,
an employee of the National Irrigation Administration assigned as instrument
man at the Upper <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> River Project.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the death of her husband on <st1:date year="1971" day="27" month="4">April 27, 1971</st1:date>, she ap­proached the
appellant, a hearing officer of the Workmen's Compensation Unit at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
to inquire about the procedure for filing a claim for death compensation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Learning <span style="">the requirements, she prepared the application forms and attach­ments
and filed them with the Workmen's Compensation Unit at </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">San Fernando</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(pp. 2-13, TSN, </span><st1:date year="1973" day="3" month="10"><span style="">October 3, 1973</span></st1:date><span style="">).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">"After a few days, the complainant went back to <st1:city><st1:place>San
  Fernando</st1:place></st1:city> to verify the status of her claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was informed that the death certificate
of her husband, their marriage contract and the birth certificates of their
children were needed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She <span style="">secured </span>these documents <span style="">and brought </span>them to <st1:city><st1:place>San
  Fernando</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
was told that her claim papers had been forwarded to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
particularly to the appellant, for consolidation of the require­ments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So she went to see the appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(pp. 13-18, TSN, <st1:date year="1973" day="3" month="10">October 3, 1973</st1:date>).</p>

<p class="2Q"><span style="">"When she saw the
appellant, </span>the complainant was told that she had to pay P100.00 so that
her claim <span style="">would </span>be acted
upon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complainant told the appellant
that she had no<span style=""> money then, but if the
appellant would process her </span><span style="">claim
</span><span style="">she would </span>give her the
P100.00 upon its approval.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellant
was adamant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She would not agree to the
complainant's pro­posal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to
her, on previous occasions certain claimants made similar promises but they
failed to live up to them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(pp. 18-24,
TSN, <st1:date year="1973" day="3" month="10">October 3, 1973</st1:date>).</p>

<p class="2Q">"The complainant went to her brother-in-law, Col. <span class="SpellE">Yoyongco</span>, erstwhile chief of <span style="">the </span>Criminal Investigation Service, Philippine Constabulary, to
inform him of the demand of the appellant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Col. <span class="SpellE">Yoyongco</span> gave the complainant two 50-peso
bills (Exhibits B and B-1) and instructed her to go to Col. David <span class="SpellE">Laureaga</span>, Provincial Commander of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>, for help.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(pp. 24­-25, TSN, <st1:date year="1973" day="3" month="10">October 3,
 1973</st1:date>).</p>

<p class="2Q">"After listening to the com­plainant, Col. <span class="SpellE">Laureaga</span>
instructed Lt. <span class="SpellE">Carlito</span> Carlos to entrap the
appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two 50-peso bills were
marked with the notations 'CC-NE-1' and 'CC-NE-2', photographed and dusted with
ultra-violet powder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With this preparation,
Lt. Carlos, Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Beleno</span>, CIC <span class="SpellE">Balcos</span>
and the complainant proceeded to the office of the appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When they arrived thereat, the appellant was
talking with three persons who had <span style="">a </span>hearing
before her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They allowed <span style="">the </span>three persons to finish their business
with the appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the group had
left, the complainant and CIC <span class="SpellE">Balcos</span> who pretended to
be the complainant's nephew approached the appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lt. Carlos and Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Beleno</span>
stationed themselves outside the room and observed events through a glass
window.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Aside from the appellant, the
complainant and CIC <span class="SpellE">Balcos</span>, there were three other
persons inside the office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These were
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span> Garcia, <span class="SpellE">Renato</span>
de Lara and Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complainant again requested the appellant
to process her claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellant
countered by asking her if she already had the P100.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In answer, the complainant brought out the
two 50-peso bills from her <span style="">bag and
handed them to the appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the
appellant took hold of the money, CIC <span class="SpellE">Balcos</span> grabbed
her hand and told her she was under arrest.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">Whereupon, Lt. Carlos and Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Beleno</span>
<span style="">immediately entered the room and helped
in the arrest of the appellant.</span></span></span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>(pp. 3-12, TSN, <st1:date year="1973" day="6" month="11">November 6, 1973</st1:date>).</p>

<p class="2Q">"The appellant has brought to the PC headquarters where her
hands were examined with a special light for the presence of ultraviolet
powder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The examination was witnessed by
Assistant Provincial Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Talavera</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The result was positive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(pp. 12-13, TSN, <st1:date year="1973" day="6" month="11">November 6, 1973</st1:date>)."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On the other hand, the
petitioner presented her own version of the facts:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q"><span style="">"On her part, the
appellant </span>testified that there was indeed an offer of P100.00 by the
complainant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She declined the offer and
never touched the bills when they were laid on her table.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If she was found positive for ultra-violet
powder, it was because CIC <span class="SpellE">Balcos</span> rubbed the bills on
her hand and dress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did it four times
-- once at her office, once at the Milky way Restaurant and twice at the PC
Headquarters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Decision, Court of
Appeals, Annex "A", p. 5)</p>

<p class="2Q"><span style="">"When the complainant
went to the office of the appellant in </span><span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span>
City, she demanded the release of the decision of her case, but appellant told
her that she cannot do so for the reason that she is only a hearing officer to
receive evidence about the claim<span style=""> for
compensation due to the death of her husband, and the real office to decide the
case is that Workmen's Compensation Branch in San Fernando, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complainant went to her brother-in-law,
Col. <span class="SpellE">Yoyongco</span>, Chief of the Criminal Investigation
Service, Philippine Constabulary, </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE"><span style="">Cabanatuan</span></span></span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style=""> to inform him of the demand of the appellant
for P100.00. Col. <span class="SpellE">Yoyongco</span> gave com­plainant </span><st1:time minute="50" hour="14"><span style="">two fifty</span></st1:time><span style=""> (P50.00) peso bills.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After </span><span style="">listening </span><span style="">to the
complainant, Col. <span class="SpellE">Laureaga</span> instructed Lt. <span class="SpellE">Carlito</span> Carlos to entrap appellant by the use of fifty
(P50.00) peso bills which were marked with the </span><span style="">notation </span><span style="">'CC-NE-1' and
'CC-NE-2', photographed and dusted with ultra violent powder, the two
fifty-peso bills.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After this preparation
Lt. Carlos, Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Beleno</span> and the </span><span style="">complainant </span><span style="">proceeded to the office of the complainant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When they arrived in the place the
complainant was talking to the 3 persons who had then a hearing before
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the appellant finished the
hearing the complainant and the CIC <span class="SpellE">Balgos</span> who
pretended to be the complainant's nephew approached the appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then the </span><span style="">complainant </span><span style="">again
requested the appellant to process her claim by this time the complainant took
the 2 fifty-peso bills from her bag and gave to the appellant but the appellant
pushed the money, and CIC <span class="SpellE">Balgos</span> grabbed her hand and
told her appellant was under arrest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
appellant was brought to the headquarters where her hands were examined with
special light for the presence of ultra-violet powder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The </span><span style="">examination </span><span style="">was
witnessed by the Assistant Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span>
City and the result was positive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(TSN,
pp. 12-13, November 6, 1973)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">On the other hand, <span class="SpellE">Renato</span> de Lara, a
witness for the appellant testified that he was in the office of the appellant
at the time the incident took place and he saw the amount of P100.00 being
offered by the complainant to the appellant but the latter refused to accept
the money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When appellant refused, CIC <span class="SpellE">Balgos</span> took it, rubbed it on the hand of the appellant and
announced that he was arresting her.</p>

<p class="2Q">"Appellant further <span class="GramE">testify</span> (sic) that
complainant offered P100.00 to her to expedite the preparation of the decision
of her claim and said complainant put <st1:time minute="50" hour="14">two fifty</st1:time>
peso bills in her table after which she was arrested and investigated and a
complaint was filed against her for violation of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt
Practices Act."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After trial, the lower
court convicted the peti­tioner as charged.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the decision reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">"WHEREFORE, the Court hereby finds the accused Atty. <span class="SpellE">Aquilina</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span> guilty beyond
reasonable doubt of the crime charged in the information and hereby sentences
her to suffer imprisonment for ONE (1) YEAR, with perpetual disqualification
from public office, and to pay the costs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The P100.00 consisting of <st1:time minute="50" hour="14">two fifty</st1:time>-peso
bills which were marked as Exhibits 'B' and 'B-1' are hereby ordered returned
to Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Gertrudes</span> <span class="SpellE">Yoyongco</span>
who owns them."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As indicated earlier, the
respondent appellate court modified the decision of the lower court and
convicted the petitioner instead of the crime of bribery under the second
paragraph of Article 210 of the Revised Penal Code.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The petitioner now
assigns the following errors:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">I<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN NOT ACQUITTING THE PETITIONER ON THE
BASIS OF ENTRAPMENT EVIDENCE DEVISED BY MEMBERS OF THE PHILIPPINE CONSTABULARY
IN <st1:place><st1:placename>CABANATUAN</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>CITY</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">II<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN CONVICTING THE PETITIONER OF BRIBERY
WHERE SUCH CRIME WAS NOT CHARGED IN THE INFORMATION FILED <span style="">BY THE FISCAL AGAINST THE PETITIONER.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">III<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN NOT ACQUITTING THE PETITIONER FOR THE
PROSECUTION FAILED TO PROVE THE GUILT OF THE PETITIONER BEYOND REASONABLE
DOUBT.</p>

<p class="BODY">Relative to the first error, the petitioner submits that the
criminal intent originated in the mind <span style="">of
the entrapping person and </span><span style="">f</span><span style="">or which reason, no convicted can be
conviction h</span><span style="">a</span><span style="">d against her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">This argument has no
merit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The petitioner confuses
entrapment with insti­gation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We agree
with the submission of the Solicitor General that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">xxx</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
There is entrapment when law officers employ ruses and schemes to ensure the
apprehension of the criminal while in the actual commission of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is instigation when the accused was
induced to commit the crime (People v. <st1:country-region><st1:place>Galicia</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
[CA], <span class="GramE">40</span> OG 4476).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The difference in the nature of the two lies in the origin of the
criminal intent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In entrapment, the <span class="SpellE"><u>mens</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>rea</u></span> originates
from the mind of the criminal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The idea
and the resolve to commit the crime <span class="GramE">comes</span> from
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In instigation, the law officer
conceives the commission of the crime and suggests to the accused <span class="GramE">who</span> adopts the idea and carries it into execution.</p>

<p class="2Q">"The legal effects of entrapment and instigation are also
different.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As already stated, entrapment
does not exempt the criminal from liability.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Instigation does."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Even more emphatic on
this point is </span><u>People v. <span class="SpellE">Lua</span> <span class="SpellE">Chu</span> and <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> Se <span class="SpellE">Tieng</span></u>
<span style="">(56 Phil. 44) where this Court ruled
that the mere fact that the Chief of Customs Secret Service pretended to agree
to a plan for smuggling illegally imported opium through the customs house, in
order to assure the seizure of the </span><span style="">said
opium </span><span style="">and the arrest of its
importers is no bar to the prosecution and conviction of the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that case, this Court quoted with approval
16 Corpus <span class="SpellE">Juris</span>, p. 88, </span><span style="">Sec. </span><span style="">57, which states that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q"><u>"ENTRAPMENT AND INSTIGATION</u>.? <span style="">While </span>it has been said that the
practice of entrapping persons into crime for the purpose of instituting
criminal prosecutions is to be deplored, and while instigation, as
distinguished, from mere entrapment, has often been condemned and has sometimes
been held to prevent the <span style="">act </span><span style="">from being criminal or punishable, </span><span style="">the general rule is that it is no defense to
the perpetrator of a crime that facilities for its commission were purposely
placed in his way, or that the criminal act was done at the 'decoy solicitation'
of persons seeking to expose the criminal, or that detectives feigning
complicity in the act were present and apparently assisting in its
commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Especially </span>is <span style="">this true in that class of cases' where the
offense is one of a kind habitually committed, and the solicitation merely
furnishes evidence of a course of conduct.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Mere deception by the detective will not shield defendant, if the
offense was committed by him free from the influence or the instigation of the
detective.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
</span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style="">"<b><o:p></o:p></b></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Anent the second
assignment of error, the petitioner argues that she was denied due process of
law because she was not charged with bribery in the information but for a crime
falling under the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Again, this argument is
erroneous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contention of the
petitioner was squarely answered in <u>United</u></span><u><span style=""> States v. <span class="SpellE">Panlilio</span></span></u><span style=""> (28 Phil. 608) where this Court held that
the fact that the information in its preamble charged a violation of Act No.
1760 does not prevent us from finding the accused guilty of a violation of an
article of the Penal Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To the same
effect </span>is <span style="">our </span><span style="">ruling in </span><u><span style="">United States v. Guzman</span></u><span style="">
</span><span style="">(25 Phil. 22) where the
appellant was convicted of the crime of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">the lower court, but on appeal, he was instead con­victed of the crime
of embezzlement of public funds as defined and penalized by Act No. 1740.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As long as the
information clearly recites all the elements of the crime of bribery and the
facts proved during the trial show is having been committed beyond reasonable
doubt, an error in the designation of the crime's name is not a denial of due
process.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In </span><u><span style="">United States v. </span></u><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Paua</span></u></span><span style=""> (6 Phil. 740), this Court held that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">"The foregoing facts, duly established as they were by the
testimony of credible witnesses who heard and saw everything that occurred,
show beyond peradventure of doubt that the crime of attempted bribery, as
defined in article 387, in connection with article 383 of the Penal <span style="">Code, </span>has been committed, it being
immaterial whether it is alleged in the complaint that section 315 of Act No.
355 of the <span style="">Philippine </span>Commission
was violated by the <span style="">defendant, as the
same recites facts and circumstances sufficient to constitute the crime of
bribery at defined and punished in the aforesaid articles of the Penal
Code."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Our review of this
decision shows that the crime for which the petitioner was convicted has been
proved beyond reasonable doubt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petition for review is hereby DISMISSED for
lack of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision of the
respondent court is AFFIRMED without costs.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Considering however, that
this case has been pending since 1971, that the amount involved is only P100.00
and that the defendant-appellant is a mother of four, it is recommended that
the petitioner either be granted executive clemency or be given the privilege
of probation if she is qualified.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
