the Trial Court but it did nothing to protect its <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">interests so </span>that the case eventually attained finality. <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">What is more, </span>the CLUB knew of the
encumbrances on </span><st1:date month="10" day="27" year="1960"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">October 27, 1960</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> but it took no steps to stop payment of the
check it had issued to ROMERO just the day before on </span><st1:date month="10" day="26" year="1960"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">October 26, 1960</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">; nor did it <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">proceed </span>against the SISTERS and <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">ROMERO </span>until fourteen (14) years later when it filed this suit for
quieting of title. The <span class="SpellE">CLUB's</span> cause of action lies,
not against the SISTERS, to whom the property had been adjudged by final judg­ment
in Civil Case No. 6365, but against ROMERO who was found to have had no right
to dispose of the land. The judgment in Civil Case No. 6365 in the SISTERS'
favor had long become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, the ROMEROS must be held liable to the CLUB for the
amount of P69,887.50, which they had received as consideration for Lot No.
1353, which they did not own and could <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">not
</span>dispose of. Their contention that they are not parties-in-interest in
this instant case and that the cause of action against them has long prescribed
is without merit. As held by the Trial Court, they were the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">parties </span>who had executed the sale to
the CLUB, and the present action is not one for annulment of contract but for
quieting of title. Besides, the <span class="SpellE">CLUB's</span> action
for-reimbursement of the price paid accrued only after the failure of the <span class="SpellE">CLUB's</span> action to quiet title. Also, the principle against
unjust enrichment applies in their case.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment dismissing the complaint is hereby
affirmed. The spouses Romeo F. Romero and Lourdes G. Rodriguez shall, within thirty
(30) days from notice, refund to petitioner Valley Golf Club, the amount of
P69,887.50 re­ceived by them as consideration for Lot No. 1353, with interest
at the legal rate from January 22, 1974, the date of the filing by petitioner
of the Complaint in Civil Case No. 18823, until fully paid.</p>
