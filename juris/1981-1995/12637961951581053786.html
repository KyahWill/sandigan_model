<p class="BODY">Petitioner Ramos is the owner of a house and lot containing an
area of 901 square meters covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 14927
situated at Barrio San <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Paranaque</span></st1:place></st1:city>, <span class="GramE">Metro</span>

</span>Respondent <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span> Realty was granted the

the <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span> and <span class="SpellE">Asprec</span>
subdivisions, by the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">respondent </span><span class="SpellE">Asprecs</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records of this case disclose that on <st1:date year="1981" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1981</st1:date>, a complaint for an easement of a
right of way with preliminary mandatory injunction was filed by Ramos against
the private respondents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Among the
allegations in the complaint are:</p>

<blockquote>"xxx that he (referring to the petitioner) constructed his
house at 27 <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span> Avenue (also known as <span class="SpellE">Palanyag</span> Road), <span class="SpellE">Paranaque</span>, and
has since resided therein with his family from 1977 up to the present; that
during construction of the house, <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span> Realty,
Inc. built a 7-8 feet high concrete wall right <span class="SpellE">infront</span>
of appellant's premises, blocking his entrance/exit to <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span>
Road, the nearest, most convenient and adequate entrance/exit to the public
road or highway, formerly <span class="SpellE">Sucat</span> Road but now known as
Dr. A. Santos Avenue, <span class="SpellE">Paranaque</span>; that this house and
lot is only about 100 meters from <span class="SpellE">Sucat</span> Road passing
thru <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span> Avenue; that prior to this, appellant
and his counsel addressed separate request/demand letters (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
A and Annex B) to defendant company to allow him to exercise a right of way on
the subject premises; that in September 1977, a meeting/conference was held
between appellant and his counsel on one hand and Mr. Roberto <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span> and counsel on the other, during which defendant
Corporation manifested its conformity to grant appellant the requested right of
way upon payment of proper indemnity, with the request that appellant inform
defendants <span class="SpellE">Asprec</span> of their aforesaid agreement; that
consequently, appellant wrote Mr. <span class="SpellE">Cleto</span> <span class="SpellE">Asprec</span> on September 16, 1977 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
D); that with the construction of the 7-8 feet concrete wall appellant and his
family have been constrained to pass through the back portion of their lot
bounded by other lots belonging to different owners, which is grassy and <span class="SpellE">cogonal</span> as temporary ingress/egress with great
inconvenience and hardship, and this becomes all the more pronounced during the
rainy season due to flood and mud (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. B-1, B-1-A,
B-2, B-2-A, B-3, B-3-A, B-3-B and B-4); and, lastly, that the aforesaid
concrete wall is dangerously leaning towards appellant's premises posing great
danger or hazard." (Court of Appeals Decision, p. 3, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 39)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On May 20, 1981, the respondent corporation filed a motion to
dismiss on grounds of lack of cause of action and bar by prior judgment alleging
that the complaint was merely a reproduction of that filed on October 26, 1972
in Civil Case No. 5930-P which was dismissed on October 30, 1980 for failure to
prosecute within a reasonable length of time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Respondents <span class="SpellE">Asprec</span> later joined the respondent
company in its motion to dismiss and adopted the grounds and arguments stated
therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1981" day="20" month="11">November 20, 1981</st1:date>,
after the petitioner had filed his opposition to the above motions, the lower
court issued its order denying the motion to dismiss on the ground that the
order dismissing the earlier case was not <span class="GramE">an adjudication</span>
on the merits.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1981" day="26" month="11">November 26, 1981</st1:date>,
the petitioner filed an urgent ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> motion for
the issuance of a preliminary mandatory injunction as well as a preliminary
prohibitory injunction. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>On the same day,
the lower court set the motion for hearing on <st1:date year="1981" day="1" month="12">December 1, 1981</st1:date>, later reset to <st1:date year="1981" day="10" month="12">December 10, 1981</st1:date>, and ordered that:</p>

<blockquote>"In the meantime, pending determination of the application on
the merits and in order that the <span class="SpellE">reliefs</span> sought
therein may not be rendered moot and academic, the defendants and all persons
acting upon their orders are hereby temporarily enjoined from building,
constructing and/or erecting a wall, fence or any enclosure adjoining or
abutting plaintiff's premises and/or from restraining, preventing or
prohibiting the plaintiff, his family or persons residing in his premises as
well as any person/s who may have any dealing or business with them from using,
passing and/or traversing the said <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span> Avenue
in going to or returning from the plaintiff's premises and in going to or
returning from <span class="SpellE">Sucat</span> Road via <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span>
Avenue, until further orders from this Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">(Order dated November 26, 1981, Records, p. 66).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1981" day="1" month="12">December 1, 1981</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span> Realty filed its answer and averred, among
others, that:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">xxx</span><span style="mso-tab-count:3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="mso-tab-count:3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Defendant Corporation has never entered into a verbal
agreement with plaintiff to grant the latter a road right of way;</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">xxx</span><span style="mso-tab-count:3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="mso-tab-count:3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The so-called <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span> Avenue or <span class="SpellE">Palanyag</span> Road is not a public road but a private street
established and constructed by the defendant Corporation intended for the sole
and exclusive use of its residents and lot buyers of its subdivisions, as well
as of the subdivisions owned and operated by the various naked owners of the
different portions constituting the entire length and breadth of said street;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"If plaintiff's property referred to in the complaint is Lot
No. 4133-G-11, (LRC) Psd-229001 (sic), then a grant of a right of way to
plaintiff is not a legal necessity, because such lot has an existing road right
of way, more particularly Lot 4133-G-12, towards Dr. <span class="SpellE">Arcadio</span>
Santos Avenue (<span class="SpellE">Sukat</span> Road);</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">xxx</span><span style="mso-tab-count:3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="mso-tab-count:3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The opening of <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span> Avenue to
the property of plaintiff will unduly cause great prejudice to defendant
Corporation as it can no longer effectively regulate the use of the said
private road; xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Assuming, though not admitting, that plaintiff may be granted
a right of way, still the reasonable compensation for such grant would be some
P800<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, as such portion of <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span>
Avenue consists of some 2,000 square meters of prime and valuable property
which could readily command a market value of P400.00 per square meter;
moreover, plaintiff still has to shoulder his proportionate share of the
expenses and upkeep of such street and the real estate taxes imposed
thereon." <span class="GramE">(Answer of <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span>
Realty, Inc., Records, pp. 81-82).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1981" day="2" month="12">December 2, 1981</st1:date>,
respondents <span class="SpellE">Asprec</span> filed their answer which basically
contained the same averments as that of the realty company.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the hearing of the petitioner's application for issuance of a
writ of preliminary injunction to compel the private respondents to remove the
wall constructed right in front of the petitioner's premises barring him access
to <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span> Avenue, both parties presented oral and
documentary evidence to support their respective positions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After the hearing, the lower court issued the
following order:</p>

<blockquote>"Plaintiff is given fifteen (15) days to file a memorandum and
the defendant is given another fifteen days from receipt thereof to file a
reply, after which the case shall be deemed submitted for resolution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">So ordered."</span>
(TSN, December 10, 1981, p. 57)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After compliance by both parties with the above order, the lower
court, on <st1:date year="1982" day="9" month="7">July 9, 1982</st1:date>,
rendered a decision the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of which
reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the
plaintiff and against the defendants ordering the latter to grant the former a
right of way through <span class="SpellE">Palanyag</span> Road to and from Don <span class="SpellE">Arcadio</span> Santos Avenue and to and from his residence, upon
payment by the plaintiff to the defendants <span class="SpellE">Asprecs</span>
the sum of P5,000 as indemnity <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> and under the
following terms and conditions to wit:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(1) the easement created shall be only in favor of the plaintiff,
members of his family and person or persons dealing with them; and (2) the
opening to be created through the concrete wall separating plaintiff's
residence and <span class="SpellE">Palanyag</span> Road shall only be three (3)
meters wide and shall be provided by an iron gate by the plaintiff all at the
expense of the plaintiff.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Without pronouncement as to costs and damages."</span> (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 30)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, the respondent company filed a motion to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">set </span>aside and/or reconsider the lower
court's decision for being premature since only the application for the writ of
injunction was heard and submitted for resolution and not the entire case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondents <span class="SpellE">Asprec</span>,
likewise, filed a motion for reconsideration mainly on the ground that the
lower court's grant of a right of way through <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span>
Avenue in petitioner's favor would be in derogation of the "Contract of
Easement of Road Right-of-Way and of Drainage" executed between them and <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span> Realty.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his opposition to both motions, the petitioner argued that on
the basis of the transcript of stenographic notes taken on December 10, 1981,
it was clear that both parties submitted the entire case for resolution
inasmuch as the pieces of evidence for the injunction and for the main <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">case </span>were the same and there was
nothing left to be presented.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in
effect, the petitioner contended that the lower court's decision dated <st1:date year="1982" day="9" month="7">July 9, 1982</st1:date> was <span class="GramE">an
adjudication</span> on the merits.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1983" day="8" month="7">July 8, 1983</st1:date>,
the lower court under a new judge by virtue of the reorganization of the
judiciary, issued an order setting aside and vacating its previous decision
dated <st1:date year="1982" day="9" month="7">July 9, 1982</st1:date> on the
ground that the same was "rendered prematurely as the defendants had not
presented their evidence on the main case."</p>

<p class="BODY">After the petitioner had rested his case, the respondent company
filed a motion to dismiss based on the insufficiency of the evidence adduced by
the petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>An opposition to said
motion, was, thereafter, filed by the petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1984" day="14" month="11">November 14, 1984</st1:date>,
the lower court, acting on the respondent company's motion to dismiss, issued
an order with the following tenor:</p>

<p class="2Q">"WHEREFORE, finding the motion to dismiss of defendant
corporation <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span> Realty, Inc. to be impressed
with merit, the same is hereby granted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>For insufficiency of evidence, plaintiff's complaint is hereby
dismissed, without pronouncement as to costs." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 34)</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals on <st1:date year="1986" day="29" month="8">August
 29, 1986</st1:date>, found that the petitioner failed to establish the
existence of the preconditions in order that he could legally be entitled to an
easement of a right of way.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It affirmed
the lower court's order dated <st1:date year="1984" day="14" month="11">November
 14, 1984</st1:date> in all respects, with costs against the petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">These assigned errors center on the issue of
whether or not the petitioner has successfully shown that all the requisites
necessary for the grant of an easement of a right of way in his favor are present.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">An easement or servitude is an encumbrance imposed upon an
immovable for the benefit of another immovable belonging to a different owner
as defined <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in </span>Article 613 of the
Civil Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is established either by

<p class="BODY">Since there is no agreement between the contending parties in
this case granting a right of way by one in favor of the other, the
establishment of a voluntary easement between the petitioner and the respondent
company and/or the other private respondents is ruled out.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What is left to examine is whether or not the
petitioner is entitled to a legal or compulsory easement of a right of way.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">In the case of <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Bacolod</span></u></span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">-Murcia Milling Company, Inc. v. Capitol

held that:</p>

<p class="2Q" style="text-indent:0in">"xxx the Central had to rely strictly
on its being entitled to a compulsory servitude of right of way, under the
Civil Code, and it could not claim any such servitude without first
establishing the preconditions for its grant fixed by Articles 649 and 650 of
the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:19.0pt">Civil </span>Code of the
Philippines:</p>

<p class="2Q">(1)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:19.0pt">is </span>surrounded by other <span class="SpellE">immovables</span> and has no adequate outlet to a public highway

Angela Estate, Inc. v. Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
Occidental, 24 SCRA 500,510)</p>

<p class="BODY">On the first requisite, the petitioner contends that since the
respondent company constructed the concrete wall blocking his ingress and
egress via the <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span> Avenue, the "nearest,
most convenient and adequate road" to and from a public highway, he has
been constrained to use as his "temporary" way the adjoining lots
belonging to different persons.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said way
is allegedly "bumpy and impassable especially during rainy seasons because
of flood waters, mud and tall '<span class="SpellE">talahib</span>' grasses
thereon." Moreover, according to the petitioner, the road right of way
which the private respondents referred to as the petitioner's alternative way
to <span class="SpellE">Sucat</span> Road is not an existing road but has
remained a proposed road as indicated in the subdivision plan of the <span class="SpellE">Sobrina</span> Rodriguez <span class="SpellE">Lombos</span> Subdivision.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner's position is not impressed with merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We find no reason to disturb the appellate
court's finding of fact that the petitioner failed to prove the non-existence
of an adequate outlet to the <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Sucat</span>
  Road</st1:address></st1:street> except through the <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span> Avenue</st1:address></st1:street>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As borne out by the records of the case,
there is a road right of way provided by the <span class="SpellE">Sobrina</span>
Rodriguez <span class="SpellE">Lombos</span> Subdivision indicated as <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
4133-G-12 in its subdivision plan for the buyers of its lots.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact that said lot is still undeveloped
and causes inconvenience to the petitioner when he uses it to reach the public
highway does not bring him within the ambit of the legal requisite.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We agree with the appellate court's
observation that the petitioner should have, first and foremost, demanded from
the <span class="SpellE">Sobrina</span> Rodriquez <span class="SpellE">Lombos</span>
Subdivision the improvement and maintenance of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>

Avenue <span class="SpellE">inspite</span> of a road right of way provided by the
petitioner's subdivision for its buyers simply because <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span>
Avenue allows petitioner a much greater ease in going to and coming from the
main thoroughfare is to completely ignore what jurisprudence has consistently
maintained through the years regarding an easement of a right of way, that
"mere convenience for the dominant estate is not enough to serve as its
basis.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To justify the imposition of this
servitude, there must be a real, not a fictitious or artificial, necessity for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">it." </span>(See <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>,
