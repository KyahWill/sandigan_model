ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
denying reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Labor Arbiter declared illegal the dismissal by petitioner
Philippine Airlines (PAL), Inc., of private respondents Lucio Zabayle and Jose
Tinio and consequently ordered their reinstatement as well as the payment of
backwages.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 4 May 1988, at about 8:00 o'clock in the evening, Michael
Beldad, a security guard employed by petitioner airline, witnessed respondent
Zabayle loading several bottles of whiskey and some cigarettes into a taxi
parked near the Passenger Services Department, Inflight Center (IFC), Pasay
City.  Zabayle was assisted by Martin
Cantiller, a messenger of the Flight Attendants' and Stewards' Association of
the Philippines (FASAP), to which Zabayle was affiliated.</p>

<p class="BODY">Beldad approached Cantiller and informed him that it was against
company policy to bring out liquor and cigarettes without an out-gate pass but
he was allegedly ignored.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Beldad then alerted his companions at the monitoring station who in turn called
the gate guards to inspect the taxi riden by Zabayle and Cantiller.  True enough, the taxi was stopped by the
gate guards and inspected.  Since
Zabayle failed to produce an out-gate pass, he was requested to proceed to the
Security Office within the IFC to fill out an interception report.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, Cantiller went to the FASAP union office where
he met respondent Tinio and relayed the incident.  Tinio immediately dialed for assistance from the elements of the
CAPCOM before going to the Security Office with two (2) other union members.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon arrival at the Security Office, Tinio introduced himself as
a FASAP adviser and angrily confronted Jimmy Sibbaluca, the Chief Security
Officer.  Tinio questioned the detention
of Zabayle and demanded to talk with Daniel Pido, PAL's Director for Cabin
Services or with Mila Abad, the Vice President for Passenger Services.  But the guards told him they could not be
contacted.  Moments later, the elements
of the CAPCOM arrived and Zabayle was thereafter released from the Security Office
without having signed the requisite interception report.</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, Zabayle and Tinio were administratively charged for
various offenses ranging from breach of security to insubordination,
withholding of cooperation, disrespect of authority, abuse of authority,
maltreatment of colleagues and subordinates, discourtesy, and serious
misconduct.</p>

<p class="BODY">After due notice and hearing, respondents Lucio Zabayle and Jose
Tinio were dismissed by petitioner airline, prompting them to file a complaint
for illegal dismissal, with prayer for reinstatement and payment of backwages.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Labor Arbiter ruled in favor of private respondents and
ordered their reinstatement and payment of backwages from 2 February 1989, the
date they were declared illegally dismissed from service.  This was affirmed by respondent
Commission.  Hence, the filing of
instant petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">A cursory reading of the petition for <i>certiorari</i> shows
that it merely raises questions of fact, i.e., the proper appreciation of the
events that transpired that eventful day of 4 May 1988.  PAL vehemently argues that the acts of
private respondents constituted serious misconduct; both the Labor Arbiter and
the NLRC ruled otherwise.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is well-settled that findings of fact of the Labor Arbiter
which are affirmed by respondent Commission are binding on this Court.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
After all, reviews of labor cases are merely confined to questions of
jurisdiction and/or grave abuse of discretion.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Nonetheless, even on the merits, PAL failed to sufficiently show
that respondent Commission gravely abused its discretion in concluding that
there was illegal dismissal in the case at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY"><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">First.</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">  As </span>petitioner
airline itself admitted, there were no stolen goods involved.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
The bottles of whiskey and the cigarettes brought out of the IFC belonged to
Zabayle and were not properties of petitioner airline.</p>

<p class="BODY"><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Second.</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">  </span>The
events that transpired on 4 May 1988 which gave rise to the controversy, i.e.,
the alleged introduction of "armed civilians," as petitioner airline
would put it, in what was otherwise an internal affair; the verbal altercation
between Tinio and Sibbaluca; and, the failure of Zabayle to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">sign an </span>interception report, all stem
from the failure of PAL to properly disseminate its security policies and
procedures to all its employees.</p>

<p class="BODY">Both respondents were never aware of the rule relating to the
out-gate pass and interception report prior to 4 May 1988.  It was only on 29 October 1989,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
or during the pendency of the case before the Labor Arbiter, that they learned
of the existence of such rule.   Incidentally, PAL did not attempt to refute or controvert this
evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Zabayle therefore cannot be said to have violated any
of petitioner airline's security policies and procedures when he attempted to
bring out of the IFC bottles of whiskey and some cigarettes without first
securing the necessary out-gate pass because he was never informed of any rule
to that effect.  As a matter of fact,
even PAL's other cabin crew members were similarly not aware of this
requirement until after the incident.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither can respondent Tinio be faulted for introducing
"armed civilians" into the fray.  When he was informed that Zabayle was being detained at the Security
Office, he had every reason to believe that another cabin crew member was being
unduly harassed by the security guards because this was not the usual process
and was highly irregular.  Indeed, the
Labor Arbiter found that there were previous incidents of harassment against
some members of the cabin crew.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, in his capacity as a union officer, Tinio dialed
for assistance from the CAPCOM because he perceived that Zabayle was being
detained illegally.</p>

<p class="BODY"><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Third.</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">  </span>The
security guards employed by petitioner airline failed to uniformly apply the
rules thereby causing confusion.  Their
interpretation of the security procedures varied as reflected in their
respective testimonies<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>.  There was no consistency in the application
of the security policies and procedures.  A misunderstanding on the implementation of the rule relating to the
out-gate pass and interception report was therefore inevitable as what actually
ensued in the case at bar.  And, to compound
matters, respondent Commission noted that at times the security guards were
simply overbearing in their behavior.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Of course, respondent Tinio's actuations in shouting invectives
at the Chief Security Officer and uttering offensive remarks against his
superiors cannot be countenanced.  Neither can Zabayle's failure to heed the call of Beldad to first secure
an out-gate pass be ignored.  But,
considering that Tinio's service with petitioner airline already spanned more
than 22 years at the time of the incident while that of Zabayle reached 20
years, the penalty of dismissal was too harsh and disproportionate to the
infractions committed specially since these were their very first.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner airline further argues in the alternative that should
the Court affirm the finding of illegal dismissal, respondents should no longer
be ordered reinstated because of loss of confidence.  Instead, PAL considers the payment of separation pay
appropriate.  This is not tenable.</p>

<p class="BODY">The infractions of private respondents were not related to the
positions they held.  Rather, they arose
as a result of a misunderstanding of PAL's security measures.  The unfelicitous remarks uttered by
respondent Tinio against his supervisors were made in the heat of anger.  He was already punished for it; as was
Zabayle for his offense.  It must be
stressed that both private respondents were placed under preventive suspension
from the moment they were administratively charged up to the time they were
ordered <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">dismissed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There being a finding of illegal dismissal, respondents are
entitled to reinstatement.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt"> </span>Such finding of illegal dismissal
warrants not only reinstatement but also the payment of backwages computed for
three (3) years only,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a> and
not from 2 February 1989 when they were <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">unlawfully
dismissed.  This is because the
dismissal of private respondents transpired before the effectivity of R.A. 6715
on 21 March 1989.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
