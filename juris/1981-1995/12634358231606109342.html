<p class="BODY">During trial, the prosecution presented as its evidence in chief
six witnesses, <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">viz., </span></i>Rodolfo
Maguad, son of Segundo Maguad; Teresita Barruela, the spouse of Marcelo
Barruela; Norberto Javier; Dr. Salvador Billones, the doctor who autopsied the
victims; Pat. Rafael Dipon; and Pfc. Allan Contreras.  Its rebuttal witnesses were Nemia Besana, Allan Contreras and
Angel Belalo.  For its part, the defense
presented as its witnesses all of the accused and thirteen other persons.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Prosecution witness Rodolfo Maguad testified that at around 7:00
o'clock on the night of the killing, he was at the fishpond dikes near the
house of the Barruelas at Barangay Bantigue, Pontevedra, Capiz inspecting the
fishpond gates.  While there, he
suddenly heard the voice of Marcelo Barruela who was at the second floor of the
said house; Barruela was conversing with some men who were outside the
house.  Rodolfo proceeded towards the
house but hid from the men because in the many years that he has stayed with
the Barruelas, no one has visited the latter at that time of the night.  Rodolfo recounted that when Marcelo Barruela
asked who these men were, one of them -- <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a
</span>person whom he (Rodolfo) recognized <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">as </span>Eduardo or Suli Cordova -- introduced himself <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>Richard de la Torre.  Rodolfo observes Eduardo Cordova request
Marcelo to bring them to Pontevedra in Marcelo's motorboat; Marcelo, however,
replied that he did not have enough gasoline for the trip.  Eduardo Cordova thereupon insisted that they
be brought instead to Barangay Quiawa, also in Pontevedra.  When Marcelo asked Eduardo how many they were,
the latter replied that they were four.  Marcelo then instructed his farm help, Segundo (Godo) Maguad --
Rodolfo's father -- to prepare a torch <i>("moron").  </i>After so instructing Segundo, Marcelo
beamed a flashlight at the group and asked Eduardo where his companions
were.  When Eduardo replied, "They
are here," two persons appeared, one of whom Rodolfo recognized as
Reynaldo Cordova.  The latter, who had a
long firearm with him, immediately fired six shots in rapid succession at
Marcelo.  Thereafter, Reynaldo fired two
more shots at Marcelo's house.  Rodolfo
then ran for safety and proceeded to the house of one Alex Acolentaba where he
related to Alex what had happened.  After
sometime, both of them went to the Barruelas' house where Rodolfo saw his father
lying dead on the first floor with a gunshot wound in his neck; on the second
floor, both discovered the lifeless body of Marcelo Barruela.  The latter's wife, Teresita Barruela, who
was also there, told Rodolfo to report the incident to the police authorities
in Pontevedra, Capiz.  Instead of doing
so, Rodolfo and Alex proceeded to the house of Marcelo's nephew, Jessie
Sevilla, and narrated the tragedy to the latter.  Jessie then told them to promptly head for Roxas City to inform
Marcelo Barruela, Jr. (Toto) about the incident.  Upon being so informed, Toto Barruela, Rodolfo and Alex returned
to Jessie Sevilla's house where they met three policemen, namely, Pfc. Allan
Contreras, Rolando Alcazaren and John Dipon.  Upon being questioned by the policemen, Rodolfo disclosed that his
father's and Marcelo's killers were the accused Eduardo Cordova, Reynaldo
Cordova and two other men whom he did not recognize.  After this preliminary inquiry, the entire group proceeded to the
scene of the crime in Barangay Bantigue.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Witness Teresita Barruela narrated that at about 7:00 o'clock in
the evening of 29 May 1986, she was praying in their house in Bantigue,
Pontevedra, Capiz.  With her at that
time were her husband Marcelo, Segundo Maguad, Gloria Maguad and Rodolfo Maguad.  She said that she then heard someone calling
for her husband thus:  <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">"Tay Seloy, Tay </span></i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Seloy, </span></i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">Tay Seloy."</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>When
Marcelo asked the caller who he was and where he was going, the latter
identified himself as <u>Richard</u> <u>de</u> <u>la</u> <u>Torre</u> and
requested Marcelo to conduct them to Pontevedra in his motorboat because they
were benighted.  Marcelo replied that he
did not have enough gasoline for the trip.  Thereupon, the man insisted that they be brought instead to Barangay
Quiawa, which is also in Bantigue.  Marcelo then told Segundo Maguad, their farm help who was at the first
floor of the house, to prepare a torch for their use during the trip.  At this point, Teresita said that she
stopped praying and whispered to her husband that the intentions of the men
outside were not good.  Marcelo merely
replied, "It seems," and forthwith got a flashlight.  Teresita then peeped through the window and
saw two men -- Suli (Eduardo Cordova) and his younger brother, Isidro
Cordova.  According to her, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">s</span>he was able to recognize both of them
because of the light emanating from the petromax on the ground floor of the
house.  When her husband approached the
window, beamed the flashlight at the man who called on him and asked the latter
how many they were, the man replied that they were four.  Suddenly, Reynaldo Cordova emerged with
another person from the dark and fired about six "rapid shots" at her
husband with the long firearm he was carrying.  Teresita lay down on the floor and her husband fell beside her.</p>

<p class="BODY">While still in the same position, she heard two more shots fired
in the direction of their house.  She
then remained prostrate on the floor with her fallen husband until Rodolfo
Maguad and Alex Acolentaba arrived.  Rodolfo told her that his father, who was downstairs, was dead.  She then asked Rodolfo to report the
incident to the police station at the poblacion.  At about 2:00 to 3:00 o'clock in the morning of the following
day, policemen arrived to investigate the killing.  Although they interviewed Rodolfo Maguad, they could not get
Teresita's statement because she was crying profusely.  It was only on 11 June 1986 that she gave
her sworn statement.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Teresita further testified that her family and the Cordovas had
not been in good terms because her husband "was against their fish trap
near our fishpond." Moreover, Marcelo had told her that when he was still
single, he had killed the uncle of Clarita Cordova -- mother of accused
Reynaldo, Eduardo and Isidro Cordova, Jr., mother-in-law of accused Freddie
Buenconsejo and grandmother of accused Ernesto Estorque, Jr.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Prosecution witness Norberto Javier declared that at about 7:00
o'clock on the night of the incident, he was fishing with his son along the
Pontevedra river when he noticed a motorboat carrying five men approach them.  He identified the men as Eduardo Cordova,
Reynaldo Cordova, Isidro Cordova, Jr., Freddie Buenconsejo and Ernesto
Estorque, Jr., the "driver" of the boat.  With a gun pointed at him, Eduardo asked him to put out his torch
while Reynaldo asked for his gasoline.  Norberto got the container of gasoline in his banca and handed it over
to Isidro.  The group then proceeded in
the direction of Pontevedra.  Later,
while he was across that same place where he had encountered the group, he saw
the motorboat return, this time with only three men on board.  He no longer recognized these men.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Pfc. Allan Contreras of the Integrated National Police (INP) in
Pontevedra testified that at around 1:30 o'clock in the morning of 30 May 1986,
Jessie Sevilla appeared in the police station and reported that Marcelo
Barruela and Segundo Maguad had been shot by four persons in Barangay
Bantigue.  Together with Pat. Rafael
Dipon and Rolando Alcazaren, he proceeded to Sevilla's house where they waited
for Rodolfo Maguad who had gone to Roxas City to inform Toto Barruela of his
(Toto's) father's death.  When Rodolfo
arrived, Contreras asked him if he knew who shot the victims; the former
answered that the killers were "Drobat" (Isidro Cordova, Jr.) and
"Suli" (Eduardo Cordova).  Thereafter, they headed for Barangay Bantigue and conducted an
investigation at the scene of the crime.  Pat. Dipon made two sketches of the crime scene, marking the spots where
the assailants allegedly fired at the victims, the place where Rodolfo Maguad
hid and other important points at the crime scene.  Contreras also asked Teresita Barruela if she knew the identities
of the assailants but the latter could not answer his questions as she kept on
crying.  After concluding the
investigation, they brought the bodies of the victims to Pontevedra.  At Pontevedra, somebody whispered to him
that Ernesto Estorque, Jr. had ferried some NPAs on his grandmother's motorboat
on the night of 29 May 1986.  Contreras
thus sought, and eventually found, Estorque.  The latter revealed that the group which commandeered his grandmother's
motorboat was led by a Commander Jojo.  Estorque then voluntarily agreed to give a written statement, which was
accomplished on 30 May 1986 (Exhibit "M").  A second informer told Contreras that the same men got some
gasoline from someone who was fishing by the river that same night.  The latter turned out to be Norberto
Javier.  Contreras likewise questioned
Norberto Javier who revealed that the persons who procured gasoline from him
were Reynaldo and Eduardo Cordova.  Norberto, however, refused to give a statement at that time because he
was afraid; he nevertheless promised to prepare one upon the arrival of his
brother "from the army."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">With the exception of Ernesto Estorque, Jr. who admitted having
seen Norberto Javier in the evening of 29 May 1986, all of the accused denied
having been in Barangay Bantigue on the night of the murder.  All, however, disclaimed having killed the
victims.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused Reynaldo Cordova declared that he was in the house of
Vice-Mayor Ildefonso Bernales in Punta, Tabuc, Roxas City on the night of the
incident.  Claiming that he and his
family were residing in the said house, he further recounted that between 7:00
and 7:30 o'clock that night, Roberto Makato and Ildefonso Bediones, Jr. arrived
to fetch the vice-mayor and take him to a meeting of the Kiwanis Club.  After having been served some beer, the duo
left with the vice-mayor at about 8:00 o'clock.  Reynaldo claims that he never left the vice-mayor's house that
night.  In fact, when the vice-mayor
arrived at around 12:00 o'clock midnight, he was there to open the door for the
latter.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

Reynaldo Cordova's testimony was corroborated by Vice-Mayor Bernales who added
that the distance between Punta, Tabuc and Bantigue is about twenty-one
kilometers; Bernales claims that it takes him forty minutes by car to get to
Pontevedra.  From Pontevedra, one had to
take a one-hour motorboat ride to finally reach Bantigue.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">Presenting a similar defense, accused Freddie Buenconsejo
testified that he was in his parents' house in Sangkal, President Roxas, Capiz on

<p class="BODY">For his part, accused Ernesto Estorque, Jr., who was thirteen
years old at the time <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of </span>the
killing, did not deny his presence in Bantigue in the evening of 29 May
1986.  Nor did he contradict Norberto
Javier's statement that he (Estorque, Jr.) piloted his grandmother's motorboat
that night.  Estorque, however, narrated
that on the said night, while both he and his grandmother, Clarita Cordova,
were harvesting the fish in their fishtraps adjoining the Barruelas' fishpond,
they heard gunshots coming from the direction of the latter's house -- a mere
twenty meters from their fishtraps.  After about fifteen minutes, a group of men headed by a certain
Commander Jojo "commandeered" his grandmother's motorboat and ordered
him, at gunpoint, to ferry them to Binangig.  After reaching Binangig, he returned to Bantigue to fetch his

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">The foregoing errors merely supplement
those set forth in the common brief.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the first assigned error in the common brief, the
appellants brand the principal prosecution witnesses as "unreliable, as
they are untruthful," and consider their testimonies as "highly
improbable and incredible."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn34" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a>
Claiming that the same should have been rejected by the trial court, they then
attack Teresita Barruela's declaration -- which they find unbelievable -- that
Marcelo Barruela had still asked Eduardo Cordova to identify himself when the
Cordova brothers were personally known to the Barruelas, and point out
inconsistencies in her testimony regarding the sequence of events after one of
the Cordovas had introduced himself as Richard de la Torre.  While she had testified on direct
examination that the men outside their house and her husband had a running
conversation before the latter directed Segundo Maguad to prepare a torch for
the trip, she later contradicted herself by stating that Segundo Maguad was
given the said instruction as her husband was fetching a flashlight.  Appellants likewise challenged Teresita's
claim that she had recognized her husband's assailants; appellants cite her
failure or refusal to reveal their identities <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">when </span>the police conducted an investigation after the
killing.  When Pfc. Contreras repeatedly
questioned her about the identities of the assailants in the course of his
six-hour investigation at the scene of the crime, she did not offer any answer.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellants similarly assail the credibility of Rodolfo
Maguad.  As in Teresita Barruela's case,
they claim that Rodolfo <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">allegedly
failed to immediately reveal to the authorities the identities of the
assailants.  Even during his interview
over radio station DYVR the day after the killing, he asserted that he did not
recognize the assailants.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, witness Norberto Javier is described by the
appellants as a "perjured witness" presented by the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">prosecution "in its </span>frantic
desire to corroborate by circumstantial evidence the highly incredible,
improbable and concocted testimonies of Teresita Barruela and Rodolfo
Maguad."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn35" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

<p class="BODY">Amplifying on their second assigned error, the appellants fault
the trial court for refusing to appreciate in their favor (a) the police
blotter of the Pontevedra police station which very clearly records the fact
that four "<u>unidentified</u>" persons killed Marcelo Barruela and
Segundo Maguad; (b) the spot report which discloses that "5 unidentified
persons" were the perpetrators; and (c) the sworn statements of Ernesto
Estorque, Jr. and Clarita Cordova which declare that the appellants were not responsible
for the killing.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">For the third assigned
error, the appellants insist that the trial court should have appreciated in
their favor the testimony of Leopoldo Barrios, a radio announcer at station
DYVR, to the effect that </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the evening of 30 May 1986, Rodolfo Maguad
went on the air to inform his brothers and sisters in Mindoro about their
father's death.  When asked by Barrios
about the details of the incident, Maguad categorically stated that a group of
men, the members of which he could not recognize, shot his father.  Enrico Galapan, a resident of Sitio
Kalipayan, Punta Tabuc, confirmed that he had heard Maguad's statements over
the radio.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn36" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the fourth and fifth assigned errors, the appellants take to
task the trial court for not according full faith and credit to the testimonies
of Alfonso Bediones, Jr., Vice-Mayor Bernales, Barangay Captain Besana and
Dominador Buenavista.</p>

<p class="BODY">In support of the sixth assigned error, the appellants question
the trial court's refusal to acquit Eduardo Cordova on the ground that as
testified to by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">his </span>mother, he
is "mentally defective." As a matter of fact, in his
cross-examination of Eduardo, Fiscal Claro Arches asked only one question
because he (Arches) knew that he could get nothing from a
"mentally-deranged" person.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn37" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the last assigned error, appellant Reynaldo Cordova claims
that if he were indeed guilty, he would have escaped.  On the contrary, however, he even visited the Barruela family to
pay his last respects to the deceased Marcelo Barruela whom he and his family
fondly called "Tay Seloy."</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants then end their arguments by insisting that although
alibi is a weak defense, it must be believed in this case since the testimonies
of the principal prosecution witnesses are unreliable, uncorroborated and
inconclusive.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the center of these assigned errors is the issue of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">credibility </span>of the opposing
witnesses.  A rule of long standing in
this jurisdiction, the respect for which remains undiminished, is that this
Court will <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">not </span>interfere with
the judgment of the trial court in passing <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">upon </span>the credibility of opposing witnesses unless there appears

is due to the fact that the trial court is in a better position to weigh <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">conflicting </span>testimonies, having heard
the witnesses themselves and observed their deportment and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">manner </span>of testifying.  Such deference, however, may be withdrawn if
it is shown that the trial court has plainly overlooked certain facts of
substance and value which, if considered, might affect the result of the case.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn39" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">We have, in the course of
the resolution of this case, meticulously pored over the voluminous transcripts
of the stenographic notes of the testimonies of the witnesses for both </span>parties.  <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">After
a careful and painstaking evaluation thereof, we have reached the inevitable
conclusion that the exception to the foregoing rule must be applied for, as
hereinafter expounded on, facts and circumstances of great weight and value
have been overlooked and misinterpreted by the trial court.  At the outset, we find the prosecution's
evidence </span>insufficient to establish the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">guilt of the appellants with moral certainty or rebut the presumption
of innocence accruing in their favor.  In short, proof beyond reasonable doubt is </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">wanting </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">in this case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">1. There was absolutely no direct evidence presented to show how
the killing of Segundo Maguad was consummated and who were responsible therefor
since soon after the firing of the initial six shots at Marcelo Barruela -- who
was standing by the window of the second storey of his house -- Teresita
Barruela fell face down on the floor while Rodolfo Maguad ran away to
hide.  Neither of them saw Segundo
Maguad's exact position at the time these shots were fired.  As to the next two successive shots, neither
of them saw where these shots were aimed at.  There is as well no showing that the gunshot wounds sustained by Segundo
were caused by bullets fired from the firearm used in the killing of Marcelo.</p>

<p class="NUM">2.  None of the prosecution
witnesses saw appellant Estorque at the scene of the crime.  It was only Norberto Javier who declared
that he saw the latter at 7:00 o'clock in the evening of 29 May 1986
"driving" Clarita Cordova's motorboat with Eduardo and Reynaldo
Cordova, Isidro Cordova, Jr. and Freddie Buenconsejo as passengers.  The trial court convicted Estorque as an <u>accessory</u>.  By so doing, therefore, it assumed that at
the time he was seen by Norberto Javier, the crimes in question had already
been committed.  No proof was offered to
support this assumption.  Nevertheless,
even if we are to concede to such a hypothesis, it will likewise be observed
that the prosecution presented no proof to show that Estorque had known of the
commission <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">of </span>the crimes.  For one to be held liable as an accessory,
it is essential that he must have <u>knowledge</u> of the commission of the
crime.  Article 19 of the Revised Penal
Code defines <u>accessories</u> as:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x those who, having knowledge of the commission of the
crime, and without having participated therein, either as principals or
accomplices, take part subsequent to its commission in any of the following
manners:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="text-indent:1.8pt">1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
profiting themselves or assisting the offender to profit by the effects of the
crime;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="text-indent:1.8pt"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>By concealing or destroying the
body of the crime or the effects or instruments thereof, in order to prevent
its discovery;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-27.0pt">3.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By harboring, concealing or assisting in
the escape of the principal of the crime, provided the accessory acts with
abuse of his public functions or whenever the author of the crime is guilty of
treason, parricide, murder, or an, attempt to take the life of the Chief
Executive, or is known to be habitually guilty of some other crime."</p>

<p class="BODY">Nor could it be assumed that even if a conspiracy had existed
among the assailants, Estorque could be considered a part thereof for at most,
his having been seen together with the other accused in the motorboat is purely
circumstantial evidence which, standing alone -- for there is no evidence of
any other circumstance -- does not sufficiently link him to such a
conspiracy.  For circumstantial evidence
to be sufficient for conviction, the following requisites must concur:  (a) there is more than one circumstance; (b)
the facts from which the inferences are derived are proven; and (c) the
combination of all the circumstances is such as to produce a conviction beyond
reasonable doubt.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn40" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There is a further obstacle that stands in the way of Estorque's
conviction.  While it has been proven
that he was only thirteen years old at the time of the incident, there are no
allegations in both informations that Estorque had acted with discernment.  And even if we are to consider the
allegations that he had committed the imputed acts "with intent to
kill" as sufficient compliance -- as we have in the past<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn41" href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></span></span></a>
-- he would still not be held liable as no proof was offered during trial that
he had so acted with discernment.  Accordingly, even if he was indeed a co-conspirator or an accessory, he
would still be exempt from criminal liability.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn42" href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">3.  The evidence for the
prosecution clearly shows that appellant Eduardo Cordova was not the person who
fired the shots.  Hence, his liability
would depend entirely on the existence of a conspiracy among the
assailants.  The trial court ruled that
conspiracy existed between Eduardo and Reynaldo Cordova who, as prosecution
witnesses Rodolfo Maguad and Teresita Barruela claimed, both fired the
shots.  A conspiracy exists when two or
more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and
decide to commit it.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn43" href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></span></span></a>
Direct evidence is not necessary to prove the same for such schemes are usually
hatched in secrecy, with witnesses other than the conspirators themselves
proving to be extremely difficult to find.  Moreover, it is settled that conspiracy need not be shown by direct

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, if we are to believe the testimonies of
Teresita Barruela and Rodolfo Maguad, we would not hesitate to rule that
conspiracy was duly established.  It was
Eduardo who, introducing himself as Richard de la Torre, called Marcelo
Barruela to request that he (Eduardo) and his companions be ferried <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">in </span>the latter's motorboat to
Pontevedra.  It was also Eduardo who,
upon being informed by Marcelo that the motorboat did not have enough gasoline,
insisted that they be brought to barangay Quiawa instead.  Thereupon, one of Eduardo's companions, whom
the said witnesses identified as Reynaldo Cordova, immediately fired six shots
at Marcelo.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering the testimonies of Teresita and Rodolfo in
conjunction with the declaration of Norberto Javier that at about 7:00 o'clock
that same evening, he saw Eduardo and Reynaldo together with their co-accused
Isidro Cordova, Jr. and Freddie Buenconsejo at the Pontevedra river aboard
Clarita Cordova's motorboat then being "driven" by appellant Estorque,
it would appear logical to conclude that Eduardo and Reynaldo were together
either before the shooting, if Norberto saw them before such shooting, or after
the incident, if he saw them after the killing.  As earlier observed, there is no evidence to show that Norberto
saw the appellants and the other accused either before or after the shooting.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since the foregoing disquisitions are based on the assumption
that the statements of witnesses Rodolfo Maguad and Teresita Barruela are true,
it behooves us to determine whether such testimonies, particularly with respect
to the presence of appellants Eduardo and Reynaldo Cordova at the scene of the
crime, are indeed credible.  On direct
examination, Rodolfo maintained that he was not inside Barruela's house when he
saw Eduardo and Reynaldo.  He claimed to
be at the fishpond dikes near the said house when he heard Marcelo Barruela
conversing with Eduardo.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn47" href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></span></span></a> Yet,
during Teresita Barruela's direct examination, it was categorically stated that
when someone -- identifying himself as Richard de la Torre -- called for her
husband, she was praying inside their home and her companions at that time were
Segundo Maguad, Gloria Maguad, Rodolfo Maguad and Marcelo Barruela.  Thus:</p>

<p class="BODY">It is clear that Rodolfo Maguad's declaration that he was out of
the house is unreliable as it has been shown that, on the contrary, he was
inside the house when the assailants allegedly arrived and Marcelo Barruela was
shot.  While we have arrived at such a conclusion,
however, we cannot help but observe that Rodolfo was quite categorical in
asserting that upon seeing Teresita Barruela in the second floor of the house
with the body of Marcelo, the latter told him "to report to the police
authorities at the poblacion of Pontevedra, Capiz"; thus, he and Alex
Acolentaba immediately left.  They,
however, proceeded to the house of Jessie Sevilla, Marcelo's nephew, where they
related what had happened to Marcelo and Segundo Maguad.  It is logical to presume that if he had
truly seen and recognized the assailants, Rodolfo would have forthwith revealed
their identities to Jessie Sevilla.  And
since it was Jessie Sevilla who proceeded to the Pontevedra police station to
report the incident, it is likewise logical to presume that the basis of his
report would be what was narrated to him by Rodolfo.  Jessie's report was entered by Pfc. Allan Contreras<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn49" href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

in the police blotter as entry no. 1000002 at 1:30 o'clock in the morning of 30
May 1986.  It reads:</p>

<blockquote>"Jessie Sevella (sic) of legal age, married, res., of Brgy
Tabuc, this mplty., reported that on or about 292000 May 86, Mr. Marcelo
Barruela, fishpond optr and res of Roxas City, and his fishpond caretaker, Godo
Maguad were shot by 4 unidentified persons while at his fishpond at Brgy
Bantigue, this mplty.  Immediately, INP
Team led by Pfc Contreras, AC, with Pat Alcazarin RB, and Dipon, RR, Jr., were

<p class="BODY">Now, if Rodolfo had indeed told Jessie Sevilla who the assailants
of Marcelo and Segundo were, it would have been unlikely for Jessie not to have
revealed the same to the police authorities as he (Jessie) immediately
proceeded to the station.  Nor would
Jessie have been merely satisfied by informing the police that the authors of
the crime were four "unidentified persons" considering that his own
uncle, Marcelo, was a victim.  Thus, the
only plausible reason why Jessie described the assailants as
"unidentified" is because his source -- Rodolfo, whose own father was
killed -- was not in fact able to identify them.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon his team's return, Pfc. Contreras <u>himself</u><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn51" href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">It bears stressing that Contreras made this entry upon meeting
Rodolfo at Jessie Sevilla's house -- after the latter had made the report
summarized in the first entry (Exhibit "4-B") -- and after having
verbally investigated him and completed the inspection of the crime scene in
his and Teresita and Toto Barruela's presence.  Upon being questioned by the trial court, Contreras admitted that this
entry was based "on my investigation from Brgy. Bantigue,"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn53" href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup></span></span></a>
<i>i.e.,</i> the investigation he conducted in the barangay where the killings
took place.  It is thus obvious that
despite all these, Pfc. Contreras and the members of his team were unable to
ascertain the assailants' identities as their names were not entered in the
police blotter.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that entries in police blotters should not be given
undue significance or probative value, for they are usually incomplete and
inaccurate, sometimes from either partial suggestions or for want of suggestion
or inquiries.  However, in the instant
case, considering that the first entry (Exhibit "4-Â­B") was made on
the basis of the report given by Sevilla immediately after being informed by
Rodolfo Maguad about the killings and, considering further that Jessie Sevilla
was not even called to the witness stand by the prosecution to testify on what
he had reported, the said entry cannot just be disregarded.  On the matter of the second entry (Exhibit
"4-C"), it is to be noted that no less than the team leader himself,
Pfc. Contreras, prepared the same at a time when the occurrences he had just
investigated -- even if preliminarily -- were still very fresh in his
mind.  Being an experienced
investigator, he certainly knew what to enter in the police blotter.  He would therefore not have written that the
assailants were unidentified if such was not the fact.</p>

<p class="BODY">Teresita Barruela's courtroom testimony is likewise
unreliable.  Our evaluation of it
strongly indicates that she was unable to see the assailants, much less
identify them.  She claims that she
peeped through the window and saw Eduardo Cordova and his younger brother
Isidro because of the light emanating from the petromax which was under their
house.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn54" href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup></span></span></a>
If there was indeed a petromax illuminating the place where the persons who
called Marcelo Barruela were positioned, we find it difficult to understand why
the latter still had to look for his flashlight and beam it towards the
former.  Moreover, the team of Pfc.
Allan Contreras conducted thorough investigation of the crime scene and meticulously
prepared sketches which indicate the relative locations of the victims, the
empty shells and the other objects which the members saw there, such as the
bed, tables, chairs, jars, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">a </span>box,
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">a </span>dirty kitchen stove and the
sink.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn55" href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup></span></span></a>
It is to be observed that no petromax appears in the said sketches.  So vital a piece of evidence could not have
entirely escaped these investigators' attention.  Both Pfc. Allan Contreras and Pat. Rafael Dipon, Jr., the person
who prepared the said sketches, never mentioned, while testifying, that there
was a petromax in the house of the Barruelas or at any other place at the scene
of the crime.  Finally, from the
testimony of Teresita Barruela, it may also be gathered that her husband did
not recognize the person who addressed him as "Tay Seloy" and
requested to be brought, together with his companions, to Pontevedra.  Thus, Marcelo was only able to answer
"It seems" when Teresita whispered to him that the intention of such
men were not good.  If indeed Marcelo
knew the identity of the person who called for him, he would not have just said
"It seems."</p>

<p class="BODY">What is more unusual about Teresita's actuation was her failure
to disclose the identities of the assailants to Pfc. Contreras or any other
member of his team during the entire time they were in her house.  The said policemen stayed with her from
early dawn to 7:00 o'clock in the morning of 30 May 1986 or, according to her,
for six hours.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn56" href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup></span></span></a>
We find her explanation -- Â­that she was unable to furnish such information
because she was crying -- to be unacceptable.  Her answers during cross-examination do not at all suggest that it was
impossible for her to have answered the questions intended to elicit the
identities of the assailants.  Thus:</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that Teresita revealed the assailants' identities only
on 11 June 1986.  It is of course
settled that delay <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">or<i> </i></span>vacillation
in making a criminal accusation does not necessarily impair the credibility of
a witness if such delay is satisfactorily explained.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

In the instant case, we find Teresita's explanation to be insufficient and
inadequate.  There is no evidence to
show that she was hysterical at the time the policemen were in her house; that
she was<i> </i>so distraught as to preclude her from answering any question; or
that she was afraid of revealing the names of the assailants for fear of
reprisal.  Considering the fact that it
was no less than her husband who was killed, the most natural thing for her to
have done was to have, despite the tears, identified the Cordovas as the
authors of the heinous crime if indeed they were.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the light of the foregoing exposition on the testimonies of
Teresita Barruela and Rodolfo Maguad, it is obvious that the culpability of
both appellants have been placed in serious doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even the testimony of Norberto Javier did not save the day for
the prosecution as the same is inherently improbable.  On direct examination, he testified that Reynaldo Cordova pointed
an armalite at him.  Thereupon, after
transferring to his (Norberto's) boat, Reynaldo asked where the gasoline was
kept; when Norberto told Reynaldo that the gasoline was at the rear of the
engine room, the latter ordered him to get it.  Norberto then complied with the command.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn59" href="#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup></span></span></a> And
yet, during cross-examination, Norberto declared that on 3 June 1987, when
Reynaldo Cordova came to his house, asked him whether the gasoline obtained by
Marcelo Barruela's killers was taken from him and told him that it was good
that nothing happened to him (Norberto), the latter did not bother to confront
Reynaldo about what he (Reynaldo) allegedly did in the evening of 29 May 1986
simply because Reynaldo "was in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>hurry."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn60" href="#_ftn60" name="_ftnref60" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

If indeed Reynaldo Cordova pointed an armalite at Norberto Javier and demanded
gasoline, Norberto's natural reaction should have been to immediately <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">confront </span>Reynaldo about the episode.</p>

<p class="NUM"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">4.  </span>Adding further doubt to the

<p class="BODY">It is to be likewise noted that Pfc. Contreras had earlier
declared that he investigated Estorque on 30 May 1986.  Estorque supposedly averred that he was the
one who "conducted" the banca used by the NPAs who were led by
Commander Jojo.  Estorque's sworn statement
was immediately taken on that date and subsequently offered by the prosecution

Needless to say, the prosecution is bound by said Exhibit "M" which
is also marked as Exhibit "2" for the defense.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn63" href="#_ftn63" name="_ftnref63" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="NUM"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">5. </span>Finally, we are
not persuaded by the trial court's thesis that appellants Reynaldo and Eduardo
Cordova killed Marcelo Barruela out of vengeance because the latter purportedly
killed their mother's uncle, Lucio Barruela, in 1953.  Evident premeditation is thus suggested.</p>

<p class="BODY">Reynaldo Cordova was only twenty-nine years old when he testified
on 17 September 1987<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn64" href="#_ftn64" name="_ftnref64" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup></span></span></a>
while Eduardo Cordova was twenty-three years old when he testified on 23
September 1987.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn65" href="#_ftn65" name="_ftnref65" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup></span></span></a>
In other words, Reynaldo and Eduardo were born in 1958 and 1964, respectively
-- long after Lucio Barruela's death.  There is no evidence on record to show how Lucio was killed and whether
Marcelo Barruela was convicted or acquitted for such an act.  It was, as well, not established whether
appellants Reynaldo and Eduardo Cordova had determined to kill Marcelo in
retaliation for the death of Lucio and had clung to such a determination.  For evident premeditation to exist, the
following requisites must concur: (1) the time when the offender determined to
commit the crime, (2) an act manifestly indicating that he has clung to his
determination, and (3) a sufficient lapse of time between the determination and
execution to allow him to reflect upon the consequences of his act.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn66" href="#_ftn66" name="_ftnref66" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup></span></span></a>
None of these requisites are present in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are not convinced that the prosecution was able to discharge
its burden of overcoming, by proof beyond reasonable doubt -- or that degree of
proof which produces a conviction in an unprejudiced mind<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn67" href="#_ftn67" name="_ftnref67" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

-- the presumption of innocence which appellants Eduardo and Reynaldo Cordova
are entitled to.  Short of this, it is
not only the appellants' right to be freed; it is, even more, the
constitutional duty of the court to acquit them.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn68" href="#_ftn68" name="_ftnref68" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup></span></span></a> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">It must always be remembered that an
accusation is not synonymous with guilt and that an accused's freedom is
forfeit only if the requisite quantum of proof necessary for conviction be in
existence.  The proof presented against
the accused must survive the test of reason; the strongest suspicion must not
be permitted to </span>sway <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">judgment.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn69" href="#_ftn69" name="_ftnref69" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">The foregoing disquisitions render unnecessary further discussion
regarding the other issues raised in the assignment of errors, save for the
claimed insanity of Eduardo Cordova under the sixth assigned error.  We shall now consider this ascribed error.</p>

<p class="BODY">The law presumes all acts to be voluntary, and that it is
improper to presume that acts were done unconsciously.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

The quantum of evidence required to overthrow the presumption of sanity is<i> </i>proof
beyond reasonable doubt.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn71" href="#_ftn71" name="_ftnref71" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup></span></span></a>
Since insanity is in the nature of a confession and avoidance, it must be
proven beyond reasonable doubt.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn72" href="#_ftn72" name="_ftnref72" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup></span></span></a>
Moreover, an accused is presumed to have been sane at the time of the
commission of the crime in the absence of positive evidence to show that he had
lost his reason or was demented prior to or during the perpetration of the
crime.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn73" href="#_ftn73" name="_ftnref73" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup></span></span></a>
Eduardo's mother was already making a conclusion when she stated that Eduardo
had no work because he was insane.  More
concrete acts showing the mental condition of the person alleged <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to be insane need to be shown in order that
insanity may be appreciated in his favor.  In </span><i>People vs. Dungo,</i><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn74" href="#_ftn74" name="_ftnref74" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup></span></span></a><i> </i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">we held:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Thus, insanity must be shown by surrounding circumstances
fairly throwing light on the subject, such as evidence of the alleged deranged
person's general conduct and appearance, his acts and conduct inconsistent with
his previous character and habits, his irrational acts and beliefs, and his
improvident bargains."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The neuro-psychiatric evaluation report for appellant Eduardo
Cordova dated 4 September 1987 and which states the following:</p>

<blockquote>"Impression-Neuro-psychiatric and psychological evaluation
shows that the subject is suffering from a mental disorder called schizophrenia
Paranoid Type."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn75" href="#_ftn75" name="_ftnref75" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">is not relevant at all as it concerns his
mental condition at the time of trial.  The inquiry into his mental condition should relate to the period
immediately before or at the very moment the crime was committed.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn76" href="#_ftn76" name="_ftnref76" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, appellant Eduardo Cordova did not even ask for the
suspension of his arraignment on the ground that he was suffering from
insanity.  Paragraph (a), Section 12,
Rule 116 of the Revised Rules of Court provides that the arraignment of an
accused who <u>appears</u> to be suffering from an unsound mental condition
which effectively renders him unable to fully understand the charge against him
and to plead intelligently thereto, shall be suspended.  In the case at bar, Eduardo Cordova even
took the witness stand to testify.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records, however, disclose that in April of 1988, when
Eduardo showed signs of mental abnormality, the Provincial Warden of Capiz
reported the matter to the trial court<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn77" href="#_ftn77" name="_ftnref77" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup></span></span></a>

Mental Health at Mandaluyong, Metro Manila.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn78" href="#_ftn78" name="_ftnref78" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup></span></span></a> On 5
October 1989, his discharge from the center was recommended by a resident

trial.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn79" href="#_ftn79" name="_ftnref79" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

It was only on 26 March 1992, however, that Eduardo was discharged from the
