IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW AND APPLICABLE DECISIONS OF THIS HONORABLE SUPREME
COURT.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">To us, the crucial issues that are to be resolved in this
controversy are:</p>

<p class="BODY">Whether or not the plaintiff in Civil Case No. 175034, the
private respondent herein, has a cause of action to bring <span style="">a </span>suit for indemnity of improvements
with injunction against the petitioners; and if she has,</p>

<p class="BODY">Whether or not her cause of action has been abandoned, waived,
barred by prescription, or barred by failure to seasonably set it up as a
compulsory counterclaim.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition is impressed <span style="">with
merit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The reliance by the respondent Court of Appeals on Articles 448
and 546 of the Civil Code of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
is misplaced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These provisions have no
application to a contract of lease which is the subject matter of this
controversy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, Article 1678 of
the Civil Code applies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">We </span>quote:</p>

<blockquote>Art. 1678.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the lessee
makes, in good faith, useful improvements which are suitable to the use for
which the lease is intended, without altering the form or substance of the
property leased, the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> upon termination of the
lease shall pay the lessee one-half <span style="">of
the value of the improvements at that time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Should the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> refuse to reimburse said
amount, the lessee may remove the improvements, even though the principal thing
may suffer damage </span>thereby.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
shall not, however, cause any more impairment upon the property leased than is
necessary.</blockquote>

<blockquote>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, Article 448 governs the right of accession
while Article 546 pertains to effects of possession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The very language of these two provisions
clearly manifest their inapplicability to lease contracts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They provide:</p>

<blockquote>ART. 448.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The owner of the
land on which anything has been built, sown or planted in good faith, shall
have the right to appropriate <span style="">as </span>his own the works, sowing or planting, after payment of the
indemnity provided for in articles 546 and 548, or to oblige the one who built
or planted to pay the price of the land, and the one who sowed, the proper
rent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the builder or planter
cannot be obliged to buy the land if its value is considerably more than that
of the building or trees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In such case,
he shall pay reasonable rent, if the owner of the land does not choose to
appropriate the building or trees after proper indemnity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The parties shall <span style="">agree upon the terms of lease and in </span>case of disagreement, the
court shall fix the terms thereof.</blockquote>

<blockquote>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>ART. 546.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Necessary expenses
shall be refunded to every possessor; but only the possessor in good faith may
retain the thing until he has been reimbursed <span class="SpellE"><span style="">therefor</span></span><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Useful expenses shall be refunded only to the possessor in good
faith with the same right of retention, the person who has defeated him in the
possession having the option of refunding the <span style="">amount of the expenses or of paying the increase in value which the
thing may </span>have acquired by reason thereof.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners do not dispute the contention of the private
respondent that her father, <span class="SpellE">Gaspar</span> <span class="SpellE">Devis</span>, filled the leased parcel of land with truck loads of
big stones or r<span style="">o</span>cks (<span class="SpellE">escumbro</span>), and enclosed or walled the same with hollow
blocks before constructing <span style="">a </span>residential
house thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All these, being in the
nature of expenses which augmented the value of the land,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
or increased the income from it, or improved its productivity, are useful
improvements within the purview of the law.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">But, it must be remembered, as in fact it is not <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>, that <span class="SpellE">Gaspar</span> <span class="SpellE">Devis</span> was a lessee by virtue of a lease contract between
him and the City of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a mere lessee, he knew that the parcel of
land in question was not his but belonged to the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even the respondent court conceded this fact
when it stated that the private respondent was "not claiming prior
possession, much less ownership of the land as heir of her father."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, the improvements that the private respondent's father had
introduced in the leased premises were done at his own risk as lessee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The right to indemnity equivalent to one-half
of the value of the said improvements--the house, the filling materials, and
the hollow block fence or wall--is governed, as earlier adverted to, by <span style="">the </span>provisions of Art. 1678, first
paragraph of the Civil Code above-quoted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But this right to indemnity exists only if the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>
opts to appropriate the improvements.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
The refusal of the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> to pay the lessee one-half
of the value of the useful improvements gives rise to the right of
removal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this score, the commentary
of Justice <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> is enlightening.</p>

<blockquote>Note that under the 1st paragraph of Art. 1678, the law on the
right of REMOVAL says that "should the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>
refuse to reimburse said amount, the <span style="">lessee
may remove the improvements, </span>even though <span style="">the principal thing may suffer thereby." While the phrase
"even though" implies that Art. 1678 always applies regardless of
whether or not the improvements can be removed without injury to the leased
premises, it is believed that application of the Article cannot always be done.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rule is evidently intended for cases
where a </span>true accession <span style="">takes
place as when part of the land leased is, say, converted into a fishpond; and
certainly </span>not <span style="">where as easily
removable thing (such as </span>a <span style="">wooden
fence) has been introduced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no
doubt that in a case involving such </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">detachable fence, the
lessee can take the same </span><span style="">away </span><span style="">with him when the lease expires.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Now then, indeed the private respondent would have <span style="">a </span>cause of action against the
petitioners for indemnity under Article 1678 of the Civil Code if the latter
had chosen to appropriate the said improvements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, there is nothing in the records to
indicate that such choice was made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
the other hand, there is no showing either that the private respondent
manifested her desire to remove these improvements absent any payment of the
required indemnity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She, or her deceased
father, should have removed the improvements at the time when the lease expired<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
on July 26, 1968<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
there being no true accession (the improvements consisting of the house, <span class="SpellE">escumbro</span>, and hollow blocks, being removable without really
destroying the land), or at the time of the filing of the unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> case which <span style="">was
</span>on October 19, 1968.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Her failure to do so, we rule, constitutes <span style="">a </span>waiver or abandonment of her right
of removal of the improvements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But even
if there was no abandonment <span style="">or waiver </span>of her right of removal, still she could not later file
a complaint for the indemnity of the improvements because that cause of action
had long prescribed, accruing as it did when the petitioners effectively
appropriated the improvements when the lease expired on July 26, 1968, or even
when the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case was filed on October 19,
1968.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complaint of the private
respondent for indemnity was filed on <st1:date year="1984" day="27" month="11">November
 27, 1984</st1:date>, more than sixteen years from the accrual of the cause of
action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the complaint <span style="">was </span>filed six years after the
expiration of the prescriptive period of ten years as provided in Article 1144,
paragraph (2)<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
of the Civil Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The obligation of the
<span class="SpellE">lessor</span> to indemnify the lessee <span style="">is </span>created by law, viz., Article
1678, first paragraph, of the Civil Code earlier quoted.</p>

<p class="BODY">In any event, well-established is the doctrine that the
counterclaim for reimbursement of the useful expenses is in the nature of a
