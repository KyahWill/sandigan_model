				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal by the Republic of the Philippines from a lower court decision granting the petition for naturalization of appellee Alfonso P. Bichara. The reversal of such decision was based on the alleged lack of competence of the witnesses for the applicant and on his failing to conduct himself in a proper and irreproachable manner during the entire period of his residence in this country. The case was submitted for decision without oppositor-appellant's reply brief. <p>On March 11, 1982, there was a Manifestation and Motion by the Office of the Solicitor General.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> It alleged: "1.

Bichara]; 2. During the pendency of the appeal, said [Alfonso P.
