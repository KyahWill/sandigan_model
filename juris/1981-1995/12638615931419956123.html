the ground among others that a perusal of the names allegedly supporting the
said petition showed that said persons by the nature <span class="GramE">of</span>
their jobs are performing managerial functions and/or occupying confidential
positions such that they cannot validly constitute a separate distinct group
from the existing collective bargaining unit also represented by private
respondent.</p>

issued by Med-Arbiter <span class="SpellE">Conchita</span> Martinez when it was
established that a collective bargaining unit (NFL) between the Corporation and
the rank-and-file employees was and is in existence at the time of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">filing </span>of the said petition for
certification election until the present filing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">However,

consistently ruled in a long line of decisions, mere supervisory designations

supervisory designations are coupled with actual performance of managerial
functions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the cases at bar, what was
submitted by the respondent companies are only lists of employees holding the
positions of foremen and confidential positions and as such <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">are </span>not covered by the bargaining

others:</p>

<p class="2Q">“2.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That since the petitions

<p class="2Q">“3.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That with respect to
those employees holding confidential positions, it is a basic principle that
they cannot be included in any bargaining unit, the fact being that having
access to confidential <span class="SpellE">informations</span>, said employees
may be the source of undue advantage.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Said employees may act <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>spies
for either <span class="GramE">parties</span> to collective bargaining

this case where the petitioning union is already the bargaining agent of the
rank-and-file employees in the establishment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>To allow confidential employees to join existing bargaining unit will
defeat the very purpose for which <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">an </span>employee

<p class="BODY">The petition merits <span class="GramE">Our</span> consideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents relied heavily on the alleged finding of Med­-Arbiter
Martinez that the employees who were signatories <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">to the </span>petition for certification election and represented by
respondent <st1:place>Union</st1:place> are actually rank-and-file workers not
disqualified <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">from </span>entering into <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">a </span>collective bargaining agreement with <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">management.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In </span>said findings of fact, Med-Arbiter
Martinez singled out in her classification as rank-and-file employees the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">foremen </span>of Petitioner Corporation
considered from their joint affidavits for lack of convincing proof that their
supervisory designations are coupled with the actual performance of managerial
functions.</p>

<p class="BODY">Whether or not such finding is supported by the evidence <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">is </span>beside the point.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondents herein do not dispute that the
signatories (listed in Annex "A", page 30, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)
to the Petition for certification election subject of this case, were holding
the positions of cashier, purchasers, personnel officers, foremen and employees
having access to confidential information such as accounting personnel, radio
and telegraph operators and head of various sections.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is also a fact that respondent <st1:place>Union</st1:place>
is the exclusive bargaining Unit of the rank-and-file employees of <span class="GramE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">petitioner </span>corporation</span>
and that an existing CBA between petitioner corporation and the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>
representing these rank-and-file employees was still enforced at the time the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>
filed a petition for certification election in behalf of the aforementioned
signatories.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under the terms of said CBA
(Annex “E”, p. 40, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>) it is expressly provided
that:</p>

<p class="2Q"><span class="GramE">"Section 1.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The COMPANY and the <st1:place>UNION</st1:place>
hereby agree that the recognized bargaining unit for purposes of this agreement
shall consist of regular rank-and-file workers employed by the COMPANY at the
plantation presently situated at <span class="SpellE">Alejal</span>, Carmen, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Davao</span></span></st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, all managerial personnel like,
superintendents, supervisor, foremen, administrative, professional and
confidential employees, and those temporary, casual contractual, and seasonal
workers are excluded from the bargaining unit and therefore, not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">covered by this agreement." (p. 41, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Respondents do not dispute the existence
of said collective bargaining agreement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>We must therefore respect this CBA which was freely and voluntarily entered
into as the law between the parties for the duration of the period agreed
upon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Until then no one can be compelled
to accept changes in the terms of the collective bargaining agreement.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, the signatories to the petition for certification
election are the very type of employees by the nature of their positions and
functions which We have decreed as disqualified from bargaining with management
in case of Bulletin Publishing Co. Inc. vs. Hon. <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span>
Sanchez, etc. (144 SCRA 628) reiterating herein the rationale for such ruling
as follows:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>if these managerial
employees would belong to or be affiliated with a Union, the latter might not
be assured of their loyalty to the Union in view of evident conflict of
interests or that the Union can be company-dominated with the presence of
managerial employees in Union membership.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>A managerial employee is defined under Art. 212 (k) of the new Labor
Code as "one who is vested with powers or prerogatives to lay down and
execute management <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">policies </span>and/or
to hire, transfer, suspend, lay-off, recall, discharge, assign or discipline
employees, or to effectively recommend such managerial actions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All employees not falling within <span class="GramE">this definitions</span> are considered rank-and-rile employees for
purposes of this Book."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">This </span>rationale
holds true also for confidential employees such as accounting personnel, radio
and telegraph operators, who having access to confidential information, may
become the source of undue advantage.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Said employee(s) may act as a spy or spies of either party to a
collective bargaining agreement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is
<span class="GramE">specially</span> true in the present case where the
petitioning <st1:place>Union</st1:place> is already the bargaining agent of the
rank-and-file employees in the establishment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>To allow the confidential employees to join the existing <st1:place>Union</st1:place>
of the rank-and-file would be in violation of the terms of the Collective
Bargaining Agreement wherein this kind of employees by the nature of their
functions/positions <span class="GramE">are</span> expressly excluded.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the company foremen, while in the performance of supervisor
functions, they may be the extension or alter ego of the management.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Adversely, the foremen, by their actuation,
may influence the workers under their supervision to engage in slow down
commercial activities or similar activities detrimental to the policy, interest
or business objectives of the company or corporation, hence they also cannot
join.</p>
