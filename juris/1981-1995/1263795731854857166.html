<blockquote>"There being no proof beyond reasonable doubt established by
the prosecution's evidence to prove the culpability and responsibility of the

accused pleaded Not Guilty to the charges in both the afore-quoted <span class="SpellE">Informations</span>.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

trial, the prosecution presented four (4) witnesses and marked as exhibits five
(5) pieces of real and documentary evidence, with sub-markings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The defense on the other hand presented five
(5) witnesses, to include the three (3) accused themselves, but did not offer
any real or documentary evidence.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"According to this witness he is a laborer in the '<span class="SpellE">bularan</span>' (fish drying) business of <span class="SpellE">Morito</span>
Espinosa, at <span class="SpellE">Tugbungan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>

deceased-victim in Criminal Case No. 1878 (6827) for Murder was also a laborer
in the same establishment, but who was employed ahead of him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Just like him, and <span class="SpellE">Desanta</span>,
the accused <span class="SpellE">Efren</span> <span class="SpellE">Garufil</span>, <span class="SpellE">Diosdado</span> <span class="SpellE">Tek</span> and Nestor <span class="SpellE">Sitol</span> were also laborers in <span class="SpellE">Morito</span>

accused <span class="SpellE">Efren</span> <span class="SpellE">Garufil</span>
started working thereat in a later date than him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="2">2:00 o'clock</st1:time>
<st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time>, both <span class="SpellE">Erinio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Badian</span> and <span class="SpellE">Ronilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Desanta</span> were lying at the back portion which is behind the <span class="GramE">drivers</span> seat of a jeep belonging to their employer <span class="SpellE">Morito</span> Espinosa, which jeep was parked in front of the
bodega also owned by <span class="SpellE">Morito</span> Espinosa and that there
was a lighted <span class="SpellE">flourescent</span> light just obliquely above
the parked jeep.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It appears that <span class="SpellE">Erinio</span> <span class="SpellE">Badian</span> was lying on the
right side of the jeep with his head towards the driver's seat while <span class="SpellE">Ronilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Desanta</span> was lying on the
side opposite him in the same jeep.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
was while both <span class="SpellE">Badian</span> and <span class="SpellE">Desanta</span>
were in such positions, that according to <span class="SpellE">Badian</span>, he
felt something warm on his stomach, so he held his stomach and discovered that
there was blood on his stomach.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
discovery of blood made <span class="SpellE">Badian</span> stand up and at this
point he saw the accused <span class="SpellE">Efren</span> <span class="SpellE">Garufil</span>
jumped from the jeep, still holding a knife which appeared white on both sides,
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "B"), and he also saw the accused <span class="SpellE">Diosdado</span> <span class="SpellE">Tek</span> and Nestor <span class="SpellE">Sitol</span> running towards the fence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then <span class="SpellE">Ronilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Desanta</span> shouted for help <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:

to the place he sat before, at the same time pressing the wound on his stomach
to stop the flow of blood.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Later, <span class="SpellE">Morito</span> Espinosa, their employer came and brought <span class="SpellE">Badian</span> and <span class="SpellE">Desanta</span> to the
hospital, and it was while <span class="SpellE">Badian</span> was still in the
hospital that he learned of <span class="SpellE">Desanta's</span> death.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The prosecution also presented Dr. Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Valmoria</span>, the Chief Medical Officer of the Philip­pine
Constabulary Crime Laboratory of Region IX, at <st1:street><st1:address>R.T.

"C") of Police Investigator Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Tuble</span>, he conducted a post-mortem Examination of the <span class="SpellE">cavader</span> of <span class="SpellE">Ronilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Desanta</span> at the Villa Funeral Homes, at about 9:00 o'clock
in the morning of October 3, 1983.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon
examination of the cadaver of <span class="SpellE">Desanta</span>, he discovered
two stab wounds, for which he prepared a sketch of a human body to show the
positions of these stab wounds (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. <span class="GramE">"D", "D-1" and "D-2".</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The first injury he found on the cadaver of <span class="SpellE">Desanta</span> was a stab wound on the upper chest or left <span class="SpellE">infraclavicular</span> region and this wound penetrated the lung,
while the second stab wound was found on the right upper front chest or right <span class="SpellE">clavicular</span> region.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Both wounds according to Dr. <span class="SpellE">Valmoria</span> <span class="GramE">was</span> caused by a sharp bladed instrument for which Exhibit
"B", the knife could qualify as such.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He also declared that he prepared a Medico-Legal Necropsy Report (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. <span class="GramE">"E", "E-1", to
"E-6") showing the results and findings of his post-mortem
examination of the cadaver of <span class="SpellE">Desanta</span>, including the
cause of death which is "Cardio-respiratory arrest due to shock and
hemorrhage secondary to stabbed wounds chest."</span> Dr. <span class="SpellE">Valmoria</span> further said that he prepared and issued a death
certificate of <span class="SpellE">Ronilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Desanta</span>,
marked as Exhibits "A", "A-1", "A-2" and
"A-3" for Criminal Case No. 1878(6827)." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
pp. 4-5)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The accused-appellant admits having stabbed the two victims but
he claims that he acted in self-defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The facts from the viewpoint of the appellant are given <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>follows:</p>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Efren</span> <span class="SpellE">Garufil</span>
testified that he is from <span class="SpellE">Jimalalud</span>, <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Oriental.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
August of 1983 he came to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> and first worked with a
certain <span class="SpellE">Tasio</span> Arroyo at <span class="SpellE">Tugbungan</span>,
<st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
but after working for only twenty-five days thereat, he quit and then worked at
the <span class="SpellE">Bularan</span> of <span class="SpellE">Morito</span>
Espinosa also at <span class="SpellE">Tugbungan</span> of the same City.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At Espinosa's <span class="SpellE">Bularan</span>,
he cooks his food and sleeps inside the bodega.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>That before the incident, he went only once to the City proper by riding
in the jeep of Mr. Espinosa in order to buy a pair of pants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For this reason, he does not know where the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City Hall</st1:placetype></st1:place>
is located, or the Police Station, fire station or <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">even </span>the market place.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Continuing further his testimony, he stated that at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="8">8:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the evening of <st1:date year="1983" day="2" month="10">October 2, 1983</st1:date>, he took his supper
in the bodega together with his fellow workers, in the persons of <span class="SpellE">Diosdado</span> <span class="SpellE">Tek</span> and Nestor <span class="SpellE">Sitol</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After supper,
both <span class="SpellE">Diosdado</span> <span class="SpellE">Tek</span> and
Nestor <span class="SpellE">Sitol</span> washed up and went to their sleeping
quarters in the bodega while he stayed, because he was making wooden boxes
which were to be used the following day to pack the dried fish and he had to
work late because he was working on a "<span class="SpellE">pakiao</span>"
(piece of work) basis.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00 o'clock</st1:time> that same evening, he heard a
voice calling for him and he recognized the voice of <span class="SpellE">Ronilo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Desanta</span> who is a co-worker at Espinosa's <span class="SpellE">Bularan</span> and the one in charge of the bodega.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon hearing <span class="SpellE">Desanta's</span>
voice, he stopped working and laid down the hammer and the box he was holding
and went out of the bodega where he saw <span class="SpellE">Desanta</span> and <span class="SpellE">Badian</span> who were both about 6 meters to the door of the
bodega.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon approaching <span class="SpellE">Desanta</span>, he was immediately collared by <span class="SpellE">Desanta</span>
and then boxed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Likewise <span class="SpellE">Badian</span> was holding a piece of wood 2 inches by 2 inches in
size and about a meter long, hit him with said piece of wood.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He then asked his two tormentors why they
were mauling him when he had no fault, to which the two answered in this way,
'now, you cannot do anything.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>You just
challenge us.' He retorted that he will not challenge them as they are not <span class="GramE">enemies,</span> beside he had no fault to them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Despite of this, he was still being held by
the two until he reached the interior of the bodega where he shouted at his
employer twice for help as he was being mauled, but no help came as his
employer was fast asleep.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Neither did <span class="SpellE">Diosdado</span> <span class="SpellE">Tek</span> or Nestor <span class="SpellE">Sitol</span> <span class="GramE">helped</span> him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When no one came to help him, he continued to
move backward until he was pushed against a drum with the deceased victim <span class="SpellE">Desanta</span> holding his hair and continued to hit him with fist
blows.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As he tried to push the two back­wards,
his hand dropped and was able to take hold of something which he came to know
later as a knife.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So, he stabbed <span class="SpellE">Desanta</span> first but only once because he was the one holding
him by the hair.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After being hit, <span class="SpellE">Desanta</span> went out of the bodega while <span class="SpellE">Badian</span>
continued to hit him with fist blows, so he also thrust the knife at him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then he went to the sleeping quarters of <span class="SpellE">Diosdado</span> <span class="SpellE">Tek</span> and Nestor <span class="SpellE">Sitol</span> and woke them up and requested them to accompany him
to the Police Station to surrender as he killed a person.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At first <span class="SpellE">Tek</span> and <span class="SpellE">Sitol</span> refused but upon his insistence for the reason that
he does not know where the police station is located, they finally agreed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He then brought his bag and his clothes
because he knew he will be imprisoned and that he cannot anymore work at
Espinosa's <span class="SpellE">Bularan</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Therafter</span> they left the place and followed the
road.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As they were on their way, they
flagged down a jeep and discovered that it <span class="SpellE">ws</span> the
jeep of their employer Espinosa who was then with P.C. soldier by the name of
Ramon Bautista who arrested the three of them and thereafter brought them to
the ACTS Center or check-point of <span class="SpellE">Tugbungan</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereat, the ACTS members at the check-point
hit them with the butts of their rifles.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Later, Ramon Bautista and some members of the ACTS brought the three of
them to the Police Station where a policeman upon learning that he (<span class="SpellE">Garufil</span>) killed a person, hit him on his back with a
chain.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His statement was then taken down
by a policeman without the assistance of counsel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After he signed his written statement, all of
them were brought to the City Jail.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(TSN pp. 1 to 11, July 11, 1985)."</span> <span class="GramE">(Appellant's

<p class="BODY">The appellant has only one assignment of error, namely -</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue before the trial court and now <span class="GramE">raised</span>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">to us </span>is one of
credibility.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All of the arguments raised
by the appellant in two pages of his rather sketchy brief are based on his
version of the facts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They merely
discuss the elements of self-defense.</p>

<p class="BODY">The conclusions of the trial court, on the other <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">hand, </span>are based on its finding that
the prosecution witnes­ses were telling the truth and that the self-defense

<p class="BODY">When a factual issue on appeal hinges on the relative credibility

the records of the case or from the arguments raised on appeal why we should
depart from the established rule.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We
affirm the judgment of conviction.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records sustain the findings of the lower court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The two victims were asleep when they were
treacherously stabbed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There could have
been no unlawful aggression on their part.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the Solicitor General's<a style="mso-footnote-id:

assessment of the evidence:</p>

<blockquote>"Appellant's claim of self-defense, however, welters in
contradictions and un­believable circumstances which expectedly, implode upon
that claim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appellant insists that the
two victims simultaneously attacked him and mauled him, <span class="SpellE">Desanta</span>
with repeated fist blows while holding him by the hair and <span class="SpellE">Badian</span>
with the use of <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a meter </span>long
2" x 2" piece of wood.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under
the claimed sufferance, appellant would have been inflicted with certain
wounds, bruises, contusions or other physical injuries.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Surprisingly, <u>no</u> <u>one</u>, not the
police officer who investigated him about five hours after the commission of
the crime, nor even his own defense witnesses, his co-accused (<span class="SpellE">Sitol</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tek</span>) who were with him
immediately after the criminal incident transpired, testified on the battered
condition, if any, of his face and/or body or that he, indeed, was mauled.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even less, no medical report or certificate
to that effect was ever presented in evidence by appellant to shore up his
claim of such brutal mauling.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Again it is incredible to conceive that appellant so easily
succeeded in stabbing <span class="SpellE">Desanta</span> without <span class="SpellE">Badian</span> giving him a good fight if only for survival.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The ease with which appellant dealt his fatal
stabs on the chest of <span class="SpellE">Desanta</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">and stomach of <span class="SpellE">Badian</span> can more easily be
explained by the testimony of the latter that they were sleeping when pounced

elicit credence because that time of the night in <span class="SpellE">Tugbungan</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> City, would be relatively silent and any
