<p class="BODY">Congressman <span class="SpellE">Ablan</span>, KBL, was retained as
the 12th member representing the House minority.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 1, 1989, Congresswoman <span class="SpellE">Coseteng</span>
and her party, the KAIBA, filed this Petition for Extraordinary Legal Writs
(which may be considered as a petition for quo <span class="SpellE">warranto</span>
and injunction) praying this Court to declare as null and void the election of

as members of the Commission on Appointments, to enjoin them from acting as

nomination and election of respondent <span class="SpellE">Verano</span>-Yap by
the respondents as representative of the minority was clearly invalid (p. 31, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>); and</p>

<p class="BODY">4)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that similarly invalid
was the retention of respondent <span class="SpellE">Ablan</span> as Minority
member in the Commission because he was neither nominated nor elected as such
by the minority party or parties in the House (p. 31, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Coseteng</span> further alleged
that she is qualified to sit in the Commission on Appointments as a
representative of the Minority because she has the support of nine (9) other
congressmen and congresswomen of the Minority (p. 31, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">In their collective Comment, the respondents House of
Representatives, the Speaker, the Majority Floor Leader, the members of the
Commission on Appointments including Congressman <span class="SpellE">Roque</span>
R. <span class="SpellE">Ablan</span>, but excluding Congresswoman Lorna <span class="SpellE">Verano</span>-Yap (who filed a separate Comment), alleged:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">(1) </span>that
the legality of the reorganization of the Commission on Appointments is a
political question, hence, outside the jurisdiction of this Court to decide,
and, (2) that in any case, the reorganization was "strictly in consonance
with Section 18, Article VI of the 1987 Constitution" i.e., on the basis
of proportional representation of the political parties, considering the
majority coalition "as <span style="">a </span>form
of a political party" (pp. 115, 118, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They further alleged that as of <st1:date year="1989" day="3" month="3">March 3, 1989</st1:date>, 160 members of the
House (including 26 former Liberals) had expressly renounced in writing their
respective political party affiliations and formally affiliated with the LDP
leaving only 15 Liberals in the House (p. 119, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After its petition for registration as a
political party was granted on <st1:date year="1989" day="28" month="8">August
 28, 1989</st1:date> by the First Division of the COMELEC and affirmed on <st1:date year="1989" day="23" month="11">November 23, 1989</st1:date> by the COMELEC <u>en</u>
<u>banc</u>, the LDP become the new Majority in the House.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They finally argued that as KAIBA is part of
the Coalesced Majority which supports the administration of President Corazon
C. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, not of the minority, petitioner is bound
by the choice of the Coalesced Majority of the members who would sit in the
Commission on Appointments.</p>

<p class="BODY">Representative Lorna <span class="SpellE">Verano</span>-Yap, in her
comment alleged that the petitioner has no better right than those already
selected, to be chosen as a member of the Commission on Appointments because:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the Constitution was not violated in
electing Yap and eleven <span style="">(11) other
House members to the Commission on </span>Appointments; (2) respondent Yap is a
rightful incumbent; and (3) petitioner's claim to a seat on the Commission on
Appointments is without legal and factual basis <span style="">(pp. </span>217-218, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">The Commission on Appointments took a neutral stand on the
petition as the issues involved may touch on the validity of its organization
and the legality of the entitlement of the LDP or the LP to representation,
which are raised in the case of <span class="SpellE">Daza</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Singson</span>, G.R. No. 86344, then pending before this Court
(pp. 195-198, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue here is whether the members of the House in the
Commission on Appointments were chosen on the basis of <span style="">proportional representation </span>from the political <span style="">parties therein as provided in Section 18,
Article VI of the 1987 Constitution which reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Sec. 18.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>There shall be a Commission on Appointments
consisting of the President of the Senate, as ex <span class="SpellE">oficio</span>
Chairman, twelve Senators, and twelve Members of the House of Representatives <u>elected</u>
<u>by</u> <u>each</u> <u>House</u> on the basis of <u>proportional</u>
representation from the political parties and parties or organizations
registered under the party-list system represented therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The chairman of the Commission shall not
vote, except in case of a tie.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Commission shall act on all appointments submitted to it within thirty session
days of the Congress from their submission.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Commission shall rule by a majority vote of all the Members.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Art. VI, 1987 Constitution.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After deliberating on the petition and the comments of the
respondents, we hold that the petition should be dismissed, not because it
raises a political question, which it does not, but because the revision of <span style="">the House representation in the Commission on
Appointments is based on proportional representation of the political parties
therein as provided in Section 18, Article VI of the 1987 Constitution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The "political question" issue was settled in <span class="SpellE">Daza</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Singson</span>, G.R. No. 86344,
December 21, 1989, where this Court ruled that "the legality, and not the
wisdom, of the manner of filling the Commission on Appointments as prescribed
by the Constitution" is <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span>, and,
"even if the question were political in nature, it would still come within
our powers of review under the expanded jurisdiction conferred upon us by
Article VIII, Section 1, of the Constitution, which includes the authority to
determine whether grave abuse of discretion amounting to excess or lack of
jurisdiction has been committed by any branch or instrumentality of the
government."</p>

<p class="BODY">The composition of the House membership in the Commission on
Appointments was based on proportional representation of the political parties
in the House.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are 160 members of
the LDP in the House.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They represent 79%
of the House membership (which may be rounded out to 80%).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Eighty percent (80%) of 12 members in the
Commission on Appointments would equal 9.6 members, which may be rounded out to
ten (10) members from the LDP.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
remaining two seats were apportioned to the LP (respondent Lorna <span class="SpellE">Verano</span>-Yap) as the next largest party in the Coalesced
Majority and the KBL (respondent <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> <span class="SpellE">Ablan</span>) as the principal <span style="">opposition </span>party in the House.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is no doubt that this apportionment of the House membership in the
Commission on Appointments was done "on the basis of proportional
representation of the political parties therein."</p>

<p class="BODY">The other political parties or groups in the House, such <span style="">as </span>petitioner's KAIBA (which is
presumably a member also of the Coalesced Majority), are bound by the
majority's choices.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even if KAIBA were
to be considered as an opposition party, its lone member (petitioner <span class="SpellE">Coseteng</span>) represents only .4% or less than 1% of the House
membership, hence, she is not entitled to one of the 12 House seats in the
Commission on Appointments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be able
to claim proportional membership in the Commission on Appointments, a political
party should represent at least <span style="">8.4% </span>of
the House membership, i.e., it should have been able to <span style="">elect at least 17 congressmen or congresswomen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">indorsements</span> of the nine (9)
congressmen and congresswomen in favor of the petitioner's election to the
Commission are inconsequential because they are not members of her party and
they signed identical <span class="SpellE">indorsements</span> in favor of her
rival, respondent Congresswoman <span class="SpellE">Verano</span>-Yap.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no merit in the petitioner's contention that the House
members in the Commission on Appointments should have been nominated and
elected by their respective political parties.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The petition itself shows that they were nominated by their respective
floor leaders in the House.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were <u><span style="">elected</span></u><span style=""> </span>by the House (not by their party) as provided in Section 18,
Article VI of the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
validity of their election to the Commission on Appointments - eleven (11) from
the Coalesced Majority and one from the minority – is unassailable.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE,</span></b><span style=""> the petition is dismissed for lack of
merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against
