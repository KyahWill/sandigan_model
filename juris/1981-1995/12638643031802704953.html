				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Resolution No. 87-554 of the Civil Service Commission, dated 28
December 1987, revoking the promotional appointment of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> Y. SANTIAGO, Jr., from Collector of Customs I to
Collector of Customs III and directing instead the appointment of private
respondent, Leonardo A. JOSE, to the same position, is sought to be reviewed
and reversed herein.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="18" month="11">18 November 1986</st1:date>,
then Customs Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Wigberto</span> E. <span class="SpellE">Tanada</span> extended a permanent promotional appointment, as
Customs Collector III, to petitioner <st1:city><st1:place>SANTIAGO</st1:place></st1:city>,
Jr.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That appointment was approved by the
Civil Service Commission (CSC), National Capital Region Office.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Prior thereto, <st1:city><st1:place>SANTIAGO</st1:place></st1:city>
held the position of Customs Collector I.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="26" month="11">26 November 1986</st1:date>,
respondent JOSE, a Customs Collector II, filed a protest with the Merit Systems
Promotion Board (the Board, for short) against <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">SANTIAGO</span></st1:place></st1:city><span class="SpellE">'s</span>
promotional appointment mainly on the ground that he was next-in-rank to the
position of Collector of Customs III.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to Section 19(6) of Presidential Decree No. 807 (the
Civil Service Decree), the Board referred the protest to Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Tanada</span> for appropriate action.</p>

<p class="BODY">In reply, said official upheld <span class="SpellE">SANTIAGO's</span>
promotional appointment on the grounds, among others, that:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) the next-in-rank rule is no longer
mandatory; (2) the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> is competent and
qualified for the position and such fact was not questioned by the protestant;
and (3) existing law and jurisprudence give wide latitude of discretion to the
appointing authority provided there is no clear showing of grave abuse of
discretion or fraud.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="29" month="12">29 December 1986</st1:date>,
respondent JOSE appealed to the Board (MSB Case No. 1410), which, on <st1:date year="1987" day="17" month="3">17 March 1987</st1:date>, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">decided to revoke petitioner </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">SANTIAGO</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">'s</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> appointment and directed that respondent

respondent Commission affirmed the Board Resolutions in its own Resolution No.
87-554.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Commission ruled that

Customs Collector III, respondent JOSE has far better qualifications in terms
of educational attainment, civil service eligibilities, relevant seminars and
training courses taken, and holding as he does by permanent appointment a
position which is higher in rank and salary range.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It added that the Commission is empowered to
administer and enforce the merit system as mandated by the 1973 and 1987
Constitutions and to approve all appointments, whether original or promotional,
to positions in the civil service, subject to specified exceptions, pursuant to
paragraphs (a) and (h), Section 9 of the Civil Service Law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Second Division issued a Temporary Restraining Order enjoining respondents from

him a period of thirty (30) days within which to locate respondent <span class="SpellE">JOSE's</span> present address.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>After having been located and furnished this Court's previous
Resolutions, JOSE manifested his intent to adopt <u>in <span class="SpellE">toto</span></u>
the Comment filed by the Solicitor General for respondent CSC.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1989" day="4" month="10"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">4 </span>October 1989</st1:date>, pursuant
to an adopted policy, the Second Division referred the case to the Court <u>en</u>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">We </span>grant
reconsideration of our Order of dismissal and reinstate the Petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">After considering the pleadings filed, the constitutional and
statutory provisions invoked, the jurisprudence cited and legal arguments
adduced, we are constrained to reverse.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">We </span>need only recall
our previous ruling in <span class="SpellE">Taduran</span> vs. Civil Service
Commission (L-52051, 31 July 1984, 131 SCRA 66) stating that there is "no
mandatory nor peremptory requirement in the (Civil Service Law) that <span class="GramE">persons</span> next-in-rank are entitled to preference in
appointment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What it does provide is
that they would be among the first to be considered for the vacancy, if
qualified, and if the vacancy is not filled by promotion, the same shall be
filled by transfer or other modes of appointment."</p>

<p class="BODY">One who is next-in-rank is entitled to preferential consideration
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">for </span>promotion to the higher
vacancy but it does not necessarily follow that he and no one else can be
appointed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The rule neither <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">grants a </span>vested right to the holder
nor imposes a ministerial duty on the appointing authority to promote such
person to the next higher position.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As
provided for in Section 4, CSC Resolution No. 83-343:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Section 4.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>An employee who holds a next-in-rank position
<span class="GramE">who</span> is deemed the most competent and qualified,
possesses an appropriate civil service eligibility, and meets the other
conditions for promotion shall be promoted to the higher position when it
becomes vacant.</blockquote>

<blockquote>However, the appointing authority may promote an employee who is
not next-in-rank but who possesses superior qualifications and competence
compared to a next-in-rank employee who merely meets the minimum requirements
for the position."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The former Customs Commissioner had explained the reasons behind
petitioner's appointment in his reply to the Merit Systems Board, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Suffice it to state that both Jose and the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> are customs collectors.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1984" day="31" month="1">31
 January 1984</st1:date>, Jose was assigned to <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Norte, but he never assumed that
position.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For the past five years, there
is no official record of any activity that recommends him for promotion.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On the other hand, after the February revolution, the <span class="SpellE">Protestee</span> was immediately designated by the undersigned as
Chief of a task force which has been credited with the seizure of millions of
pesos worth <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span>smuggled
shipments.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Each one was duly recorded,
not only in the official files, but also in the media.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"For the services, the undersigned saw fit, not only to
promote the <span class="SpellE">Protestee</span> but also to designate him as my
special assistant.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It may likewise be mentioned that <span class="SpellE">Protestee</span>
has been the recipient of citations awarded by the Customs Commissioner for the
two consecutive years 1984 and 1985, for exemplary performance of official
duties, particularly investigation and prosecution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>More specifically, the latest citation
commends the <span class="SpellE">Protestee</span> for his pivotal role in the
seizure and forfeiture of an ocean-going vessel upheld by the Supreme Court,
which constituted a first in the history of this Bureau."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The power to appoint is a matter of discretion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The appointing power has <span class="GramE">a
wide</span> latitude of choice as to who is best qualified for the position (<span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Subido</span>, L-28344,
August 27, 1976, 72 SCRA 443).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To apply
the next-in-rank rule peremptorily would impose a rigid formula on the
appointing power contrary to the policy of the law that among those qualified
and eligible, the appointing authority is granted discretion and prerogative of
choice of the one he deems fit for appointment (Pineda vs. Claudio, L-29661,
May 13, 1969, 28 SCRA 34).<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The case of <span class="SpellE">Meram</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Edralin</span> (L-71228, September 24, 1987, 154 SCRA 238) is
inapplicable to the factual situation herein.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In said case, we affirmed the appointment of the next-in-rank because the
original appointee's appointment was made in consideration of political,
ethnic, religious or blood ties totally against the very purpose behind the
establishment of professionalism in the civil service.</p>

<p class="BODY">True, the Commission is empowered to approve all appointments,
whether original or promotional, to positions in the civil service and
disapprove those where the appointees do not possess the appropriate
eligibility or required qualification (paragraph (h), Section 9, P.D. No. 807).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, consistent with our ruling in <span class="SpellE">Luego</span> vs. CSC (L-69137, 5 August 1986, 143 SCRA 327),
"all the commission is actually allowed to do is check whether or not the
appointee possesses the appropriate civil service eligibility or the required
qualifications.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If he does, his appointment
is approved; if not, it is disapproved.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>No other criterion is permitted by law to be employed by the Commission
when it acts on, or as the decree says, "approves" or
"disapproves" an appointment made by the proper authorities.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">x</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>To be sure, it has no authority to revoke the said
appointment simply because it believed that the private respondent was better
qualified for that would have constituted an encroachment on the discretion
vested solely (in the appointing authority)."<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">All told, we fail to see any reason to disturb <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">SANTIAGO</span></st1:place></st1:city><span class="SpellE">'s</span>
promotional appointment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The minimum
qualifications and the standard of merit and fitness have been adequately
satisfied as found by the appointing authority.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The latter has not been convincingly shown to have committed any grave
abuse of discretion.</p>

<p class="BODY">Having arrived at the foregoing conclusion, we find no necessity
to delve into the other issues raised.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>,<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>Resolution
No. 87-554 of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">Civil </span>Service
