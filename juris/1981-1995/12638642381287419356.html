				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">A sworn complaint was filed on August 1, 1988 by Lourdes <span class="SpellE">Padolina</span> in the Regional Trial Court, Branch LXI, Angeles
City, charging Deputy Sheriff Ruben L. Henson of the Municipal Trial Court in
Cities, Branch 2, Angeles City, with malfeasance in the conduct of the auction

debt of P2,538, plus legal interest, in favor of the Advent Educational System,
Inc., plaintiff in a collection suit (Civil Ca<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

appropriate action.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts of this case, as recited in a memorandum prepared by

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="25" month="5">May 25, 1988</st1:date>,
the Municipal Trial Court in Cities, Branch 2, <st1:place><st1:placename>Angeles</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, issued <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>Writ of Execution for the
satisfaction of a judgment for P2<span class="GramE">,538</span> rendered by it
against defendant Lourdes <span class="SpellE">Padolina</span> in Civil<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span>Case No. 87-140, entitled,
"Advent Educational System, Inc. vs. Lourdes <span class="SpellE">Padolina</span>."
Respondent Deputy Sheriff implemented the writ on <st1:date year="1988" day="9" month="6">June 9, 1988</st1:date> by seizing the following personal properties
of complainant:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>One (1) unit Sony colored T.V. Model KV-1546R, 15 inches, valued at P10<span class="GramE">,000</span>;</blockquote>

</span>One (1) unit Teac Stereo valued at P5<span class="GramE">,000</span>;</blockquote>

</span>One (1) unit Casio Electronic Organ valued at P10<span class="GramE">,000</span>.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="10" month="6">June 10, 1988</st1:date>,
a Notice of sheriff's <st1:city><st1:place>Sale</st1:place></st1:city> was
posted by the respondent in three (3) unspecified conspicuous places announcing
that the sale would take place <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">at </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="14">2:00 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">P.M.</span></st1:time><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span>on <st1:date year="1988" day="20" month="6"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">June 20, 1988</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> in his office in the Municipal Trial Court,

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In his Comment,
respondent sheriff admitted that three (3) days before the scheduled sale, the
complainant paid P2<span class="GramE">,300</span> through the Clerk of Court in
partial satisfaction of the judgment against her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to the complainant, she and the
respondent had an understanding (which respondent denied), that the sale would
not proceed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In spite of it, respondent
Henson conducted the auction sale on June 20, 1988, as scheduled, and sold for
P3,000 to a certain <span class="SpellE">Edgardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Balingit</span>,
as the lone bidder, the two (2) most </span>expensive <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">appliances which he had seized from the complainant, namely:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(a) the colored Sony TV set worth P10,000,
and (b) the Casio Electronic Organ also valued at P10,000, or P20,000 worth of
appliances, to satisfy the balance of P238 plus interest on the judgment
debt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent alleged that the levied
properties were defective and not worth more than the </span>judgment debt.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">After carefully
considering the complaint and the comment thereon, We are persuaded that
respondent sheriff committed serious misconduct in proceeding with the auction
sale, and in selling the complainant's TV set and the electronic organ for a
pittance (only P3<span class="GramE">,000</span>) when their declared value was
P20,000.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His misfeasance becomes more
glaring when we consider the fact that the unpaid balance of the judgment was
only </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">P238</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">plus
legal interest, because </span>with Henson's knowledge, the complainant had
already <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">deposited P2<span class="GramE">,300</span>
with the Clerk </span>of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Court, three
days before the auction sale.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
deposit was properly made with the Clerk of Court who was the <u>ex</u> </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">oficio</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">sheriff
and Hensonâ€™s </span>immediate superior.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Section 11 of Rule 39 of the Rules of Court provides that the writ of
execution shall be returnable either to the <u>clerk</u>, or judge, of the
court issuing it.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Respondent's allegation,
that he proceeded with the sale because the complainant's P2<span class="GramE">,300</span>-deposit
was insufficient to satisfy the judgment, has no merit, for he agreed with the
complainant that the sale would not go</span> on.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">We
believe that if he did not agree to suspend the sale, the complainant would
have attended it to pay the small balance of P238 plus legal interest she still
owed on the judgment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">We can </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">perceive no other reason for her paying </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">substantial portion of
the judgment three days before the auction, than her desire to stop the sale of
her valuable appliances.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In any event, the meager
balance of her debt could have been satisfied by the sale of any of the two
cheaper items in the list of levied appliances.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>But respondent picked not only one, but two, and not the cheaper, but
the more expensive, appliances in the list.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Obviously, he either wanted to favor the supposed "lone
bidder" or he may have coveted the complainant's expensive Sony TV set and
Casio electronic organ, and used <span class="SpellE">Balingit</span> so he could
acquire </span>them himself for a song.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Contrary to respondent's allegation, the Sony colored TV set was not
described as "defective" in his list of levied properties, and,
although the Casio electronic organ was supposedly "defective," there
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">is </span>no suggestion in the
respondent's Comment that it was <span class="SpellE">inoperational</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Section 15, Rule 39 of
the Rules of Court provides that "when there is more property of the
judgment debtor than is sufficient to satisfy the judgment and accruing costs, </span>within
the view of the officer, he must levy only on such part of the property as is
amply sufficient to satisfy the judgment and costs." In this case,
respondent Deputy Sheriff not only made an excessive levy but also sold
property of the judgment debtor in excess of the amount needed to satisfy the
almost insignificant balance of her judgment debt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We see bad faith and evident intent to
defraud the judgment debtor in respondent's implementation of the writ of
execution against the complainant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We,
therefore, find him guilty of serious misconduct in the discharge of his office
(R.M. Salazar, Jr. Construction, Inc. vs. <span class="SpellE">Espinelli</span>,
110 SCRA 32).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">In <span class="SpellE">Policarpio</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Fajardo</span>, Adm.
Matter No.</span> P-312, 78 SCRA 210, a sheriff who made an excessive levy was
found guilty of gross misconduct and dismissed from the service by this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">,</span>
respondent Deputy Sheriff Ruben L. Henson is found guilty of grave misconduct
in the discharge of his office and is hereby dismissed from the service with
forfeiture of retirement benefits, except the value of his accrued leaves, and
with prejudice to future reinstatement in the Government service.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Let a copy of this decision be furnished the
Ombudsman for appropriate action.</p>
