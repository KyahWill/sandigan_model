Dorado, denied their request for lack of basis.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>On August 7, 2006, petitioners filed a Petition for <i>Certiorari </i>and Mandamus<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> against PCSD and PLMDC with the RTC of Palawan and Puerto Princesa City.&nbsp; They prayed for the nullification of the said SEP Clearance for violating various provisions of RA 7611<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> and PCSD Resolution No. 05-250.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>&nbsp; They alleged that these provisions prohibit small-scale nickel mining for profit in the proposed site,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> which, they maintain, is not even a controlled use zone, but actually a core zone.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>PLMDC<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> and PCSD sought the dismissal of the Petition on various grounds, including the impropriety of the remedy of <i>certiorari.</i>&nbsp; PCSD argued that it did not perform a quasi-judicial function.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>The trial court denied the said motions in its Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> dated September 20, 2006.&nbsp; It ruled, among others, that <i>certiorari</i> is proper to assail PCSD’s action. PCSD Administrative Order (AO) No. 6 series of 2000 or the Guidelines in the Implementation of SEP Clearance System states that the PCSD must conduct a public hearing, and study the supporting documents for sufficiency and accuracy, before it decides whether to issue the clearance to the project proponent.&nbsp; The trial court concluded that this procedure is an exercise of a quasi-judicial power.<br><br>The trial court denied<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> reconsideration of the above Order.<br><br>PLMDC and PCSD again filed Motions to Dismiss but this time on the ground of lack of jurisdiction.&nbsp; They argued that, under Section 4 of Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, only the Court of Appeals [CA] can take cognizance of a Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> and Mandamus filed against a quasi-judicial body.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>The trial court agreed and issued the assailed Order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Petitioners appealed directly to this Court.<br><br>In their respective memoranda, all the parties submitted that PCSD is exercising quasi-judicial functions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>&nbsp; They only diverge on the issue of which court – the CA or the RTC – has the jurisdiction to review the actions of this quasi-judicial body.<br><br>Petitioners argue that the RTC has certiorari jurisdiction over PCSD because the latter is a quasi-judicial body functioning only within the RTC’s territorial jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>&nbsp; Moreover, the RTC is the proper court following the principle of judicial hierarchy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, respondents argue that, under Section 4 of Rule 65, only the CA can take cognizance of <i>certiorari </i>petitions against quasi-judicial bodies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b></center><br>The following requisites must concur for a Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> to prosper, namely:<br><br>“(a)&nbsp; The writ is directed against a tribunal, board, or officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions;<br><br>(b) Such tribunal, board, or officer has acted without or in excess of jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction; and<br><br>(c)&nbsp; There is no appeal or any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, the parties submit that the public respondent PCSD is exercising a quasi-judicial function in its issuance of the SEP clearance based on the procedure it follows under its own AO 6 or Guidelines in the Implementation of SEP Clearance System.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>&nbsp; This procedure includes reviewing the sufficiency and accuracy of the documents submitted by the project proponent and conducting public hearings or consultations with the affected community.<br><br>The Court disagrees with the parties’ reasoning and holds that PCSD did not perform a quasi-judicial function that is reviewable by petition for <i>certiorari.</i><br><br>There must be an enabling statute or legislative act conferring quasi-judicial power upon the administrative body.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> RA 7611, which created the PCSD, does not confer quasi-judicial powers on the said body:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 19. <b><i> Powers and Functions.</i></b> – In order to successfully implement the provisions of this Act, the Council is hereby vested with the following powers and functions:<br><br>(1)&nbsp; Formulate plans and policies as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act.<br><br>(2)&nbsp; Coordinate with the local governments to ensure that the latter’s plans, programs and projects are aligned with the plans, programs and policies of the SEP.<br><br>(3) Call on any department, bureau, office, agency or instrumentality of the Government, and on private entities and organizations for cooperation and assistance in the performance of its functions.<br><br>(4)&nbsp; Arrange, negotiate for, accept donations, grants, gifts, loans, and other fundings from domestic and foreign sources to carry out the activities and purposes of the SEP.<br><br>(5)&nbsp; Recommend to the Congress of the Philippines such matters that may require legislation in support of the objectives of the SEP.<br><br>(6)&nbsp; Delegate any or all of its powers and functions to its support staff, as hereinafter provided, except those which by provisions of law cannot be delegated;<br><br>(7)&nbsp; Establish policies and guidelines for employment on the basis of merit, technical competence and moral character and prescribe a compensation and staffing pattern;<br><br>(8) Adopt, amend and rescind such rules and regulations and impose penalties therefor for the effective implementation of the SEP and the other provisions of this Act.<br><br>(9)&nbsp; Enforce the provisions of this Act and other existing laws, rules and regulations similar to or complementary with this Act;<br><br>(10) Perform related functions which shall promote the development, conservation, management, protection, and utilization of the natural resources of Palawan; and<br><br>(11)&nbsp; Perform such other powers and functions as may be necessary in carrying out its functions, powers, and the provisions of this Act.</blockquote>Save possibly for the power to impose penalties<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> under Section 19(8) (which is not involved in PCSD’s issuance of an SEP Clearance), the rest of the conferred powers, and the powers necessarily implied from them, do not include adjudication or a quasi-judicial function.<br><br>Instead of reviewing the powers granted by law to PCSD, the trial court found the following procedure outlined in PCSD’s AO 6, as supposedly descriptive of an adjudicatory process:<br><br><blockquote>1. The project proponent submits a brief description of the processes it seeks to undertake and the location and description of the proposed project site.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>2. The PCSD staff reviews the sufficiency and accuracy of these documents, and conducts a field validation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>3. The PCSD staff may conduct public consultations or public hearings to determine the acceptability of the project in the community.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>4. The evaluation of the project shall be based on the ECAN Zoning of Palawan, ecological sustainability, social acceptability, and economic viability of the project.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>5. The staff makes an evaluation report, stating therein his recommended action, for the consideration of the PCSD.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>6. The PCSD may issue or deny the SEP clearance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>7. In case of approval, the SEP clearance, together with the evaluation reports, shall be transmitted to the DENR as bases for the latter’s subsequent processing of the required permits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>8. In case of denial, the project proponent may seek reconsideration.&nbsp; PCSD’s action on the reconsideration is considered final and executory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>9. The DENR will undertake an independent evaluation of the project and shall not in any way be prejudiced by the PCSD’s actions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></blockquote><br>The Court disagrees.<br><br>First, PCSD AO 6, cited by the trial court and the parties, cannot confer a quasi-judicial power on PCSD that its enabling statute clearly withheld.&nbsp; An agency’s power to formulate rules for the proper discharge of its functions is always circumscribed by the enabling statute.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>&nbsp; Otherwise, any agency conferred with rule-making power, may circumvent legislative intent by creating new powers for itself through an administrative order.<br><br>More importantly, the procedure outlined in PCSD AO 6 does not involve adjudication.&nbsp; A government agency performs adjudicatory functions when it renders decisions or awards that determine the rights of adversarial parties, which decisions or awards have the same effect as a judgment of the court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>&nbsp; These decisions are binding, such that when they attain finality, they have the effect of <i>res judicata</i> that even the courts of justice have to respect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>&nbsp; As we have held in one case,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> “[j]udicial or quasi-judicial function involves the determination of what the law is, and what the legal rights of the contending parties are, with respect to the matter in controversy and, on the basis thereof and the facts obtaining, the adjudication of their respective rights. In other words, the tribunal, board or officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial function must be clothed with power and authority to pass judgment or render a decision on the controversy construing and applying the laws to that end.”<br><br>In issuing an SEP Clearance, the PCSD does not decide the rights and obligations of adverse parties with finality.&nbsp; The SEP Clearance is not even a license or permit.&nbsp; All it does is to allow the project proponent to proceed with its application for permits, licenses, patents, grants, or concessions with the relevant government agencies.&nbsp; The SEP Clearance allows the project proponent to prove the viability of their project, their capacity to prevent environmental damage, and other legal requirements, to the other concerned government agencies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>&nbsp; The SEP Clearance in favor of PLMDC does not declare that the project proponent has an enforceable mining right within the Municipality of Narra; neither does it adjudicate that the concerned citizens of the said municipality have an obligation to respect PLMDC’s right to mining.&nbsp; In fact, as seen in Section 5 of AO 6, the PCSD bases its actions, not on the legal rights and obligations of the parties (which is necessary in adjudication), but on policy considerations, such as social acceptability, ecological sustainability, and economic viability of the project.<br><br>Further, PCSD’s receipt of documents and ascertainment of their sufficiency and accuracy are not indicative of a judicial function.&nbsp; It is, at most, an investigatory function to determine the truth behind the claims of the project proponent.&nbsp; This Court has held that the power to investigate is not the same as adjudication,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> so long as there is no final determination of the parties’ respective rights and obligations.<br><br>Lastly, the fact that the PCSD conducts public consultations or hearings does not mean that it is performing quasi-judicial functions.&nbsp; AO 6 defines public hearing/public consultation simply as an “activity undertaken by PCSD to gather facts and thresh out all issues, concerns and apprehensions and at the same time provide the project proponent with the opportunity to present the project to the affected community.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>&nbsp; Its purpose is not to adjudicate the rights of contending parties but only to “ascertain the acceptability of the project in the community and to ensure that the interests of all stakeholders are considered,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> pursuant to RA 7611’s policy of “encourag[ing] the involvement of all sectors of society and maximiz[ing] people participation x x x in natural resource management, conservation and protection.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup>&nbsp; On the other hand, the purpose of hearings in judicial bodies is to ascertain the truth of the parties’ claims through an adversarial process.&nbsp; Clearly, the purpose of PCSD’s public consultations is not for adversaries to pit their claims against each other.&nbsp; Since the PCSD’s actions cannot be considered quasi-judicial, the same cannot be reviewed via a special civil action for <i>certiorari</i>.&nbsp; Where an administrative body or officer does not exercise judicial or quasi-judicial power, <i>certiorari </i>does not lie.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>A review of the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> reveals another flaw.&nbsp; The alleged grounds for the nullity of the SEP Clearance are its violations of certain provisions of RA 7611 and PCSD Resolution No. 05-250.&nbsp; Clearly, an ordinary action for the nullification of the SEP Clearance is a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy available to the petitioners, which precludes resort to a special civil action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup>&nbsp; This ordinary action will allow the parties to litigate factual issues, such as petitioners’ contention that PLMDC’s proposed mining site is in a core zone, it being in a natural forest and a critical watershed, contrary to PCSD’s claim that it is in a controlled use zone.&nbsp; <i>Certiorari</i> would not have provided the petitioners with such an opportunity because it is limited to questions of jurisdiction and does not resolve factual matters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> <i> Certiorari </i>does not involve a full-blown trial but is generally restricted to the filing of pleadings (petition, comment, reply, and memoranda), unless the court opts to hear the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup>&nbsp; Since an ordinary action is available and in fact appears to be more appropriate, petitioners were wrong to resort to the extraordinary remedy of <i>certiorari.</i><br><br>The same fate befalls the Petition for Mandamus.&nbsp; Petitioners prayed that the PCSD be compelled to comply with the provisions of RA 7611.&nbsp; Clearly, the success of the Petition for Mandamus depends on a prior finding that the PCSD violated RA 7611 in issuing the SEP Clearance.&nbsp; There can be no such finding with the dismissal of the Petition for<i> Certiorari.</i><br><br>Given the foregoing, it is no longer necessary to resolve the jurisdictional issue presented by the parties.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the assailed May 7, 2007 Order of Branch 47 of the Regional Trial Court of Palawan and Puerto Princesa City dismissing the Petition for <i>Certiorari </i>and Mandamus, docketed as Civil Case No. 4218, is <b>AFFIRMED</b> but for being an <b>IMPROPER REMEDY.<br></b><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Carpio, (Chairperson), Perez, Mendoza</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup> and<span style="font-style: italic;"> Perlas-Bernabe, JJ</span>., concur.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup> Per Special Order No. 1421 dated February 20, 2013.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><i> Chamber of Real Estate and Builders’ Associations, Inc.
