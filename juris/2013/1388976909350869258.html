The CTA in Division also directed the respondent to file a supplemental answer within ten days from notice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>When no supplemental answer was filed within the period thus allowed, the CTA in Division treated the answer filed on May 16, 2003 as the Commissioner’s answer to the Amended Petition for Review.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Thereafter, the petitioner presented testimonial and documentary evidence to support its claim.

Likewise, petitioner did not submit any VAT official receipt of payments for services rendered to NPC. The only proof submitted by petitioner is a letter from Regional Director Rene Q. Aguas, Revenue Region No. 1, stating that the financial statements and annual income tax return constitute sufficient secondary proof of effectively zero-rated and that based on their examination and evaluation of the financial statements and annual income tax return of petitioner for taxable year 2000, it had annual gross receipts of PhP187,992,524.00. This Court cannot give credence to the said letter as it refers to taxable year 2000, while the instant case refers to taxable year 2001.<br><br>Without zero-rated sales for the four quarters of 2001, the input VAT payments of PhP9,795,427.88 (including the present claim of PhP2,920,665.16) allegedly attributable thereto cannot be refunded.

Aguas that the statements and the return are considered sufficient to establish that it generated zero-rated sale of electricity is bereft of merit. As found by the Court <i>a quo</i>, the letter opinion refers to taxable year 2000, while the instant case covers taxable year 2001; hence, cannot be given credence. Even assuming for the sake of argument that the financial statements, the return and the letter opinion relates to 2001, the same could not be taken plainly as it is because there is still a need to produce the supporting documents proving the existence of such zero-rated sales, which is wanting in this case.<br><br>Considering that there are no zero-rated sales to speak of for taxable year 2001, petitioner is, therefore, not entitled to a refund of PhP2,920,665.16 input tax allegedly attributable thereto since it is basic requirement under Section 112 (A) of the NIRC that there should exists a zero-rated sales in order to be entitled to a refund of unutilized input tax.<br><br>It is settled that tax refunds, like tax exemptions, are construed strictly against the taxpayer and that the claimant has the burden of proof to establish the factual basis of its claim for tax credit or refund.

We agree with the CTA<i> En Banc </i>that the petitioner did not produce evidence showing that it had zero-rated sales for the four quarters of taxable year 2001. As the CTA <i>En Banc</i> precisely found, the petitioner did not reflect any zero-rated sales from its power generation in its four quarterly VAT returns, which indicated that it had not made any sale of electricity. Had there been zero-rated sales, it would have reported them in the returns. Indeed, it carried the burden not only that it was entitled under the substantive law to the allowance of its claim for refund or tax credit but also that it met all the requirements for evidentiary substantiation of its claim before the administrative official concerned, or in the <i>de novo</i> litigation before the CTA in Division.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Although the petitioner has correctly contended here that the sale of electricity by a power generation company like it should be subject to zero-rated VAT under Republic Act No. 9136,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> its assertion that it need not prove its having actually made zero-rated sales of electricity by presenting the VAT official receipts and VAT returns cannot be upheld. It ought to be reminded that it could not be permitted to substitute such vital and material documents with secondary evidence like financial statements.<br><br>We further find to be lacking in substance and bereft of merit the petitioner’s insistence that the CTA <i>En Banc</i> should not have disregarded the letter opinion by BIR Regional Director Rene Q. Aguas to the effect that its financial statements and its return were sufficient to establish that it had generated zero-rated sale of electricity. To recall, the CTA <i>En Banc </i>rejected the insistence because, <i>firstly</i>, the letter opinion referred to taxable year 2000 but this case related to taxable year 2001, and, <i>secondly</i>, even assuming for the sake of argument that the financial statements, the return and the letter opinion had related to taxable year 2001, they still could not be taken at face value for the purpose of approving the claim for refund or tax credit due to the need to produce the supporting documents proving the existence of the zero-rated sales, which did not happen here. In that respect, the CTA<i> En Banc </i>properly disregarded the letter opinion as irrelevant to the present claim of the petitioner.<br><br>We further see no reason to grant the prayer of the petitioner for the remand of this case to enable it to present before the CTA newly discovered evidence consisting in VAT official receipts.<br><br>Ordinarily, the concept of newly discovered evidence is applicable to litigations in which a litigant seeks a new trial or the re-opening of the case in the trial court. Seldom is the concept appropriate when the litigation is already on appeal, particularly in this Court. The absence of a specific rule on newly discovered evidence at this late stage of the proceedings is not without reason. The propriety of remanding the case for the purpose of enabling the CTA to receive newly discovered evidence would undo the decision already on appeal and require the examination of the pieces of newly discovered evidence, an act that the Court could not do by virtue of its not being a trier of facts. Verily, the Court has emphasized in <i>Atlas Consolidated Mining and Development Corporation v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> that a judicial claim for tax refund or tax credit brought to the CTA is by no means an original action but an appeal by way of a petition for review of the taxpayer’s unsuccessful administrative claim; hence, the taxpayer has to convince the CTA that the quasi-judicial agency a quo should not have denied the claim, and to do so the taxpayer should prove every minute aspect of its case by presenting, formally offering and submitting its evidence to the CTA, including whatever was required for the successful prosecution of the administrative claim as the means of demonstrating to the CTA that its administrative claim should have been granted in the first place.<br><br>Nonetheless, on the proposition that we may relax the stringent rules of procedure for the sake of rendering justice, we still hold that the concept of newly discovered evidence may not apply herein. In order that newly discovered evidence may be a ground for allowing a new trial, it must be fairly shown that: (<i>a</i>) the evidence is discovered after the trial; (b) such evidence could not have been discovered and produced at the trial even with the exercise of reasonable diligence; (c) such evidence is material, not merely cumulative, corroborative, or impeaching; and (d) such evidence is of such weight that it would probably change the judgment if admitted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>The first two requisites are not attendant. To start with, the proposed evidence was plainly not newly discovered considering the petitioner’s admission that its former Finance and Accounting Manager had misplaced the VAT official receipts. If that was true, the misplaced receipts were forgotten evidence. And, secondly, the receipts, had they truly existed, could have been sooner discovered and easily produced at the trial with the exercise of reasonable diligence. But the petitioner made no convincing demonstration that it had exercised reasonable diligence. The Court cannot accept its tender of such receipts and return now, for, indeed, the non-production of documents as vital and material as such receipts and return were to the success of its claim for refund or tax credit was improbable, as it goes against the sound business practice of safekeeping relevant documents precisely to ensure their future use to support an eventual substantial claim for refund or tax credit.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court <b>DENIES</b> the petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> for its lack of merit; <b>AFFIRMS</b> the decision dated May 5, 2009 of the Court of Tax Appeals <i>En Banc;</i> and <b>ORDERS</b> the petitioner to pay the costs of suit.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Sereno, C.J., Leonardo-De Castro, Bersamin, Villarama, Jr.,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Reyes, JJ.,</span> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>, pp. 84-96; penned by Associate Justice Erlinda P.
