In this complaint, the Ingleses claim that Jose and Josefina never actually consented to any mortgage on their land and that their signatures in the <i>Deed of Real Estate Mortgage</i> were obtained thru Charles’ deception.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> The Ingleses allege that Charles had deceived Jose and Josefina into signing blank documents, one of which eventually becoming the <i>Deed of Real Estate Mortgage</i> and another becoming the <i>Promissory Note</i>, on the pretense that such documents were required in a business venture that they had.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> This complaint was docketed as <b>Civil Case No. Q-98-33277</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> and was raffled to Branch 225.<br><br>On 24 July 1998, Charles registered his Certificate of Sale with the Register of Deeds of Quezon City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>On 15 September 1998, Charles filed an <i>Ex-Parte Petition for Issuance of a Writ of Possession</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> before the Quezon City RTC,35 wherein he asked to immediately be placed in possession of the ten (10) lots foreclosed in his favor <i>in lieu</i> of their current possessors, the Ingleses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> This petition was docketed as <b>LRC Case No. Q-10766 (98)</b> and was raffled to Branch 92.<br><br>On 23 February 1999, Branch 92 of the Quezon City RTC issued an <i>Order</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> directing <b>LRC Case No. Q-10766 (98)</b> to be consolidated with Civil Case No. Q-98-33277<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> under Branch 225. As a consequence of the consolidation, the records of LRC Case No. Q-10766 (98) were transferred to Branch 225.<br><br>On 17 December 1999, on the other hand, the Ingleses filed before the Court of Appeals a petition for <i>Annulment of Final Orders</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> pursuant to Rule 47 of the Rules of Court. In it, the Ingleses sought the nullification of the <i>Orders</i> dated 8 October 1997, 20 November 1997 and 27 July 1998<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> of Executive Judge Estrada, which allowed Charles to extrajudicially foreclose the mortgage on the ten (10) lots as well as to register the resulting Certificate of Sale. The Ingleses argue that Executive Judge Estrada was bereft of any jurisdiction to issue the assailed <i>Orders</i> in light of the provisions in the <i>Deed of Real Estate Mortgage</i>: (a) referring to the mortgaged property as being covered by TCT No. 125<b><u>1</u></b>41 PR-17485 rather than TCT No. 125<b><u>3</u></b>41 PR-17485, and (b) giving to Jose and Josefina, not to Charles, the right to choose whether the mortgage may be extrajudicially foreclosed or not.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> In issuing the assailed <i>Orders</i>, therefore, the Ingleses accuse Executive Judge Estrada of “<i>amending</i>,” “<i>altering</i>,” and “<i>revising</i>” the terms of the <i>Deed of Real Estate Mortgage</i> that could not be done in a mere extrajudicial proceeding.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>&nbsp; This petition was docketed as <b>CA-G.R. SP No. 56292</b>.<br><br><center><u><i>CA-G.R. SP No. 56292: Annulment of Final Orders</i></u></center><br>On 28 December 1999, the Court of Appeals in <b>CA-G.R. SP. No. 56292</b> issued a <i>Resolution</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> dismissing the petition for <i>Annulment of Final Orders</i> on grounds of non-compliance with Section 4, Rule 47<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> and Section 3, Rule 4645 of the Rules of Court. The Ingleses filed a motion for reconsideration.<br><br>On 28 January 2000, the Court of Appeals issued a <i>Resolution</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> denying the motion for reconsideration. In this later <i>Resolution</i>, however, the Court of Appeals used a different, albeit a more fundamental <i>rationale</i> to maintain its dismissal of the petition for <i>Annulment of Final Orders</i>.<br><br>In the later Resolution, the Court of Appeals dismissed the petition for <i>Annulment of Final Orders</i> on the ground of lack of jurisdiction. According to the Court of Appeals, it cannot take original cognizance of the Ingleses’ petition as the same does not qualify either as an action under Rule 47 or, for that matter, as any other case that would fall within its original jurisdiction under Rule 46 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> The Court of Appeals pointed out that the petition for Annulment of Final Orders assails orders issued by an executive judge in a proceeding merely for the extrajudicial foreclosure of a mortgage whereas the Rules of Court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> clearly prescribes that only judgments, final orders and resolutions issued by a “<i>Regional Trial Court</i>” in “<i>civil actions”</i> may be the subject of annulment under Rule 47.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> The Court of Appeals further added that, at any rate, the principle of hierarchy of courts dictates that the Ingleses should have first challenged the validity of the <i>Orders</i> of Executive Judge Estrada in an appropriate case before the RTC instead of resorting to a direct action before it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> <br><br>Unconvinced, the Ingleses appealed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> both<i> Resolutions</i> of the Court of Appeals before this Court in what would be the first of the three petitions consolidated herein. This appeal by <i>certiorari</i> is currently <b>G.R. No. 141809</b>.<br><br><center><i><u>The Proceedings in Quezon City RTC, Branch 225</u></i></center><br>Meanwhile, as <b>LRC Case No. Q-10766 (98)</b> had already been consolidated with <b>Civil Case No. Q-98-33277</b>, Charles filed a <i>Motion for Issuance of [a] Writ of Possession</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> before Branch 225 of the Quezon City RTC on 9 September 1999. Branch 225 was then presided by Judge Arsenio J. Magpale (Judge Magpale).<br><br>In his <i>Motion for Issuance of [a] Writ of Possession</i>, Charles reiterated his plea to be put in possession of the ten (10) lots.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> But in order to show all the more his entitlement to a writ of possession, Charles also raised therein the fact that he now had consolidated title over the ten (10) lots as a consequence of the failure of the Ingleses to exercise their right of redemption within the period allowed by law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>On 19 November 1999, the RTC denied for lack of merit Charles’ <i>Motion for Issuance of [a] Writ of Possession</i>. Four days after, Charles filed a motion for reconsideration.<br><br>On 7 February 2000, the RTC issued a resolution55 on granting Charles’ motion for reconsideration. The dispositive portion of the resolution allowed Charles to present <i>ex parte </i>evidence in support of his application for a writ of possession before the Branch Clerk of Court, viz:<br><br><blockquote>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, petitioner Charles J. Esteban’s Motion for Reconsideration is GRANTED. For this purpose, the petitioner is hereby directed to present evidence ex- parte before Atty. Arlene V. Mancao, Branch Clerk of Court, the appointed commissioner within five (5) days from receipt of this order and for the said commissioner to submit to the Court her report as soon as the presentation of ex-parte evidence is through.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup></blockquote><br>On 29 February 2000, the Ingleses filed a motion for reconsideration against the 7 February 2000 resolution of the RTC.<br><br>On 1 March 2000, the Branch Clerk of Court received, in an <i>ex- parte</i> hearing, the testimony of Charles in support of his application for a writ of possession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> After which, Charles submitted a <i>Formal Offer of Evidence</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> for his documentary exhibits.<br><br>On 10 May 2000, the RTC denied the Ingleses’ motion for reconsideration.<br><br>Aggrieved, the Ingleses filed a <i>certiorari</i> petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> before the Court of Appeals contesting the 7 February 2000 resolution and 10 May 2000 order of the RTC. In the said petition, the Ingleses argue that the RTC gravely abused its discretion in allowing Charles to present <i>ex-parte</i> evidence on his application for a writ of possession despite the consolidation of <b>LRC Case No. Q-10766 (98)</b> with <b>Civil Case No. Q-98-33277</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> The Ingleses posit that the consolidation of <b>LRC Case No. Q-10766 (98)</b> and <b>Civil Case No. Q-98-33277</b> effectively tied the resolution of Charles’ application for a writ of possession with the resolution of their action for annulment of mortgage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> For the Ingleses then, the RTC cannot simply allow Charles to present <i>ex-parte</i> evidence on his application for a writ possession without first laying to rest, in a judicial proceeding for that purpose, other related issues raised in <b>Civil Case No. Q-98-33277</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup>&nbsp; This <i>certiorari</i> petition, which was accompanied by a prayer for a temporary restraining order, was docketed before the Court of Appeals as <b>CA-G.R. SP No. 58790</b>.<br><br>On account of the pendency of CA-G.R. SP No. 58790, the RTC issued another resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> on 10 July 2000 holding in abeyance any action and resolution on Charles’ <i>Motion for Issuance of a Writ of Possession.</i><br><br>Subsequently, however, Judge Magpale inhibited himself from further hearing <b>LRC Case No. Q-10766 (98)</b> and <b>Civil Case No. Q-98-33277</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> The two (2) consolidated cases were thus re-raffled and were eventually assigned to Branch 97 of the Quezon City RTC, which was then presided by Judge Oscar L.

Against this premise, it becomes apparent why the Ingleses’ petition for <i>Annulment of Final Orders </i>must fail. We substantiate:<br><br><b><i>Proceedings for the Extrajudicial Foreclosure <br>of Mortgages are not Civil Actions</i></b><br><br>The subject of the Ingleses’ petition for <i>Annulment of Final Orders</i> are not the proper subjects of a petition for annulment before the Court of Appeals.

Such orders, issued as they were by an executive judge in connection with a proceeding for the extrajudicial foreclosure of a mortgage, evidently do not fall within the type of issuances so carefully identified under Section 1 of Rule 47. The Court of Appeals was, therefore, correct in postulating that the annulment of the assailed <i>Orders</i> is not within their exclusive original jurisdiction per Section 9(2) of <i>Batas Pambansa Blg</i>. 129.<br><br><b><i>Allegation that the Assailed Orders<br>were Rendered Without Jurisdiction is <br>Immaterial, Baseless</i></b><br><br>The allegation of the Ingleses that Executive Judge Estrada overstepped her jurisdiction in issuing the assailed <i>Orders</i> is immaterial to the issue of whether the Court of Appeals may assume jurisdiction over their petition. Assuming <i>arguendo </i>that Executive Judge Estrada did exceed her jurisdiction in issuing the assailed Orders, the nature of such orders and the circumstances under which they were issued would still remain the same. The mere fact, nay, the mere allegation, that the assailed <i>Orders</i> have been issued without jurisdiction do not make them, even by the limits of either the strongest reasoning or the most colourful imagination, final orders in a “<i>civil action</i>” by a “<i>Regional Trial Court.</i>” Clearly, a petition under Rule 47 even then would still not be a viable remedy.<br><br>At any rate, this Court finds that Executive Judge Estrada did not actually “exceed” her jurisdiction when she issued the assailed <i>Orders</i>. All that Executive Judge Estrada did was to render an interpretation of the <i>Deed of Real Estate Mortgage</i> on its face—which is something that she is lawfully entitled, if not obliged, to do in an extrajudicial foreclosure proceeding. After all, an executive judge has the administrative duty in such proceedings to ensure that all the conditions of the law have been complied with before authorizing the public auction of any mortgaged property<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup> and this duty, by <i>necessity</i>, includes facially examining the mortgage agreement as to whether it adequately identified the land to be auctioned or whether it contains sufficient authorization on the part of the mortgagee to push forth with an extrajudicial sale.&nbsp; Of course, an executive judge may <i>err</i> in the exercise of such administrative function and, as a result, may improvidently sanction an extrajudicial sale based on a faulty construction of a mortgage agreement—but those are not errors of jurisdiction inasmuch as they relate only to the <i>exercise</i> of jurisdiction.<br><br>In fine, therefore, We see no reversible error on the part of the Court of Appeals in dismissing the Ingleses’ petition for <i>Annulment of Final Orders</i>.<br><br><center style="font-style: italic;"><b><u>G.R.

We quote them at length:<br><br><blockquote>1) A distinction must be made between non-compliance with the requirement on or submission of defective verification, and non- compliance with the requirement on or submission of defective certification against forum shopping.<br><br>2) As to verification, non-compliance therewith or a defect therein does not necessarily render the pleading fatally defective.

We substantiate:<br><br><b><i>The Ingleses Substantially Complied with<br> the Requirement of Verification</i> </b><br><br>The Ingleses’ <i>certiorari</i> petition was properly verified even though not all of them were able to sign the same. As related by <b>Altres</b>, the requirement of verification is deemed substantially complied with if “<i><b>one</b> who has ample knowledge to swear to the truth of the allegations in the complaint or petition signs the verification, and when matters alleged in the petition have been made in good faith or are true and correct.</i>”<br><br>The pronouncement in <b><i>Altres</i></b> is based on the recognition that the purpose of verifying a petition or complaint, <i>i.e</i>., to assure the court that such petition or complaint was filed in good faith; and that the allegations therein are true and correct and not the product of the imagination or a matter of speculation,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[135]</sup> can sufficiently be achieved even if only one of the several petitioners or plaintiffs signs the verification.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[136]</sup> As long the signatory of the verification is competent, there is already substantial compliance with the requirement.<br><br>Verily, the signatures of <i>all</i> of the Ingleses were not required to validly verify their <i>certiorari</i> petition. It suffices, according to <b><i>Altres</i></b>, that the verification was signed by at least one of the Ingleses who was competent to do so. In this case, the <i>certiorari</i> petition was verified by Josefina and Hector F.

Nevertheless, the <i>certiorari</i> petition should be sustained as to all of the Ingleses since substantial compliance with the requirement of a certification against forum shopping may be appreciated in their favor. Jurisprudence clearly recognizes that <i>“under reasonable or justifiable circumstances x x x as when all the plaintiffs or petitioners share a common interest and invoke a common cause of action or defense”</i> the rule requiring all such petitioners or plaintiffs to sign the certification against forum shopping may be relaxed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[141]</sup><br><br>In this case, the “<i>reasonable or justifiable circumstance</i>” that would warrant a relaxation of the rule on the certification against forum shopping consists in the undeniable fact that Ingleses are immediate relatives of each other espousing but only one cause in their <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari </span>petition.

It is well-settled that a petition for the issuance of a writ of possession is <i>ex-parte</i>, summary and non-litigious by nature; which nature would be rendered nugatory if such petition was to be consolidated with any other ordinary civil action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[146]</sup><br><br>The exception to the foregoing rule is the case of <i style="font-weight: bold;">Active Wood Products, Co., Inc. vs. Court of Appeals</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[147]</sup> In <b><i>Active Wood</i></b>, this Court allowed the consolidation of a petition for the issuance of a writ of possession with an ordinary action for the annulment of mortgage. In doing so, <b><i>Active Wood</i></b> justified such consolidation as follows:<br><br><blockquote>It is true that a petition for a writ of possession is made <i>ex-parte</i> to facilitate proceedings, being founded on a presumed right of ownership. <b>Be that as it may, when this presumed right of ownership is contested and made the basis of another action, then the proceedings for writ of possession would also become seemingly groundless. The entire case must be litigated and if need be as in the case at bar, must be consolidated with a related case so as to thresh out thoroughly all related issues.</b> (Emphasis supplied).<br></blockquote><br>The unbridled construction of <b><i>Active Wood</i></b>, however, led to a deplorable practice where mortgagors aggrieved by the result of an extrajudicial foreclosure would prevent possession by the successful purchaser by simply filing an action contesting the latter’s “<i>presumed right of ownership</i>” either by an annulment of mortgage or of the extrajudicial sale, and then asking the court for their consolidation with the petition for the issuance of a writ of possession. Needless to state, this abusive practice have reached the attention of this Court that, in turn, led to subsequent decisions refining the application of the <b><i>Active Wood</i></b> doctrine.<br><br>Hence, in<b><i> Sps. De Vera v. Hon. Agloro</i></b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[148]</sup> this Court held that the consolidation of an action for the annulment of mortgage and extrajudicial sale with a petition for the issuance of a writ of possession, is not mandatory but still rests within the discretion of the trial court to allow. <b><i>De Vera</i></b> opined that “<i>when the rights of [a purchaser in an extrajudicial foreclosure sale] would be prejudiced x x x especially since [the latter] already adduced its evidence [in support of his application for a writ of possession]”</i> consolidation of the two cases may rightfully be denied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[149]</sup><br><br>Amplifying further on <b><i>Sps. De Vera </i></b>is the case of <i><b>Philippine National Bank v. Gotesco Tyan Ming Development, Inc.</b></i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[150]</sup> In <b><i>Philippine National Bank</i></b>, this Court held that consolidation of an action for annulment of extrajudicial sale and a petition for the issuance of a writ of possession should not be allowed when doing so would actually lead to more delay in the proceedings and thus “<i>defeat the very rationale of consolidation</i>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[151]</sup> In the same case, this Court even ordered the separation of the then already consolidated action for the annulment of extrajudicial sale and petition for the issuance of a writ of possession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[152]</sup><br><br>But perhaps the most crucial refinement of <b><i>Active Wood</i></b> was in the case of <i><b>Espinoza v. United Overseas Bank Phils</b></i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[153]</sup> Espinoza declared that the mere fact that the purchaser’s “<i>presumed right of ownership is contested and made the basis of another action</i>” does not mean that such action ought to be consolidated with the petition for the issuance of a writ of possession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[154]</sup> For <b><i>Espinoza</i></b>, the application of the <b><i>Active Wood</i></b> doctrine must be limited only to cases with the same factual circumstances under which the latter was rendered.<br><br><b><i>Espinoza</i></b> called attention to the fact that in <b><i>Active Wood</i></b> the petition for the issuance of a writ of possession was “<i>filed before the expiration of the one-year redemption period</i>” and that <i>“the litigated property had not been consolidated in the name of the mortgagee</i>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[155]</sup>&nbsp; Hence, <b><i>Espinoza</i></b> invalidated the consolidation of an action for the annulment of the extrajudicial sale with a petition for the issuance of a writ of possession <i>after</i> finding that the latter petition was filed after the expiration of the one-year redemption period and <i>after</i> the purchaser had already consolidated his title over the auctioned property. This must be, <b><i>Espinoza</i></b> explained, because when:<br><br><blockquote>x x x <b>title to the litigated property had already been consolidated in the name of respondent,</b> x x x <b>the issuance of a writ of possession [becomes] a matter of right</b>. Consequently, the consolidation of the petition for the issuance of a writ of possession with the proceedings for nullification of foreclosure would be highly improper. Otherwise, not only will the very purpose of consolidation (which is to avoid unnecessary delay) be defeated but <b>the procedural matter of consolidation will also adversely affect the substantive right of possession as an incident of ownership</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[156]</sup> (Emphasis supplied).<br></blockquote><br>Applying the foregoing judicial pronouncements to the case at bar, this Court discerns that the consolidation of <b>LRC Case No. Q-10766 (98) </b>and <b>Civil Case No. Q-98-33277</b> had already ceased to become proper by the time the RTC allowed him to present ex-parte evidence in support of his application for the issuance of a writ of possession. Separation of the two cases is moreover warranted. We substantiate:<br><br><b><i>Charles Has Already Consolidated <br>His Title Over the Mortgaged Lots; <br>No Grave Abuse of Discretion in<br>Allowing Charles to Present Ex- <br>Parte Evidence</i></b><br><br>The ruling in <b><i>Espinoza</i></b> applies. It is uncontested that by the time he filed his <i>Motion for Issuance of a Writ of Possession</i>, which was before the RTC allowed him to present <i>ex-parte</i> evidence in support of his application for the issuance of a writ of possession, Charles had already consolidated his title over the ten (10) lots.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[157]</sup> At that time, Charles was already the absolute owner of the ten (10) lots and, as such, his right to possess the same becomes a matter of right on his part.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[158]</sup> Charles’ claim of possession is no longer merely based on a “<i>presumed right of ownership</i>” as the Ingleses have evidently failed to exercise their right of redemption within the period provided by law. By then, the consolidation of Charles’ application for a writ of possession with the Ingleses’ action for the annulment of mortgage had already lost its basis and, therefore, ceased to become proper. Consequently, no grave abuse of discretion may be imputed on the part of the RTC in allowing Charles to present <i>ex-parte</i> evidence in support of his application for the issuance of a writ of possession.<br><br>Even though Charles filed his original <i>Ex-Parte Petition for Issuance of a Writ Possession</i> still within the redemption period, <b><i>Espinoza</i></b> would nevertheless apply. Charles’ subsequent filing of his <i>Motion for Issuance of a Writ of Possession</i> at a time that he was already absolute owner of the auctioned lots supplemented his earlier <i>Ex-Parte Petition for Issuance of a Writ Possession</i>—thus making his application for a writ of possession similar to that in the <b><i>Espinoza</i></b> case.<br><br>All in all, the Ingleses <i>certiorari</i> petition must therefore be dismissed.<br><br><b><i>Consolidation of LRC Case No. Q-<br>10766 (98) and Civil Case No. Q-<br>98-33277 Delayed Rather Than <br>Expedited Resolution of Both Cases; <br>Separation of Both Cases In Order</i></b><br><br>In addition, this Court finds that the consolidation of <b>LRC Case No. Q-10766 (98)</b> and <b>Civil Case No. Q-98-33277</b> had actually been counter-productive for the resolution of the two cases.
