Incidents of December 28, 2001</i></b><br><br>Petitioners alleged that at around midnight of December 28, 2001, respondent Gil Anthony Calianga (Gil) called petitioner Iris Kristine Alberto (Iris), then sixteen (16) years old,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> informing her that he was at their garage with some food and drinks. For fear of being scolded, Iris refused to see Gil. But due to his insistence, Iris finally went out to meet Gil and thereafter, took the food and drinks which he brought. Eventually, while they were talking, Iris felt weak and dizzy and thus, tried to return to her room. Gil assisted Iris and when they reached the room, he laid her on the bed. A little later, Gil started kissing Iris which prompted her to scream. Consequently, Gil covered Iris’ mouth with a pillow and soon after, he succeeded in having sexual intercourse with her. Before leaving, Gil warned Iris not to tell anyone about what happened or else he would kill her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>By way of rebuttal, respondents averred that Gil and Iris met at the Mormon Church in Muntinlupa City and became sweethearts in 2001. They eventually developed an amorous physical relationship and on the evening of December 28, 2001, secretly slept together for the first time in Iris’ own bedroom.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br><b><i>B. Incidents of April 23 to 24, 2002</i></b><br><br>As for the second set of incidents, petitioners claimed that on April 23, 2002, Gil called Iris, then seventeen (17) years old,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> telling her that he would pick her up for them to go to church in order to play volleyball. They met at about 5:30 in the afternoon in South Green Heights and proceeded to Camella to meet Gil’s sister, respondent Jessebel Calianga (Jessebel), and her friend, respondent Grace Evangelista (Grace). At around 6:30 in the evening, Gil and Iris boarded a tricycle. At the outset, Iris thought they would be going to church for volleyball practice; but instead, Gil, while poking a knife at Iris’ side, told her that they were headed to a different destination. Eventually, they reached a McDonald’s restaurant located in San Pedro, Laguna where they transferred to a car driven by Grace’s common- law husband. They then returned to Camella and stayed with a relative of Grace where they had dinner. While having dinner, Iris overheard respondent Atty. Rodrigo Reyna (Atty. Reyna) giving instructions to Jessebel to take Iris to Marikina City. When they finished their dinner, Atty. Reyna called again and told Iris not to go out as her relatives were around the area, on board several cars. Iris pleaded Gil to let her go, but her pleas were ignored. A little later, Jessebel and Grace led Gil and Iris to a tree house where Gil forced her to enter a room. She tried to resist but he threatened to kill her if she did not accede. Left with no option, Iris entered the room where Gil, holding her at knifepoint, succeeded in once again having sexual intercourse with her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>The following day, or on April 24, 2002, at around 6:00 in the morning, Atty. Reyna arrived and instructed Iris to tell her relatives, who had been worriedly looking for her, that she voluntarily went with Gil; that she was treated with kindness; and that everything that happened was to her own liking because of her love for Gil. Atty. Reyna then asked Iris to go home but she refused because she did not know her way back. Because of Iris’ refusal, Atty. Reyna called up her Auntie Vilma and Uncle Albert and agreed to meet at Chowking-Poblacion where Iris was finally released to her grandfather, petitioner Benjamin Balois (Benjamin).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>In defense, respondents maintained that on April 23, 2002, Iris’ brother, Eldon Alberto (Eldon), caught Gil inside Iris’ bedroom where he had spent the night. Fearing the consequences of having been caught, Gil and Iris eloped and stayed at the house of Grace’s grandfather. When Benjamin realized that Iris was missing, he sought the help of Atty. Reyna, since he was a family friend from their church. Iris’ relatives also suspected that she might be with Gil after learning from the entries in her journal that Iris loved Gil very much. Coincidentally, Gil was the nephew of Atty. Reyna’s wife and so they were hoping that Atty. Reyna would have some information as to Gil’s whereabouts. Atty. Reyna and the Balois family searched together for Iris that night. In the course thereof, Atty. Reyna called Jessebel and Grace to ask if they knew where Gil was. Both stated that they were in Marikina but denied having any knowledge about Gil’s location. Later, the party tried to search Gil’s house as well as Grace’s place (the latter being referred to as the “tree house”). However, both yielded negative results.<br><br>In the morning of April 24, 2002, Atty. Reyna proceeded to look for Grace and again asked where Gil and Iris were. Eventually, Grace admitted that the two were at her grandfather’s house, which was only around 30 minutes away from her place. They proceeded accordingly and there, found Iris and Gil who were both surprised to see Atty. Reyna. Subsequently, Atty. Reyna asked Iris why she left home and she answered that it was because of her brother Eldon’s warning that her family knew everything about her relationship with Gil. Atty. Reyna confirmed the veracity of Eldon’s statement and went on to advise Iris to just tell the truth. Iris heeded Atty. Reyna’s advice, allowing him to contact the Baloises and arrange for her return. As it turned out, they agreed to meet at Chowking-Poblacion for such purpose.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>In view of the incidents that transpired on December 28, 2001 and April 23 to 24, 2002, Benjamin filed a criminal complaint for Rape, Serious Illegal Detention and Child Abuse under Section 5(b), Article III of RA 7610 against Gil, Atty. Reyna, Jessebel and Grace before the Office of the City Prosecutor of Muntinlupa (Muntinlupa Pros. Office), docketed as <b>I.S. No. 02-G-03020-22</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br><b><i>C. Incidents of June 23 to November 9, 2003</i></b><br><br>Finally, as for the third set of incidents, petitioners asserted that on June 23, 2003, Iris was abducted in front of Assumption College. This time, Gil conspired with Atty. Reyna and respondent Arturo Calianga (Arturo), to take Iris in order to prevent her from appearing at the preliminary investigation in I.S. No. 02-G-03020-22 scheduled on June 25, 2003. In the afternoon of the same day, Iris’ family brought Police Anti-Crime and Emergency Response (PACER) agents to Arturo’s house. Upon their arrival, Grace told them that Gil left with some clothes and that he and Iris eloped and would proceed to Cagayan de Oro City. Soon after the abduction on June 23, 2003, Gil, Atty. Reyna and Arturo started their psychological manipulation of Iris.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>On June 27, 2003, Gil, with the help of two men, brought Iris to Cagayan de Oro City and there, held her captive in a small room with a small mat, near a pigpen. They controlled her movements, such as when she would eat, sleep, bathe or use the toilet. Gil raped her almost every day even during her menstrual period and would beat her up whenever she resisted. Also, Gil often told Iris that he would have her entire family killed by his Moslem relatives.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Disputing petitioners’ allegations, respondents denied that Gil, Atty. Reyna and Arturo abducted Iris and instead, claimed that Gil and Iris eloped for the second time, after visiting the Office of the City Prosecutor of Muntinlupa City where Iris declared that the charges against respondents were all fabricated by her grandfather, Benjamin, and that she wanted them dismissed. Respondents claimed that Iris was quite prepared during her second elopement with Gil as she brought with her three bags containing several personal effects and other relevant documents. Eventually, Iris’ family would discover that the reason for her elopement with Gil was because she was being maltreated and physically abused by her grandfather, Benjamin. Moreover, Iris could no longer stomach the lies Benjamin wanted her to say about Gil.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Subsequently, Benjamin filed a second complaint against Gil, Atty. Reyna and Arturo for Kidnapping and Serious Illegal Detention, Grave Coercion and Obstruction of Justice before the Office of the City Prosecutor of Makati (Makati Pros. Office), docketed as <b>I.S. No. 03-G-14072-75.</b> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>On July 9, 2003, the City Prosecutor of Muntinlupa City dismissed the charges against Gil, Atty. Reyna, Jessebel and Grace for Rape and Serious Illegal Detention in I.S. No. 02-G-03020-22 for insufficiency of evidence. However, having found that he had sexual intercourse with a minor, Gil was charged for Child Abuse. Consequently, a warrant of arrest was issued against Gil.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Determined to face the charges against him, Gil, together with Iris, returned from Cagayan de Oro City to Manila where he posted bail for the Child Abuse case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>On August 6, 2003, Iris executed an affidavit (August 6, 2003 affidavit), sworn before Makati Assistant City Prosecutor George de Joya (Pros. de Joya), denying that she was kidnapped, detained or raped by Gil. She also affirmed that she loved Gil and eloped with him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>On August 13, 2003, Iris and Gil appeared together on the GMA-7 television network’s <i>Frontpage</i> news segment “<i>Magkasintahan Pala</i>” where Iris publicly declared that she loved Gil and that she went with him freely.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>On August 19, 2003, Iris appeared before the 9<sup>th</sup> Division of the CA in the hearing of the petition for <i>habeas corpus</i> filed by Benjamin in view of her second elopement on June 23, 2003.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> During the said hearing, Iris declared that she was never kidnapped, detained or raped and that she loved Gil who was her boyfriend since December 2001. She also confirmed that she executed the August 6, 2003 affidavit before Pros. de Joya and that she appeared in “<i>Magkasintahan Pala</i>” on August 13, 2003. She also testified that she visited the Office of the City Prosecutor of Muntinlupa asking for the dismissal of the erroneous charges filed by Benjamin. When the CA Justices asked with whom she wanted to go home, she said that she wanted to go with Gil and his family. She added that she did not want her grandfather to visit her. Hence, in line with her decision during the foregoing proceedings, Iris and Gil freely cohabited beginning August 19, 2003 and were seen in public, freely roaming around the city. They regularly went to church together, underwent counseling and even planned to have their relationship bonded by marriage as soon as they got the required parental consent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>On November 9, 2003, Benjamin forcibly took Iris away from Gil as the two were going to church. He subsequently kept Iris <i>incommunicado</i> for days and then had her declare through radio, newspaper and television that she was kidnapped and raped by Gil and his family. While in the company of her relatives, Iris was able to sneak out text messages to Gil using the cellular phone of her grandfather, expressing her deep love and concern for him and warning his family about Benjamin’s plans against them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>On December 15, 2003, Iris, assisted by members of the groups Volunteers Against Crime and Corruption and Gabriela, proceeded to the DOJ Task Force on Women and Children Protection (DOJ Task Force) and filed a third complaint against Gil for Forcible Abduction with Rape and Obstruction of Justice, punished under Presidential Decree No. 1829,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> docketed as <b>I.S. No. 2004-127</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br><center><b>Disposition of the Criminal Complaints</b></center><br>The three (3) criminal complaints filed by Iris and Benjamin against respondents were disposed as follows:<br><br><b><i><u>First</u></i></b>, in <b>I.S. No. 02-G-03020-22</b>, State Prosecutor II Lilian Doris S. Alejo (Pros. Alejo) of the Muntinlupa Pros. Office issued the Resolution dated July 9, 2003,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> dismissing the charges for Serious Illegal Detention and Rape against Gil, Atty. Reyna, Jessebel and Grace for insufficiency of evidence. In gist, Pros. Alejo found that the pieces of evidence showed that Gil and Iris were sweethearts and the sexual intercourse that transpired between them was consensual. Likewise, she observed that the story narrated by Iris was farfetched and, to a certain degree, unacceptable and unimaginable, intimating that it was unbelievable that Iris would still go to volleyball practice with Gil after the first rape he allegedly committed against her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Nonetheless, Pros. Alejo recommended the filing of informations for Child Abuse against Gil for having sexual intercourse with Iris on <b>December 28, 2001</b> and <b>April 23, 2003</b> by taking advantage of her minority and his moral influence as a pastor of their church.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Accordingly, Gil was charged under the following amended criminal informations,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> docketed as <b>Criminal Case Nos. 03-549</b> and <b>03-551</b>:<br><br><blockquote><center><b>Criminal Case No. 03-551</b></center><br>That on <b>December 28, 2001</b>, in the City of Muntinlupa, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above- named accused, by taking advantage of his influence as Mormon priest of the church of which herein victim, seventeen (17) year[s] old IRIS KRISTINE ALBERTO <span style="font-style: italic;">y</span> BALOIS is a member, and through moral compulsion, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously <b>engaged in sexual intercourse with said minor</b>.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW. <br>Muntinlupa City, July 9, 2003.<br><br><center><b>Criminal Case No. 03-549</b></center><br>That on <b>April 23, 2002</b>, in the City of Muntinlupa, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, by taking advantage of his influence as Mormon priest of the church of which herein victim, seventeen (17) year old IRIS KRISTINE ALBERTO y BALOIS is a member, and through moral compulsion, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously <b>engaged in sexual intercourse with said minor.</b><br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<br>Muntinlupa City, July 9, 2003.</blockquote><br><b><i><u>Second</u></i></b>, in <b>I.S. No. 03-G-14027-75</b>, 2<sup>nd</sup> Assistant City Prosecutor Henry M. Salazar (Pros. Salazar) of the Makati Pros. Office issued a Resolution dated March 5, 2004,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> equally dismissing the charges for Kidnapping and Serious Illegal Detention, Grave Coercion and Obstruction of Justice against Gil, Atty. Reyna and Arturo for lack of merit and/or insufficiency of evidence. Anent the Kidnapping charge, Pros. Salazar found that no evidence was submitted which would prove that Iris was forcibly taken away and deprived of her liberty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Similarly, he observed that there was no evidence or any particular allegation of facts in the complaint- affidavit constituting the acts which were claimed as coercive.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> In the same vein, he found no evidence or any sufficient allegation to support the charge of Obstruction of Justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Pros. Salazar further noted that aside from the insufficiency of the complainant’s<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> evidence, the affidavit of Iris dated August 5, 2003, the news package entitled “<i>Magkasintahan Pala</i>,” and the transcript of stenographic notes of the hearing on August 19, 2003 of the petition for <i>habeas corpus </i>in CA-G.R. S.P. No. 78316 all support the dismissal of the foregoing charges.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> He also observed that the complainant moved for the suspension of the preliminary investigation due to the need to have Iris mentally examined, alleging certain doubts on the voluntariness of her August 6, 2003 affidavit. However, no mental examination report was submitted to verify such doubts. In addition, Pros. Salazar took cognizance of the fact that while Iris was “rescued” on November 9, 2003, Benjamin only asked for the revival of the preliminary investigation of the case on January 22, 2004.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>Finally, the counter-charge of Perjury was dismissed, also for lack of merit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>Dissatisfied, Benjamin moved for reconsideration which was, however, denied in a Resolution dated July 30, 2004.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br><b><i><u>Third</u></i></b>, in <b>I.S. No. 2004-127</b>, State Prosecutor Zenaida M. Lim (Pros. Lim) of the DOJ Task Force issued a Resolution dated November 8, 2004,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> also dismissing the third case for Forcible Abduction with Rape and Obstruction of Justice against Gil, Atty. Reyna and Arturo on the ground of insufficiency of evidence.<br><br>In addition to the above-stated incidents, complainant<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> averred that Atty. Reyna and Arturo also raped her in the month of August 2003. She alleged that Atty. Reyna gave her a drink laced with some kind of chemical substance which made her dizzy and weak and thereafter, succeeded to have sexual intercourse with her. Iris averred that Arturo also did the same thing to her. She likewise claimed that Atty. Reyna and Arturo sexually molested her every time they went to Taytay, while Gil continually raped her. After the <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings in CA-G.R. S.P. No. 78316, Gil brought her to Atty. Reyna’s house in Putatan, Muntinlupa where she was repeatedly raped by Gil and Atty. Reyna. According to Iris, Atty. Reyna also brought her to an apartment in Camella Homes, Muntinlupa where Arturo raped her. She stayed at Atty. Reyna’s Putatan residence for three (3) months and the latter would bring her to the Camella Homes apartment whenever his wife sensed what they were doing to her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Pros. Lim found no probable cause for the crimes charged, holding that Iris was not a credible witness because of her flip-flopping testimonies and the serious contradictions therein. She observed that the fact that Iris admitted that she went back to school and even got exemplary grades confirmed that she was of sound mind and acted with volition when she went away with Gil on June 23, 2003. Her mental condition was also adjudged to be normal by the CA justices who observed her personal demeanor during the August 19, 2003 hearing in CA-G.R. S.P. No. 78316. Further, the fact that Iris was not abducted but acted with free will was attested to by Gemma Cachuela (Cachuela), a staff of the Muntinlupa Prosecutor’s Office, stating that Iris went to their office on June 23, 2003 to withdraw her complaint. Pros. Lim added that Cachuela had no reason or motive to fabricate her statement. Likewise, she noted that the fact that the presentation of the news program “<i>Magkasintahan Pala</i>” and Iris’ text messages to Gil as evidence were suppressed meant that they were adverse to Iris’ cause. She also found the assertion that Iris was made to undergo a mock trial twice a week to script her testimony for the first <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings to be untrue as Iris herself admitted that respondents received the subpoena only on August 17, 2003, or two (2) days before the August 19, 2003 hearing. Further, she deemed that it was incredible that respondents would use a color-coding vehicle on the day of Iris’ purported abduction. Complainant’s sweeping statements against Atty. Reyna and Arturo were also found to be inadequate to establish their guilt, observing that if Iris were indeed drugged for the first time and raped, she should not have acceded to drink the same substance for a second time. Moreover, if she was indeed molested by Atty. Reyna and Arturo, she should have declared such fact during the proceedings in CA-G.R. S.P. No. 78316. Yet, on the contrary, Iris even praised Atty. Reyna and Arturo for being “<i>mabubuting tao</i>” (good people).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> In closing, Pros. Lim held that no abduction with rape took place but rather, the rule on two (2) consenting adults giving free reign to their emotions prevailed in this case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>Finally, anent the charge of Obstruction of Justice, Pros. Lim dismissed the same, also for lack of sufficient evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>Aggrieved, Iris and Benjamin appealed the dismissal of all the foregoing charges to the DOJ.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br><center><b>Proceedings Before the DOJ</b></center><br>On December 11, 2006, the DOJ Secretary issued the first assailed Resolution of even date<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> which he later modified through an Amended Resolution dated December 22, 2006 (Amended Resolution).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> In the Amended Resolution, the DOJ Secretary resolved the consolidated petitions in I.S. No. 02-G-03020-22, I.S. No. 03-G-14027-75 and I.S. No. 2004-127, finding probable cause to charge: (<i>a</i>) Gil for Rape, in relation to Section 5(b), Article III of RA 7610, on account of the December 28, 2001 incidents; (<i>b</i>) Gil, Jessebel, Atty. Reyna and Grace for one (1) count each of Serious Illegal Detention and Rape, in relation to Section 5(b), Article III of RA 7610, on account of the April 23 to 24, 2002 incidents; and (<i>c</i>) Gil, Atty.

He further held that it was error to have dismissed the charges against respondents on the basis of the dismissal of the two (2) <i>habeas corpus</i> cases considering that the causes of action therein were different and that the CA did not make any finding on the criminal liability of the respondents. Also, he noted that Iris’ family reported to the authorities that she had been abducted. Moreover, he found that respondents conspired with one another in the abduction and consequent raping of Iris.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>On January 18, 2007, respondents moved for the reconsideration of the Amended Resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>Meanwhile, on February 5, 2007, two (2) separate criminal Informations were filed for Forcible Abduction with Rape against Gil, Arturo, and Atty.

The rationale behind the general rule rests on the principle of separation of powers, dictating that the determination of probable cause for the purpose of indicting a suspect is properly an executive function; while the exception hinges on the limiting principle of checks and balances,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> whereby the judiciary, through a special civil action of <i>certiorari</i>, has been tasked by the present Constitution “to determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>In the case of <i>Callo-Caridad v.

That happens when the Secretary of Justice acts in a limited sense like a quasi-judicial officer of the executive department exercising powers akin to those of a court of law. <b>But the requirement for such intervention was still for the petitioner to demonstrate clearly that the Secretary of Justice committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. Unless such a clear demonstration is made, the intervention is disallowed in deference to the doctrine of separation of powers</b>. As the Court has postulated in <i>Metropolitan Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Tobias III</i>:<br><br><blockquote>Under the doctrine of separation of powers, the courts have no right to directly decide matters over which full discretionary authority has been delegated to the Executive Branch of the Government, or to substitute their own judgments for that of the Executive Branch, represented in this case by the Department of Justice. <b>The settled policy is that the courts will not interfere with the executive determination of probable cause for the purpose of filing an information, in the absence of grave abuse of discretion.</b> x x x x (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote></blockquote><br>In the context of filing criminal charges, grave abuse of discretion exists in cases where the determination of probable cause is exercised in an arbitrary and despotic manner by reason of passion and personal hostility. The abuse of discretion to be qualified as “grave” must be so patent or gross as to constitute an evasion of a positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform the duty or to act at all in contemplation of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> In this regard, case law states that not every error in the proceedings, or every erroneous conclusion of law or fact, constitutes grave abuse of discretion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> As held in <i>PCGG v. Jacobi:</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br><blockquote>In fact, the prosecutor may err or may even abuse the discretion lodged in him by law. <b>This error or abuse alone, however, does not render his act amenable to correction and annulment by the extraordinary remedy of <i>certiorari</i>.</b> To justify judicial intrusion into what is fundamentally the domain of the Executive, the petitioner must clearly show that the prosecutor gravely abused his discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in making his determination and in arriving at the conclusion he reached.<b> This requires the petitioner to establish that the prosecutor exercised his power in an arbitrary and despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility; and <u>it must be so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion or to a unilateral refusal to perform the duty enjoined or to act in contemplation of law, before judicial relief from a discretionary prosecutorial action may be obtained</u></b>. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>To note, probable cause, for the purpose of filing a criminal information, exists when the facts are sufficient to engender a well-founded belief that a crime has been committed and that the respondent is probably guilty thereof. It does not mean “actual and positive cause” nor does it import absolute certainty. Rather, it is merely based on opinion and reasonable belief. Accordingly, probable cause does not require an inquiry into whether there is sufficient evidence to procure a conviction; it is enough that it is believed that the act or omission complained of constitutes the offense charged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> As pronounced in <i>Reyes v. Pearlbank Securities, Inc.</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br><blockquote><b>A finding of probable cause needs only to rest on evidence showing that, more likely than not, a crime has been committed by the suspects</b>. It need not be based on clear and convincing evidence of guilt, not on evidence establishing guilt beyond reasonable doubt, and definitely not on evidence establishing absolute certainty of guilt. In determining probable cause, the average man weighs facts and circumstances without resorting to the calibrations of the rules of evidence of which he has no technical knowledge. He relies on common sense. What is determined is whether there is sufficient ground <b><u>to engender a well-founded belief that a crime has been committed</u></b>, and <b><u>that the accused is probably guilty thereof and should be held for trial</u></b>. It does not require an inquiry as to whether there is sufficient evidence to secure a conviction. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>In order to engender a well-founded belief that a crime has been committed, and to determine if the suspect is probably guilty of the same, the elements of the crime charged should, in all reasonable likelihood, be present. This is based on the principle that every crime is defined by its elements, without which there should be, at the most, no criminal offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br>Guided by the foregoing considerations, the Court therefore holds as follows:<br><br><b><i><u>First</u></i></b>, the DOJ Secretary did not gravely abuse his discretion in finding that probable cause exists for the crime of Rape against Gil, Atty. Reyna and Arturo.<br><br>Under Article 266-A of the RPC, as amended by Republic Act No. 8353, the elements of Rape are: (<i>a</i>) that the offender is a man; (<i>b</i>) that the offender had carnal knowledge of a woman; and (<i>c</i>) that such act is accomplished by using force or intimidation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br>In particular, with respect to Gil, Iris averred that on December 28, 2001, Gil drugged her and thereafter, through force and intimidation, succeeded in having sexual intercourse with her. She also claimed that on April 23, 2002, Gil, again through force and intimidation, had carnal knowledge of her in the tree house. Likewise, beginning June 27, 2003, Gil raped her almost every day up until her rescue on November 9 of the same year.<br><br>In defense, records show that Gil never denied any of the above-stated sexual encounters, but merely maintained the he and Iris were sweethearts, as shown by several love letters and text messages between them.<br><br>Ruling on the matter, the Court finds no grave abuse of discretion on the part of the DOJ Secretary, as the elements of rape, more likely than not, appear to be present.<br><br>The first and second elements of the crime are beyond dispute as Gil does not deny having carnal knowledge with Iris. Anent the third element of force and intimidation, Iris’s version of the facts, as well as Gil’s sole reliance on the sweetheart defense, leads the Court to believe that the said element, in all reasonable likelihood, appears to be present, considering that: (<i>a</i>) mere denial cannot prevail over the positive testimony of a witness;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> (<i>b</i>) the sweetheart theory does not, by and of itself, negate the commission of rape;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> and (<i>c</i>) the fact that Iris was a minor during the foregoing incidents casts serious doubt on the efficacy of the consent purportedly given by her,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> especially in view of Gil’s esteemed position of being a priest of the same congregation of which Iris belongs to.<br><br>Moreover, a perusal of the transcript of stenographic notes of the January 14, 2004 hearing in CA-G.R. S.P. No. 80624 (January 14, 2004 TSN) shows that Iris retracted her previous testimony during the August 19, 2003 hearing in the first <i>habeas corpus</i> case, <i>i.e.</i>, CA-G.R. S.P. No. 78316, to the effect that her statements that Gil never raped her and that she went with him on her own volition were merely “scripted” and conjured only upon the instruction of Atty. Reyna.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> While case law holds that recantations do not necessarily cancel out an earlier declaration, ultimately, it should still be treated like any other testimony and as such, its credibility must be tested during trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br>Based on the foregoing reasons, the Court finds reasonable bases to sustain the DOJ Secretary’s finding of probable cause for Rape against Gil in connection with all three (3) incidents of December 28, 2001, April 23, 2002 and June 23 to November 9, 2003. In this respect, the DOJ Secretary committed no grave abuse of discretion.<br><br>Similarly, the Court finds no grave abuse of discretion in the DOJ Secretary’s finding of probable cause for Rape against Atty. Reyna and Arturo, but only insofar as the June 23 to November 9, 2003 incidents are concerned.<br><br>The January 14, 2004 TSN reveals that Iris categorically declared in open court that she was raped by Atty. Reyna and Arturo during the aforesaid five month period.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> It is a standing rule that due to the nature of the commission of the crime of rape, the testimony of the victim may be sufficient to convict the accused, provided that such testimony is credible, natural, convincing and consistent with human nature and the normal course of things.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> Applying the same, the Court deems it prudent to test the credibility of Iris’s testimony during trial, in which her demeanor and deportment would be properly observable,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> and likewise be subject to cross- examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup><br><br>On the contrary, there appears to be no ample justification to support the finding of probable cause against Atty. Reyna and Arturo, with respect to the rape incidents of December 28, 2001 and April 23, 2002, as well as against Jessebel and Grace for all three (3) incidents.<br><br>As may be gleaned from the Amended Resolution, the DOJ Secretary indicted Atty. Reyna, Arturo, Jessebel and Grace for these incidents only by reason of conspiracy. Yet, other than his general imputation thereof, the DOJ Secretary never provided any rational explanation for his finding of conspiracy against the aforementioned respondents. The rule is that conspiracy must be proved as clearly and convincingly as the commission of the offense itself. It can be inferred from and established by the acts of the accused themselves when said acts point to a joint purpose and design, concerted action and community of interests.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> In this case, the Amended Resolution is bereft of any showing as to how the particular acts of the foregoing respondents figured into the common design of raping Iris and as such, the Court finds no reason to charge them for the same.<br><br>Therefore, finding no grave abuse of discretion in the following respects, the Court upholds the DOJ Secretary’s finding of probable cause for the crime of Rape against Gil for all three (3) rape incidents and against Atty. Reyna and Arturo for the incidents of June 23 to November 9, 2003.<br><br>At this juncture, the Court observes that the DOJ charged Gil for Rape <i>in relation</i> to Child Abuse under Section 5(b), Article III of RA 7610<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> on account of the December 28, 2001 and April 23, 2002 incidents. Existing jurisprudence, however, proscribes charging an accused for both crimes, rather, he may be charged only for either. As held in<i> People v. Pangilinan</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup><br><br><blockquote>[I]f the victim is 12 years or older, the offender should be charged with <b><u>either</u></b> sexual abuse under Section 5(b) of RA 7610 or rape under Article 266-A (except paragraph 1[d]) of the Revised Penal Code. However, <b><u>the offender cannot be accused of both crimes for the same act because his right against double jeopardy will be prejudiced</u></b>. A person cannot be subjected twice to criminal liability for a single criminal act. Likewise, rape cannot be complexed with a violation of Section 5(b) of RA 7610. Under Section 48 of the Revised Penal Code (on complex crimes), a felony under the Revised Penal Code (such as rape) cannot be complexed with an offense penalized by a special law. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>In this light, while the Court also finds that probable cause exists for the crime of Child Abuse against Gil for the same rape incidents of December 28, 2001 and April 23, 2002 in view of the substantial identity of its elements<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> with that of Rape, he cannot be charged for both. Records disclose that there are standing charges against Gil for Child Abuse in Criminal Case Nos. 03-551 and 03-549,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> respectively on account of the same occurrences. Thus, so as not to violate his right against double jeopardy, the Court finds it proper to dismiss the charges of Rape against Gil with respect to the December 28, 2001 and April 23, 2002 incidents considering the subsisting charges of Child Abuse as herein discussed.<br><br>Notably, Gil, as well as Atty. Reyna and Arturo, cannot be charged for Child Abuse with respect to the June 23 to November 9, 2003 incidents since Iris had ceased to be a minor by that time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> Likewise, Atty. Reyna and Arturo cannot be indicted for Child Abuse in connection with the December 28, 2001 and April 23, 2002 incidents as there appears to be no sufficient bases to support the DOJ Secretary’s finding of conspiracy.<br><br><b><i><u>Second</u></i></b>, the Court further holds that the DOJ Secretary gravely abused his discretion in finding that probable cause exists for the crime of Serious Illegal Detention.<br><br>The elements of the crime of Serious Illegal Detention under Article 267 of the RPC are: (<i>a</i>) that the offender is a private individual; (<i>b</i>) that he kidnaps or detains another, or in any manner deprives the latter of his liberty; (<i>c</i>) that the act of detention is illegal, not being ordered by any competent authority nor allowed by law; and (<i>d</i>) that any of the following circumstances is present: (1) that the detention lasts for more than five days; or (2) that it is committed by simulating public authority; or (3) that any serious physical injuries are inflicted upon the person kidnapped or threats to kill him shall have been made; or (4) that the person kidnapped or detained is a minor, female, or a public officer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup><br><br>Based on the Amended Resolution, the DOJ Secretary charges all the respondents for Serious Illegal Detention for the incidents of April 23 to 24, 2002 and June 23 until November 9, 2003. Related to this, records show that Iris retracted her previous testimony wherein she stated that she voluntarily went with Gil.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> She also stated that she was abducted on June 23, 2003 and brought to various places, such as Cagayan De Oro, Taytay and San Pedro, within a period of five (5) months.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup><br><br>Aside from Iris’s bare allegations, records are bereft of any evidence to support a finding that Iris was illegally detained or restrained of her movement. On the contrary, based on Pros. Lim’s Resolution dated November 8, 2004, several disinterested witnesses had testified to the fact that Iris was seen freely roaming in public with Gil,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> negating the quintessential element of deprivation of liberty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup><br><br>Towards the same end, the Court equally observes that the inherent inconsistencies in Iris’s statements are too dire to ignore even only at the prosecutor’s level. Anent the April 23, 2002 incidents, the Court finds it contrary to both reason and logic that Gil would stop-over at a McDonald’s restaurant, a place widely open to the public eye, in the process of kidnapping Iris. Similarly, with respect to the June 23, 2003 incidents, if Iris was indeed abducted and detained during that time, then it is highly incredible that she would be voluntarily let go by her captors in order to attend a <i>habeas corpus</i> hearing before justices of the CA.<br><br>It is well to note that while the Court had given substantial weight to Iris’s uncorroborated testimony to sustain the DOJ Secretary’s finding of probable cause for the crime of Rape, the same treatment cannot be applied to the crime of Serious Illegal Detention. Comparing the two, Rape is an offense of secrecy<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> which, more often than not, happens in a private setting involving only the accused and the victim; likewise, the degree of humiliation and disgrace befalling a rape victim who decides to come forward must be taken into consideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> For these reasons, the testimony of the latter, even if uncorroborated, can lead to a conviction. On the other hand, in Serious Illegal Detention, the victim is usually taken from one place and transferred to another – which is in fact what has been alleged in this case - making the commission of the offense susceptible to public view. Unfortunately, petitioners never presented any evidence to show that Iris was restrained of her liberty at any point in time during the period of her alleged captivity.<br><br>All told, given the clear absence of probable cause for the crime of Serious Illegal Detention, the Court finds that the DOJ Secretary gravely abused his discretion in charging respondents for the same.<br><br><b><i><u>Third</u></i></b>, the DOJ Secretary also committed grave abuse of discretion in finding probable cause for the crime of Forcible Abduction with Rape.<br><br>The elements of Forcible Abduction under Article 342 of the RPC are: (<i>a</i>) that the person abducted is any woman, regardless of her age or reputation; (<i>b</i>) that the abduction must be against her will; and (<i>c</i>) that the abduction must be with lewd designs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> As this crime is complexed with the crime of Rape pursuant to Article 48 of the RPC, the elements of the latter offense must also concur. Further, owing to its nature as a complex crime proper,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> the Forcible Abduction must be shown to be a necessary means for committing the crime of Rape.<br><br>As earlier discussed, there lies no evidence to prove that Iris was restrained of her liberty during the period of her captivity from June 23 to November 9, 2003 thus, denying the element of abduction. More importantly, even if it is assumed that there was some form of abduction, it has not been shown – nor even sufficiently alleged – that the taking was done with lewd designs. Lust or lewd design is an element that characterizes all crimes against chastity, apart from the felonious or criminal intent of the offender. As such, the said element must be always present in order that they may be so considered as a crime of chastity in contemplation of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup><br><br>Moreover, the Court observes that even if it is assumed that all of the elements of Forcible Abduction were present, it was not shown nor sufficiently alleged how the said abduction constituted a necessary means for committing the crime of Rape. As earlier discussed, records disclose that there lies probable.cause to indict Gil, Atty. Reyna and Arturo only for the component crime of Rape. In this accord, the charge of the complex crime of Forcible Abduction with Rape was improper and, hence, there was grave&nbsp; abuse of discretion.<br><br>In sum, the Court finds probable cause for Rape against Gil, Atty. Reyna and Arturo in connection with the June 23 to November 9, 2003 incidents.&nbsp; Consequently, the DOJ Secretary is ordered to direct the City State&nbsp; Prosecutor of Muntinlupa or any of its subordinates to file such charge.&nbsp; Meanwhile, the charges of Child Abuse against Gil in Criminal Case Nos. 03-551 and 03-549 are deemed to subsist. Aside from the foregoing, all other charges are hereby nullified on the ground of grave abuse of discretion. Accordingly, in order to conform with the pronouncements made herein, the DOJ Secretary is directed to drop (<i>a</i>) any subsisting charges against Jessebel and Grace in connection with this case; (<i>b</i>) the charge of Rape, in relation to Section 5(b), Article III of RA 7610, for the incidents of December 28, 2001 and April 23, 2002 against Gil, Atty.
