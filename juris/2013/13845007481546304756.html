Aichi Forging Company of Asia, Inc. (Aichi)</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> promulgated on October 6, 2010, that the two-year prescriptive period applies only to administrative claims and not to judicial claims.&nbsp; Morever, it was ruled that the 120-day and 30-day periods are not merely directory but <b>mandatory</b>.&nbsp; Accordingly, the judicial claim of <i>Aichi</i>, which was simultaneously filed with its administrative claim, was found to be premature.&nbsp; The Court held:<br><br><blockquote>In fact, applying the two-year period to judicial claims would render nugatory Section 112(D) [now Section 112 (C)] of the NIRC, which already provides for a specific period within which a taxpayer should appeal the decision or inaction of the CIR. <b>The second paragraph of Section 112(D) [now Section 112 (C)] of the NIRC envisions two scenarios: (1) when a decision is issued by the CIR before the lapse of the 120-day period; and (2) when no decision is made after the 120-day period. In both instances, the taxpayer has 30 days within which to file an appeal with the CTA.

Carpio, the Court ratiocinated as follows:<br><br><blockquote>There is no dispute that the 120-day period is mandatory and jurisdictional, and that the CTA does not acquire jurisdiction over a judicial claim that is filed before the expiration of the 120-day period.&nbsp; There are, however, two exceptions to this rule.&nbsp; The first exception is if the Commissioner, through a specific ruling, misleads a particular taxpayer to prematurely file a judicial claim with the CTA.&nbsp; Such specific ruling is applicable only to such particular taxpayer.&nbsp; The second exception is where the Commissioner, <i>through a general interpretative rule</i> issued under Section 4 of the Tax Code, misleads all taxpayers into filing prematurely judicial claims with the CTA. In these cases, the Commissioner cannot be allowed to later on question the CTA's assumption of jurisdiction over such claim since equitable estoppel has set in as expressly authorized under Section 246 of the Tax Code.<br><br>Section 4 of the Tax Code, a new provision introduced by RA 8424, expressly grants to the Commissioner the power to interpret tax laws, thus:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 4. Power of the Commissioner To Interpret Tax Laws and To Decide Tax Cases. – The power to interpret the provisions of this Code and other tax laws shall be under the exclusive and original jurisdiction of the Commissioner, subject to review by the Secretary of Finance.<br><br>The power to decide disputed assessments, refunds of internal revenue taxes, fees or other charges, penalties imposed in relation thereto, or other matters arising under this Code or other laws or portions thereof administered by the Bureau of Internal Revenue is vested in the Commissioner, subject to the exclusive appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Tax Appeals.</blockquote><br>Since the Commissioner has exclusive and original jurisdiction to interpret tax laws, taxpayers acting in good faith should not be made to suffer for adhering to general interpretative rules of the Commissioner interpreting tax laws, should such interpretation later turn out to be erroneous and be reversed by the Commissioner or this Court.&nbsp; Indeed, Section 246 of the Tax Code expressly provides that a reversal of a BIR regulation or ruling cannot adversely prejudice a taxpayer who in good faith relied on the BIR regulation or ruling prior to its reversal. x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></blockquote><br>BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 was classified in <i>San Roque</i> as a <b>general interpretative rule</b> having been made in response to a query by a government agency tasked with processing tax refunds and credits – the <b>One Stop Shop Inter-Agency Tax Credit and Drawback Center of the Department of Finance</b>.&nbsp; As such, <i>all</i> taxpayers can rely on said ruling from the time of its issuance on December 10, 2003 up to its reversal by this Court in <i>Aichi</i> on October 6, 2010, where it was held that the 120+30 day periods are mandatory and jurisdictional.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>Therefore, GST can benefit from BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 with respect to its claims for refund of unutilized excess input VAT for the second and third quarters of taxable year 2005 which were filed <b><i>before</i></b> the CIR on November 18, 2005 but elevated to the CTA on March 17, 2006 before the expiration of the 120-day period (March 18, 2006 being the 120<sup>th</sup> day).&nbsp; BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 effectively shielded the filing of GST's judicial claim from the vice of prematurity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>GST's claims, however, for the four quarters of taxable year 2004 and the first quarter of taxable year 2005 should be denied for <b>late filing</b> of the petition for review before the CTA. GST filed its VAT Return for the first quarter of 2004 on April 16, 2004. Reckoned from the close of the first taxable quarter of 2004 on March 31, 2004, the administrative claim filed on June 9, 2004 was well within the required two-year prescriptive period from the close of the taxable quarter, the last day of filing being March 31, 2006.&nbsp; The CIR then had 120 days from June 9, 2004, or until October 7, 2004, to decide the claim.&nbsp; Since the Commissioner did not act on the claim within the said period, GST had 30 days from October 7, 2004, or until November 6, 2004, to file its judicial claim.&nbsp; However, GST filed its petition for review before the CTA only on March 17, 2006, or <u>496</u> days <b><i>after</i></b> the last day of filing.&nbsp; In short, <b>GST was late by one year and 131 days in filing its judicial claim</b>.<br><br>For the second quarter of taxable year 2004, GST filed its administrative claim on August 12, 2004.&nbsp; The 120-day period from the filing of such claim ended on December 10, 2004, and the 30th day within which to file a judicial claim fell on January 9, 2005.&nbsp; However, GST filed its petition for review before the CTA only on March 17, 2006, or <u>432</u> days <b><i>after</i></b> the last day of filing.&nbsp; <b>GST was late by one year and 67 days in filing its judicial claim.</b><br><br>For the third and fourth quarters of taxable year 2004, GST filed its administrative claims on February 18, 2005.&nbsp; The 120<sup>th</sup> day, or June 18, 2005, lapsed without any action from the CIR.&nbsp; Thus, GST had 30 days therefrom, or until July 18, 2005, to file its judicial claim, but it did so only on March 17, 2006, or <u>242</u> days <b><i>after</i></b> the last day of filing.&nbsp; <b>GST was late by 242 days in filing its judicial claim.</b><br><br>Finally, for the first quarter of taxable year 2005, GST filed its administrative claim on May 11, 2005.&nbsp; The 120-day period ended on September 8, 2005, again with no action from the CIR.&nbsp;
