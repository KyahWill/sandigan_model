(Stronghold Insurance), a domestic insurance company, assails the decision promulgated on January 31, 2006,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> whereby the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 79145 affirmed the judgment rendered on April 28, 2003 by the Regional Trial Court in Parañaque City (RTC) holding Stronghold Insurance and respondent Manuel D. Marañon, Jr. jointly and solidarily liable for damages to respondents Tomas Cuenca, Marcelina Cuenca, Milagros Cuenca (collectively referred to as Cuencas), and Bramie Tayactac, upon the latter’s claims against the surety bond issued by Stronghold Insurance for the benefit of Marañon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br><center><b>Antecedents</b></center><br>On January 19, 1998, Marañon filed a complaint in the RTC against the Cuencas for the collection of a sum of money and damages. His complaint, docketed as Civil Case No. 98-023, included an application for the issuance of a writ of preliminary attachment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> On January 26, 1998, the RTC granted the application for the issuance of the writ of preliminary attachment conditioned upon the posting of a bond of P1,000,000.00 executed in favor of the Cuencas. Less than a month later, Marañon amended the complaint to implead Tayactac as a defendant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>On February 11, 1998, Marañon posted SICI Bond No. 68427 JCL (4) No. 02370 in the amount of P1,000,000.00 issued by Stronghold Insurance. Two days later, the RTC issued the writ of preliminary attachment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> The sheriff served the writ, the summons and a copy of the complaint on the Cuencas on the same day. The service of the writ, summons and copy of the complaint were made on Tayactac on February 16, 1998.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Enforcing the writ of preliminary attachment on February 16 and February 17, 1998, the sheriff levied upon the equipment, supplies, materials and various other personal property belonging to Arc Cuisine, Inc. that were found in the leased corporate office-cum-commissary or kitchen of the corporation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> On February 19, 1998, the sheriff submitted a report on his proceedings,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> and filed an <i>ex parte</i> motion seeking the transfer of the levied properties to a safe place.

In turn, the Cuencas and Tayactac filed their reply on May 5, 2000.<br><br>On May 25, 2000, Marañon filed his own comment/opposition to the<i> Motion to Require Sheriff to Deliver Attached Properties and to Set Case for Hearing</i> of the Cuencas and Tayactac, arguing that because the attached properties belonged to Arc Cuisine, Inc. 50% of the stockholding of which he and his relatives owned, it should follow that 50% of the value of the missing attached properties constituted liquidating dividends that should remain with and belong to him. Accordingly, he prayed that he should be required to return only P100,000.00 to the Cuencas and Tayactac.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>On June 5, 2000, the RTC commanded Marañon to surrender all the attached properties to the RTC through the sheriff within 10 days from notice; and directed the Cuencas and Tayactac to submit the affidavits of their witnesses in support of their claim for damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>On June 6, 2000, the Cuencas and Tayactac submitted their <i>Manifestation and Compliance</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br><center><b>Ruling of the RTC</b></center><br>After trial, the RTC rendered its judgment on April 28, 2003, holding Marañon and Stronghold Insurance jointly and solidarily liable for damages to the Cuencas and Tayactac,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, as the defendants were able to preponderantly prove their entitlement for damages by reason of the unlawful and wrongful issuance of the writ of attachment, MANUEL D.

Courts of law in our judicial system are not allowed to delve on academic issues or to render advisory opinions. They only resolve actual controversies, for that is what they are authorized to do by the Fundamental Law itself, which forthrightly ordains that the judicial power is wielded only to settle actual controversies involving rights that are legally demandable and enforceable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>To ensure the observance of the mandate of the Constitution, Section 2, Rule 3 of the <i>Rules of Court </i>requires that unless otherwise authorized by law or the <i>Rules of Court </i>every action must be prosecuted or defended in the name of the real party in interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Under the same rule, a real party in interest is one who stands to be benefited or injured by the judgment in the suit, or one who is entitled to the avails of the suit. Accordingly, a person , to be a real party in interest in whose name an action must be prosecuted, should appear to be the present real owner of the right sought to be enforced, that is, his interest must be a present substantial interest, not a mere expectancy, or a future, contingent, subordinate, or consequential interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Where the plaintiff is not the real party in interest, the ground for the motion to dismiss is lack of cause of action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> The reason for this is that the courts ought not to pass upon questions not derived from any actual controversy. Truly, a person having no material interest to protect cannot invoke the jurisdiction of the court as the plaintiff in an action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Nor does a court acquire jurisdiction over a case where the real party in interest is not present or impleaded.<br><br>The purposes of the requirement for the real party in interest prosecuting or defending an action at law are: (<i>a</i>) to prevent the prosecution of actions by persons without any right, title or interest in the case; (<i>b</i>) to require that the actual party entitled to legal relief be the one to prosecute the action; (<i>c</i>) to avoid a multiplicity of suits; and (<i>d</i>) to discourage litigation and keep it within certain bounds, pursuant to sound public policy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Indeed, considering that all civil actions must be based on a cause of action,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> defined as the act or omission by which a party <i>violates</i> the right of another,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> the former as the defendant must be allowed to insist upon being opposed by the real party in interest so that he is protected from further suits regarding the same claim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Under this rationale, the requirement benefits the defendant because “the defendant can insist upon a plaintiff who will afford him a setup providing good <i>res judicata </i>protection if the struggle is carried through on the merits to the end.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>The rule on real party in interest ensures, therefore, that the party with the legal right to sue brings the action, and this interest ends when a judgment involving the nominal plaintiff will protect the defendant from a subsequent identical action. Such a rule is intended to bring before the court the party rightfully interested in the litigation so that only real controversies will be presented and the judgment, when entered, will be binding and conclusive and the defendant will be saved from further harassment and vexation at the hands of other claimants to the same demand.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>But the real party in interest need not be the person who ultimately will benefit from the successful prosecution of the action. Hence, to aid itself in the proper identification of the real party in interest, the court should first ascertain the nature of the substantive right being asserted, and then must determine whether the party asserting that right is recognized as the real party in interest under the rules of procedure. Truly, that a party stands to gain from the litigation is not necessarily controlling.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>It is fundamental that the courts are established in order to afford reliefs to persons whose rights or property interests have been invaded or violated, or are threatened with invasion by others’ conduct or acts, and to give relief only at the instance of such persons. The jurisdiction of a court of law or equity may not be invoked by or for an individual whose rights have not been breached.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>The remedial right or the remedial obligation is the person’s interest in the controversy. The right of the plaintiff or other claimant is alleged to be violated by the defendant, who has the correlative obligation to respect the right of the former. Otherwise put, without the right, a person may not become a party plaintiff; without the obligation, a person may not be sued as a party defendant; without the violation, there may not be a suit. In such a situation, it is legally impossible for any person or entity to be both plaintiff and defendant in the same action, thereby ensuring that the controversy is actual and exists between adversary parties. Where there are no adversary parties before it, the court would be without jurisdiction to render a judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>There is no dispute that the properties subject to the levy on attachment belonged to Arc Cuisine, Inc. alone, not to the Cuencas and Tayactac in their own right. They were only stockholders of Arc Cuisine, Inc., which had a personality distinct and separate from that of any or all of them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> The damages occasioned to the properties by the levy on attachment, wrongful or not, prejudiced Arc Cuisine, Inc., not them. As such, only Arc Cuisine, Inc. had the right under the substantive law to claim and recover such damages. This right could not also be asserted by the Cuencas and Tayactac unless they did so in the name of the corporation itself. But that did not happen herein, because Arc Cuisine, Inc. was not even joined in the action either as an original party or as an intervenor.<br><br>The Cuencas and Tayactac were clearly not vested with any direct interest in the personal properties coming under the levy on attachment by virtue alone of their being stockholders in Arc Cuisine, Inc. Their stockholdings represented only their proportionate or aliquot interest in the properties of the corporation, but did not vest in them any legal right or title to any specific properties of the corporation. Without doubt, Arc Cuisine, Inc. remained the owner as a distinct legal person.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>Given the separate and distinct legal personality of Arc Cuisine, Inc., the Cuencas and Tayactac lacked the legal personality to claim the damages sustained from the levy of the former’s properties. According to <i>Asset Privatization Trust v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> even when the foreclosure on the assets of the corporation was wrongful and done in bad faith the stockholders had no standing to recover for themselves moral damages; otherwise, they would be appropriating and distributing part of the corporation’s assets prior to the dissolution of the corporation and the liquidation of its debts and liabilities. Moreover, in <i>Evangelista v. Santos</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> the Court, resolving whether or not the minority stockholders had the right to bring an action for damages against the principal officers of the corporation for their own benefit, said:<br><br><blockquote>As to the second question, the complaint shows that the action is for damages resulting from mismanagement of the affairs and assets of the corporation by its principal officer, it being alleged that defendant’s maladministration has brought about the ruin of the corporation and the consequent loss of value of its stocks. <b>The injury complained of is thus primarily to the corporation, so that the suit for the damages claimed should be by the corporation rather than by the stockholders</b> (3 Fletcher, Cyclopedia of Corporation pp. 977-980). <b>The stockholders may not directly claim those damages for themselves</b> for that would result in the appropriation by, and the distribution among them of part of the corporate assets before the dissolution of the corporation and the liquidation of its debts and liabilities, something which cannot be legally done in view of section 16 of the Corporation Law, which provides:<br><br><blockquote>No shall corporation shall make or declare any stock or bond dividend or any dividend whatsoever except from the surplus profits arising from its business, or divide or distribute its capital stock or property other than actual profits among its members or stockholders until after the payment of its debts and the termination of its existence by limitation or lawful dissolution.<br><br>x x x x</blockquote><br>In the present case, <b>the plaintiff stockholders have brought the action not for the benefit of the corporation but for their own benefit</b>, since they ask that the defendant make good the losses occasioned by his mismanagement and pay to them the value of their respective participation in the corporate assets on the basis of their respective holdings. <b>Clearly, this cannot be done until all corporate debts, if there be any, are paid and the existence of the corporation terminated by the limitation of its charter or by lawful dissolution in view of the provisions of section 16 of the Corporation Law</b>. (Emphasis ours)<br><br>It results that plaintiff’s complaint shows no cause of action in their favor so that the lower court did not err in dismissing the complaint on that ground.<br><br>While plaintiffs ask for remedy to which they are not entitled unless the requirement of section 16 of the Corporation Law be first complied with, we note that the action stated in their complaint is susceptible of being converted into a derivative suit for the benefit of the corporation by a mere change in the prayer. Such amendment, however, is not possible now, since the complaint has been filed in the wrong court, so that the same has to be dismissed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br></blockquote><br>That Marañon knew that Arc Cuisine, Inc. owned the properties levied on attachment but he still excluded Arc Cuisine, Inc. from his complaint was of no consequence now. The Cuencas and Tayactac still had no right of action even if the affected properties were then under their custody at the time of the attachment, considering that their custody was only incidental to the operation of the corporation.<br><br>It is true, too, that the Cuencas and Tayactac could bring in behalf of Arc Cuisine, Inc. a proper action to recover damages resulting from the attachment. Such action would be one directly brought in the name of the corporation.
