				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This Appeal seeks the reversal and setting aside of the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated 26 July 2010 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR.-H.C. No. 03043, which affirmed the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Caloocan City, Branch 129 convicting appellant Ninoy Rosales y Esto of the crime of rape.<br><br>Appellant was charged with rape in an Information,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> the accusatory portion of which reads as follows:<br><br><blockquote>That on or about the 27<sup>th</sup> day of June, 2004, in Caloocan City, Metro Manila and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, having knowledge that [AAA],<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> 39 years old, is mentally retarded and has the mind of child below 18 years old, taking advantage of the victim’s mental disability, wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously had sexual intercourse with said [AAA].</blockquote><br>Appellant pleaded not guilty on arraignment.&nbsp; Trial on the merits ensued.<br><br>The victim, AAA, then 39 years of age, testified that in the morning of 27 June 2004, while she was holding a dog outside her residence in X X X,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Quezon City, appellant approached her and gave her P200.00 to buy some junk food.&nbsp; Appellant then forced her to go with him to his house located inside a nearby cemetery in Caloocan City.&nbsp; Upon reaching appellant’s house, appellant ordered AAA to lie down.&nbsp; He undressed her, sucked her nipple and inserted his penis in her vagina.&nbsp; AAA felt pain.&nbsp; Thereafter, appellant ordered her to put her dress on and took her cellular phone.&nbsp; Appellant sold AAA’s phone and bought drinks for his drinking companions.&nbsp; AAA was later fetched by her sister at appellant’s house.&nbsp; AAA identified appellant in court as the person who raped her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>On 28 June 2004, BBB<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> accompanied her daughter AAA to the Women and Children Protection Desk of the Caloocan City Police Station to report the incident.<br><br>The police investigator immediately prepared a request so that AAA could be physically examined by a medico-legal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> After the medical examination, Medico-Legal Report No. M-366-04 was issued by Dr. Filemon C. Porciuncula, Jr.&nbsp; The Report contains the following pertinent findings and conclusion:<br><br><blockquote>GENITAL:<br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">PUBIC HAIR: Abundant<br>LABIA MAJORA: Full, convex &amp; coapted<br>LABIA MINORA: With dark brown, hypertrophied. Labia minora congested &amp; abraded on both sides.<br>HYMEN: Deep healed lacerations at 3&amp;7 o’clock position.<br>POSTERIOR FOURCHETTE: Abraded, congested<br>EXTERNAL VAGINAL ORIFICE: Slight resistance of the examining index finger.<br>VAGINAL CANAL: Narrow with prominent rugosities.<br>CERVIX: Firm &amp; closed.<br></div><br>PERIURETHRAL AND VAGINAL SMEARS: Negative for spermatozoa &amp; negative for gram negative diplococci.<br><br>CONCLUSION: Subject is non-virgin state physically.&nbsp; There are no external signs of application of any form of trauma.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></blockquote><br>Dr. Lorenda Gozar (Dr. Gozar), a clerical psychologist working with the National Bureau of Investigaton, testified on AAA’s mental condition.&nbsp; Dr. Gozar had examined AAA and concluded in her Neuro-Psychiatric Examination and Evaluation that AAA has been found suffering from “moderate mental retardation with a Mental Age of (6) six years and (8) eight months and an IQ of (41) forty-one.” <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Appellant, testifying in his own behalf, denied that he raped AAA.&nbsp; He however admitted that he was having a drinking session in his house with AAA when the alleged rape incident occurred.&nbsp; Appellant stated that prior to the incident, AAA has lived in his house for 4 months.&nbsp; He then denied any knowledge of AAA’s mental condition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>On 19 September 2007, the RTC rendered judgment finding appellant guilty of rape and imposing the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.&nbsp; The RTC also ordered appellant to pay P50,000.00 as civil indemnity, and P50,000.00 as moral damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>The&nbsp; trial&nbsp; court&nbsp; found AAA’s testimony straightforward, notwithstanding her mental condition.&nbsp; The trial court also dismissed appellant’s alibi as weak and unreliable.<br><br>On 26 September 2007, appellant filed a notice of appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>On 26 July 2010, the Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the trial court.&nbsp; Consequently, appellant filed a notice of appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>On 10 August 2011, this Court informed the parties that it had received the records from the Court of Appeals and required them to file their respective supplemental briefs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Both parties manifested that they would no longer file supplemental briefs, since they had exhaustively argued all the relevant issues in the Briefs they had previously submitted before the Court of Appeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>The case is now before us.&nbsp; Appellant assigned two (2) errors in his appeal which were initially passed upon by the Court of Appeals, to wit: 1) whether the trial court gravely erred in considering the evidence adduced by the prosecution despite its apparent incredibility; and 2) whether the trial court gravely erred in rendering a verdict of conviction despite the fact that the guilt of the accused-appellant was not proven beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Appellant contends that AAA’s testimony is incredible on the lone argument that the latter did not make an outcry when the alleged lustful advances were made against her.<br><br>In <i>People v. Alipio</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> the Court rebuked appellant therein for raising a similar argument.&nbsp; The Court went on to state that it is not fair to judge a mentally-retarded person, one who does not have a good grasp of information and who lacks the capacity to make a mental calculation of the events unfolding before her eyes, according to what is natural or unnatural for normal persons.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>In this case where the victim was proven to be a mental retardate, it could certainly not be expected that AAA would have behaved or acted in accordance with what appellant perceived to be as normal.<br><br>At any rate, it is an oft-repeated principle that not every witness to or victim of a crime can be expected to act reasonably and conformably to the usual expectations of everyone.&nbsp; People may react differently to the same situation.&nbsp; One person's spontaneous, or unthinking or even instinctive, response to a horrible and repulsive stimulus may be aggression, while another's may be cold indifference.&nbsp; Yet, it can never be successfully argued that the latter are any less sexual victims than the former.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Moreover, when AAA was called to the witness stand, she never wavered in her assertion that appellant raped her. AAA’s testimony is clear and concise, thus:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div

the credibility of her testimony.&nbsp; Mental retardation <i>per se </i>does not affect credibility.&nbsp; A one mentally retarded may be a credible witness.&nbsp; The acceptance of her testimony depends on the quality of her perceptions and the manner she can make them known to the court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>We have thoroughly examined AAA’s testimony and found no reason to depart from the legal adage that this Court accords the trial judge’s assessment of the credibility of witnesses great respect in the absence of any attendant of grave abuse of discretion on the account that the trial court had the advantage of actually examining both real and testimonial pieces of evidence, including the demeanor of the witnesses, and is in the best position to rule on the matter.&nbsp; The rule finds an even greater application when the trial court’s findings are sustained by the Court of Appeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0,

, by proof beyond reasonable doubt, was raped by the appellant.<br><br>Appellant’s denials and alibi cannot prevail over the positive, consistent and straightforward testimony of AAA.&nbsp; Alibi is an inherently weak defense because it is easy to fabricate and highly unreliable.&nbsp; To merit approbation, the accused must adduce clear and convincing evidence that he was in a place other than the <i>situs criminis </i>at the time the crime was committed, such that it was physically impossible for him to have been at the scene of the crime when it was committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255,

alibi cannot be given any weight or value.<br><br>The lower courts, in vague terms, found appellant guilty of rape and imposed the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua.</i>&nbsp; It is very clear from the Information that the allegations therein actually constitute a criminal charge for qualified rape under Article 266-A, paragraph (1)(a), in relation to Section 266-B, paragraph (10) of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, which provide:<br><br><blockquote>ART. 266-A.&nbsp; Rape; When and How Committed. –&nbsp; Rape is committed:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">1) By a man who shall have
