Originally, the principal shareholders and corporate directors of the bank were Eduardo M. Agustin, Jr. (Agustin) and Peregrin de Guzman, Jr. (De Guzman).<br><br>In June 2001, SME Bank experienced financial difficulties. To remedy the situation, the bank officials proposed its sale to Abelardo Samson (Samson).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Accordingly, negotiations ensued, and a formal offer was made to Samson. Through his attorney-in-fact, Tomas S. Gomez IV, Samson then sent formal letters (Letter Agreements) to Agustin and De Guzman, demanding the following as preconditions for the sale of SME Bank’s shares of stock:<br><blockquote><ol start="4"><li>You shall guarantee the peaceful turn over of all assets as well as the peaceful transition of management of the bank and shall terminate/retire the employees we mutually agree upon, upon transfer of shares in favor of our group’s nominees;<br></li></ol>x x x x<br><ol start="7"><li>All retirement benefits, if any of the above officers/stockholders/board of directors are hereby waived upon cosummation [sic] of the above sale.

Spouses Samson then became the principal shareholders of SME Bank, while Aurelio Villaflor, Jr. was appointed bank president. As it turned out, respondent employees, except for Simeon, Jr.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> were not rehired. After a month in service, Simeon, Jr. again resigned on October 2001.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Respondent-employees demanded the payment of their respective separation pays, but their requests were denied.<br><br>Aggrieved by the loss of their jobs, respondent employees filed a Complaint before the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC)– Regional Arbitration Branch No. III and sued SME Bank, spouses Abelardo and Olga Samson and Aurelio Villaflor (the Samson Group) for unfair labor practice; illegal dismissal; illegal deductions; underpayment; and nonpayment of allowances, separation pay and 13<sup>th</sup> month pay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Subsequently, they amended their Complaint to include Agustin and De Guzman as respondents to the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>On 27 October 2004, the labor arbiter ruled that the buyer of an enterprise is not bound to absorb its employees, unless there is an express stipulation to the contrary. However, he also found that respondent employees were illegally dismissed, because they had involuntarily executed their resignation letters after relying on representations that they would be given their separation benefits and rehired by the new management. Accordingly, the labor arbiter decided the case against Agustin and De Guzman, but dismissed the Complaint against the Samson Group, as follows:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered ordering respondents Eduardo Agustin, Jr. and Peregrin De Guzman to pay complainants’ separation pay in the total amount of <b><i>P339,403.00</i></b> detailed as follows:<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td width="20%"><em><strong>Elicerio B.

Respondent employees questioned the labor arbiter’s failure to award backwages, while Agustin and De Guzman contended that they should not be held liable for the payment of the employees’ claims.<br><br>The NLRC found that there was only a mere transfer of shares – and therefore, a mere change of management – from Agustin and De Guzman to the Samson Group. As the change of management was not a valid ground to terminate respondent bank employees, the NLRC ruled that they had indeed been illegally dismissed. It further ruled that Agustin, De Guzman and the Samson Group should be held jointly and severally liable for the employees’ separation pay and backwages, as follows:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the Decision appealed from is hereby <b>MODIFIED</b>. Respondents are hereby Ordered to jointly and severally pay the complainants backwages from 11 September 2001 until the finality of this Decision, separation pay at one month pay for every year of service, P10,000.00 and P5,000.00 moral and exemplary damages, and five (5%) percent attorney’s fees.<br><br>Other dispositions are <b>AFFIRMED</b> <br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br></blockquote>On 28 November 2006, the NLRC denied the Motions for Reconsideration filed by Agustin, De Guzman and the Samson Group.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Agustin and De Guzman filed a Rule 65 Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> with the CA, docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 97510. The Samson Group likewise filed a separate Rule 65 Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> with the CA, docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 97942. Motions to consolidate both cases were not acted upon by the appellate court.<br><br>On 13 March 2008, the CA rendered a Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 97510 affirming that of the NLRC. The <i>fallo</i> of the CA Decision reads:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of the foregoing, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>. Accordingly, the Decision dated May 8, 2006, and Resolution dated November 28, 2006 of the National Labor Relations Commission in NLRC NCR CA No. 043236-05 (NLRC RAB III-07-4542-02) are hereby <b>AFFIRMED</b>.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br></blockquote>Subsequently, CA-G.R. SP No. 97942 was disposed of by the appellate court in a Decision dated 15 January 2008, which likewise affirmed that of the NLRC. The dispositive portion of the CA Decision states:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the instant Petition for Certiorari is denied, and the herein assailed May 8, 2006 Decision and November 28, 2006 Resolution of the NLRC are hereby <b>AFFIRMED</b>.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br></blockquote>The appellate court denied the Motions for Reconsideration filed by the parties in Resolutions dated 1 September 2008<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> and 19 February 2009.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>The Samson Group then filed two separate Rule 45 Petitions questioning the CA Decisions and Resolutions in CA-G.R. SP No. 97510 and CA-G.R. SP No. 97942. On 17 June 2009, this Court resolved to consolidate both Petitions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br><center><b>THE ISSUES</b><br></center><br>Succinctly, the parties are asking this Court to determine whether respondent employees were illegally dismissed and, if so, which of the parties are liable for the claims of the employees and the extent of the reliefs that may be awarded to these employees.<br><br><center><b>THE COURT’S RULING</b><br></center><br>The instant Petitions are partly meritorious.<br><br><center><b>I<br>Respondent employees were illegally dismissed.</b><br></center><br><b><i>As to Elicerio Gaspar, Ricardo Gaspar, Jr., Fidel Espiritu, Eufemia Rosete and Liberato Mangoba&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </i></b><br><br>The Samson Group contends that Elicerio, Ricardo, Fidel, and Liberato voluntarily resigned from their posts, while Eufemia retired from her position. As their resignations and retirements were voluntary, they were not dismissed from their employment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> In support of this argument, it presented copies of their resignation and retirement letters,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> which were couched in terms of gratitude.<br><br>We disagree. While resignation letters containing words of gratitude may indicate that the employees were not coerced into resignation,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> this fact alone is not conclusive proof that they intelligently, freely and voluntarily resigned. To rule that resignation letters couched in terms of gratitude are, by themselves, conclusive proof that the employees intended to relinquish their posts would open the floodgates to possible abuse. In order to withstand the test of validity, resignations must be made voluntarily and with the intention of relinquishing the office, coupled with an act of relinquishment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Therefore, in order to determine whether the employees truly intended to resign from their respective posts, we cannot merely rely on the tenor of the resignation letters, but must take into consideration the totality of circumstances in each particular case.<br><br>Here, the records show that Elicerio, Ricardo, Fidel, and Liberato only tendered resignation letters because they were led to believe that, upon reapplication, they would be reemployed by the new management.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> As it turned out, except for Simeon, Jr., they were not rehired by the new management. Their reliance on the representation that they would be reemployed gives credence to their argument that they merely submitted courtesy resignation letters because it was demanded of them, and that they had no real intention of leaving their posts. We therefore conclude that Elicerio, Ricardo, Fidel, and Liberato did not voluntarily resign from their work; rather, they were terminated from their employment.<br><br>As to Eufemia, both the CA and the NLRC discussed her case together with the cases of the rest of respondent-employees. However, a review of the records shows that, unlike her co-employees, she did not resign; rather, she submitted a letter indicating that she was retiring from her former position.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>The fact that Eufemia retired and did not resign, however, does not change our conclusion that illegal dismissal took place.<br><br>Retirement, like resignation, should be an act completely voluntary on the part of the employee. If the intent to retire is not clearly established or if the retirement is involuntary, it is to be treated as a discharge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>In this case, the facts show that Eufemia’s retirement was not of her own volition. The circumstances could not be more telling. The facts show that Eufemia was likewise given the option to resign or retire in order to fulfill the precondition in the Letter Agreements that the seller should “terminate/retire the employees [mutually agreed upon] upon transfer of shares” to the buyers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Thus, like her other co-employees, she first submitted a letter of resignation dated 27 August 2001.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> For one reason or another, instead of resigning, she chose to retire and submitted a retirement letter to that effect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> It was this letter that was subsequently transmitted to the representative of the Samson Group on 11 September 2001.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>In <i>San Miguel Corporation v. NLRC</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> we have explained that involuntary retirement is tantamount to dismissal, as employees can only choose the means and methods of terminating their employment, but are powerless as to the status of their employment and have no choice but to leave the company. This rule squarely applies to Eufemia’s case. Indeed, she could only choose between resignation and retirement, but was made to understand that she had no choice but to leave SME Bank. Thus, we conclude that, similar to her other co-employees, she was illegally dismissed from employment.<br><br>The Samson Group further argues<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> that, assuming the employees were dismissed, the dismissal is legal because cessation of operations due to serious business losses is one of the authorized causes of termination under Article 283 of the Labor Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>Again, we disagree.<br><br>The law permits an employer to dismiss its employees in the event of closure of the business establishment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> However, the employer is required to serve written notices on the worker and the Department of Labor at least one month before the intended date of closure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Moreover, the dismissed employees are entitled to separation pay, except if the closure was due to serious business losses or financial reverses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> However, to be exempt from making such payment, the employer must justify the closure by presenting convincing evidence that it actually suffered serious financial reverses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>In this case, the records do not support the contention of SME Bank that it intended to close the business establishment. On the contrary, the intention of the parties to keep it in operation is confirmed by the provisions of the Letter Agreements requiring Agustin and De Guzman to guarantee the “peaceful transition of management of the bank” and to appoint “a manager of [the Samson Group’s] choice x x x to oversee bank operations.”<br><br>Even assuming that the parties intended to close the bank, the records do not show that the employees and the Department of Labor were given written notices at least one month before the dismissal took place. Moreover, aside from their bare assertions, the parties failed to substantiate their claim that SME Bank was suffering from serious financial reverses.<br><br>In fine, the argument that the dismissal was due to an authorized cause holds no water.<br><br>Petitioner bank also argues that, there being a transfer of the business establishment, the innocent transferees no longer have any obligation to continue employing respondent employees,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> and that the most that they can do is to give preference to the qualified separated employees; hence, the employees were validly dismissed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>The argument is misleading and unmeritorious. Contrary to petitioner bank’s argument, <b>there was no transfer of the business establishment to speak of, but merely a change in the new majority shareholders of the corporation.</b><br><br>There are two types of corporate acquisitions: asset sales and stock sales.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> In asset sales, the corporate entity<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> sells all or substantially all of its assets<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> to another entity. In stock sales, the individual or corporate shareholders<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> sell a controlling block of stock<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> to new or existing shareholders.<br><br>In asset sales, the rule is that the seller in good faith is authorized to dismiss the affected employees, but is liable for the payment of separation pay under the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> The buyer in good faith, on the other hand, is not obliged to absorb the employees affected by the sale, nor is it liable for the payment of their claims.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> The most that it may do, for reasons of public policy and social justice, is to give preference to the qualified separated personnel of the selling firm.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>In contrast with asset sales, in which the assets of the selling corporation are transferred to another entity, the transaction in stock sales takes place at the shareholder level. Because the corporation possesses a personality separate and distinct from that of its shareholders, a shift in the composition of its shareholders will not affect its existence and continuity. Thus, notwithstanding the stock sale, the corporation continues to be the employer of its people and continues to be liable for the payment of their just claims. Furthermore, the corporation or its new majority shareholders are not entitled to lawfully dismiss corporate employees absent a just or authorized cause.<br><br>In the case at bar, the Letter Agreements show that their main object is the acquisition by the Samson Group of 86.365% of the shares of stock of SME Bank.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> Hence, this case involves a stock sale, whereby the transferee acquires the controlling shares of stock of the corporation. Thus, following the rule in stock sales, respondent employees may not be dismissed except for just or authorized causes under the Labor Code.<br><br>Petitioner bank argues that, following our ruling in <i>Manlimos v. NLRC</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> even in cases of stock sales, the new owners are under no legal duty to absorb the seller’s employees, and that the most that the new owners may do is to give preference to the qualified separated employees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> Thus, petitioner bank argues that the dismissal was lawful.<br><br>We are not persuaded.<br><br><i>Manlimos</i> dealt with a stock sale in which a new owner or management group acquired complete ownership of the corporation at the shareholder level.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> The employees of the corporation were later “considered terminated, with their conformity”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> by the new majority shareholders. The employees then re-applied for their jobs and were rehired on a probationary basis. After about six months, the new management dismissed two of the employees for having abandoned their work, and it dismissed the rest for committing “acts prejudicial to the interest of the new management.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br>Thereafter, the employees sought reinstatement, arguing that their dismissal was illegal, since they “remained regular employees of the corporation regardless of the change of management.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>In disposing of the merits of the case, we upheld the validity of the second termination, ruling that “the parties are free to renew the contract or not [upon the expiration of the period provided for in their probationary contract of employment].”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> Citing our pronouncements in <i>Central Azucarera del Danao v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> <i>San Felipe Neri School of Mandaluyong, Inc. v. NLRC</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> and <i>MDII Supervisors &amp; Confidential Employees Association v. Presidential Assistant on Legal Affairs</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> we likewise upheld the validity of the employees’ first separation from employment, pronouncing as follows:<br><blockquote>A change of ownership in a business concern is not proscribed by law. In <i>Central Azucarera del Danao vs. Court of Appeals</i>, this Court stated:<br><blockquote>There can be no controversy for it is a principle well- recognized, that it is within the employer’s legitimate sphere of management control of the business to adopt economic policies or make some changes or adjustments in their organization or operations that would insure profit to itself or protect the investment of its stockholders. As in the exercise of such management prerogative, the employer may merge or consolidate its business with another, or sell or dispose all or substantially all of its assets and properties which may bring about the dismissal or termination of its employees in the process. Such dismissal or termination should not however be interpreted in such a manner as to permit the employer to escape payment of termination pay. For such a situation is not envisioned in the law. It strikes at the very concept of social justice.<br><br>In a number of cases on this point, the rule has been laid down that the sale or disposition must be motivated by good faith as an element of exemption from liability. Indeed, an innocent transferee of a business establishment has no liability to the employees of the transfer or to continue employer them. Nor is the transferee liable for past unfair labor practices of the previous owner, except, when the liability therefor is assumed by the new employer under the contract of sale, or when liability arises because of the new owner’s participation in thwarting or defeating the rights of the employees.<br></blockquote>Where such transfer of ownership is in good faith, the transferee is under no legal duty to absorb the transferor’s employees as there is no law compelling such absorption. The most that the transferee may do, for reasons of public policy and social justice, is to give preference to the qualified separated employees in the filling of vacancies in the facilities of the purchaser.<br><br>Since the petitioners were effectively separated from work due to a <i>bona fide</i> change of ownership and they were accordingly paid their separation pay, which they freely and voluntarily accepted, the private respondent corporation was under no obligation to employ them; it may, however, give them preference in the hiring. x x x. (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>We take this opportunity to revisit our ruling in <i>Manlimos</i> insofar as it applied a doctrine on asset sales to a stock sale case. <i>Central Azucarera del Danao, San Felipe Neri School of Mandaluyong and MDII Supervisors &amp; Confidential Employees Association</i> all dealt with asset sales, as they involved a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation. The transactions in those cases were not made at the shareholder level, but at the corporate level. Thus, applicable to those cases were the rules in asset sales: the employees may be separated from their employment, but the seller is liable for the payment of separation pay; on the other hand, the buyer in good faith is not required to retain the affected employees in its service, nor is it liable for the payment of their claims.<br><br>The rule should be different in <i>Manlimos</i>, as this case involves a stock sale. It is error to even discuss transfer of ownership of the business, as the business did not actually change hands. The transfer only involved a change in the equity composition of the corporation. To reiterate, <b>the employees are not transferred to a new employer, but remain with the original corporate employer, notwithstanding an equity shift in its majority shareholders</b>. This being so, the employment status of the employees should not have been affected by the stock sale. A change in the equity composition of the corporate shareholders should not result in the automatic termination of the employment of the corporation’s employees. Neither should it give the new majority shareholders the right to legally dismiss the corporation’s employees, absent a just or authorized cause.<br><br>The right to security of tenure guarantees the right of employees to continue in their employment absent a just or authorized cause for termination. This guarantee proscribes a situation in which the corporation procures the severance of the employment of its employees – who patently still desire to work for the corporation – only because new majority stockholders and a new management have come into the picture. This situation is a clear circumvention of the employees’ constitutionally guaranteed right to security of tenure, an act that cannot be countenanced by this Court.<br><br>It is thus erroneous on the part of the corporation to consider the employees as terminated from their employment when the sole reason for so doing is a change of management by reason of the stock sale. The conformity of the employees to the corporation’s act of considering them as terminated and their subsequent acceptance of separation pay does not remove the taint of illegal dismissal. Acceptance of separation pay does not bar the employees from subsequently contesting the legality of their dismissal, nor does it estop them from challenging the legality of their separation from the service.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br><br>We therefore see it fit to expressly reverse our ruling in <i>Manlimos</i> insofar as it upheld that, in a stock sale, the buyer in good faith has no obligation to retain the employees of the selling corporation; and that the dismissal of the affected employees is lawful, even absent a just or authorized cause.<br><br><b><i>As to Simeon Espiritu, Jr.</i></b><br><br>The CA and the NLRC discussed the case of Simeon, Jr. together with that of the rest of respondent-employees. However, a review of the records shows that the conditions leading to his dismissal from employment are different. We thus discuss his circumstance separately.<br><br>The Samson Group contends that Simeon, Jr., likewise voluntarily resigned from his post.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> According to them, he had resigned from SME Bank before the share transfer took place.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> Upon the change of ownership of the shares and the management of the company, Simeon, Jr. submitted a letter of application to and was rehired by the new management.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> However, the Samson Group alleged that for purely personal reasons, he again resigned from his employment on 15 October 2001.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br>Simeon, Jr., on the other hand, contends that while he was reappointed by the new management after his letter of application was transmitted, he was not given a clear position, his benefits were reduced, and he suffered a demotion in rank.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> These allegations were not refuted by the Samson Group.<br><br>We hold that Simeon, Jr. was likewise illegally dismissed from his employment.<br><br>Similar to our earlier discussion, we find that his first courtesy resignation letter was also executed involuntarily. Thus, it cannot be the basis of a valid resignation; and thus, at that point, he was illegally terminated from his employment. He was, however, rehired by SME Bank under new management, although based on his allegations, he was not reinstated to his former position or to a substantially equivalent one.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> Rather, he even suffered a reduction in benefits and a demotion in rank.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> These led to his submission of another resignation letter effective 15 October 2001.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup><br><br>We rule that these circumstances show that Simeon, Jr. was constructively dismissed. In <i>Peñaflor v. Outdoor Clothing Manufacturing Corporation</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> we have defined constructive dismissal as follows:<br><blockquote>Constructive dismissal is an involuntary resignation by the employee due to the harsh, hostile, and unfavorable conditions set by the employer and which arises when a clear discrimination, insensibility, or disdain by an employer exists and has become unbearable to the employee.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup><br></blockquote>Constructive dismissal exists where there is cessation of work, because “continued employment is rendered impossible, unreasonable or unlikely, as an offer involving a demotion in rank or a diminution in pay” and other benefits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup><br><br>These circumstances are clearly availing in Simeon, Jr.’s case. He was made to resign, then rehired under conditions that were substantially less than what he was enjoying before the illegal termination occurred. Thus, for the second time, he involuntarily resigned from his employment. Clearly, this case is illustrative of constructive dismissal, an act prohibited under our labor laws.<br><br><center><b>II<br>SME Bank, Eduardo M. Agustin, Jr. and Peregrin de Guzman, Jr. are liable for illegal dismissal.</b><br></center><br>Having ruled on the illegality of the dismissal, we now discuss the issue of liability and determine who among the parties are liable for the claims of the illegally dismissed employees.<br><br>The settled rule is that an employer who terminates the employment of its employees without lawful cause or due process of law is liable for illegal dismissal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup><br><br>None of the parties dispute that SME Bank was the employer of respondent employees. The fact that there was a change in the composition of its shareholders did not affect the employer-employee relationship between the employees and the corporation, because an equity transfer affects neither the existence nor the liabilities of a corporation. Thus, SME Bank continued to be the employer of respondent employees notwithstanding the equity change in the corporation. This outcome is in line with the rule that a corporation has a personality separate and distinct from that of its individual shareholders or members, such that a change in the composition of its shareholders or members would not affect its corporate liabilities.<br><br>Therefore, we conclude that, as the employer of the illegally dismissed employees before and after the equity transfer, petitioner SME Bank is liable for the satisfaction of their claims.<br><br>Turning now to the liability of Agustin, De Guzman and the Samson Group for illegal dismissal, at the outset we point out that there is no privity of employment contracts between Agustin, De Guzman and the Samson Group, on the one hand, and respondent employees on the other. Rather, the employment contracts were between SME Bank and the employees. However, this fact does not mean that Agustin, De Guzman and the Samson Group may not be held liable for illegal dismissal as corporate directors or officers. In <i>Bogo-Medellin Sugarcane Planters Association, Inc. v. NLRC</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> we laid down the rule as regards the liability of corporate directors and officers in illegal dismissal cases, as follows:<br><blockquote>Unless they have exceeded their authority, corporate officers are, as a general rule, not personally liable for their official acts, because a corporation, by legal fiction, has a personality separate and distinct from its officers, stockholders and members. However, this fictional veil may be pierced whenever the corporate personality is used as a means of perpetuating a fraud or an illegal act, evading an existing obligation, or confusing a legitimate issue. In cases of illegal dismissal, corporate directors and officers are solidarily liable with the corporation, where terminations of employment are done with malice or in bad faith.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Thus, in order to determine the respective liabilities of Agustin, De Guzman and the Samson Group under the afore-quoted rule, we must determine, <i>first</i>, whether they may be considered as corporate directors or officers; and, <i>second</i>, whether the terminations were done maliciously or in bad faith.<br><br>There is no question that both Agustin and De Guzman were corporate directors of SME Bank. An analysis of the facts likewise reveals that the dismissal of the employees was done in bad faith. Motivated by their desire to dispose of their shares of stock to Samson, they agreed to and later implemented the precondition in the Letter Agreements as to the termination or retirement of SME Bank’s employees. However, instead of going through the proper procedure, the bank manager induced respondent employees to resign or retire from their respective employments, while promising that they would be rehired by the new management. Fully relying on that promise, they tendered courtesy resignations or retirements and eventually found themselves jobless. Clearly, this sequence of events constituted a gross circumvention of our labor laws and a violation of the employees’ constitutionally guaranteed right to security of tenure. We therefore rule that, as Agustin and De Guzman are corporate directors who have acted in bad faith, they may be held solidarily liable with SME Bank for the satisfaction of the employees’ lawful claims.<br><br>As to spouses Samson, we find that nowhere in the records does it appear that they were either corporate directors or officers of SME Bank at the time the illegal termination occurred, except that the Samson Group had already taken over as new management when Simeon, Jr. was constructively dismissed. Not being corporate directors or officers, spouses Samson were not in legal control of the bank and consequently had no power to dismiss its employees.<br><br>Respondent employees argue that the Samson Group had already taken over and conducted an inventory before the execution of the share purchase agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> Agustin and De Guzman likewise argued that it was at Olga Samson’s behest that the employees were required to resign from their posts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> Even if this statement were true, it cannot amount to a finding that spouses Samson should be treated as corporate directors or officers of SME Bank. The records show that it was Espiritu who asked the employees to tender their resignation and or retirement letters, and that these letters were actually tendered to him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> He then transmitted these letters to the representative of the Samson Group.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> That the spouses Samson had to ask Espiritu to require the employees to resign shows that they were not in control of the corporation, and that the former shareholders – through Espiritu – were still in charge thereof. As the spouses Samson were neither corporate officers nor directors at the time the illegal dismissal took place, we find that there is no legal basis in the present case to hold them in their personal capacities solidarily liable with SME Bank for illegally dismissing respondent employees, without prejudice to any liabilities that may have attached under other provisions of law.<br><br>Furthermore, even if spouses Samson were already in control of the corporation at the time that Simeon, Jr. was constructively dismissed, we refuse to pierce the corporate veil and find them liable in their individual steads. There is no showing that his constructive dismissal amounted to more than a corporate act by SME Bank, or that spouses Samson acted maliciously or in bad faith in bringing about his constructive dismissal.<br><br>Finally, as regards Aurelio Villaflor, while he may be considered as a corporate officer, being the president of SME Bank, the records are bereft of any evidence that indicates his actual participation in the termination of respondent employees. Not having participated at all in the illegal act, he may not be held individually liable for the satisfaction of their claims.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b>III</b><br><b>Respondent employees are entitled to separation pay, full backwages, moral damages, exemplary damages and attorney’s fees.</b><br></div><br>The rule is that illegally dismissed employees are entitled to (1) either reinstatement, if viable, or separation pay if reinstatement is no longer viable; and (2) backwages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup><br><br>Courts may grant separation pay in lieu of reinstatement when the relations between the employer and the employee have been so severely strained; when reinstatement is not in the best interest of the parties; when it is no longer advisable or practical to order reinstatement; or when the employee decides not to be reinstated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> In this case, respondent employees expressly pray for a grant of separation pay in lieu of reinstatement. Thus, following a finding of illegal dismissal, we rule that they are entitled to the payment of separation pay equivalent to their one-month salary for every year of service as an alternative to reinstatement.<br><br>Respondent employees are likewise entitled to full backwages notwithstanding the grant of separation pay. In <i>Santos v. NLRC</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> we explained that an award of backwages restores the income that was lost by reason of the unlawful dismissal, while separation pay "provide[s] the employee with 'the wherewithal during the period that he is looking for another employment.'"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> Thus, separation pay is a proper substitute only for reinstatement; it is not an adequate substitute for both reinstatement and backwages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> Hence, respondent employees are entitled to the grant of full backwages in addition to separation pay.<br><br>As to moral damages, exemplary damages and attorney's fees, we uphold the appellate court's grant thereof based on our finding that the forced resignations and retirement were fraudulently done and attended by bad faith.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the instant Petitions for Review are <b>PARTIALLY GRANTED</b>.<br><br>The assailed Decision and Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA­ G.R.
