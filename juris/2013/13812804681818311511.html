Hence, it is not entitled to credit its input VAT under Section 4.103-1 of Revenue Regulations No. (RR) 7-95.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Besides, petitioner’s alleged unutilized input VAT for 1999 was not properly documented.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br><center><b>The Proceedings Before the CTA</b><br></center><br>On March 16, 2004, the CTA Division<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> rendered a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> denying petitioner’s claim for input VAT refund&nbsp; on the ground that all of its export sales invoices: (<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>) have no Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) Permit to Print; (<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) did not contain its Taxpayer’s Identification Number-VAT (TIN-V); and (<span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>) the word “zero-rated” was not imprinted thereon in violation of Section 113(A)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> in relation to Section 238 of the NIRC and Section 4.108-1 of RR 7-95.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Having thus failed to comply with the invoicing requirements, petitioner’s evidence was deemed insufficient to establish its zero-rated export sales for input VAT refund purposes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Dissatisfied, petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> which was, however, denied in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> dated September 20, 2004.<br><br>Unperturbed, petitioner elevated the matter before the CTA <i>En Banc</i>, arguing that the export sales invoices are not the sole basis to prove export sales.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> In this accord, it posited that its export sales should be deemed properly documented and substantiated by the bills of lading, airway bills, and export documents<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> as these documents are the best evidence to prove the actual exportation of the goods.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>On September 20, 2005, the CTA <i>En Banc</i> issued the assailed Decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> denying petitioner’s claim for input VAT refund. It ruled that petitioner failed to establish the fact that its 1999 export sales were “zero-rated” for VAT purposes as it failed to comply with the substantiation requirements under Section 113(A) in relation to Section 238 of the NIRC, as well as Section 4.108-1 of RR 7-95.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Further, it affirmed the earlier finding that petitioner’s export sales invoices had no BIR Permit to Print and did not contain its TIN-V and the words “zero-rated.” As such, the documents it submitted were insufficient to prove the zero-rated export sales of the goods for input VAT refund purposes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Petitioner moved for reconsideration which was, similarly, denied in a Resolution dated January 27, 2006.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Hence, the instant petition.<br><br><center><b>The Issue Before the Court</b><br></center><br>The sole issue in this case is whether or not the CTA erred in denying petitioner’s claim for tax refund.<br><br><center><b>The Court’s Ruling</b><br></center><br>The petition lacks merit.<br><br>Case law dictates that in a claim for tax refund or tax credit, the applicant must prove not only entitlement to the claim but also compliance with all the documentary and evidentiary requirements therefor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Section 110(A)(1)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> of the NIRC provides that creditable input taxes must be evidenced by a VAT invoice or official receipt, which must, in turn, comply with&nbsp; Sections 237<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> and 238<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> of the same law, as well as Section 4.108.1<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> of RR 7-95. The foregoing provisions require, <i>inter alia</i>, that an invoice must reflect, as required by law: (<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>) the BIR Permit to Print; (<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) the TIN-V of the purchaser; and (<span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>) the word “zero-rated” imprinted thereon. In this relation, failure to comply with the said invoicing requirements provides sufficient ground to deny a claim for tax refund or tax credit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>In this case, records show that all of the export sales invoices presented by petitioner not only lack the word “zero-rated” but also failed to reflect its BIR Permit to Print as well as its TIN-V. Thus, it cannot be gainsaid that it failed to comply with the above-stated invoicing requirements, thereby rendering improper its claim for tax refund. Clearly, compliance with all the VAT invoicing requirements is required to be able to file a claim for input taxes attributable to zero-rated sales. As held in <i>Microsoft Philippines, Inc. v. CIR</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><blockquote>The invoicing requirements for a VAT-registered taxpayer as provided in the NIRC and revenue regulations are clear. <b>A VAT-registered taxpayer is required to comply with all the VAT invoicing requirements to be able to file for a claim for input taxes on domestic purchases for goods or services attributable to zero-rated sales.</b> A “VAT invoice” is an invoice that meets the requirements of Section 4.108-1 of RR 7-95. Contrary to Microsoft’s claim, RR-7-95 expressly states that “[A]ll purchases covered by invoice other than a VAT invoice shall not give rise to any input tax. Microsoft’s invoice, lacking the word “zero-rated,” is not a “VAT invoice,” and thus cannot give rise to any input tax.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>All told, the CTA committed no reversible error in denying petitioner’s refund claim.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>.
