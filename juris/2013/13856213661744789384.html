CV No. 70078, affirming the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Mandaue City, Branch 56, which granted the application of Diosdada I.

No. 1529 or <i>The Property Registration Decree </i>enumerates the persons who may apply for the registration of title to land, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 14. <i>Who may apply</i>. The following persons may file in the proper Court of First Instance an application for registration of title to land, whether personally or through their duly authorized representatives:<br><br>(1) Those who by themselves or through their predecessors-in- interest have been in open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and occupation of alienable and disposable lands of the public domain under a <i>bona fide</i> claim of ownership since June 12, 1945, or earlier.<br><br>(2) Those who have acquired ownership of private lands by prescription under the provision of existing laws.<br><br>(3) Those who have acquired ownership of private lands or abandoned river beds by right of accession or accretion under the existing laws.<br><br>(4) Those who have acquired ownership of land in any other manner provided for by law.</blockquote><br>In the assailed decision granting the respondent’s application for registration of title, the CA explained that the RTC’s decision was based on Section 14(2) of P.D. No. 1529 and not on Section 14(1) of the same decree.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> The CA said:<br><br><blockquote>However, a judicious scrutiny of the attendant facts would reveal that the assailed decision of the RTC was based not on PD No. 1529, Section 14(1), but under Section 14(2) of said issuance. The pertinent portion of the decision is quoted as follows:<br><blockquote>“From the documentary evidence presented and formally offered by the applicant, the Court is convinced that she and her predecessors-in-interest has (sic) been in open, complete, continuous, notorious, exclusive and peaceful possession over the lands herein applied for registration of title, for a period of over 40 years, in the concept of an owner and that applicant has registrable title over same lots in accordance with Sec. 14, PD 1529.”<br></blockquote>A closer scrutiny will show that the questioned decision was based on PD No. 1529, Section 14(2).<br><br>In the case of Republic of the Philippines vs. Court of Appeals and Naguit, it was ruled that:<br><blockquote>Did the enactment of the Property Registration Decree and the amendatory P.D. No. 1073 preclude the application for registration of alienable lands of the public domain, possession over which commenced only after June 12, 1945? It did not, considering Section 14(2) of the Property Registration Decree, which governs and authorizes the application of “those who have acquired ownership of private lands by prescription under the provisions of existing laws.”<br><br><b><u>“Prescription is one of the modes of acquiring ownership under the Civil Code. There is a consistent jurisprudential rule that properties classified as alienable public land may be converted into private property by reason of open, continuous and exclusive possession of at least thirty (30) years. With such conversion, such property may now fall within the contemplation of “private lands” under Section 14(2), and thus susceptible to registration by those who have acquired ownership through prescription. Thus, even if possession of the alienable public land commenced on a date later than June 12, 1945, and such possession being been [sic] open, continuous and exclusive, then the possessor may have the right to register the land by virtue of Section 14(2) of the Property Registration Decree.”</u></b></blockquote>In the instant case, applicant-appellee was able to present tax declarations dating back from 1948. Although tax declarations and realty tax payment of property are not conclusive evidence of ownership, nevertheless, they are good <i>indicia</i> of the possession in the concept of owner for no one in his right mind would be paying taxes for a property that is not in his actual, or at the least constructive, possession. They constitute proof that the holder has a claim of title over the property. The voluntary declaration of a piece of property for taxation purposes manifests, not only one’s sincere and honest desire to obtain title to the property, but it also announces his adverse claim against the State and all other interested parties, including his intention to contribute to the needed revenues of the Government. All told, such acts strengthen one’s <i>bona fide</i> claim of acquisition of ownership.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote><br>The Court agrees with the CA’s finding that the RTC’s grant of the respondent’s application for registration of title was based on Section 14(2) of P.D. No. 1529 and not on Section 14(1) of the same decree. As the CA, citing <i>Republic of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals and Naguit</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> correctly explained, an applicant may apply for registration of title through prescription under Section 14(2) of P.D. No. 1529, stating that patrimonial properties of the State are susceptible of prescription and that there is a rich jurisprudential precedents which rule that properties classified as alienable public land may be converted into private property by reason of open, continuous and exclusive possession of at least 30 years.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>In <i>Heirs of Mario Malabanan v. Republic</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> the Court further clarified the difference between Section 14(1) and Section 14(2) of P.D. No. 1529. The former refers to registration of title on the basis of <b>possession</b>, while the latter entitles the applicant to the registration of his property on the basis of <b>prescription</b>. Registration under the first mode is extended under the aegis of the P.D. No. 1529 and the Public Land Act (PLA) while under the second mode is made available both by P.D. No. 1529 and the Civil Code. Moreover, under Section 48(b) of the PLA, as amended by Republic Act No. 1472, the 30-year period is in relation to possession without regard to the Civil Code, while under Section 14(2) of P.D. No. 1529, the 30-year period involves extraordinary prescription under the Civil Code, particularly Article 1113 in relation to Article 1137.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Indeed, the foregoing jurisprudence clearly shows the basis of the respondent’s application for registration of title. However, the petitioner argued that the respondent failed to show proof of an expressed State declaration that the properties in question are no longer intended for public use, public service, the development of the national wealth or have been converted into patrimonial property. It pointed out that the certification which the respondent submitted did not indicate when the lands applied for were declared alienable and disposable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>On this point, the Court cannot completely agree with the petitioner. Indeed, the respondent attempted to show proof as to when the subject lands were declared alienable and disposable. While the RTC and the CA failed to cite the evidence which the respondent submitted, the Court cannot, in the name of substantial justice and equity, close its eyes to the September 23, 2004 <i>Certification</i> issued and signed by Fedencio P. Carreon (Carreon), OIC, CENRO, which the respondent attached in her Appellee’s brief in the CA,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> as a supplement to her earlier submissions, particularly Annex “G” and Annex “G-1” or the June 28, 1995 <i>Certifications</i> issued by Eduardo M.

While the certification refers to Forestry Administrative Order No. 4-1063 dated September 1, 1965, the respondent should have submitted a certified true copy thereof to substantiate the alienable character of the land. In any case, the Court does not need to further discuss whether the respondent was able to overcome the burden of proving that the land no longer forms part of the public domain to support her application for original land registration because of other deficiencies in her application.<br><br>Indeed, the respondent failed to meet the required period of possession and occupation for purposes of prescription. From the time of the declaration on September 1, 1965 that the properties in question are purportedly alienable and disposable up to the filing of the application of the respondent on July 17, 1995, the respondent and her predecessors-in-interest had possessed and occupied the said properties for only 29 years and 10 months, short of two months to complete the whole 30-year possession period.<br><br>Granting <i>por arguendo</i> that the respondent and her predecessors-in-interest had possessed and occupied the subject lots since 1948, the Court cannot still tack those years to complete the 30-year possession period since the said lots were only declared alienable and disposable on September 1, 1965.

Here, the Court agrees with the petitioner’s argument.<br><br>In <i>Roman Catholic Bishop of Kalibo, Aklan v. Municipality of Buruanga, Aklan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> the Court ruled that for an applicant to ipso jure or by operation of law acquire government grant or vested title to a lot, he must be in open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and occupation of the lot.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> In the said case, the Court clarified what it actually meant when it said “open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and occupation,” to wit:<br><br><blockquote>The petitioner submits that even granting <i>arguendo</i> that the entire Lot 138 was not assigned to it during the Spanish regime or it is not the owner thereof pursuant to the Laws of the Indies, its open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and occupation of Lot 138 since 1894 and for many decades thereafter vests <i>ipso jure</i> or by operation of law upon the petitioner a government grant, a vested title, to the subject property. It cites Subsection 6 of Section 54 of Act No. 926 and Subsection b of Section 45 of Act No. 2874.<br><br>This contention is likewise not persuasive.<br><br>One of the important requisites for the application of the pertinent provisions of Act No. 926 and Act No. 2874 is the “open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and occupation” of the land by the applicant. <b>Actual possession of land consists in the manifestation of acts of dominion over it of such a nature as a party would naturally exercise over his own property</b>. The phrase “possession and occupation” was explained as follows:<br><blockquote>It must be underscored that the law speaks of “possession and occupation.” Since these words are separated by the conjunction <i>and</i>, the clear intention of the law is not to make one synonymous with the order [sic]. <b>Possession is broader than occupation because it includes constructive possession. When, therefore, the law adds the word <i>occupation</i>, it seeks to delimit the all-encompassing effect of constructive possession. Taken together with the words <i>open, continuous, exclusive and notorious</i>, the word <i>occupation</i> serves to highlight the fact that for one to qualify under paragraph (b) of the aforesaid section, his possession of the land must not be mere fiction</b>. As this Court stated, through then Mr. Justice Jose P. Laurel, in <i>Lasam v. The Director of Lands</i>:<br><blockquote>x x x Counsel for the applicant invokes the doctrine laid down by us in <i>Ramos v. Director of Lands</i>. But it should be observed that the application of the doctrine of constructive possession in that case is subject to certain qualifications, and this court was careful to observe that among these qualifications is “one particularly relating to the size of the tract in controversy with reference to the portion actually in possession of the claimant.” <b>While, therefore, “possession in the eyes of the law does not mean that a man has to have his feet on every square meter of ground before it can be said that he is in possession,” possession under paragraph 6 of Section 54 of Act No. 926, as amended by paragraph (b) of Section 45 of Act No. 2874, is not gained by mere nominal claim. The mere planting of a sign or symbol of possession cannot justify a Magellan-like claim of dominion over an immense tract of territory. Possession as a means of acquiring ownership, while it may be constructive, is not a mere fiction</b>. x x x.<br><br>x x x x</blockquote><b>Possession is open when it is patent, visible, apparent, notorious and not clandestine. It is continuous when uninterrupted, unbroken and not intermittent or occasional; exclusive when the adverse possessor can show exclusive dominion over the land and an appropriation of it to his own use and benefit; and notorious when it is so conspicuous that it is generally known and talked of by the public or the people in the neighborhood.<br><br>Use of land is adverse when it is open and notorious</b>.</blockquote>Indisputably, the petitioner has been in open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and occupation of Lot 138-B since 1894 as evidenced by the church structure built thereon. However, the record is bereft of any evidence that would tend to show that such possession and occupation extended to Lots 138-A and 138-C beginning the same period. No single instance of the exercise by the petitioner of proprietary acts or acts of dominion over these lots was established. Its unsubstantiated claim that the construction of the municipal building as well as the subsequent improvements thereon, <i>e.g.</i>, the rural health center, Buruanga community Medicare hospital [sic], basketball court, Rizal monument and grandstand, was [sic] by its tolerance does not constitute proof of possession and occupation on its (the petitioner’s) part.<br><br>Absent the important requisite of open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and occupation thereon since 1894, no government grant or title to Lots 138-A and 138-C had vested upon the petitioner <i>ipso jure</i> or by operation of law. Possession under paragraph 6 of section 54 of Act No. 926, as amended by paragraph (b) of section 45 of Act No. 2874, is not gained by mere nominal claim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> (Citations omitted and emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>In sum, a simple claim of “open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and occupation” does not suffice. An applicant for a grant or title over a lot must be able to show that he has exercised acts of dominion over the property in question. The applicant’s possession must not be simply a nominal claim where he only plants a sign or symbol of possession. In other words, his possession of the property must be patent, visible, apparent, notorious and not clandestine; it should be uninterrupted, unbroken and not intermittent or occasional; it should demonstrate exclusive dominion over the land and an appropriation of it to his own use and benefit; and it should be conspicuous, which means generally known and talked of by the public or the people in the neighborhood.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>The Court held in <i>Cruz v. Court of Appeals, et al</i>.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> that therein petitioners were able to show clear, competent and substantial evidence establishing that they have exercised acts of dominion over the property in question. These acts of dominion were the following:<br><br><blockquote>(a) they constructed permanent buildings on the questioned lot;<br>(b) they collected rentals;<br>(c) they granted permission to those who sought their consent for the construction of a drugstore and a bakery;<br>(d) they collected fruits from the fruit-bearing trees planted on the said land;<br>(e) they were consulted regarding questions of boundaries between adjoining properties; and<br>(f) they religiously paid taxes on the property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup></blockquote><br>However, in the present petition, the respondent failed to specifically show that she and her predecessors-in-interest had exercised acts of dominion over the subject lots. Admittedly, the respondent’s best evidence to prove possession and ownership were tax declarations and receipts issued in her name or the names of her predecessors-in-interest, but these tax declarations and receipts are not conclusive evidence of ownership or right of possession over a piece of land. “Well settled is the rule that tax declarations and receipts are not conclusive evidence of ownership or of the right to possess land when not supported by any other evidence. The fact that the disputed property may have been declared for taxation purposes in the names of the applicants for registration or of their predecessors-in- interest does not necessarily prove ownership. They are merely indicia of a claim of ownership.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>In the instant case, the respondent failed to show that she or her predecessors-in-interest have exercised acts of dominion over the said parcels of land. In fact, it was only the respondent who testified to substantiate her allegations in the application. She did not present anyone else to support her claim of “open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and occupation.” Unfortunately, her testimony simply made general declarations without further proof, to wit:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DIRECT EXAMINATION:</span><br></div><blockquote>Q - Mrs. Gielczyk, are you the same Diosdada Gielzcyk[,] the applicant in this case?<br>A - Yes.<br><br>Q - Are you familiar with [L]ots No. 3135 and 20045, both of Consolacion, Cebu?<br>A - Yes.<br><br>Court:<br>Excuse me, You can answer in English?

Neither can the Court give credence to the respondent’s claim that her predecessors-in-interest had exercised dominion over the property since the respondent failed to present any witness who would substantiate her allegation. The pieces of documentary evidence, specifically the tax declarations and the deeds of absolute sale, can neither be relied upon because the same revealed no indication of any improvement that would have the Court conclude that the respondent exercised specific acts of dominion. For instance, the deed of absolute sale simply said that the improvements on Lot No. 3135-A consisted of two (2) coconut trees, one (1) mango tree, one (1) <i>caimito </i>tree and one (1) jackfruit tree.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> The tax declarations have not shown any indication supporting the respondent’s claim that she exercised specific acts of dominion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>As to Lot No. 3136-A, the deed of absolute sale showed that there were 14 coconut trees, eight (8) jackfruit trees, and a residential building, which was actually possessed by the vendor Constancio Ceniza. Moreover, it was only in Tax Declaration Nos. 29200, 04210 and 13275 where it was declared that a residential building has been built in Lot No. 3136-A.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> And based on the records, Tax Declaration No. 29200, where the residential building was first indicated, is dated 1981. It may be said then that it was only in 1981 when the respondent’s predecessors-in-interest exercised specific acts of dominion over Lot No. 3136-A, the period of which consists barely of 14 years. Thus, the respondent has not completed the required 30 years of “open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and occupation.”<br><br>Clearly, from the pieces of documentary and testimonial evidence, and considering that the respondent did not present any other witness to support her claim, the Court has no other recourse but to declare that she has not presented the premium of evidence needed to award her title over the two parcels of land.<br><br>Finally, the Court cannot end this decision without reiterating the final words of former Associate Justice Dante O. Tinga in the case of <i>Malabanan</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup>. Justice Tinga correctly pointed out the need to review our present law on the distribution of lands to those who have held them for a number of years but have failed to satisfy the requisites in acquiring title to such land. Justice Tinga eloquently put the matter before us, thus:<br><br><blockquote>A final word. The Court is comfortable with the correctness of the legal doctrines established in this decision. Nonetheless, discomfiture over the implications of today’s ruling cannot be discounted. For, every untitled property that is occupied in the country will be affected by this ruling. The social implications cannot be dismissed lightly, and the Court would be abdicating its social responsibility to the Filipino people if we simply levied the law without comment.<br><br>The informal settlement of public lands, whether declared alienable or not, is a phenomenon tied to long-standing habit and cultural acquiescence, and is common among the so-called “Third World” countries. This paradigm powerfully evokes the disconnect between a legal system and the reality on the ground. The law so far has been unable to bridge that gap. Alternative means of acquisition of these public domain lands, such as through homestead or free patent, have proven unattractive due to limitations imposed on the grantee in the encumbrance or alienation of said properties. Judicial confirmation of imperfect title has emerged as the most viable, if not the most attractive means to regularize the informal settlement of alienable or disposable lands of the public domain, yet even that system, as revealed in this decision, has considerable limits.<br><br>There are millions upon millions of Filipinos who have individually or exclusively held residential lands on which they have lived and raised their families. Many more have tilled and made productive idle lands of the State with their hands. They have been regarded for generation by their families and their communities as common law owners. There is much to be said about the virtues of according them legitimate states. Yet such virtues are not for the Court to translate into positive law, as the law itself considered such lands as property of the public dominion. <b>It could only be up to Congress to set forth a new phase of land reform to sensibly regularize and formalize the settlement of such lands which in legal theory are lands of the public domain before the problem becomes insoluble. This could be accomplished, to cite two examples, by liberalizing the standards for judicial confirmation of imperfect title, or amending the Civil Code itself to ease the requisites for the conversion of public dominion property into patrimonial.</b><br><br>One’s sense of security over land rights infuses into every aspect of well-being not only of that individual, but also to the person’s family. Once that sense of security is deprived, life and livelihood are put on stasis. It is for the political branches to bring welcome closure to the long pestering problem.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> (Citation omitted and emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Indeed, the Court can only do as much to bring relief to those who, like herein respondent, wish to acquire title to a land that they have bought.
