Familara and Ferdinand L. Castro’s initials.<br><br>Appellant was brought to the police station for further questioning.&nbsp; PO1 Mapula personally brought the three seized plastic sachets containing white crystalline substance to the Philippine National Police Crime Laboratory for examination together with the written Request for Laboratory Examination.&nbsp; The qualitative tests conducted by Forensic Chemist, Sr. Police Inspector x x x (Forro) on the contents of the sachets proved positive for methamphetamine hydrochloride or shabu.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></blockquote><br>The defense gave a different version of the story.&nbsp; Thus:<br><br><blockquote>On May 7, 2003, around 11 in the evening, appellant was engaged in a drinking spree with his friends, Arthur [Millare] and Luloy [dela Cruz], in front of his house at 1170 Kalamansi Street, Dapigo, Pasig City.&nbsp; Past midnight, he excused himself from the group to prepare for his trip to Nueva Ecija the following morning.<br><br>When he was about to enter the gate of his house, four persons suddenly confronted him.&nbsp; Two of them, who were identified as PO1 Mapula and PO1 Familara grabbed him.&nbsp; He asked why he was being arrested, but did not get a reply.&nbsp; His name, age and address were then taken by the police officers.&nbsp; He was thereafter charged with possession and sale of illegal drugs.<br><br>[Millare] corroborated appellant’s testimony.&nbsp; He stated that he saw appellant being pushed toward his house by four men who had just alighted from a white car without a plate number.&nbsp; He saw appellant being handcuffed.&nbsp; He shouted and asked, "<i>Pare, anong kasalanan mo, bakit ka nakaposas</i>?" but received no response.&nbsp; He went to inform appellant’s mother about the incident.&nbsp; They rushed to the scene of the incident but the four officers had already left with appellant.<br><br>[Dela Cruz] alleged that he was the drinking buddy of appellant at the time he was arrested and confirmed the foregoing defense witnesses’ testimonies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></blockquote><br>After trial, the court convicted accused-appellant of both crimes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> the decision of the trial court but modified the penalty imposed for illegal possession of <i>shabu</i> from <i>six (6) years and one (1) day of prision mayor as minimum to twelve (12) years and one (1) day of reclusion temporal as maximum to <u>imprisonment of twelve (12) years and one (1) day as minimum, to fourteen (14) years and eight (8) months as maximum, and payment of a fine of three hundred thousand pesos (P300,000.00)</u></i>.<br><br>The motion for reconsideration of the decision was likewise denied by the Court of Appeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Before this Court, both the prosecution and the defense opted not to file their respective supplemental briefs.&nbsp; We, thus, refer to their briefs and re-examine the position of the accused-appellant that: (1) the equipoise rule should have been applied in his favor inasmuch as the testimonies of the witnesses for the prosecution and the defense are all self-serving; (2) the warrantless arrest is invalid; and (3) the seized item proceeding from such arrest is inadmissible in evidence.<br><br><center><b><i>Our Ruling</i></b></center><br>We sustain the conviction of accused-appellant.<br><br>To secure a conviction for illegal sale of<i> shabu</i>, the following elements must be present: "(a) the identities of the buyer and the seller, the object of the sale, and the consideration; and (b) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment for the thing."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>&nbsp; The prosecution must show that the transaction or sale actually took place, coupled with the presentation of the <i>corpus delicti</i> as evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>We find these present in the case at bar.<br><br>PO1 Mapula testified that accused-appellant, not being authorized by law, sold a sachet of <i>shabu</i> to PO1 Mapula during a buy-bust operation;&nbsp; that he was introduced by the informant as the person who wanted to buy <i>shabu</i>; that he told accused-appellant that he wanted to buy a hundred peso-worth of<i> shabu</i>;&nbsp; that accused-appellant asked for and received the marked money; that accused-appellant thereafter handed PO1 Mapula the substance, which later tested for <i>shabu</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>&nbsp; The testimony of PO1 Mapula was corroborated on material points by PO1 Familara.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>&nbsp; Also, the prosecution was able to present in court the item subject of the sale including the marked money tendered to accused-appellant.<br><br>The presence of the elements of the crime of illegal possession of <i>shabu</i> has likewise been sufficiently established, to wit: "(a) the accused [was] in possession of an item or object that is identified to be a prohibited or dangerous drug; (b) such possession [was] not authorized by law; and (c) the accused freely and consciously possessed the drug."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>&nbsp; When asked to empty his pocket, accused-appellant produced therefrom two (2) more transparent plastic sachets containing white substance, which also tested positive for <i>shabu</i>.&nbsp; Such possession was likewise unauthorized by law.<br><br>The defense posits that the equipoise rule should have been applied in his favor inasmuch as the testimonies of the witnesses for the prosecution and the defense are all self-serving.<br><br>We cannot agree.&nbsp; The equipoise rule does not apply because the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses are, in fact, credible based on settled legal principles and doctrines applicable to the particular factual circumstances of the case.<br><br>Thus, we have said, time and again, that "findings of the trial courts which are factual in nature and which involve credibility are accorded respect when no glaring errors; gross misapprehension of facts; or speculative, arbitrary, and unsupported conclusions can be gathered from such findings."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>&nbsp; Also, "the determination by the trial court of the credibility of witnesses, when affirmed by the appellate court, is accorded full weight and credit as well as great respect, if not conclusive effect."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>We find nothing in the records that would justify a deviation from the findings of the trial court and the appellate court.&nbsp; Supported by evidence, the arresting officers rendered a straightforward narration of the details of the operation relative to the following: (1) the receipt of an information as to the illegal drugs activity in the area where accused-appellant was apprehended; (2) the organization of the buy-bust team; (3) the preparations made for the purpose;&nbsp; (4) the entrapment itself leading to the arrest of accused-appellant; (5) the marking of the seized items; and (6) the eventual delivery of the specimens to the crime laboratory.<br><br>Neither did the defense prove that there was ill-motive or bad faith on the part of the team to falsely impute upon him the commission of these grave offenses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> The doctrine of presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty, therefore, applies.&nbsp; As explained in <i>People v. Tion</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br><blockquote>x x x Unless there is clear and convincing evidence that the members of the buy-bust team were inspired by any improper motive or were not properly performing their duty, their testimonies on the buy-bust operation deserve full faith and credit.&nbsp; <b>Settled is the rule that in cases involving violations of the Dangerous Drugs Act, credence is given to prosecution witnesses who are police officers, for they are presumed to have performed their duties in a regular manner, unless there is evidence to the contrary suggesting ill motive on the part of the police officers or deviation from the regular performance of their duties.</b>&nbsp; The records do not show any allegation of improper motive on the part of the buy-bust team.&nbsp; Thus, the presumption of regularity in the performance of duties of the police officers must be upheld.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> (<i>Citations omitted; emphasis supplied</i>)</blockquote><br>Necessarily, the finding of the credibility of the testimonies of the arresting officers should prevail over the testimonies of the accused-appellant and his friend-witnesses especially so when their respective testimonies were inconsistent on material points.<br><br>Witness Millare testified that upon peeping through the window and seeing accused-appellant in handcuffs, he shouted, "<i>Pare, anong kasalanan mo, bakit ka nakaposas?"</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>&nbsp; On the other hand, dela Cruz testified that Millare was upstairs when the latter shouted "<i>Pare, ano ba ‘yang nangyayari <b>d’yan sa baba</b> at bakit ka hinuhuli</i>?"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Even assuming that these were not substantial enough to doubt the credibility of the testimonies of the defense witnesses, we cannot simply disregard the contradicting testimonies of the accused-appellant on one hand and his witnesses on the other as to the place where the arrest was made.<br><br>From the context of the testimony of accused-appellant on cross-examination, he was arrested outside his house in front of his drinking buddies Millare and dela Cruz.&nbsp; Pertinent portions of the transcript of stenographic notes read:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Q - </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">What were you exactly doing when the police officers arrived and grabbed you?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A - </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">I was on my way home, I was actually closing the gate, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q - </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Do I take it to mean that you were already alone, [M]r.

Concepcion</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> the Court had the occasion to rule on the credibility of the witnesses with two conflicting statements on the place of arrest.&nbsp; It held:<br><br><blockquote>The testimony of defense witness Julieta dela Rosa does not convince us. As the wife of appellant Alfredo and sister-in-law of appellant Henry, we find her not to be credible. Her testimony is suspect and unsubstantiated. In her direct testimony, she said her husband, appellant Alfredo, was outside their house with his friends.&nbsp; However, such statement was belied by Alfredo himself who said he was inside his house when he was allegedly arrested by members of the PDEA. Such inconsistency as to where appellant Alfredo was when the alleged unlawful arrest was made, further diminishes the credibility of the defense witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></blockquote><br>Further, in <i>Aurelio v. People</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> the Court discussed the weight given to the testimonies of a long-time neighbor and a sister, who rendered contradicting statements, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>The testimonies of the petitioner’s witnesses cannot be given more weight than the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses. Teresita is the sister of the petitioner while Julieta has been his neighbor for the past 10 years.&nbsp; Thus, their testimonies are necessarily suspect, considering they are petitioner’s sibling and friend respectively. The testimonies of Julieta and Teresita even contradict each other as Teresita declared that five malefactors entered their home while Julieta stated that only two men went with petitioner inside his house. This inconsistency further diminishes the credibility of petitioner’s witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></blockquote><br>In its Motion for Reconsideration of the Decision of 28 May 2010, the defense further argued that the prosecution failed to prove the unbroken chain of custody of the drugs seized.<br><br>We are not convinced.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals correctly ratiocinated, and we quote:<br><br><blockquote>The identity of the sachets of <i>shabu</i> confiscated and the continuous chain of custody was established by the prosecution.&nbsp; An adequate foundation establishing a continuous chain of custody is said to have been established if the State accounts for the evidence at each stage from its acquisition to its testing, and to its introduction at trial.&nbsp; In this case, it was shown that after the three sachets of <i>shabu</i> were confiscated from appellant, they were marked by PO1 Mapula and PO1 Familara.&nbsp; At the police station, the seized drugs were the subject of a Request for Examination by SPO4 Danilo M. Tuano.&nbsp; Said drugs were then personally delivered by PO1 Mapula to the PNP Crime Laboratory, at the Eastern Police District Crime Laboratory.&nbsp; Subsequently, qualitative tests were conducted and the test results, presented in evidence confirmed that the specimen contained <i>shabu</i>.&nbsp; During trial, PO1 Mapula identified the plastic sachet marked with "AVM" as the same sachet containing shabu which he bought from appellant.&nbsp; Likewise, PO1 Familara positively identified the two sachets of <i>shabu</i> marked with "MRF" and "FLC" as the same ones recovered from appellant’s possession.<br><br>Moreover, in the Stipulation of Facts by the parties during the Pre-Trial Conference, the genuineness and due execution of <i>Forensic Chemistry Report No. D-849-03E</i> and the truth of its contents were admitted by appellant.&nbsp; It was therefore established that the sachets recovered from appellant contained methamphetamine hydrochloride or <i>shabu</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote><br>As to the penalties for the crimes committed, the law provides that the penalty of life imprisonment and a fine ranging from Five Hundred Thousand (P500,000.00) Pesos to Ten Million Pesos (P10,000,000.00) shall be imposed upon any person found guilty of the crime of illegal sale of <i>shabu</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>&nbsp; The crime of illegal possession of <i>shabu</i> weighing less than five (5) grams is punishable by imprisonment of twelve (12) years and one (1) day to twenty (20) years, and a fine ranging from Three Hundred Thousand Pesos (P300,000.00) to Four Hundred Thousand Pesos (P400,000.00).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>The Indeterminate Sentence Law,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> in turn, provides that "if the offense is punished by any other law, the court shall sentence the accused to an indeterminate sentence, the maximum term of which shall not exceed the maximum fixed by said law and the minimum shall not be less than the minimum term prescribed by the same."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Accordingly, with respect to Criminal Case No. 12472-D for illegal sale of <i>shabu</i>, the Court of Appeals correctly affirmed the penalty of life imprisonment imposed by the trial court.&nbsp; The fine of Five Hundred Thousand Pesos (P500,000.00) is also within the range of the fine prescribed under Section 5 of R.A. 9165.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>&nbsp; The modification of the penalty imposed in Criminal Case No. 12473-D for illegal possession of <i>shabu</i> from <i>six (6) years and one (1) day of prision mayor as minimum to twelve (12) years and one (1) day of reclusion temporal as maximum to <u>imprisonment of twelve (12) years and one (1) day as minimum, to fourteen (14) years and eight (8) months as maximum, and payment of a fine of three hundred thousand pesos (P300,000.00)</u></i> is likewise in order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Decision dated 28 May 2010 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
