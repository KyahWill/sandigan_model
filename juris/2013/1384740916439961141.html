				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">These consolidated administrative matters resulted from the two financial audits conducted on the books of accounts of the Municipal Trial Court in Cities (MTCC) of Tagum City, Davao del Norte.<br><br>The first financial audit conducted in said court in 2005 covered the period January 1, 1993 to January 31, 2005. The court was then presided by Judge Ismael L. Salubre. The audit was prompted by a report of the Commission on Audit (COA) regarding the violation of Nerio L. Edig, Clerk of Court IV, of Section 21 of the <u>New Manual on the New Government Accounting System</u>, which requires all collecting officers to deposit intact all their collections with the authorized government bank daily or not later than the next banking day, and Edig’s non-submission of monthly reports. Edig failed to submit monthly reports for the Judiciary Development Fund (JDF) for the period February 2003 to December 31, 2004, the Clerk of Court General Fund (COCGF) for the period February 2003 to November 2003, the Special Allowance for the Judiciary Fund (SAJF) for the period December 2003 to December 31, 2004 and the Fiduciary Fund for the period April to December 31, 2004.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> The second audit, done in 2008, covered the period February 1, 2005 to July 31, 2008 and was prompted by the successive changes in accountable officers in the court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>During the 2005 audit, Edig informed the audit team that Bella Luna C. Abella was his cashier from the time he assumed office as Clerk of Court on February 16, 1978. Abella was later replaced by Delia R. Palero from January 1, 1996 until January 30, 2002 and then by Macario H.S. Aventurado from January 31, 2002 up to the time of the audit in 2005. Abella also acted as Officer-in-Charge from April 1, 2002 until October 6, 2002 while Edig was on study leave.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>Per Report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> of the audit team dated September 2, 2005, the financial accountabilities of Edig, Salubre, Abella, Palero and Aventurado are as follows:<br><br><table align="CENTER" border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="124"> <div align="CENTER">PARTICULARS </div></td> <td width="92"> <div align="CENTER">Judge Salubre </div></td> <td width="92"> <div align="CENTER">Edig </div></td> <td width="92"> <div align="CENTER">Abella </div></td> <td width="92"> <div align="CENTER">Palero </div></td> <td width="92"> <div align="CENTER">Aventurado </div></td></tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td width="124"><div>&nbsp;

Gonzaga, initially asked for a 30-day extension to file an answer citing the former’s serious ailments.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> But Antonieta Edig, Edig’s wife, in a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> dated March 17, 2006, informed the investigating judge that her husband was incapable of filing an answer and that she wanted to insulate him from stress that may affect his gradual recovery.<br><br>In Palero’s Answer<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> dated March 20, 2006, she explained that the unaccounted withdrawals totaling P3,147,285 were authorized. She contended that the withdrawal slips were signed by either Judge Salubre or Clerk of Court Edig. Part of the amount was received by Judge Salubre who even signed the acknowledgment receipts. As to the P21,000 pertaining to the cash bonds of dismissed cases that were supposed to be applied to fines but were not, Palero claimed that Judge Salubre also took it without signing an acknowledgment receipt though she noted it for reference. As to the P110,800 forfeited cash bonds, Palero submitted acknowledgment receipts showing that P21,000 was received by Evelyn Molde, wife of an accused in three criminal cases; P14,000 was withdrawn and received by Ms. Ruth Ibaos; and P63,800 was taken by Judge Salubre.<br><br>Palero also admitted that the remittances were delayed but she was not even aware that they were “technically” delayed already. She claimed that it has been the practice of the court to just make the remittance on the month following the month when the collections were actually made and that she was just doing the manual task of going to the bank to make the deposits. She likewise knew for a fact that the clerk of court would still wait for Judge Salubre to pay for his debt/advances in the collections, but the clerk of court would just use his own money in replenishing the collections when Judge Salubre throws invectives at them when they demand payment.<br><br>In Aventurado’s Answer<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> dated March 21, 2006, he contended that he never benefited from the unaccounted amount he was made to explain. He claimed to be the newest and youngest employee in the court and only sought advice from his fellow employees. He alleged that Clerk of Court Edig, Legal Researcher Abella and Court Interpreter Palero advised him to let the bondsman sign at the back of the receipts but even if he did as told, there were instances when the bondsmen would leave immediately after receiving the money. He also claimed that he can no longer give a detailed explanation on the withdrawals and non-receipt of amounts by bondsmen because they were instructed to send all the pertinent records to the Supreme Court. As to the P39,000 unaccounted forfeited cash bonds, Aventurado submitted some receipts.<br><br>Aventurado likewise admitted to the delays in the remittance of collections but attributed said delays to Judge Salubre. He claimed that there were instances when the judge would call him to his chambers to ask about the cash on hand and thereafter order him to hand over some of the collections with a promise that he would return them after a day or two. As the judge was his superior, he would comply and as advised by his fellow employees, ask the judge to sign an acknowledgment receipt. He, however, alleged that there were times when the judge would get angry and refuse to sign the receipt. He further added that he had to wait for the incoming collections for the month to be able to deposit because there were instances when the judge would not pay what he got from the court collections.<br><br>In his letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> dated February 14, 2006, Benemile explained that records would show that he did not receive a writ of execution for <i>People v. Molde</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> and that he only knew of the fact that the same was decided and gained finality when he received the administrative order. As to <i>People v. Salipot,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> he clarified that the writ of execution in said case was duly implemented but admitted that no return was made because the parties agreed that the losing party will pay in installment basis.<br><br>In his report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> dated April 22, 2006, the investigating judge evaluated the liabilities of Palero, Aventurado and Benemile. He left to this Court’s discretion the liabilities of Judge Salubre, Abella and Edig.<br><br>The investigating judge found Palero’s explanation as inadequate and unsatisfactory because Palero failed to produce the acknowledgment receipts required except for 36 cases wherein she was able to present court orders directing the release of the bonds and the signatures of the persons who received them. Still, the investigating judge opined that in said 36 cases, Palero had been too lax and liberal, releasing to persons equipped with no authority to receive the money for cancelled cash bonds and failing in most instances to note down the names of the recipients. Palero, also by her explanation, betrayed her unreliability as custodian of funds if indeed it was true that Judge Salubre took the P1,630,439.70 and that Judge Salubre should be blamed for her failure to account for the P21,000 cash bonds that should be applied to fines, since she allowed it to happen.<br><br>The investigating judge also found unacceptable the reason posed by both Palero and Aventurado for the delay in the remittance of collections – that they had to wait for Judge Salubre to return the borrowed funds – as the duty to remit collections on time cannot be compromised.<br><br>As to Aventurado, while he was able to show that deposits of some of the forfeited cash bonds were duly effected and reported, he was not able to present proof of acknowledgments of bondsmen for withdrawn cash bonds in several cases.<br><br>The investigating judge ruled that there was no clear indication of dishonesty that can be imputed to Palero and Aventurado and held that it was perhaps out of inexperience in the job of cash clerk that made them grossly ineffective and incompetent resulting in so much loss.<br><br>As to Benemile, the investigating judge found that he cannot be held accountable for his failure to implement a writ which was never brought to his attention in <i>People v. Molde</i>, but he should be made to answer for failure to make a return on the writ of execution in <i>People v. Salipot</i>.<br><br>Based on the above observations, the investigating judge made the following recommendations:<br><br><blockquote><ol><li>that respondents DELIA [R.] PALERO and MACARIO H.S.

Having complied with the rudiments of due process, the OCA is of the opinion that the Court can proceed in determining the administrative liability of Judge Salubre and Edig.<br><br>The OCA found that the evidence gathered during the audit, such as the acknowledgments signed by Judge Salubre evidencing receipt of dismissed and forfeited cash bonds and the statements of Palero and Aventurado, established his culpability. It ruled that Judge Salubre’s act of receiving and appropriating for himself the cash bonds of dismissed cases and forfeited cash bonds which were due to the government and to the bondsmen constitute grave misconduct.<br><br>As to Edig, the OCA ruled that the evidence gathered by the audit team clearly establish the unauthorized withdrawals from the Fiduciary Fund amounting to P5,684,875. Being the clerk of court and custodian of the court’s funds, Edig is primarily accountable for the unauthorized withdrawals from the Fiduciary Fund. It held that Edig’s failure to fulfill the responsibility of closely supervising the proper handling of collections and deposits to avoid any mishandling of government funds deserves administrative sanction and not even the full payment of the shortages shall exempt him from liability.<br><br>As to Abella, the OCA found that while she died on December 10, 2005, after the issuance of the November 23, 2005 Resolution of the Court directing her to pay the shortages and to explain the charges against her, the directive was only received on January 11, 2006. Thus, there was no actual service of notice to Abella since she was already dead at that time. Because of lack of due process, the OCA opined that the administrative complaint against Abella should be dismissed.<br><br>Given the above findings, the OCA recommended that:<br><br><blockquote>A) Judge ISMAEL L.

To avoid further delay and to prevent any occurrence of shortages in the court’s funds, this Court will proceed with the resolution of the consolidated cases without prejudice to the evaluation of the OCA of the compliances to directives in the February 18, 2009 Resolution pertaining to the second audit submitted by Palero, Aventurado, Benemile, Catubag, Obero, Camisura and Iligan.<br><br>The Court is confronted with two main issues in the instant cases: (1) Is the death of the respondent in an administrative case a ground for the dismissal of the case against him? (2) Should respondents be held administratively liable for the shortages in the court’s funds found by the audit team?<br><br><b><i>The death of the respondent in an administrative <br>case does not automatically divest this Court of <br>jurisdiction over the case.</i></b><br><br>Jurisprudence is settled that the death of a respondent does not preclude a finding of administrative liability subject to certain exceptions. In the case of <i>Gonzales v. Escalona,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> this Court expounded on this doctrine:<br><br><blockquote>While his death intervened after the completion of the investigation, it has been settled that the Court is not ousted of its jurisdiction over an administrative matter by the mere fact that the respondent public official ceases to hold office during the pendency of the respondent’s case; jurisdiction once acquired, continues to exist until the final resolution of the case. In Layao, Jr. v. Caube, we held that the death of the respondent in an administrative case does not preclude a finding of administrative liability:<br><br><blockquote>“This jurisdiction that was ours at the time of the filing of the administrative complainant was not lost by the mere fact that the respondent public official had ceased in office during the pendency of his case. The Court retains its jurisdiction either to pronounce the respondent public official innocent of the charges or declared him guilty thereof. A contrary rule would be fraught with injustice and pregnant with dreadful and dangerous implications ... If innocent, respondent public official merits vindication of his name and integrity as he leaves the government which he has served well and faithfully; if guilty, he deserves to receive the corresponding censure and a penalty proper and imposable under the situation.”</blockquote><br>The above rule is not without exceptions, as we explained in the case of <i>Limliman v. Judge Ulat-Marrero,</i> where we said that death of the respondent necessitates the dismissal of the administrative case upon a consideration of any of the following factors: <i>first</i>, the observance of respondent’s right to due process; <i>second</i>, the presence of exceptional circumstances in the case on the grounds of equitable and humanitarian reasons; and <i>third</i>, it may also depend on the kind of penalty imposed. None of these exceptional considerations are present in the case.<br><br>The dismissal of an administrative case against a deceased respondent on the ground of lack of due process is proper under the circumstances of a given case when, because of his death, the respondent can no longer defend himself. Conversely, the resolution of the case may continue to its due resolution notwithstanding the death of the respondent if the latter has been given the opportunity to be heard, as in this case, or in instances where the continuance thereof will be more advantageous and beneficial to the respondent’s heirs.<br><br>In <i>Judicial Audit Report, Branches 21, 32 and 36</i>, we recognized the dismissal of an administrative case by reason of the respondent’s death for equitable and humanitarian considerations; the liability was incurred by reason of the respondent’s poor health. We had occasion, too, to take into account the imposable administrative penalty in determining whether an administrative case should be continued. We observed in several cases that the penalty of fine could still be imposed notwithstanding the death of the respondent, enforceable against his or her estate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> (Citations omitted.)</blockquote><br>As in <i>Gonzales</i>, none of the exceptions exist in the cases of Judge Salubre and Edig. As correctly found by the OCA, both were served copies of this Court’s Resolution dated November 23, 2005 as well as the directive of the investigating judge for them to answer the charges against them. Thus, there was no violation of their right to due process as they were given the opportunity to be heard. Humanitarian considerations can neither be a ground for dismissal since there was no allegation or proof that the liabilities were incurred due to poor health. Also, if the imposable penalty is to be considered to determine if the instant cases against them should still continue, a fine may still be imposed or even a forfeiture of their retirement benefits if deemed proper.<br><br>On the other hand, Abella’s case is different. She died before a copy of the November 23, 2005 Resolution was served on her. As no actual service was made, Abella did not have the chance to defend herself against the charges hurled against her. Hence, the dismissal of the administrative case against her is in order.<br><br>We now go to the administrative liabilities of Judge Salubre, Edig, Palero, Aventurado and Benemile.<br><br><i><b>Re: Judge Ismael Salubre</b></i><br><br>A vital administrative function of a judge is effective management of his court, and this includes control of the conduct of the court’s ministerial officers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> He has the responsibility to see to it that his clerk of court performs his duties and observes the circulars issued by the Supreme Court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> and that includes the safekeeping and on-time remittance of the legal fees collected. Clearly, Judge Salubre miserably failed to fulfill this duty. Worse, he even borrowed money from the court funds. The audit team discovered several withdrawal slips containing acknowledgments by Judge Salubre evidencing that he received the cash bonds of dismissed cases and forfeited cash bonds. Based on the statements of Palero and Aventurado, this was one of the primary reasons why there were delays in the remittances– because the clerk of court or the cash clerk had to wait for Judge Salubre to return the amounts he borrowed before they can deposit them. The shortages attributed to Judge Salubre totaling to P436,800, on the other hand, pertain to the amounts he borrowed but failed to return. Having remained uncontroverted, all these pieces of evidence undoubtedly establish the culpability of Judge Salubre for gross misconduct.<br><br><b><i>Re: Nerio L. Edig<br></i></b><br>As can be gathered from the documentary evidence collected by the audit team, it was established that there were unauthorized withdrawals from the Fiduciary Fund amounting to P5,684,875 while Edig was Clerk of Court. As Clerk of Court, he is primarily accountable for all funds that are collected for the court, whether personally received by him or by a duly appointed cashier who is under his supervision and control. Being the custodian of the court’s funds, revenues, and records, Edig is likewise liable for any loss, shortage, destruction, or impairment of said funds and property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Moreover, it was likewise found that there were delays in the remittances of the court funds during his tenure. Clerks of Court have always been reminded of their duty to immediately deposit the various funds received by them to the authorized government depositories for they are not supposed to keep funds in their custody.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> The non-remittance of said amounts deprived the Court of the interest that may be earned if the amounts were deposited in a bank, as prudently required. Shortages in the amounts to be remitted and the years of delay in the actual remittance constitute gross neglect of duty for which Edig should be held administratively liable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br><b><i>Re: Delia R. Palero and Macario H.S. Aventurado</i></b><br><br>We agree with the OCA that both Palero and Aventurado were remiss in their duties as cash clerks. They tried to exculpate themselves from liability by blaming others for the shortages discovered and delay in the remittances. In several decisions, the Court has ruled that the failure of a public officer to remit funds upon demand by an authorized officer constitutes <i>prima facie</i> evidence that the public officer has put such missing funds or property to personal use.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Thus, they are not only guilty of gross neglect of duty in the performance of their duty for their failure to timely turn over the cash deposited with them but also gross dishonesty.<br><br><b><i>Re: Sheriff Carlito B. Benemile</i></b><br><br>As found by the OCA, Benemile should be made to answer for his failure to file a return in one criminal case. Section 14, Rule 39 of the <u>1997 Rules of Civil Procedure</u>, as amended, provides that it is mandatory for sheriffs to execute and make a return on the writ of execution within 30 days from receipt of the writ and every 30 days thereafter until it is satisfied in full or its effectivity expires. Even if the writs are unsatisfied or only partially satisfied, sheriffs must still file the reports so that the court, as well as the litigants, may be informed of the proceedings undertaken to implement the writ.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> For said omission, Benemile is guilty of simple neglect of duty.<br><br><b><i>The penalties</i></b><br><br>Grave misconduct, gross neglect of duty and gross dishonesty of which Judge Salubre, Edig, Palero and Aventurado are found guilty, even if committed for the first time, are punishable by dismissal and carries with it the forfeiture of retirement benefits, except accrued leave benefits, and the perpetual disqualification for reemployment in the government service.<br><br>As to Judge Salubre and Edig, however, in view of their deaths, the supreme penalty of dismissal cannot be imposed on them anymore. We however do not agree with the OCA’s recommendation that they will only be fined but their heirs will still be entitled to their retirement benefits. It is only the penalty of dismissal that is rendered futile by their passing since they are not in the service anymore, but it is still within the Court’s power to forfeit their retirement benefits as in the recent case of <i>Office of the Court Administrator v. Noel R. Ong, Deputy Sheriff, Branch 49, and Alvin A. Buencamino, Deputy Sheriff, Branch 53 of the Metropolitan Trial Court, Caloocan City.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> In said case, the Court ordered the forfeiture of the retirement benefits, except accrued leave credits, of Buencamino, who was found guilty of grave misconduct and gross neglect of duty, but died during the pendency of the case.<br><br>As to Benemile, instead of the P1,000 fine recommended by the OCA, a suspension of one month and one day is meted on him for being found guilty of simple neglect of duty, a less grave offense, pursuant to Section 52.B (1), Rule IV of the <i><u>Uniform Rules in Administrative Cases in the Civil Service.</u></i><br><br><b><i>The restitution of shortages</i></b><br><br>In this Court’s February 18, 2009 Resolution, the terminal leave benefits of Judge Salubre, Edig and Abella were ordered forfeited to answer for the computed shortages found by the audit team.
