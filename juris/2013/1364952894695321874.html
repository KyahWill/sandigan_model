				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The recantation of her testimony by the victim of rape is to be disregarded if the records show that it was impelled either by intimidation or by the need for the financial support of the accused.<br><br>This rule comes to the forefront once again in our review of the affirmance by the Court of Appeals (CA) of the conviction for two counts of rape of Tomas Teodoro y Angeles,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> in which the victim, AAA,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>&nbsp; was the 8-year old daughter of BBB, his common-law wife. The Regional Trial Court had pronounced Teodoro guilty of two counts of statutory rape on December 10, 2001, and condignly meted him the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> for each count.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br><center><b>Antecedents</b><br></center><br>Two informations, both dated March 25, 1998, charged Teodoro with statutory rape committed as follows:<br><br><blockquote><center>Criminal Case No. 98-02<br></center><br>That on or about the 18<sup>th</sup> day of December, 1997, at, 10:00 o’clock in the evening, more or less, in Sitio Seringan, Poblacion, Kitcharao, Agusan del Norte, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, said accused, by means of force and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge of AAA, an eight (8) year old minor.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW: (Article 335, <i>Revised Penal Code</i>, as amended by R.A. 7659)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br><center>Criminal Case No. 98-03<br></center><br>That on or about the 8<sup>th</sup> day of February, 1998, at 10:00 o’clock in the evening, more or less, in Sitio Seringan, Poblacion, Kitcharao, Agusan del Norte, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, said accused by means of force and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge of AAA, an eight (8) year old minor.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW:&nbsp; (Article 335, <i>Revised Penal Code</i>, as amended by R.A. 7659)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></blockquote><br>With respect to the statutory rape charged in Criminal Case No. 98-02, the records show that on December 18, 1997 BBB left home in Kitcharao, Agusan del Norte on an errand in Surigao; that her children, including AAA, were left under the care of Teodoro, her common-law husband; that late that night, he returned home drunk, and his arrival roused the children from their sleep, because they had not yet eaten; that they eagerly ate the food he set down for them; that soon after the dinner, he told the children to go to bed; that the children went to sleep in their respective places on the floor; that AAA became puzzled when he turned off the lights that were supposed to be left on; that AAA eventually fell asleep beside her siblings; that at some point later in the night, he roused AAA, and ordered her to strip naked; that she initially defied him, but he himself then undressed her; that he took off his pants and drawers down to his knees, exposing his penis; that he went on top of her, inserted his penis in her vagina, and made push and pull movements; that she felt a sharp pain inside her vagina; that he stopped his movements when she protested due to her pain becoming unbearable, because he did not want the other children to be roused from sleep; that he returned to his own place, but she got up to relieve herself; that she felt searing pain in her vagina as she was relieving herself; and that she did not tell her mother upon the latter’s return from Surigao about what Teodoro had done to her.<br><br>Anent the rape committed on February 8, 1998 (Criminal Case No. 98-03), BBB was again away from the house, having gone to Manila. Teodoro committed the rape in a fashion similar to that in the first rape. However, AAA could no longer bear her ordeal, and told of the rapes to CCC, the older brother of BBB: <i>Tay, guihilabtan ko ni Tomas Teodoro (Tay, I was touched by Tomas Teodoro)</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> CCC immediately reported the crimes to the Kitcharao Police Station. The police quickly arrested Teodoro. Upon BBB’s return in the afternoon, CCC informed her about what Teodoro had done to her daughter. BBB and CCC took AAA to the Kitcharao District Hospital for physical and medical examination.<br><br>Dr. Mary Ann D. Abrenillo of the Kitcharao District Hospital examined AAA, and issued a medical certificate on her findings, as follows:<br><br><blockquote><ol><li>Intact Hymen that admits Right Small Finger of examiner and with slight peripheral erythema.<br><br></li><li>Labia Majora and Minora slightly Gaped Exposing Hymenal Opening, with tenderness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></li></ol></blockquote><br>Based on the medical certificate, the Office of the Provincial Prosecutor of Agusan del Norte charged Teodoro with two counts of statutory rape through the aforequoted informations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>At his arraignment on August 17, 1998, Teodoro pleaded <i>not guilty</i> to the informations. Although he subsequently manifested a willingness to change the pleas to <i>guilty</i>, he balked when he was re-arraigned on December 23, 1998 by qualifying that he had only “fingered” AAA. Accordingly, the RTC reinstated his pleas of <i>not guilty</i>.<br><br>During the trial, AAA<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> and BBB<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> testified for the Prosecution, but two years later recanted and turned hostile towards the Prosecution, now telling the RTC that Teodoro had only touched AAA’s vagina on the nights of December 18, 1997 and February 8, 1998.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>On his part, Teodoro claimed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> that he had only caressed or touched AAA’s body on the night of February 8, 1998; that before going home from work on that day, he had joined his friends in drinking <i>Kulafu</i>; that he had arrived home late that night, and had gone to bed after serving the children food to eat; that he had later awakened to find somebody sleeping beside him; that he had embraced and caressed the different parts of the body of that person, whom he thought was BBB whom he had earlier sent off to Surigao on an errand; that he had realized that he was caressing AAA only after she shouted: <i>Cle, Cle, ayaw! </i>(<i>Uncle, stop that</i>!); that he had then gotten up to go to a different part of the room;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> and that he did not rape AAA on the night of December 18, 1997,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> although he admitted being at home then.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br><center><b>Ruling of the RTC</b></center><br>After the trial, on December 10, 2001, the RTC rendered its judgment convicting Teodoro on both counts of statutory rape notwithstanding the recantations by AAA and BBB.&nbsp; The RTC disposed:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in the light of all the foregoing, the Court finds the accused TOMAS TEODORO Y ANGELES in Criminal Cases Nos. 98-02 and 98-03 GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crimes of rape committed against AAA, an eight (8)-year old minor.&nbsp; Accordingly, he is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA in each of the cases, with the accessories provided for by law, to pay the offended party the sum of P100,000.00, P50,000.00 for each case, and to pay the costs.<br><br>In the service of his sentence, accused is credited with the full time during which he has undergone preventive imprisonment conformably to Article 29 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended.<br><br>IT IS SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></blockquote><br>The RTC rejected AAA’s recantation of her accusation for being inconsistent with the testimony of Dr. Abrenillo showing that the redness on the edges of the protective structure of her vaginal opening had been caused by friction from the forceful introduction of an erect penis; and that such forceful introduction of an erect penis had led to the gaping of the <i>labia minora</i> and<i> labia majora</i> of AAA.<br><br><center><b>Ruling of the CA</b><br></center><br>On appeal, Teodoro focused on the RTC’s rejection of AAA’s recantation. He argued in his appellant’s brief<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> that no rape was committed considering that the Cebuano-Visayan word <i>guihilabtan</i> used by AAA in describing what he did to her signified only touching, as contrasted with <i>lugos,</i> the proper Cebuano-Visayan term for rape that AAA did not use.<br><br>Unimpressed, the CA sustained the RTC, and ignored AAA’s recantation for being dictated by her family’s financial difficulties. It agreed with the observation of the Office of the Solicitor General to the effect that AAA’s recantation should not be considered because it came about after she had returned home from the custody of the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD). In contrast, it found AAA’s court testimony given on November 17, 1998 consistent with the physical findings of Dr. Abrenillo.<br><br>The CA decreed:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, herein appeal is hereby <b>DISMISSED</b> for evident lack of merit and the assailed Judgment is hereby <b>AFFIRMED</b> with <b>MODIFICATION</b> granting in each case moral damages in the amount of P50,000.00 and exemplary damages in the sum of P25,000.00.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br></blockquote><br><center><b>Issues</b><br></center><br><blockquote><ol><li>Were the rapes charged against Teodoro established beyond reasonable doubt?<br></li><li>Should the recantation by AAA be accepted?</li></ol></blockquote><br><center><b>Ruling of the Court</b><br></center><br>The appeal lacks merit.<br><br>Articles 266-A and 266-B of the <i>Revised Penal Code</i>, as amended by Republic Act No. 8353,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> define and punish rape as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Article 266-A.&nbsp; <i>Rape; When and How Committed. – Rape is committed –</i><br><br>1) By a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the circumstances:<br><br>a) Through force, threat, or intimidation;<br><br>b) When the offended party is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious;<br><br>c) By means of fraudulent machinations or grave abuse of authority; and<br><br>d) When the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age or is demented, even though none of the circumstances mentioned above be present.<br><br>Article 266-B. <i>Penalties.</i> – Rape under paragraph 1 of the next preceding article shall be punished by <i>reclusion perpetua.</i><br><br>x x x x</blockquote><br>The crimes charged were two counts of statutory rape. The elements of statutory rape are that: (a) the victim is a female under 12 years or is demented; and (b) the offender has carnal knowledge of the victim. Considering that the essence of statutory rape is carnal knowledge of a female <i>without her consent</i>, neither the use of force, threat or intimidation on the female, nor the female’s deprivation of reason or being otherwise unconscious, nor the employment on the female of fraudulent machinations or grave abuse of authority is necessary to commit statutory rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Full penile penetration of the female’s genitalia is not likewise required, because carnal knowledge is simply the act of a man having sexual bodily connections with a woman.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Describing the rape committed against her on December 18, 1997, AAA declared thus:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0" align="CENTER"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">How about your uncle, Tomas Teodoro, do you know what did he do after you have already eaten and drank water? </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Yes.

AAA’s recollections given in court when she was only eight years old disclosed an unbroken and consistent narration of her ordeals at his hands. She thereby revealed details that no child of her very tender age could have invented or concocted. The only rational and natural conclusion to be made by any objective arbiter is to accord the fullest credence to her.<br><br>Yet, Teodoro would have us undo his convictions for statutory rape, arguing that AAA’s description of his acts in Cebuano-Visayan, the dialect spoken by AAA, was <i>guihilabtan</i>, not <i>lugos</i>, the former being the dialect term for <i>touching</i> and the latter for <i>rape.</i><br><br>Teodoro’s argument is directly belied by the established facts. AAA remained categorical and steadfast about what Teodoro had done to her all throughout her testimony in court, even during her delivery of the supposed recantation.

Campuhan</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> that the mere touching of the external genitalia by a penis <i>capable of consummating the sexual act</i> is sufficient to constitute carnal knowledge. All that is necessary to reach the consummated stage of rape is for the penis of the accused capable of consummating the sexual act to come into contact with the lips of the pudendum of the victim.&nbsp; This means that the rape is consummated once the penis of the accused capable of consummating the sexual act <i>touches</i> either <i>labia</i> of the pudendum. As the Court has explained in <i>People v. Bali-Balita,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> the <i>touching</i> that constitutes rape does not mean mere epidermal contact, or stroking or grazing of organs, or a slight brush or a scrape of the penis on the external layer of the victim’s vagina, or the <i>mons pubis</i>, but rather the erect penis touching the <i>labias</i> or sliding into the female genitalia. Accordingly, the conclusion that touching the <i>labia majora</i> or the labia minora of the pudendum constitutes consummated rape proceeds from the physical fact that the <i>labias</i> are physically situated beneath the <i>mons pubis</i> or the vaginal surface, such that for the penis to touch either of them is to attain some degree of penetration beneath the surface of the female genitalia. It is required, however, that this manner of touching of the <i>labias</i> must be sufficiently and convincingly established.<br><br>Here, the proof of the penis of Teodoro touching the <i>labias</i> of AAA was sufficient and convincing.&nbsp; Dr. Abrenillo found the peripheral erythema in the hymen of AAA and the fact that her <i>labia majora</i> and <i>labia minora</i> were tender and gaping, exposing the hymenal opening. In other words, the touching by Teodoro’s penis had gone beyond the <i>mons pubis</i> and had reached the <i>labias</i> of the victim.&nbsp; Such physical findings, coupled with the narrative of AAA that, <i>one</i>, Teodoro went on top of her body; <i>two</i>, he inserted his penis into her vagina; <i>three</i>, he made push and pull motions thereafter; and, <i>four</i>, she felt great pain inside her during his push and pull movements, rendered the findings of rape against him unassailable as to the rape committed on February 8, 1998. With respect to the rape committed on December 18, 1997, we concur with the RTC and CA’s conclusion that AAA’s testimonial account thereon likewise sufficiently and convincingly established the commission of rape. She suffered severe pain inside her genitalia while his penis was penetrating her, which could only be understood in the light of the foregoing explanation made herein about his penis attaining some degree of penetration beneath the surface of her genitalia.<br><br>Apart from being incompatible with the established facts, Teodoro’s argument remained a matter of pure semantics. For sure, <i>rape</i> as defined and used by the <i>Revised Penal Code</i> is a legal term whose exact nuances and juridical consequences no victim of AAA’s tender age and naivete could already fully know or realize.&nbsp; As such, her usage of the term <i>guihilabtan</i> to describe in the dialect what he had done to her should not be confined to what he would have us accept as the entire characterization of his deeds. Indeed, his argument on the distinction between the dialect terms <i>guihilabtan</i> and <i>lugos</i> reflected nothing better than his self-serving opinion on their meanings. Such opinion, already by its nature argumentative, should not prevail over the physical evidence. Worse, it was not even relevant, for what he ought to have done, instead, was to flesh out his opinion through a credible demonstration during the trial that by her usage of the dialect term <i>guihilabtan</i> she really meant mere touching of her genitalia that did not amount to his having carnal knowledge of her.<br><br>Teodoro’s further submission that AAA recanted the accusations against him is bereft of substance.<br><br>The relevant portions of AAA’s recantation on November 20, 2000 went as follows:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0" align="CENTER"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Now, it appears that during the time that you were made to testify, you testified before this honorable court that your stepfather had carnal knowledge with you, the question is – why did you make that testimony before?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A:</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Because I saw him doing that to me, Sir</span>.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q:</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Which one?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A: </div></td> <td style="font-weight: bold;"><div align="JUSTIFY">Because he undressed me and he touched my private parts.

But a recantation under such insincere circumstances was unacceptable.<br><br>As a rule, recantation is viewed with disfavor firstly because the recantation of her testimony by a vital witness of the State like AAA is exceedingly unreliable, and secondly because there is always the possibility that such recantation may later be repudiated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Indeed, to disregard testimony solemnly given in court simply because the witness recants it ignores the possibility that intimidation or monetary considerations may have caused the recantation. Court proceedings, in which testimony upon oath or affirmation is required to be truthful under all circumstances, are trivialized by the recantation. The trial in which the recanted testimony was given is made a mockery, and the investigation is placed at the mercy of an unscrupulous witness. Before allowing the recantation, therefore, the court must not be too willing to accept it, but must test its value in a public trial with sufficient opportunity given to the party adversely affected to cross-examine the recanting witness both upon the substance of the recantation and the motivations for it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> The recantation, like any other testimony, is subject to the test of credibility based on the relevant circumstances, including the demeanor of the recanting witness on the stand. In that respect, the finding of the trial court on the credibility of witnesses is entitled to great weight on appeal unless cogent reasons necessitate its re-examination, the reason being that the trial court is in a better position to hear first-hand and observe the deportment, conduct and attitude of the witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Finally, we rectify the amounts of the civil liability of Teodoro.&nbsp; The RTC had granted to AAA only the amount of P50,000.00 for each case, or a total of P100,000.00 for both cases, without stating the character of the award, but the CA modified the award by granting in each case moral damages of P50,000.00 and exemplary damages of P25,000.00.<br><br>Both lower courts thereby erred. There is no longer any debate that the victim in statutory rape is entitled to a civil indemnity of P50,000.00, moral damages of&nbsp; P50,000.00, and exemplary damages of P30,000.00.
