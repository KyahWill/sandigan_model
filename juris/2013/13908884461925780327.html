The party-list representatives shall constitute twenty per centum (20%) of the total number of the members of the House of Representatives including those under the party-list.<br><br>For purposes of the May 1998 elections, the first five (5) major political parties on the basis of party representation in the House of Representatives at the start of the Tenth Congress of the Philippines shall not be entitled to participate in the party-list system.<br><br>In determining the allocation of seats for the second vote, the following procedure shall be observed:<br><blockquote>(a) The parties, organizations, and coalitions shall be ranked from the highest to the lowest based on the number of votes they garnered during the elections.<br><br>(b) The parties, organizations, and coalitions receiving at least two percent (2%) of <b>the total votes cast for the party-list system</b> shall be entitled to one seat each: Provided, That those garnering more than two percent (2%) of the votes shall be entitled to additional seats in proportion to their total number of votes: Provided, finally, That each party, organization, or coalition shall be entitled to not more than three (3) seats.<br></blockquote>Section 12. <i>Procedure in Allocating Seats for Party-List Representatives</i>. The COMELEC shall tally all the votes for the parties, organizations, or coalitions on a nationwide basis, rank them according to the number of votes received and allocate party-list representatives proportionately according to the percentage of votes obtained by each party, organization, or coalition as against the <b>total nationwide votes cast for the party-list system</b>. (Emphasis provided)<br></blockquote>The petitioner argues that the correct interpretation of the provisions of Republic Act No. 7941 or the Party-list Law does not distinguish between valid and invalid votes, to wit:<br><blockquote>Therefore, votes for specific party lists are not the same as votes for the party-list system. Hence, people whose votes were spoiled for instance (like checking or failure to properly shade the ovals in the ballots, or voted for two party lists when the requirement is only one, or had erasures on their ballots for instance), or did not vote for any party-list at all <b>are still voters for the party-list system</b>.

It also proposes its own interpretation of the formula to determine the proportional representation of party-list candidates in the House of Representatives. However despite any new computation, ARARO’s proposed divisor of total votes cast for the party-list system whether valid or invalid still fails to secure one seat for ARARO.

We held that the correct formula to be used is the one used in <i>Veterans</i> and reiterated it in <i>Ang Bagong Bayani</i> – <i>OFW Labor Party v. COMELEC</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> This Court in <i>CIBAC v.

COMELEC</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> we declared the 2% threshold in relation to the distribution of the additional seats as void. We said in that case that:<br><blockquote>x x x The two percent threshold presents an unwarranted obstacle to the full implementation of Section 5(2), Article VI of the Constitution and prevents the attainment of “the broadest possible representation of party, sectoral or group interests in the House of Representatives.” (Republic Act No. 7941, Section 2)<br><br>x x x x<br><br>x x x There are two steps in the second round of seat allocation. <i>First</i>, the percentage is multiplied by the remaining available seats, 38, which is the difference between the 55 maximum seats reserved under the Party-List System and the 17 guaranteed seats of the two-percenters. The whole integer of the product of the percentage and of the remaining available seats corresponds to a party’s share in the remaining available seats. <i>Second</i>, we assign one party-list seat to each of the parties next in rank until all available seats are completely distributed. We distributed all of the remaining 38 seats in the second round of seat allocation. <i>Finally</i>, we apply the three-seat cap to determine the number of seats each qualified party-list candidate is entitled.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br></blockquote>The most recent <i>Atong Paglaum v. COMELEC</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> does not in any way modify the formula set in <i>Veterans</i>. It only corrects the definition of valid party-list groups. We affirmed that party-list groups may be national, regional, and sectoral parties or organizations. We abandoned the requirement introduced in <i>Ang Bagong Bayani</i> that all party-list groups should prove that they represent a “marginalized” or “under-represented” sector.<br><br>Proportional representation is provided in Section 2 of Republic Act No. 7941.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> <i>BANAT</i> overturned <i>Veterans</i>’ interpretation of the phrase <i>in proportion to their total number of votes</i>. We clarified that the interpretation that only those that obtained at least 2% of the votes may get additional seats will not result in proportional representation because it will make it impossible for the party-list seats to be filled completely. As demonstrated in BANAT, the 20% share may never be filled if the 2% threshold is maintained.<br><br>The divisor, thus, helps to determine the correct percentage of representation of party-list groups as intended by the law. This is part of the <i>index of proportionality</i> of the representation of a party-list to the House of Representatives.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> It measures the relation between the share of the total seats and the share of the total votes of the party-list.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> In <i>Veterans</i>, where the 20% requirement in the Constitution was treated only as a ceiling, the mandate for proportional representation was not achieved, and thus, was held void by this Court.<br><br>The petitioner now argues that the votes of all the registered voters who actually voted in the May 2010 elections should be included in the computation of the divisor whether valid or invalid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> According to the petitioner, <b>votes cast for the party-list candidates</b> is not the same as the <b>votes cast under or for the party-list system</b>. Specifically, it said that:<br><blockquote>The party list system is not just for the specific party lists as provided in the ballot, but pertains to the system of selection of the party list to be part of the House of Representatives.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></blockquote>The petitioner claims that there should be no distinction in law between <i>valid</i> and <i>invalid</i> votes. Invalid votes include those votes that were made for disqualified party-list groups, votes that were spoiled due to improper shading, erasures in the ballots, and even those that did not vote for any party-list candidate at all.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> All of the votes should be included in the divisor to determine the 2% threshold.<br><br><b>We agree with the petitioner but only to the extent that votes later on determined to be invalid due to no cause attributable to the voter should not be excluded in the divisor. In other words, votes cast validly for a party-list group listed in the ballot but later on disqualified should be counted as part of the divisor. To do otherwise would be to disenfranchise the voters who voted on the basis of good faith that that ballot contained all the qualified candidates. However, following this rationale, party-list groups listed in the ballot but whose disqualification attained finality prior to the elections and whose disqualification was reasonably made known by the Commission on Elections to the voters prior to such elections should not be included in the divisor.</b><br><br>Not all votes cast in the elections should be included in the divisor. Contrary to the argument of the petitioner, Section 11(b) of Republic Act No. 7941 is clear that only those votes cast <i><u>for the party-list system</u></i> shall be considered in the computation of the percentage of representation:<br><blockquote>(b) The parties, organizations, and coalitions receiving at least two percent (2%) of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">total votes cast for the party-list system</span> shall be entitled to one seat each: Provided, That those garnering more than two percent (2%) of the votes shall be entitled to additional seats in proportion to their total number of votes: Provided, finally, That each party, organization, or coalition shall be entitled to not more than three (3) seats. (Emphasis provided)</blockquote>The total votes cast do not include invalid votes. The <i>invalid votes</i>, for the determination of the denominator, may be votes that were spoiled or votes that resulted from the following: improper shading or having no shade at all;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> existence of stray or ambiguous marks;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> tears in the ballot; and/or ballots rejected by the Precinct Count Optical Scan (PCOS) machines under the paper-based<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> automated election system. All these are causes that nullify the count for that vote that can be attributable to the voter’s action.<br><br>Votes cast for the party-list system should, however, include all votes cast for party-list groups contained in the ballot even if subsequently they are disqualified by the Commission on Elections or by our courts. Thus, the content of the divisor in the formula to determine the seat allocation for the party-list component of the House of Representatives should be amended accordingly.<br><br>We qualify that the divisor to be used in interpreting the formula used in BANAT is the <u><i>total votes cast for the party-list system.

Declaration of Policy. - The State shall promote proportional representation in the election of representatives to the House of Representatives through a party-list system of registered national, regional and sectoral parties or organizations or coalitions thereof, which will enable Filipino citizens belonging to the marginalized and underrepresented sectors, organizations and parties, and who lack well-defined political constituencies but who could contribute to the formulation and enactment of appropriate legislation that will benefit the nation as a whole, to become members of the House of Representatives. <b>Towards this end, the State shall develop and guarantee a full, free and open party system in order to attain the broadest possible representation of party, sectoral or group interests in the House of Representatives by enhancing their chances to compete for and win seats in the legislature, and shall provide the simplest scheme possible.</b> (Emphasis provided)</blockquote>Section 10 of Republic Act No. 7941, which governs party-list elections, states that votes cast for a party-list “not entitled to be voted for shall not be counted.” It does not specify any reckoning period of the finding of disqualification or cancellation of registration for the validity or the invalidity of votes unlike that in Section 72 of the Omnibus Election Code, as amended by Section 6, Republic Act No. 6646.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> Taking Sections 2 and 10 together, this Court must consider the intention of the law and the nature of Philippine style party-list elections. Party-list groups provide for a different and special representation in Congress. To disregard votes of party-list groups disqualified after the conduct of the elections means the disenfranchisement of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of votes, of the Filipino people. Definitely, it is not the voter’s fault that the party-list group in the ballot it votes for will be subsequently disqualified. The voter should not be penalized.<br><br>The counting of votes for party-list groups in the ballot but subsequently declared as disqualified is, thus, corollary to the “fundamental tenet of representative democracy that the people should be allowed to choose whom they please to govern them.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> It is also part of the right of suffrage, and the law’s intention to ensure a more representative Congress should be given priority.<br><br>Therefore, the divisor should now include all votes cast for party-list groups that are subsequently disqualified for so long as they were presented as a choice to the electorate.<br><br>If his or her vote is not counted as part of the divisor, then this would amount to a disenfranchisement of a basic constitutional right to be able to choose representatives of the House of Representatives in two ways.

Commission on Elections</i>, G.R. No. 163776. April 24, 2007, 522 SCRA 23; 550 Phil. 209 (2007). This case involves the cancellation of the certificate of candidacy of Rev. Fr. Nardo B. Cayat as mayoralty candidate of Buguias, Benguet in the May 10, 2004 local elections. We said in this case that Section 6 of Rep. Act No. 6646 covers two situations. One situation is when the disqualification becomes final before the elections and the other situation is when the disqualification becomes final after the elections. Petitioner Cayat’s case falls under the first situation wherein a candidate disqualified by final judgment before an election cannot be voted for, and votes cast for him shall be considered stray and not counted. The Court held that the Resolution disqualifying petitioner Cayat became final on April 17, 2004, or way before the May 10, 2004 elections due to the non-payment of the required filing fee for the Motion for Reconsideration.<br><div align="JUSTIFY"><br><hr align="center" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><br><div style="text-align: center;">CONCURRING AND DISSENTING OPINION<br></div><br>VELASCO, JR., J.:<br><br>The sole issue in the present case revolves around the application of the phrase “total votes cast for the party-list system” in Republic Act No. (RA) 7941, otherwise known as the “Party-List System Act.”<br><br>Petitioner is of the position that the phrase refers to the total number of voters who actually voted less the number of votes for party list organizations (PLOs) disqualified before the actual elections. In other words, petitioner maintains that “votes that were spoiled or were not made for any party list” as well as votes cast in favor of PLOs disqualified after the actual elections must be counted in determining the “total votes cast for the party-list system.” Respondent, on the other hand, maintains otherwise arguing that only “valid votes” and votes cast in favor of PLOs not otherwise declared disqualified should be included in the “total votes cast for the part-list system.”<br><br>The issue is of particular significance as its resolution determines the proper divisor of the formula applied in <i>BANAT v. COMELEC</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> to determine a PLO’s percentage of votes garnered and thus its entitlement to a seat or two in congress. It is, therefore, of utmost relevance that the present petition is given the proper consideration by this Court.<br><br>I agree that the divisor representing the “total votes cast for the party-list system” should include valid votes cast for PLOs disqualified with finality after the day of elections but not PLOs disqualified with finality before the day of elections.<br><br>Whether preceded by the adverb “under,” used in Section 6 of RA 7941, or the preposition “for,” used in Sections 11 and 12 of RA 7941, the “party-list system” still refers to a mechanism of proportional representation in the election of representatives from “national, regional and sectoral parties or organizations or coalitions thereof <b>registered</b> with the Commission on Elections.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> It is, therefore, necessary for the inclusion of the votes in the “total votes cast for the party-list system” that the PLO voted for is qualified, i.e., registered with the COMELEC, on the day of the elections. Thus, when the vote is in favor of a PLO that had been removed or cancelled under Section 6 of RA 7941 and thus disqualified with finality before the election, the vote can only be considered “stray votes” and therefore invalid; it cannot be considered as a valid vote or included in the “total votes cast for the party-list system.”<br><br>Section 72 of the Omnibus Election Code, as amended by Section 6 of RA 6646, clearly provides for the effect of a disqualification on a candidate before the day of elections, which under the party-list system is a PLO:<br><blockquote>Sec. 6. Effect of Disqualification Case. - <b>Any candidate who has been declared by final judgment to be disqualified shall not be voted for, and the votes cast for him shall not be counted.</b> If for any reason a candidate is not declared by final judgment before an election to be disqualified and he is voted for and receives the winning number of votes in such election, the Court or Commission shall continue with the trial and hearing of the action, inquiry, or protest and, upon motion of the complainant or any intervenor, may during the pendency thereof order the suspension of the proclamation of such candidate whenever the evidence of his guilt is strong. (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote>In <i>Cayat v. COMELEC</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> this Court declared as “stray” the votes cast in favor of a candidate disqualified with finality <i>before</i> the election even if his name remained in the ballot. We held, thus:<br><blockquote>The law expressly declares that a candidate disqualified by final judgment before an election cannot be voted for, and votes cast for him shall not be counted. This is a mandatory provision of law. Section 6 of Republic Act No. 6646, The Electoral Reforms Law of 1987, states:<br><blockquote>Sec. 6. Effect of Disqualification Case.— Any candidate who has been declared by final judgment to be disqualified shall not be voted for, and the votes cast for him shall not be counted. If for any reason a candidate is not declared by final judgment before an election to be disqualified and he is voted for and receives the winning number of votes in such election, the Court or Commission shall continue with the trial and hearing of the action, inquiry, or protest and, upon motion of the complainant or any intervenor, may during the pendency thereof order the suspension of the proclamation of such candidate whenever the evidence of his guilt is strong. (Emphasis added)<br></blockquote>Section 6 of the Electoral Reforms Law of 1987 covers two situations. The first is when the disqualification becomes final before the elections, which is the situation covered in the first sentence of Section 6. The second is when the disqualification becomes final after the elections, which is the situation covered in the second sentence of Section 6.<br><br>The present case falls under the first situation. Section 6 of the Electoral Reforms Law governing the first situation is categorical: <b><u>a candidate disqualified by final judgment before an election cannot be voted for, and votes cast for him shall not be counted</u></b>. The Resolution disqualifying Cayat became final on 17 April 2004, way before the 10 May 2004 elections. Therefore, all the 8,164 <b><u>votes cast in Cayat’s favor are stray</u></b>. Cayat was never a candidate in the 10 May 2004 elections. Palileng’s proclamation is proper because he was the sole and only candidate, second to none.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>To allow a candidate disqualified by final judgment 23 days before the elections to be voted for and have his votes counted is a blatant violation of a mandatory provision of the election law. It creates confusion in the results of the elections and invites needless new litigations from a candidate whose disqualification had long become final before the elections. The doctrine on the rejection of the second placer was never meant to apply to a situation where a candidate’s disqualification had become final before the elections.<br></blockquote>Of particular importance is this Court’s June 25, 2003 Resolution in <i>Ang Bagong Bayani-OFW Labor Party v. COMELEC</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> where We emphasized the relevance of Section 10 of RA 7941, which states that “a vote cast for a party, sectoral organization, or coalition not entitled to be voted for shall not be counted x x x.” This Court held that the “total votes cast for the party-list system” include only the votes cast for PLOs <i>qualified</i> to be voted on the day of election, viz:<br><blockquote>Legal Effect of the Disqualifications on the “Total Votes Cast”<br><br>….. The critical question now is this: To determine the “total votes cast for the party-list system,” should the votes tallied for the disqualified candidates be deducted? Otherwise stated, does the clause “total votes cast for the party-list system” include only those ballots cast for <span style="font-style: italic;">qualified</span> party-list candidates?<br><br>To answer this question, there is a need to review related jurisprudence on the matter, especially <i>Labo v. Comelec</i> and <i>Grego v. Comelec</i>, which were mentioned in our February 18, 2003 Resolution.<br><br><i>Labo and Grego <br>Not Applicable</i><br><br>In <i>Labo</i>, the Court declared that “the ineligibility of a candidate receiving majority votes does not entitle the eligible candidate receiving the next highest number of votes to be declared elected. A minority or defeated candidate cannot be deemed elected to the office.” In other words, the votes cast for an ineligible or disqualified candidate cannot be considered “stray.”<br><br>However, “this rule would be different if the electorate, fully aware in fact and in law of a candidate’s disqualification so as to bring such awareness within the realm of notoriety, would nonetheless cast their votes in favor of the ineligible candidate. In such case, the electorate may be said to have waived the validity and efficacy of their votes by notoriously misapplying their franchise or throwing away their votes, in which case, the eligible candidate obtaining the next higher number of votes may be deemed elected.” In short, the votes cast for a “notoriously disqualified” candidate may be considered “stray” and excluded from the canvass.<br><br>The foregoing pronouncement was reiterated in <i>Grego</i>, which held that the exception mentioned in <i>Labo v. Comelec</i> “is predicated on the concurrence of two assumptions, namely: (1) the one who obtained the highest number of votes is disqualified; and (2) the electorate is fully aware in fact and in law of a candidate’s disqualification so as to bring such awareness within the realm of notoriety but would nonetheless cast their votes in favor of the ineligible candidate.”<br><br>Note, however, that the foregoing pronouncements (1) referred to regular elections for local offices and (2) involved the interpretation of Section 6 of RA 6646. They were not meant to cover party-list elections, which are specifically governed by RA 7941. <b><u>Section 10 of this latter law clearly provides that the votes cast for a party, a sectoral organization or a coalition “<i>not entitled to be voted for shall not be counted</i>”:</u></b><br><blockquote>“SEC. 10. <i>Manner of Voting</i>. — Every voter shall be entitled to two (2) votes: the first vote is a vote for candidate for membership of the House of Representatives in his legislative district, and the second, a vote for the party, organization, or coalition he wants represented in the House of Representatives: <b><i>Provided</i>, That a vote cast for a party, sectoral organization, or coalition not entitled to be voted for shall not be counted:</b> <i>Provided, finally</i>, That the first election under the party-list system shall be held in May 1998.” (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><b>The language of the law is clear; hence, there is room, not for interpretation, but merely for application. Likewise, no recourse to extrinsic aids is warranted when the language of the law is plain and unambiguous.</b><br><br>Another reason for not applying <i>Labo</i> and <i>Grego</i> is that these cases involve single elective posts, while the present controversy pertains to the acquisition of a number of congressional seats depending on the total election results — such that even those garnering second, third, fourth or lesser places could be proclaimed winners depending on their compliance with other requirements.<br><br><b>RA 7941 is a special statute governing the elections of party-list representatives and is the controlling law in matters pertaining thereto.</b> Since <i>Labo</i> and Section 6 of RA 6646 came into being prior to the enactment of RA 7941, the latter is a qualification of the former ruling and law. On the other hand, <i>Grego</i> and other related cases that came after the enactment of RA 7941 should be construed as inapplicable to the latter.<br><br>Subtracting the votes garnered by these disqualified party-list groups from the total votes cast under the party-list system will reduce the base figure to 6,523,185. This means that the two-percent threshold can be more easily attained by the <i>qualified</i> marginalized and under-represented groups. Hence, <b>disregarding the votes of disqualified party-list participants will increase and broaden the number of representatives from these sectors. Doing so will further concretize and give flesh to the policy declaration in RA 7941</b>, which we reproduce thus:<br><blockquote>“SEC. 2. <i>Declaration of Policy</i>. — The State shall promote proportional representation in the election of representation in the election of representatives to the House of Representatives through a party-list system of registered, national and sectoral parties or organizations or coalitions thereof, which will enable Filipino citizens belonging to marginalized and underrepresented sectors, organizations and parties, and who lack well-defined political constituencies but who could contribute to the enactment of appropriate legislation that will benefit the nation as a whole, to become members of the House of Representatives. Towards this end, the State shall develop and guarantee a full, free and open party system in order to attain the broadest possible representation of party, sectoral or group interests in the House of Representatives by enhancing their chances to compete for and win seats in the legislature, and shall provide the simplest scheme possible.”<br></blockquote></blockquote>It is therefore in keeping with both the spirit and language of the law on the party-list system that the votes cast in favor of PLOs disqualified with finality <i>before</i> the day of the election be considered invalid and not included in the computation of the “total votes cast for the party-list system.”<br><br>On this note, We must consider the fact of final disqualification of the PLO before the day of election as enough to consider the votes cast in favor of the disqualified PLO as stray votes. The proviso stated in the <i><i>ponencia</i></i> that the “disqualification [must be] reasonably made known by the [COMELEC] to the voters prior to such elections”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> is without legal basis and only serves to weaken Our ruling in <i>Cayat</i>.<br><br>To rule that the votes cast in favor of PLOs disqualified with finality prior to the elections are to be excluded from the divisor only “if the electorate is notified of the finality of their disqualification”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> places the exclusion of these votes on the notoriety of the disqualification of these PLOs. Clearly, this contravenes our ruling in <i>Cayat</i> and similar cases where this Court refused to apply the presumption that the voters remained in the belief that the disqualified PLO is qualified.<br><br>The obscurity of the final disqualification of these PLOs before the day of elections cannot be used as a reason to recognize the validity of their inclusion in the ballot. Otherwise, the qualifications set for PLOs to validly participate in the elections will all be for naught and this Court will only be encouraging nuisance PLOs to participate in the election and dilute the percentage votes cast for the qualified PLOs, even denying some of the opportunity to achieve the 2% winning minimum percentage threshold. After all, as provided in the <i>ponencia</i>, a decision of disqualification, regardless of the date of its finality, does not affect its inclusion in the divisor “if not reasonably made known by the COMELEC.” Clearly, this cannot be allowed. At the very least, the <i>ponencia</i> should have provided sufficient parameters that will enable the COMELEC to comply with the proviso. Otherwise, the nebulous qualification in the proviso renders the rule open to various interpretations and possible circumvention. Indeed, the fact that a disqualified PLO’s name remains on the ballot on the day of the election can be used to assert that the COMELEC has not “reasonably” informed the electorate of the disqualification.<br><br>Thus, I vote that the modification of the divisor in the formula for determining the winning PLOs in <i>BANAT v. COMELEC</i> shall be limited only to include the votes cast for PLOs whose names are in the ballot but are disqualified <i>after</i> the elections. Spoiled, invalid and stray votes, as well as votes cast in favor of PLOs whose names are in the ballot but were disqualified with finality <i>before</i> the day of election shall remain excluded in the computation of the “total votes cast for the party-list system.”&nbsp; The final disqualification of a PLO prior to the day of the election, without more, is sufficient to render the votes cast in its favor as stray votes and excluded from the “total votes cast for the party-list system.”<br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> G.R.
