				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">We resolve the petition for review on <i>certiorari</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> filed by petitioners Century Iron Works, Inc. (<i>Century Iron</i>) and Benito Chua to challenge the January 31, 2008 decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and the August 8, 2008 resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 98632.<br><br><center><b><u>The Factual Antecedents</u></b></center><br>Respondent Eleto B. Bañas worked at petitioner Century Iron beginning July 5, 2000<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> until his dismissal on June 18, 2002.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Bañas responded to his dismissal by filing a complaint for illegal dismissal with prayer for reinstatement and money claims.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>According to Century Iron, Bañas worked as an inventory comptroller whose duties are to: (1) train newly hired warehouseman; (2) initiate analysis on the discrepancies concerning records and inventories; (3) check and confirm warehouseman’s report; (4) check the accuracy of materials requisition before issuance to the respective warehouseman at the jobsite; (5) monitor and maintain records; and (6) recommend and initiate corrective or preventive action as may be warranted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Sometime in 2002, Century Iron received letters of complaint from its gas suppliers regarding alleged massive shortage of empty gas cylinders.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> In the investigation that Century Iron conducted in response to the letters, it found that Bañas failed to make a report of the missing cylinders. On May 14, 2002, Century Iron required Bañas to explain within forty-eight (48) hours from receipt of its letter why no disciplinary action should be taken against him for loss of trust and confidence and for gross and habitual neglect of duty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> On May 31, 2002, Century Iron issued a Memorandum requiring Bañas to attend a hearing regarding the missing cylinders.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Bañas subsequently appeared at the hearing to air his side.<br><br>On June 17, 2002, Century Iron, through Personnel Officer Mr. Virgilio T. Bañaga, terminated Bañas’ services on grounds of loss of trust and confidence, and habitual and gross neglect of duty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> The termination was effective June 18, 2002.<br><br>In his defense, Bañas alleged that he merely worked as an inventory clerk who is not responsible for the lost cylinders. He pointed out that his tasks were limited to conducting periodic and yearly inventories, and submitting his findings to the personnel officer. He maintained that unlike a supervisory employee, he was not required to post a bond and he did not have the authority to receive and/or release cylinders in the way that a warehouseman does. Therefore, he cannot be terminated on the ground of loss of confidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, the petitioners asserted that Bañas was a supervisory employee who was responsible for the lost cylinders. They maintained that Bañas committed numerous infractions during his tenure amounting to gross and habitual neglect of duty. These included absences without leave, unauthorized under time, failure to implement proper standard warehousing and housekeeping procedure, negligence in making inventories of materials, and failure to ensure sufficient supplies of oxygen-acetylene gases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br><center><b>The Labor Arbitration Rulings</b></center><br>In a decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> dated January 31, 2005, Labor Arbiter (LA) Joel S. Lustria ruled that Bañas was illegally dismissed. The LA did not believe Century Iron’s assertions that Bañas worked as an inventory comptroller and that he was grossly and habitually neglectful of his duties. The evidence on record shows that Bañas was an inventory clerk whose duties were merely to conduct inventory and to submit his report to the personnel officer. As an inventory clerk, it was not his duty to receive the missing items. The LA also ruled that Century Iron deprived Bañas of due process because the purpose of the hearing was to investigate the lost cylinders and not to give Bañas an opportunity to explain his side.<br><br>On appeal by Century Iron, the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) affirmed the LA’s ruling <i>in toto</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> It ruled that the various memoranda issued by Century Iron explicitly show that Bañas was an inventory clerk. It noted that Century Iron unequivocally stated in its termination report dated July 29, 2002 that Bañas was an inventory clerk. It also pointed out that Century Iron failed to present the Contract of Employment or the Appointment Letter which was the best evidence that Bañas was an inventory comptroller.<br><br>The NLRC denied<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> the motion for reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> that Century Iron subsequently filed, prompting the employer company to seek relief from the CA through a petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br><center><b><u>The CA Ruling</u></b></center><br>On January 31, 2008, the CA affirmed with modification the NLRC decision. It agreed with the lower tribunals’ finding that Bañas was merely an inventory clerk. It, however, ruled that Bañas was afforded due process. It held that Bañas had been given ample opportunity to air his side during the hearing, pointing out that the essence of due process is simply an opportunity to be heard.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Century Iron filed the present petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> after the CA denied<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> its motion for reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br><center><b><u>The Petition</u></b></center><br>The petitioners impute the following errors committed by the appellate court:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">1) The CA erred in holding that the factual findings of the NLRC may not be inquired into considering that only questions of law may be brought in an original action for <i>certiorari;</i><br><br>2) The CA erred in finding that Bañas was not a supervisory employee; and<br><br>3) The CA erred in not holding that Bañas’ termination from his employment was for valid and just causes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br></div><br>The petitioners argue that the CA erred when it did not disturb the NLRC’s finding that Bañas was merely a rank-and-file employee. Citing <i>Capitol Medical Center, Inc. v. Dr. Meris</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> they contend that for factual findings of the NLRC to be accorded respect, these must be sufficiently supported by the evidence on record. The petitioners assert that Bañas was a supervisory employee who, in the interest of the employer, effectively recommended managerial actions using his independent judgment. They point out that one of Bañas’ duties as an inventory comptroller was to recommend and initiate corrective or preventive action as may be warranted.<br><br>The petitioners also maintain that Bañas was dismissed for just and valid causes. They reiterate that since Bañas was a supervisory employee, he could be dismissed on the ground of loss of confidence. Finally, the petitioners claim that Bañas was grossly and habitually negligent in his duty which further justified his termination.<br><br><center><b><u>The Respondent’s Position</u></b></center><br>In his <i>Comment</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Bañas posits that the petition raises purely questions of fact which a petition for review on <i>certiorari </i>under Rule 45 of the Rules of Courts does not allow. He additionally submits that the petitioners’ arguments have been fully passed upon and found unmeritorious by the lower tribunals and the CA.<br><br><center><b><u>The Issues</u></b></center><br>This case presents to us the following issues:<br><br><table width="100%" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="CENTER">1)</div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Whether or not questions of fact may be inquired into in a petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court; </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">2) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Whether or not Bañas occupied a position of trust and confidence, or was routinely charged with the care and custody of Century Iron’s money or property; and</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">3)</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Whether or not Century Iron terminated Bañas for just and valid causes.</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br>As part of the third issue, the following questions are raised:<br><br><table width="100%" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="CENTER">a)</div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Whether or not loss of confidence is a ground for terminating a rank-and-file employee who is not routinely charged with the care and custody of the employer’s money or property; and</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">b) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Whether or not Bañas was grossly and habitually neglectful of his duties.<br></div></td></tr></tbody></table><br><center><b><u>The Court’s Ruling</u></b></center><br><br>We reverse the CA’s decision.<br><br><b><i>In a petition for review on certiorari under <br>Rule 45, only questions of law may be put<br> into issue while in a petition for certiorari <br>under Rule 65, only questions of jurisdiction <br>may be inquired into</i></b><br><br>On the first issue, the CA relied on<i> Cebu Shipyard &amp; Eng’g Works, Inc. v. William Lines, Inc</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> in affirming the lower tribunals’ finding that Bañas worked as an inventory clerk. According to the CA, this Court has ruled in <i>Cebu Shipyard </i>that in <b>petitions for <i>certiorari</i></b>, only <b>questions of law</b> may be put into issue and questions of fact cannot be entertained. Not noticing such glaring error, the petitioners agree to such disquisition. They, however, assert that there is an exception to the rule that only questions of law may be brought in an original action for <i>certiorari</i>, such as when the lower court’s findings of facts are not supported by sufficient evidence or that the same was based on misapprehension or erroneous appreciation of facts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>A revisit of <i>Cebu Shipyard</i> shows that the CA has inadvertently misquoted this Court. In the said case, we held:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br><blockquote>[I]n <b>petitions for review on <i>certiorari</i></b>, only questions of law may be put into issue. Questions of fact cannot be entertained. The finding of negligence by the Court of Appeals is a question which this Court cannot look into as it would entail going into factual matters on which the finding of negligence was based. [emphasis ours; italics supplied]</blockquote><br>We clarify that the petitioners filed a <b>petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court</b> before the CA. Both the petitioners and the CA have confused Rule 45 and Rule 65. In several Supreme Court cases,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> we have clearly differentiated between a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 and a petition for certiorari under Rule 65. A petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 45 is an appeal from a ruling of a lower tribunal on pure questions of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> It is only in exceptional circumstances<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> that we admit and review questions of fact.<br><br>A question of law arises when there is doubt as to what the law is on a certain state of facts, while there is a question of fact when the doubt arises as to the truth or falsity of the alleged facts. For a question to be one of law, the question must not involve an examination of the probative value of the evidence presented by the litigants or any of them. The resolution of the issue must rest solely on what the law provides on the given set of circumstances. Once it is clear that the issue invites a review of the evidence presented, the question posed is one of fact.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Thus, the test of whether a question is one of law or of fact is not the appellation given to such question by the party raising the same; rather, it is whether the appellate court can determine the issue raised without reviewing or evaluating the evidence, in which case, it is a question of law; otherwise it is a question of fact.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, a petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 is a special civil action, an original petition confined solely to questions of jurisdiction because a tribunal, board or officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions has acted without jurisdiction or in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>The petition before us involves mixed questions of fact and law. The issues of whether Bañas occupied a position of trust and confidence, or was routinely charged with the care and custody of the employer’s money or property, and whether Bañas was grossly and habitually neglectful of his duties involve questions of fact which are necessary in determining the legal question of whether Bañas’ termination was in accordance with Article 282 of the Labor Code.<br><br>We will only touch these factual issues in the course of determining whether the CA correctly ruled whether or not the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion in the process of deducing its conclusions from the evidence proffered by the parties. In reviewing in this Rule 45 petition the CA’s decision on a Rule 65 petition, we will answer the question: <i>Did the CA correctly determine whether the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion in ruling on this case</i>? <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br><b><i>Bañas did not occupy a position of trust and <br>confidence nor was he in charge of the care <br>and custody of Century Iron’s money or property</i></b><br><br>The CA properly affirmed the NLRC’s ruling that Bañas was a rank-and-file employee who was not charged with the care and custody of Century Iron’s money or property. The ruling of the CA, finding no grave abuse of discretion in the LA and the NLRC rulings and are supported by substantial evidence, is, to our mind, correct. The evidence on record supports the holding that Bañas was an ordinary employee. There is no indication that the NLRC’s decision was unfair or arbitrary. It properly relied on Century Iron’s numerous memoranda<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> where Bañas was identified as an inventory clerk. It correctly observed that Century Iron unequivocably declared that Bañas was an inventory clerk in its July 29, 2002 termination report with the Department of Labor and Employment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Moreover, as the NLRC judiciously pointed out, Century Iron failed to present the Contract of Employment or the Appointment Letter, the best evidence that would show that Bañas was an inventory comptroller.<br><br><b><i>Since Bañas was an ordinary rank-and-file <br>employee, his termination on the ground of<br> loss of confidence was illegal</i></b><br><br>Since Bañas did not occupy a position of trust and confidence nor was he routinely in charge with the care and custody of Century Iron’s money or property, his termination on the ground of loss of confidence was misplaced.<br><br>We point out in this respect that loss of confidence applies to: (1) employees occupying positions of trust and confidence, the managerial employees; and (2) <i>employees who are routinely charged with the care and custody of the employer’s money or property which may include <b>rank-and-file employees</b>.</i> Examples of rank-and-file employees who may be dismissed for loss of confidence are cashiers, auditors, property custodians, or those who, in the normal routine exercise of their functions, regularly handle significant amounts of money or property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Thus, the phrasing of the petitioners’ second assignment of error is inaccurate because <b>a rank-and-file employee who is routinely charged with the care and custody of the employer’s money or property may be dismissed on the ground of loss of confidence.</b><br><br><b><i>Bañas was grossly and habitually<br> neglectful of his duties </i></b><br><br>With respect to Century Iron’s assertion that Bañas was grossly and habitually neglectful of his duties, the CA erred in ruling that the NLRC did not commit grave abuse of discretion in concluding that the dismissal was illegal. The NLRC’s finding that there was illegal dismissal on the ground of gross and habitual neglect of duties is not supported by the evidence on record. It believed in Bañas’ bare and unsubstantiated denial that he was not grossly and habitually neglectful of his duties <i>when the record is replete with pieces of evidence showing the contrary</i>. Consequently, the NLRC capriciously and whimsically exercised its judgment by failing to consider all material evidence presented to it by the petitioners and in giving credence to Bañas’ claim which is unsupported by the evidence on record.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Bañas’ self-serving and unsubstantiated denials cannot defeat the concrete and overwhelming evidence submitted by the petitioners.&nbsp;The evidence on record shows that Bañas committed numerous infractions in his one year and eleven-month stay in Century Iron. On October 27, 2000, Century Iron gave Bañas a warning for failing to check the right quantity of materials subject of his inventory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> On December 29, 2000, Bañas went undertime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> On January 2, 2001, Bañas incurred an absence without asking for prior leave.42 On August 11, 2001, he was warned for failure to implement proper warehousing and housekeeping procedures.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> On August 21, 2001, he failed to ensure sufficient supplies of oxygen-acetylene gases during business hours.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> On November 15, 2001, Bañas was again warned for failing to secure prior permission before going on leave.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> In May 2002, Century Iron’s accounting department found out that Bañas made double and wrong entries in his inventory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Article 282 of the Labor Code provides that one of the just causes for terminating an employment is the employee’s gross and habitual neglect of his duties. This cause includes gross inefficiency, negligence and carelessness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> "Gross negligence connotes want or absence of or failure to exercise slight care or diligence, or the entire absence of care.&nbsp;&nbsp;It evinces a thoughtless disregard of consequences without exerting any effort to avoid them. Fraud and willful neglect of duties imply bad faith of the employee in failing to perform his job, to the detriment of the employer and the latter’s business. Habitual neglect, on the other hand, implies repeated failure to perform one's duties for a period of time, depending upon the circumstances."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>To our mind, such numerous infractions are sufficient to hold him grossly and habitually negligent. His repeated negligence is not tolerable. The totality of infractions or the number of violations he committed during his employment merits his dismissal. Moreover, gross and habitual negligence includes unauthorized absences and tardiness,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> as well as gross inefficiency, negligence and carelessness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> As pronounced in <i>Valiao v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> "[f]itness for continued employment cannot be compartmentalized into tight little cubicles of aspects of character, conduct, and ability separate and independent of each other."<br><br>Besides, the determination of who to keep in employment and who to dismiss for cause is one of Century Iron’s prerogatives. Time and again, we have recognized that the employer has the right to regulate, according to its discretion and best judgment, all aspects of employment, including work assignment, working methods, processes to be followed, working regulations, transfer of employees, work supervision, lay-off of workers and the discipline, dismissal and recall of workers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> It would be the height of injustice if we force an employer to retain the services of an employee who does not value his work.<br><br>In view of all the foregoing, we find the petition meritorious.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, we hereby <b>GRANT</b> the petition. The assailed decision and resolution of the Court of Appeals are <b>REVERSED</b> and <b>SET ASIDE</b>. The complaint for illegal dismissal is <b>DISMISSED</b> for lack of merit.
