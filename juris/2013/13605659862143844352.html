The petitioner applied for a Certificate of Non- Coverage (CNC) with the Environmental Management Bureau (EMB) of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), Region 7, seeking to be exempt from the requirement of the Environmental Compliance Certificate (ECC) under Section 4 of Presidential Decree No. 1586 on the following justifications, to wit:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"><div align="JUSTIFY">1)</div></td> <td width="95%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">The whole project simply involves tapping of water from the Loboc River, filtering and purifying it, and distributing the same to the consumers in the covered towns;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">2)</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">From the source to the filtration plant, then to the purifier stations, then finally to the consumers’ households, water flows through steel pipes;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">3)</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">The filtration and purifying process employs the latest technology— “electrocatalytic”—internationally accepted for safety and environment friendliness;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">4) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">No waste is generated, as the electrocatalytic process dissolves all impurities in the water;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">5) The project involves no destruction [n]or harm to the environment.

The magnitude of the earthquake is 6.8 and the highest intensity reported was VIII, based on the Rossi-Forel Intensity Scale. During the said earthquake, the PMI Academy Building collapsed while minor cracks were sustained by the municipal hall, public school, town church and some other houses in the town. There were reports that immediately after the earthquake, the force of the incoming waves from the sea caused Alijuan River in the town of Duero to flow inland. The report also states that the waves affected 10-50 meters of the coastal beach of the towns of Jagna, Duero, Guindulman, Garcia Hernandez and Valencia.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> (Emphases supplied)<br></blockquote><br>The petitioner failed to secure a certification from the Regional Office of the Mines and Geosciences Bureau (RO-MGB) to the effect that the project area was not located along a fault line/fault zone or a critical slope because RO-MGB did not have the data and expertise to render such finding, and thus had to forward the petitioner’s request to the MGB Central Office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Upon the MGB’s advice, the petitioner sought and obtained the required certification from PHIVOLCS, but the certification did not state whether the project area was within a critical slope. Instead, the certification stated that the project site was approximately 18 kilometers west of the East Bohol Fault.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Given the tenor of the certification from PHIVOLCS, RD Lipayon’s letter dated February 4, 2003 declared that the project was within an environmentally critical area, and that the petitioner was not entitled to the CNC, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>After thorough review of your submitted certifications, it was found out that the area was subjected to an earthquake of Intensity VII in the adapted Rossi-Forel scale wherein the magnitude of the earthquake is 6.8 with the highest intensity reported of VIII and you fail to support certification that the project area is not within critical slope. And based on the Water Usage and Classification per Department Order (DAO) 34 Series of 1990, subject river system was officially classified as Class B intended for swimming and bathing purposes. Moreover, one component of your project involves opening of roadway connected to the barangay road.<br><br>Therefore, we reiterate our previous stand that your project is covered by the EIS System pursuant to P.D. 1586, the Environmental Impact Statement Law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></blockquote><br>On March 27, 2003, the petitioner filed a petition for <i>mandamus</i> and damages in the Regional Trial Court (RTC) in Loay, Bohol,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> alleging that it was now entitled to a CNC as a matter of right after having complied with the certification requirements; and that the EMB had earlier issued a CNC to the DPWH for a similar waterworks project in the same area.<br><br>In the decision dated November 18, 2003,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> the RTC <b>dismissed</b> the petition for <i>mandamus</i> upon the following considerations, namely: (1) PHIVOLCS certified that the project site had been subjected to an Intensity VII earthquake in 1990; (2) the CNC issued by the EMB to a similar waterworks project of the DPWH in the same area was only for the construction of a unit spring box intake and pump house, and the DENR issued a cease and desist order relative to the DPWH’s additional project to put up a water filtration plant therein; (3) the determination of whether an area was environmentally critical was a task that pertained to the EMB; (4) the assignment of a control number by the EMB to the petitioner’s application did not mean that the application was as good as approved; (5) the RTC would not interfere with the primary prerogative of the EMB to review the merits of the petitioner’s application for the CNC; and (6) there was already a pending appeal lodged with the DENR Secretary.<br><br>Hence, this appeal brought directly to the Court via petition for review on certiorari.<br><br><center><b>Issues</b><br></center><br>The petitioner submits the following issues:<br><blockquote><br><ol type="A"><li>WHETHER OR NOT, AFTER PETITIONER’S DUE COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS MANDATED BY RESPONDENTS FOR&nbsp;

that after the petitioner complied with the requirements enumerated in the August 26, 2002 letter of RD Lipayon, the EMB became duty-bound to issue the CNC to the petitioner; that the EMB issued a CNC to a similar project of the DPWH in the same area; that it filed an appeal with the DENR Secretary, but the appeal remained unresolved; and that it brought the petition for <i>mandamus</i> precisely as a speedier recourse.<br><br>In their comment, RD Lipayon and Canda aver that the act complained of against them involved an exercise of discretion that could not be compelled by <i>mandamus</i>; that the petitioner’s proposed project was located within an environmentally critical area, and the activities to be done were so significant that they would create massive earth movement and environmental degradation; that the petitioner violated the rule against forum shopping; and that the petitioner had no cause of action against them for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.<br><br>On his part, the DENR Secretary, through the Solicitor General, contends that the petition raises questions of fact that are not proper in a petition for review; that the petitioner should have appealed to the CA under Rule 41 of the<i> Rules of Court</i>; that the grant or denial of a CNC application is discretionary and cannot be compelled by <i>mandamus</i>; and that the petitioner failed to exhaust administrative remedies.<br><br>Accordingly, the Court is called upon to resolve, <i>firstly</i>, whether the appeal directly to this Court from the RTC was proper, and, <i>secondly</i>, whether the petition for <i>mandamus</i> was the correct recourse.<br><br><center><b>Ruling</b><br></center><br>The petition for review is denied for its lack of merit.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b>1.</b><br><b>Petitioner’s appeal is improper </b><br><b>under Rule 45, <span style="font-style: italic;">Rules of Court</span></b><br></div><br>This appeal by <i>certiorari </i>is being taken under Rule 45, <i>Rules of Court</i>, whose Section 1 expressly requires that the petition shall raise only questions of law which must be distinctly set forth. Yet, the petitioner hereby raises a question of fact whose resolution is decisive in this appeal. That issue of fact concerns whether or not the petitioner established that its project was not located in an environmentally critical area. For this reason, the Court is constrained to deny due course to the petition for review.<br><br>It is a settled rule, indeed, that in the exercise of our power of review, the Court is not a trier of facts and does not normally undertake the re-examination of the evidence presented by the contending parties during the trial of the case. The Court relies on the findings of fact of the Court of Appeals or of the trial court, and accepts such findings as conclusive and binding unless any of the following exceptions obtains, namely: (<i>a</i>) when the findings are grounded entirely on speculation, surmises or conjectures; (<i>b</i>) when the inference made is manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible; (<i>c</i>) when there is grave abuse of discretion; (<i>d</i>) when the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts; (<i>e</i>) when the findings of facts are conflicting; (<i>f</i>) when in making its findings the Court of Appeals or the trial court went beyond the issues of the case, or its findings are contrary to the admissions of both the appellant and the appellee; (<i>g</i>) when the findings are contrary to the trial court; (<i>h</i>) when the findings are conclusions without citation of specific evidence on which they are based; (<i>i</i>) when the facts set forth in the petition as well as in the petitioner’s main and reply briefs are not disputed by the respondent; (<i>j</i>) when the findings of fact are premised on the supposed absence of evidence and contradicted by the evidence on record; and (<i>k</i>) when the Court of Appeals or the trial court manifestly overlooked certain relevant facts not disputed by the parties, which, if properly considered, would justify a different conclusion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> However, none of the aforementioned exceptions applies herein.<br><br><center><b>2.<br><i>Mandamus</i> was an improper remedy for petitioner</b></center><br>We dismiss the present recourse because the petitioner failed to exhaust the available administrative remedies, and because it failed to show that it was legally entitled to demand the performance of the act by the respondents.<br><br>It is axiomatic, to begin with, that a party who seeks the intervention of a court of law upon an administrative concern should first avail himself of all the remedies afforded by administrative processes. The issues that an administrative agency is authorized to decide should not be summarily taken away from it and submitted to a court of law without first giving the agency the opportunity to dispose of the issues upon due deliberation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> The court of law must allow the administrative agency to carry out its functions and discharge its responsibilities within the specialized areas of its competence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>&nbsp; This rests on the theory that the administrative authority is in a better position to resolve questions addressed to its particular expertise, and that errors committed by subordinates in their resolution may be rectified by their superiors if given a chance to do so.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>The records show that the petitioner failed to exhaust the available administrative remedies. At the time RD Lipayon denied the petitioner’s application for the CNC, Administrative Order No. 42 dated November 2, 2002<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> had just vested the authority to grant or deny applications for the ECC in the Director and Regional Directors of the EMB. Notwithstanding the lack of a specific implementing guideline to what office the ruling of the EMB Regional Director was to be appealed, the petitioner could have been easily guided in that regard by the Administrative Code of 1987, which provides that the Director of a line bureau, such as the EMB,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> shall have supervision and control over all division and other units, including regional offices, under the bureau.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Verily, supervision and control include the power to “review, approve, reverse or modify acts and decisions of subordinate officials or units.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Accordingly, the petitioner should have appealed the EMB Regional Director’s decision to the EMB Director, who exercised supervision and control over the former.<br><br>It is relevant to mention that the DENR later promulgated Administrative Order No. 2003-30<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> in order to define where appeals should be taken, providing as follows:<br><blockquote>Section 6. Appeal<br><br>Any party aggrieved by the final decision on the ECC/CNC applications may, within 15 days from receipt of such decision, file an appeal on the following grounds:<br><ol type="a"><li>Grave abuse of discretion on the part of the deciding authority, or <br></li><li>Serious errors in the review findings.<br></li></ol>The DENR may adopt alternative conflict/dispute resolution procedures as a means to settle grievances between proponents and aggrieved parties to avert unnecessary legal action. Frivolous appeals shall not be countenanced.<br><br>The proponent or any stakeholder may file an appeal to the following:<br><br><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td width="50%"><div align="CENTER">Deciding Authority</div></td> <td width="50%"><div align="CENTER">Where to file the appeal</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td>EMB Regional Office Director</td> <td>Office of the EMB Director</td> </tr> <tr> <td>EMB Central Office Director</td> <td>Office of the DENR Secretary</td> </tr> <tr> <td>DENR Secretary</td> <td>Office of the President</td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br>Moreover, the petitioner states in its pleadings that it had a pending appeal with the DENR Secretary. However, the records reveal that the subject of the appeal of the petitioner was an undated resolution of the DENR Regional Director, Region VII, denying its application for the CNC,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> not the decision of RD Lipayon. Nonetheless, even assuming that the pending appeal with the DENR Secretary had related to RD Lipayon’s decision, the petitioner should still have waited for the DENR Secretary to resolve the appeal in line with the principle of exhaustion of administrative remedies. Its failure to do so rendered its resort to mandamus in the RTC premature. The omission is fatal, because <i>mandamus</i> is a remedy only when there is no appeal, nor any plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Another reason for denying due course to this review is that the petitioner did not establish that the grant of its application for the CNC was a purely ministerial in nature on the part of RD Lipayon. Hence,<i> mandamus</i> was not a proper remedy.<br><br>The CNC is a certification issued by the EMB certifying that a project is not covered by the Environmental Impact Statement System (EIS System) and that the project proponent is not required to secure an ECC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> The EIS System was established by Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1586 pursuant to Section 4 of P.D. No. 1151 (<i>Philippine Environmental Policy</i>) that required all entities to submit an EIS for projects that would have a significant effect on the environment, thus:<br><br><blockquote>Section 4. <i>Environmental Impact Statements</i>. – Pursuant to the above enunciated policies and goals, all agencies and instrumentalities of the national government, including government-owned or controlled corporations, as well as private corporations, firms and entities shall prepare, file and include in every action, project or undertaking which significantly affects the quality of the environment a detailed statement on–<br><br><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="CENTER">(a) </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">the environmental impact of the proposed action, project or undertaking</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">(b)</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">any adverse environmental effect which cannot be avoided should the proposal be implemented</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">(c)</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">alternative to the proposed action</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">(d) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">a determination that the short-term uses of the resources of the environment are consistent with the maintenance and enhancement of the long-term productivity of the same; and</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">(e) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">whenever a proposal involve[s] the use of depletable or non- renewable resources, a finding must be made that such use and commitment are warranted.</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br>x x x x<br></blockquote><br>P.D.

As such, he was then obliged to issue the CNC once the petitioner had submitted the required certifications.<br><br>The petitioner errs on two grounds.<br><br>Firstly, RD Lipayon had not yet fully exercised his discretion with regard to the CNC application when he made his finding. It is clear that his finding referred to the “procedural requirements for review” only. He had still to decide on the substantive aspect of the application, <i>that is</i>, whether the project and the project area were considered critical to the environment. In fact, this was the reason why RD Lipayon required the petitioner to submit certifications from the various government agencies concerned. Surely, the required certifications were not mere formalities, because they would serve as the bases for his decision on whether to grant or deny the application.<br><br>Secondly, there is no sufficient showing that the petitioner satisfactorily complied with the requirement to submit the needed certifications. For one, it submitted no certification to the effect that the project site was not within a critical slope. Also, the PHIVOLCS’s certification showed that the project site had experienced an Intensity VII earthquake in 1990, a fact that sufficed to place the site in the category of “areas frequently visited and/or hard-hit by natural calamities.” Clearly, the petitioner failed to establish that it had the legal right to be issued the CNC applied for, warranting the denial of its application.<br><br>It is not amiss for us to observe, therefore, that the petitioner grossly misunderstood the nature of the remedy of <i>mandamus</i>. To avoid similar misunderstanding of the remedy hereafter, a short exposition on the nature and office of the remedy is now appropriate.<br><br>The writ of <i>mandamus</i> is of very ancient and obscure origin. It is believed that the writ was originally part of the class of writs or mandates issued by the English sovereign to direct his subjects to perform a particular act or duty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> The earliest writs were in the form of letters missive, and were mere personal commands. The command was a law in itself, from which there was no appeal. The writ of <i>mandamus</i> was not only declaratory of a duty under an existing law, but was a law in itself that imposed the duty, the performance of which it commanded.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> The King was considered as the fountain and source of justice, and when the law did not afford a remedy by the regular forms of proceedings, the prerogative powers of the sovereign were invoked in aid of the ordinary powers of the courts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>A judicial writ of <i>mandamus</i>, issued in the King’s name out of the court of King’s Bench that had a general supervisory power over all inferior jurisdictions and officers, gradually supplanted the old personal command of the sovereign.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> The court of King’s Bench, acting as the general guardian of public rights and in the exercise of its authority to grant the writ, rendered the writ of <i>mandamus</i> the suppletory means of substantial justice in every case where there was no other specific legal remedy for a legal right, and ensured that all official duties were fulfilled whenever the subject-matter was properly within its control.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Early on, the writ of <i>mandamus</i> was particularly used to compel public authorities to return the petitioners to public offices from which they had been unlawfully removed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br><i>Mandamus </i>was, therefore, originally a purely prerogative writ emanating from the King himself, superintending the police and preserving the peace within the realm.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> It was allowed only in cases affecting the sovereign, or the interest of the public at large.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>&nbsp; The writ of <i>mandamus</i> grew out of the necessity to compel the inferior courts to exercise judicial and ministerial powers invested in them by restraining their excesses, preventing their negligence and restraining their denial of justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Over time, the writ of <i>mandamus</i> has been stripped of its highly prerogative features and has been assimilated to the nature of an ordinary remedy. Nonetheless, the writ has remained to be an extraordinary remedy in the sense that it is only issued in extraordinary cases and where the usual and ordinary modes of proceeding and forms of remedy are powerless to afford redress to a party aggrieved, and where without its aid there would be a failure of justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>The writ of <i>mandamus</i> has also retained an important feature that sets it apart from the other remedial writs, <i>i.e.</i>, that it is used merely to compel action and to coerce the performance of a pre-existing duty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> In fact, a doctrine well-embedded in our jurisprudence is that mandamus will issue only when the petitioner has a clear legal right to the performance of the act sought to be compelled and the respondent has an imperative duty to perform the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> The petitioner bears the burden to show that there is such a clear legal right to the performance of the act, and a corresponding compelling duty on the part of the respondent to perform the act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>A key principle to be observed in dealing with petitions for <i>mandamus</i> is that such extraordinary remedy lies to compel the performance of duties that are purely ministerial in nature, not those that are discretionary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> A purely ministerial act or duty is one that an officer or tribunal performs in a given state of facts, in a prescribed manner, in obedience to the mandate of a legal authority, without regard to or the exercise of its own judgment upon the propriety or impropriety of the act done. The duty is ministerial only when its discharge requires neither the exercise of official discretion or judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>The petitioner's disregard of the foregoing fundamental requisites for <i>mandamus</i> rendered its petition in the RTC untenable and devoid of merit.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court <b>DENIES</b> the petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>; and <b>ORDERS</b> the petitioner to pay the costs of suit.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED</b>.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Sereno, C.J., Leonardo-De Castro, Villarama, Jr., </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">Reyes, JJ., </span>concur.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo,</i> p. 35.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Id. at 39.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Id. at 40.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Id. at 44.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Id. at 45.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Id. at 52-53.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Id. at 54-64.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Id. at 58.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Id. at 59.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Id. at 64.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Id. at 65.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Id. at 16-27<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Id. at 125-134.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Id. at 6.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> <i>Sampayan v.
