Hernandez St., San Joaquin, Pasig City, for their drug sessions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>&nbsp; After recording the report in the police blotter, PO2 Noble relayed the information to his superior, P/Insp.

PO2 Noble wrote the markings “MCC-RNN October 9, 2004” on both the plastic sachets of white substance sold to him by Marcelino and the one found inside the metal container.<br><br>Meanwhile, SPO2 Cruz and another police officer went inside the house of Marcelino and Myra, where they found Apelo, Cipriano, Ranada, Abache, Sumulong, Madarang and Latario gathered around a table littered with various drug paraphernalia such as an improvised water pipe, strips of aluminum foil with traces of white substance, disposable lighters, and plastic sachets. A strip of aluminum foil used for smoking marijuana was recovered from Ranada.&nbsp; The buy-bust team arrested all these persons, advised them of their constitutional rights, and brought them to police headquarters for investigation and drug testing.<br><br>A chemistry report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> on all the seized items yielded positive results for methylamphetamine hydrochloride.

When the officers frisked all the accused, Marcelino claimed that nothing illegal nor incriminating was recovered from them.<br><br>When Myra arrived at the scene, she was shocked to see her husband being arrested.&nbsp; The police officers then brought all the accused to the police station for further questioning.<br><br>At the police station, PO2 Noble asked Marcelino for P50,000.00 as settlement of their case.&nbsp; Marcelino, Apelo, Cipriano, and Ranada were also made to drink water that according to Marcelino tasted bitter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp; They were then brought to Camp Crame for medical examination and drug tests.&nbsp; Those who drank the bitter water tested positive for drugs use while the others, who did not drink, tested negative.<br><br>Marcelino surmised that their arrest was due to a misunderstanding he had with a former police officer named Rey who bought a VCD player from his shop.&nbsp; He specifically instructed Rey not to let anyone repair the VCD player should it malfunction.&nbsp; However, when the VCD player malfunctioned, Rey had it repaired by somebody else, hence Marcelino refused to accept the VCD player and return Rey’s money.&nbsp; This earned the ire of Rey who threatened him with the words “Humanda ka pagbalik ko.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br><b><i>Ruling of the Regional Trial Court</i></b><br><br>In its Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> dated December 7, 2005, the RTC disposed of the case as follows:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered as follows:<br><br>In Crim.

Arrest without warrant; when lawful. -- A peace officer or a private person may, without a warrant, arrest a person:<br><br>(a) When, in his presence, the person to be arrested has committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to commit an offense;<br><br>(b) When an offense has in fact just been committed and he has probable cause to believe based on personal knowledge of facts or circumstances that the person to be arrested has committed it; and<br><br>(c) When the person to be arrested is a prisoner who escaped from a penal establishment or place where he is serving final judgment or temporarily confined while his case is pending, or has escaped while being transferred from one confinement to another.</blockquote><br>Section 5(a) is what is known as arrest <i>in flagrante delicto.</i>&nbsp; For this type of warrantless arrest to be valid, two requisites must concur: “(1) the person to be arrested must execute an overt act indicating that he has just committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to commit a crime; and, (2) such overt act is done in the presence or within the view of the arresting officer.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>&nbsp; A common example of an arrest <i>in flagrante delicto </i>is one made after conducting a buy-bust operation.<br><br>This is precisely what happened in the present case.&nbsp; The arrest of the appellants was an arrest<i> in flagrante delicto</i> made in pursuance of Sec. 5(a), Rule 113 of the Rules of Court.&nbsp; The arrest was effected after Marcelino and Myra performed the overt act of selling to PO2 Noble the sachet of <i>shabu</i> and Ranada of having in his control and custody illegal drug paraphernalia.&nbsp; Thus, there is no other logical conclusion than that the arrest made by the police officers was a valid warrantless arrest since the same was made while the appellants were actually committing the said crimes.<br><br>Moreover, assuming that irregularities indeed attended the arrest of appellants, they can no longer question the validity thereof as there is no showing that they objected to the same before their arraignment.&nbsp; Neither did they take steps to quash the Informations on such ground.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>&nbsp; They only raised this issue upon their appeal to the appellate court.&nbsp; By this omission, any objections on the legality of their arrest are deemed to have been waived by them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Anent their claim of unreasonable search and seizure, it is true that under the Constitution, “a search and consequent seizure must be carried out with a judicial warrant; otherwise, it becomes unreasonable and any evidence obtained therefrom shall be inadmissible for any purpose in any proceeding.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>&nbsp; This proscription, however, admits of exceptions, one of which is a warrantless search incidental to a lawful arrest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>The arrest of the appellants was lawful.&nbsp; Under Section 13, Rule 126 of the Rules of Court, “[a] person lawfully arrested may be searched for dangerous weapons or anything which may have been used or constitute proof in the commission of an offense without a search warrant.”&nbsp; The factual milieu of this case clearly shows that the search was made after appellants were lawfully arrested.&nbsp; Pursuant to the above-mentioned rule, the subsequent search and seizure made by the police officers were likewise valid.&nbsp; Hence, appellants’ claim of unreasonable search and seizure must fail.<br><br><i>Extortion</i><br><br>Appellants aver that PO2 Noble tried to extort money from them in exchange for dropping the drug charges against them.<br><br>The defense of extortion and/or frame-up is often put up in drugs cases in order to cast doubt on the credibility of police officers.&nbsp; This is a serious imputation of a crime hence clear and convincing evidence must be presented to support the same.&nbsp; There must also be a showing that the police officers were inspired by improper motive.&nbsp; In this case, we find such imputation unfounded.<br><br>In <i>People v. Capalad</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> this Court held thus:<br><br><blockquote>Charges of extortion and frame-up are frequently made in this jurisdiction. Courts are, thus, cautious in dealing with such accusations, which are quite difficult to prove in light of the presumption of regularity in the performance of the police officers’ duties. To substantiate such defense, which can be easily concocted, the evidence must be clear and convincing and should show that the members of the buy-bust team were inspired by any improper motive or were not properly performing their duty. Otherwise, the police officers’ testimonies on the operation deserve full faith and credit.</blockquote><br>Here, aside from Marcelino’s self-serving testimony, appellants’ claim of extortion is not substantiated by other convincing evidence.&nbsp; Neither was it established during trial that PO2 Noble or the other members of the buy-bust team were impelled by improper motive.&nbsp; Appellants’ allegation that PO2 Noble and his team arrested them because of Marcelino’s previous misunderstanding with a certain retired policeman named Rey deserves no credence.&nbsp; No evidence was presented to show any connection between Rey and the buy-bust team.&nbsp; It was not even shown by the defense who this person Rey really is.&nbsp; Also, it is highly unlikely that a team of police officers would pursue a surveillance, conduct a buy-bust operation, and arrest all the accused for a measly P1,000.00 VCD player.&nbsp; In view of these, appellants’ allegation of extortion and improper motive deserves no credence.<br><br><i>Chain of Custody</i><br><br>Appellants argue that the procedure laid down in Section 21 of RA 9165 was not followed.&nbsp; They specifically harp on the fact that the confiscated drugs were not photographed and inventoried. Moreover, they contend that the police officers who handled the seized specimen were not presented in court to testify on the condition in which they received the said specimen.&nbsp; For the appellants, these defects constitute a clear break in the chain of custody and, consequently, the prosecution failed to establish <i>corpus delicti</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>The Court, however, finds this argument unmeritorious.<br><br>Section 21, paragraph 1, Article II of RA 9165 provides for the custody and disposition of the confiscated drugs, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>(1) The apprehending officer/team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof;</blockquote><br>This rule is elaborated in Section 21(a), Article II of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA 9165, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>a) The apprehending officer/team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof: Provided, that the physical inventory and photograph shall be conducted at the place where the search warrant is served; or at the nearest police station or at the nearest office of the apprehending officer/ team, whichever is practicable, in case of warrantless seizure;<b> Provided, further, that non-compliance with these requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and invalid such seizures of and custody over said items.</b>&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Pursuant to the above-cited provisions, this Court has consistently ruled that the failure of the police officers to inventory and photograph the confiscated items are not fatal to the prosecution’s cause,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> provided that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized substance were preserved, as in this case.&nbsp; Here, PO2 Noble, after apprehending Marcelino and confiscating from him the sachets of shabu, immediately placed his markings on them.&nbsp; He testified thus:<br><br><blockquote>PROSECUTOR PAZ:<br><br>Q:&nbsp; What did you do with that sachet containing white substance that was bought from Marcelino and the one that you were able to confiscate from him?<br>A:&nbsp; I put my markings.<br><br>Q:&nbsp; What were those markings?<br>A:&nbsp; MCC-RNN October 9, 2004.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></blockquote><br>In the Request for Laboratory Examination<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> the seized items were listed and inventoried.&nbsp; After the conduct of the laboratory examination, Chemistry Report No. D-807-04<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> revealed that the contents of the said sachets tested positive for methylamphetamine hydrochloride or <i>shabu</i>.<br><br>Moreover, it is of no moment that Forensic Chemist Alejandro De Guzman who conducted the laboratory examination was not presented as a witness. The non-presentation as witnesses of other persons who had custody of the illegal drugs is not a crucial point against the prosecution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>&nbsp; There is no requirement for the prosecution to present as witness in a drugs case every person who had something to do with the arrest of the accused and the seizure of the prohibited drugs from him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>&nbsp; To stress, the implementing rules are clear that non-compliance with the requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and invalid such seizures of and custody over said items.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br><i>Criminal Case No. 13784-D</i><br><br>With regard to Criminal Case No. 13784-D for illegal possession of drug paraphernalia, we find it imperative to re-examine the findings of both the RTC and the CA.<br><br>The RTC’s findings are as follows:<br><br><blockquote>The evidence for the prosecution clearly shows that certain things or paraphernalia which are fit or intended [for] smoking shabu were found in the house of the accused Marcelino and Myra Collado on the same occasion that the said spouses were arrested by the police officers. This fact makes all the accused without exception liable for violation of Section 14. While it was only Reynaldo Ranada who was caught having in his possession an item used in smoking marijuana, i.e., a strip of aluminum foil x x x and nothing was found in the possession of the other accused, this fact nonetheless does not render Reynaldo Ranada the only person liable for violation of Section 14. [Take note] that the law speaks not only of possession but also of having under one’s control the paraphernalia intended for smoking. In the instant case, the paraphernalia were found by the police on top of the table around which the accused were gathered. Hence, even if the x x x accused other than Ranada did not have in their possession any of the paraphernalia, it can, however, be said that the paraphernalia found on top of the table were under their control. x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></blockquote><br>Thus, the RTC found Ranada, Cipriano, Latario, Apelo Abache, Sumulong and Madarang all equally guilty of illegal possession of drug paraphernalia.<br><br>On appeal, however, the CA found Ranada guilty as principal while Cipriano, Latario, Apelo, Abache, Sumulong and Madarang were adjudged as accessories only for the crime of illegal possession of drug paraphernalia.&nbsp; The CA ratiocinated thus:<br><br><blockquote>On the one hand, we sustain the conviction of Rañada in <u>Crim. Case 13784-D</u>. He was actually caught having custody and control of the confiscated drug paraphenalia intended for smoking, injecting, etc. into one’s body. It was also indubitably shown that he failed to present authority to possess the prohibited articles, much less, an explanation of his possession thereof. However, as regards the other accused who were seen in the company of Rañada, the evidence of conspiracy against them was insufficient.<br><br>To hold an accused guilty as co-principal by reason of conspiracy, he must be shown to have performed an overt act in pursuance or furtherance of the complicity. Responsibility of a conspirator is not confined to the accomplishment of a particular purpose of conspiracy but extends to collateral acts and offenses incident to and growing out of the purpose intended.<br><br>It may be that appellants Mark Cipriano and Samuel Sherwin Latario and co-accused Melody Apelo, Marwin Abache, Michael Angelo Sumulong, Jay Madarang were in close proximity [to] Rañada at the time and place of the incident. But mere presence at the scene of the crime does not imply conspiracy. The prosecution failed to show specific overt acts that would link these accused to Ranada’s possession of the said contrabands. As to why they were there [in] the vicinity of the crime scene was not explained. They could be mere innocent onlookers although they were aware of the illegality of the principal’s acts.<br><br>In any event, appellants Cipriano and Latario and the rest of the accused cannot be totally exonerated. [However, we] downgrade their culpability corresponding to their criminal design and participation. Evidently, they are guilty as accessories who, according to paragraph 1, Article 19 of the Revised Penal Code, are criminally liable by ‘profiting themselves or assisting the offender to profit by the effects of the crime’.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></blockquote><br>We find that the CA erred in convicting Cipriano, Latario, Apelo, Abache, Sumulong and Madarang as accessories.&nbsp; As pointed out by Justice Arturo D. Brion:<br><br><blockquote>“[I]llegal possession of equipment, instrument, apparatus and other paraphernalia for dangerous drugs during parties, social gatherings or meetings under Section 14 of R.A. No. 9165 is a crime of malum prohibitum, that is, the act is made wrong or evil because there is a law prohibiting it. x x x<br><br><b>Since violation of Section 14 of R.A. No. 9165 is a crime of mala <i>prohibita</i>, the degree of participation of the offenders is not considered. All who perpetrated the prohibited act are penalized to the same extent. There is no principal or accomplice or accessory to consider</b>. In short, the degree of participation of the offenders does not affect their liability, and the penalty on all of them are the same whether they are principals or merely accomplices or accessories.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></blockquote><br>In addition, Section 98 of RA 9165 specifically provides that “[n]otwithstanding any law, rule or regulation to the contrary, the provisions of the Revised Penal Code (Act No. 3814), as amended, shall not apply to the provisions of this Act, except in the case of minor offenders.&nbsp; Where the offender is a minor, the penalty for acts punishable by life imprisonment to death provided herein shall be <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death.”&nbsp; It is therefore clear that the provisions of the Revised Penal Code, particularly Article 19 on Accessories, cannot be applied in determining the degree of participation and criminal liability of Ranada’s co-accused.<br><br>At any rate, this Court is convinced that only Ranada should be held liable for violation of Section 14 of RA 9165.&nbsp; It is clear that it was only Ranada who was caught having in his possession an aluminum foil intended for using dangerous drugs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>&nbsp; As to the other co-accused, namely Apelo, Abache, Cipriano, Latario, Madarang, and Sumulong, not one drug paraphernalia was found in their possession.&nbsp; The police officers were only able to find the other drug paraphernalia scattered on top of a table.&nbsp; It is already established that there was no conspiracy between Ranada and the other co-accused.&nbsp; As the CA correctly held, mere presence at the scene of the crime does not imply conspiracy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>PO2 Noble, when placed on the witness stand, only testified as follows:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="JUSTIFY">A-</div></td> <td width="90%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">While I was checking the item that I bought, I saw several persons inside their house.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q-&nbsp;&nbsp;</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">What were these persons doing?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A- </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Some were seated, some were standing and there was x x x smoke.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q- </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Where was this smoke coming from?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A- </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">I did not see where the smoke [was] coming from because some of the persons were blocking [my view].</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q- </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">About how many persons were inside who were seated and who were standing?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A- </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Seven (7).</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q-&nbsp;&nbsp;</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Will you tell us if they are male or female or both?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A-</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Six (6) male persons and one (1) female.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q- </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">What are these persons who were seated inside the house doing?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A- </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">They were allegedly engaged in drug session.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">COURT:</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">What do you mean allegedly?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A- </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Because there was smoke and I did not see what they were using.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY">PROSECUTOR PAZ:</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q- </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">What about those who were standing, what were they doing?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A- </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">The persons who were standing were looking at the persons who were sitting.
