Ramos, in response to MGB R-III Director Arnulfo V. Cabantog's memorandum query dated September 8, 2004, categorically stated that the MGB-Central Office's Order dated July 16, 2004 became final on August 11, 2004, fifteen (15) days after Golden Falcon received the said Order, per the Certification dated October 8, 2004 issued by the Postmaster II of the Philippine Postal Corporation of Cainta, Rizal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Through letters dated May 5 and May 10, 2005, AMTC notified the PENRO of Bulacan and the MGB R-III Director, respectively, that the subject Applications for Quarry Permit fell within its (AMTC's) existing valid and prior Application for Exploration Permit, and the the former area of Golden Falcon was open to mining location only on August 11, 2004 per the Memorandum dated October 19, 2004 of the MGB Director, Central Office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>On June 24, 2005, Ricardo Medina, Jr., PENRO of Bulacan, indorsed AMTC's letter to the Provincial Legal Officer, Atty. Eugenio F. Resurreccion, for his legal opinion on which date of denial of Golden Falcon's application/appeal – April 29, 1998 or July 16, 2004 - is to be considered in the deliberation of the Provincial Mining Regulatory Board&nbsp; (PMRB) for the purpose of determining when the land subject of the Applications for Quarry Permit could be considered open for application.<br><br>On June 28, 2005, Provincial Legal Officer Eugenio Resurreccion issued a legal opinion stating that the Order dated July 16, 2004 of the MGB-Central Office was a mere reaffirmation of the Order dated April 29, 1998 of the MGB R-III; hence, the Order dated April 29, 1998 should be the reckoning period of the denial of the application of Golden Falcon.<br><br>On July 22, 2005, AMTC filed with the PMRB of Bulacan a formal protest against the aforesaid Applications for Quarry Permit on the ground that the subject area was already covered by its Application for Exploration Permit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>On August 8, 2005, MGB R-III Director Cabantog, who was the concurrent Chairman of the PMRB, endorsed to the Provincial Governor of Bulacan, Governor Josefina M. dela Cruz, the aforesaid Applications for Quarry Permit&nbsp; that had apparently been converted to Applications for Small-Scale Mining Permit of Eduardo D. Mercado, Benedicto S. Cruz, Gerardo R. Cruz and Lucila S. Valdez (formerly Liberato Sembrano).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>On August 9, 2005, the PENRO of Bulacan issued four memoranda recommending to Governor Dela Cruz the approval of the aforesaid Applications for Small-Scale Mining Permit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>On August 10, 2005, Governor Dela Cruz issued the corresponding Small-Scale Mining Permits in favor of Eduardo D. Mercado, Benedicto S. Cruz, Gerardo R. Cruz and Lucila S. Valdez.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Subsequently, AMTC appealed to respondent DENR Secretary the grant of the aforesaid Small-Scale Mining Permits, arguing that: (1) The PMRB of Bulacan erred in giving due course to the Applications for Small-Scale Mining Permit&nbsp; without first resolving its formal protest; (2) The areas covered by the Small-Scale Mining Permits fall within the area covered by AMTC's valid prior Application for Exploration Permit; (3) The Applications for Quarry Permit were illegally converted to Applications for Small-Scale Mining Permit; (4) DENR-MGB Director Horacio C. Ramos' ruling that the subject areas became open for mining location only on August 11, 2004 was controlling; (5) The Small-Scale Mining Permits were null and void because they covered areas that were never declared People's Small-Scale Mining Program sites as mandated by Section 4 of the People's Small-Scale Mining Act of 1991; and (6) Iron ore is not considered as one of the quarry resources, as defined by Section 43 of the Philippine Mining Act of 1995, which could be subjects of an Application for Quarry Permit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>On August 8, 2006, respondent DENR Secretary rendered a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> in favor of AMTC. The DENR Secretary agreed with MGB Director Horacio C. Ramos that the area was open to mining location only on August 11, 2004, fifteen (15) days after the receipt by Golden Falcon on July 27, 2004 of a copy of the MGB-Central Office's Order dated July 16, 2004, which Order denied Golden Falcon's appeal. According to the DENR Secretary, the filing by Golden Falcon of the letter-appeal suspended the finality of the Order of denial issued on April 29, 1998 by the Regional Director until the resolution of the appeal on July 16, 2004 by the MGB-Central Office.&nbsp; He stated that the Applications for Quarry Permit were filed on February 10, 2004 when the area was still closed to mining location; hence, the Small-Scale Mining Permits granted by the PMRB and the Governor were null and void.&nbsp; On the other hand, the DENR Secretary declared that AMTC filed its Application for Exploration Permit when the area was already open to other mining applicants; thus, AMTC’s Application for Exploration Permit was valid. Moreover, the DENR Secretary held that the questioned Small-Scale Mining Permits were issued in violation of Section 4 of R.A. No. 7076 and beyond the authority of the Provincial Governor pursuant to Section 43 of R.A. No. 7942, because the area was never proclaimed to be under the People's Small-Scale Mining Program. Further, the DENR Secretary stated that iron ore mineral is not considered among the quarry resources.<br><br>The dispositive portion of the DENR Secretary’s Decision reads:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Application for Exploration Permit, AEP-III-02-04 of Atlantic Mines and Trading Corp. is declared valid and may now be given due course. The Small-Scale Mining Permits, SSMP-B-002-05 of Gerardo Cruz, SSMP-B-003-05 of Eduardo D. Mercado, SSMP-B-004-05 of Benedicto S. Cruz and SSMP-B-005-05 of Lucila S.

Consequently, the said permits are hereby <b>CANCELLED</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Hence, petitioner League of Provinces filed this petition.<br><br>Petitioner is a duly organized league of local governments incorporated under R.A.

It states that this is not an action of one province alone, but the collective action of all provinces through the League, as a favorable ruling will not only benefit one province, but all provinces and all local governments.<br><br>Petitioner raises these issues:<br><br><blockquote><center>I</center><br>WHETHER OR NOT SECTION 17(B)(3)(III) OF THE, 1991 LOCAL GOVERNMENT CODE AND SECTION 24 OF THE PEOPLE'S SMALL-SCALE MINING ACT OF 1991 ARE UNCONSTITUTIONAL FOR PROVIDING FOR EXECUTIVE CONTROL AND INFRINGING UPON THE LOCAL AUTONOMY OF PROVINCES.<br><br><center>II</center><br>WHETHER OR NOT THE ACT OF RESPONDENT [DENR] IN NULLIFYING, VOIDING AND CANCELLING THE SMALL-SCALE MINING PERMITS AMOUNTS TO EXECUTIVE CONTROL, NOT MERELY SUPERVISION AND USURPS THE DEVOLVED POWERS OF ALL PROVINCES.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></blockquote><br>To start, the Court finds that petitioner has legal standing to file this petition because it is tasked under Section 504 of the Local Government Code of 1991 to promote local autonomy at the provincial level;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> adopt measures for the promotion of the welfare of all provinces and its officials and employees;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> and&nbsp; exercise such other powers and perform such other duties and functions as the league may prescribe for the welfare of the provinces.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Before this Court determines the validity of an act of a co-equal and coordinate branch of the Government, it bears emphasis that ingrained in our jurisprudence is the time-honored principle that a statute is presumed to be valid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> This presumption is rooted in the doctrine of separation of powers which enjoins upon the three coordinate departments of the Government a becoming courtesy for each other's acts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> This Court, however, may declare a law, or portions thereof, unconstitutional where a petitioner has shown a clear and unequivocal breach of the Constitution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> leaving no doubt or hesitation in the mind of the Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>In this case, petitioner admits that respondent DENR Secretary had the authority to nullify the Small-Scale Mining Permits issued by the Provincial Governor of Bulacan, as the DENR Secretary&nbsp; has control over the&nbsp; PMRB, and the implementation of the Small-Scale Mining Program is subject to control by respondent DENR.<br><br>Control of the DENR/DENR Secretary over small-scale mining in the provinces is granted by three statutes: (1) R.A.

The statutes are also silent as to the power of respondent DENR Secretary to substitute his own judgment over that of the Provincial Governor and the PMRB.<br><br>Moreover, petitioner contends&nbsp; that Section 17 (b)(3)(iii) of the Local Government Code of 1991 and Section 24 of R.A. No. 7076, which confer upon&nbsp; respondents DENR and the DENR Secretary the power of control are unconstitutional, as the Constitution states that the President (and Executive Departments and her alter-egos) has the power of supervision only, not control, over acts of the local government units, and grants the local government units autonomy, thus:<br><br><blockquote><u>The 1987 Constitution</u>:<br><br>Article X, Section 4. <b>The President of the Philippines shall exercise <u>general supervision</u> over local governments</b>. Provinces with respect to component cities and municipalities, and cities and municipalities with respect to component barangays, shall ensure that the acts of their component units are within the scope of their prescribed powers and functions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></blockquote><br>Petitioner contends that the policy in the above-cited constitutional provision is mirrored in the Local Government Code, which states:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 25. <i>National Supervision over Local Government Units</i>. - (a) Consistent with the basic policy on local autonomy, <b>the President shall exercise general supervision over local government units to ensure that their acts are within the scope of their prescribed powers and functions.</b><br><br>The President shall exercise supervisory authority directly over provinces, highly urbanized cities, and independent component cities; through the province with respect to component cities and municipalities; and through the city and municipality with respect to barangays.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></blockquote><br>Petitioner contends that the foregoing provisions of the Constitution and the Local Government Code of 1991 show that the relationship between the President and the Provinces or respondent DENR, as the alter ego of the President, and the Province of Bulacan is one of executive supervision, not one of executive control. The term “control” has been defined as the power of an officer to alter or modify or set aside what a subordinate officer had done in the performance of his/her duties and to substitute the judgment of the former for the latter, while the term “supervision” is the power of a superior officer to see to it that lower officers perform their function in accordance with law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Petitioner argues that respondent DENR Secretary went beyond mere executive supervision and exercised control when he nullified the small-scale mining permits granted by the Provincial Governor of Bulacan, as the former substituted the judgment of the latter.<br><br>Petitioner asserts that what is involved here is a devolved power.&nbsp; Under the Local Government Code of 1991, the power to regulate small-scale mining has been devolved to all provinces. In the exercise of devolved powers, departmental approval is not necessary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Petitioner contends that if the provisions in Section 24 of R.A. No. 7076 and Section 17 (b)(3)(iii) of the Local Government Code of 1991 granting the power of control to the DENR/DENR Secretary are not nullified, nothing would stop the DENR Secretary from nullifying, voiding and canceling the small-scale mining permits that have been issued by a Provincial Governor.<br><br>Petitioner submits that the statutory grant of power of control to respondents is unconstitutional, as the Constitution only allows supervision over local governments and proscribes control by the executive departments.<br><br>In its Comment, respondents, represented by the Office of the Solicitor General, stated that contrary to the assertion of petitioner, the power to implement the small-scale mining law is expressly limited in Section 17 (b)(3)(iii) of the Local Government Code, which provides&nbsp; that it must be carried out "pursuant to national policies and subject to supervision, control and review of the DENR."&nbsp; Moreover, the fact that the&nbsp; power to implement the small-scale mining law has not been fully devolved to provinces is further amplified by Section 4 of the People's Small-Scale Mining Act of 1991, which provides, among others, that the People's Small-Scale Mining Program shall be implemented by the DENR Secretary.<br><br>The petition lacks merit.<br><br>Paragraph 1 of Section 2, Article XII (National Economy and Patrimony) of the Constitution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> provides that “[t]he exploration, development and utilization of natural resources shall be under the full control and supervision of the State.”<br><br>Moreover, paragraph 3 of Section 2, Article XII of the Constitution provides that “[t]he Congress may, by law, allow small-scale utilization of natural resources by Filipino citizens x x x.”<br><br>Pursuant to Section 2, Article XII of the Constitution, R.A. No. 7076 or the People's Small-Scale Mining Act of 1991, was enacted, establishing&nbsp; under Section 4 thereof a People's Small-Scale Mining Program to be implemented by the DENR Secretary in coordination with other concerned government agencies.<br><br>The People's Small-Scale Mining Act of 1991 defines “small-scale mining” as “refer[ring] to mining activities, which rely heavily on manual labor using simple implement and methods and do not use explosives or heavy mining equipment.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>It should be pointed out that the Administrative Code of 1987<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>&nbsp; provides that the DENR is, subject to law and higher authority, in charge of carrying out the State's constitutional mandate, under Section 2, Article XII of the Constitution, to control and supervise the exploration, development, utilization and conservation of the country's natural resources. Hence, the enforcement of small-scale mining law in the provinces is made subject to the supervision, control and review of the DENR under the Local Government Code of 1991, while the People’s Small-Scale Mining Act of 1991 provides that the People’s Small-Scale Mining Program is to be implemented by the DENR Secretary in coordination with other concerned local government agencies.<br><br>Indeed, Section 4, Article X (Local Government) of the Constitution states that “[t]he President of the Philippines shall exercise general supervision over local governments,” and Section 25 of the Local Government Code reiterates the same. General supervision by the President means no more than seeing to it that laws are faithfully executed or that subordinate officers act within the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>The Court has clarified that the constitutional guarantee of local autonomy in the Constitution [Art. X, Sec. 2] refers to the <i>administrative</i> autonomy of local government units or, cast in more technical language, the decentralization of government authority.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> It does not make local governments sovereign within the State.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>&nbsp; Administrative autonomy may involve devolution of powers, but subject to limitations like following national policies or standards,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> and those provided by the Local Government Code, as the structuring of local governments and the allocation of powers, responsibilities, and resources among the different local government units and local officials have been placed by the Constitution in the hands of Congress<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>&nbsp; under Section 3, Article X of the Constitution.<br><br>Section 3, Article X of the Constitution mandated Congress to “enact <b><u>a local government code which shall provide for a more responsive and accountable local government structure instituted through a system of decentralization</u></b> with effective mechanisms of recall, initiative, and referendum, <b>allocate among the different local government units their powers, responsibilities, and resources, <u>and provide for the</u></b> qualifications, election, appointment and removal, term, salaries, <b><u>powers and functions and duties of local officials, and all other matters relating to the organization and operation of the local units.</u></b>”<br><br>In connection with the enforcement of the small-scale mining law in the province, Section 17 of the Local Government Code provides:<b><br><br></b><blockquote><b>SEC. 17. <i>Basic Services and Facilities</i></b>. - (a) Local 
government units shall endeavor to be self-reliant and shall continue

No. 7076, the AMTC filed on July 22, 2005 with the PMRB of Bulacan a formal protest against the Applications for Quarry Permits of Eduardo Mercado, Benedicto Cruz, Liberato Sembrano (replaced by Lucila Valdez) and Gerardo Cruz on the ground that the subject area was already covered by its Application for Exploration Permit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>&nbsp; However, on August 8, 2005, the PMRB issued Resolution Nos. 05-8, 05-9, 05-10 and 05-11, resolving to submit to the Provincial Governor of Bulacan the Applications for Small-Scale Mining Permits of Eduardo Mercado, Benedicto Cruz, Lucila Valdez and Gerardo Cruz for the granting/issuance of the said permits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> On August 10, 2005, the Provincial Governor of Bulacan issued the Small-Scale Mining Permits to Eduardo Mercado, Benedicto Cruz, Lucila Valdez and Gerardo Cruz based on the legal opinion of the Provincial Legal Officer and the Resolutions of the PMRB of Bulacan.<br><br>Hence, AMTC filed an appeal with respondent DENR Secretary, appealing from Letter-Resolution No. 05-1317 and Resolution Nos. 05-08, 05-09, 05-10 and 05-11, all dated August 8, 2005, of the PMRB of Bulacan, which resolutions gave due course and granted, on August 10, 2005, Small-Scale Mining Permits to Eduardo D. Mercado, Benedicto S. Cruz, Lucila Valdez and Gerardo Cruz involving parcels of mineral land situated at Camachin, Doña Remedios Trinidad, Bulacan.<br><br>The PMRB of Bulacan filed its Answer, stating that it is an administrative body, created under R.A. No. 7076, which&nbsp; cannot be equated with the court wherein a full-blown hearing could be conducted, but it is enough that the parties were given the opportunity to present evidence. It asserted that the questioned resolutions it issued were in accordance with the mining laws and that the Small-Scale Mining Permits granted were registered ahead of AMTC's Application for Exploration Permit. Further, the Board stated that the Governor of Bulacan&nbsp; had the power to approve the Small-Scale Mining Permits under R.A. No. 7160.<br><br>The DENR Secretary found the appeal meritorious, and resolved these pivotal issues: (1) when is the subject mining area open for mining location by other applicants; and (2) who among the applicants have valid applications. The pertinent portion of the decision of the DENR Secretary reads:<br><br><blockquote>We agree with the ruling of the MGB Director that the area is [open only] to mining location on August 11, 2004, fifteen (15) days after the receipt by Golden Falcon on July 27, 2004 of a copy of the subject Order of July 16, 2004. The filing by Golden Falcon of the letter-appeal suspended the finality of the Order of Denial issued on April 29, 1998 by the Regional Director until the Resolution thereof on July 16, 2004.<br><br>Although the subject AQPs/SSMPs were processed in accordance with the procedures of the PMRB, however, the AQPs were filed on February 10, 2004 when the area is still closed to mining location. Consequently, the SSMPs granted by the PMRB and the Governor are null and void making thereby AEP No. III-02-04 of the AMTC valid, it having been filed when the area is already open to other mining applicants.<br><br>Records also show that the AQPs were converted into SSMPs. These are two (2) different applications. The questioned SSMPs were issued in violation of Section 4 of RA 7076 and beyond the authority of the Provincial Governor pursuant to Section 43 of RA 7942 because the area was never proclaimed as "People's Small-Scale Mining Program." Moreover, iron ore mineral is not considered among the quarry resources.<br><br>x x x x<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Application for Exploration Permit, AEP-III-02-04 of Atlantic Mines and Trading Corp. is declared valid and may now be given due course. The Small-Scale Mining Permits, SSMP-B-002-05 of Gerardo Cruz, SSMP-B-003-05 of Eduardo D. Mercado, SSMP-B-004-05 of Benedicto S. Cruz and SSMP-B-005-05 of Lucila S. Valdez are declared <b>NULL AND VOID</b>. Consequently, the said permits are hereby <b>CANCELLED</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup></blockquote><br>The Court finds that the decision of the DENR Secretary was rendered in accordance with the power of review granted to the DENR Secretary in the resolution of disputes, which is provided for in Section 24 of R.A. No. 7076<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> and Section 22 of its Implementing Rules and Regulations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> It is noted that although AMTC filed a protest with the PMRB regarding its superior and prior Application for Exploration Permit over the Applications for Quarry Permit, which were&nbsp; converted to Small-Scale Mining Permits, the PMRB did not resolve the same, but issued Resolution Nos. 05-08 to 05-11 on August 8, 2005, resolving to submit to the Provincial Governor of Bulacan the Applications for Small-Scale Mining Permits of Eduardo Mercado, Benedicto Cruz, Lucila Valdez and Gerardo Cruz for the granting of the said permits.&nbsp; After the Provincial Governor of Bulacan issued the Small-Scale Mining Permits on August 10, 2005, AMTC appealed the Resolutions of the PMRB giving due course to the granting of the Small-Scale Mining Permits by the Provincial Governor.<br><br>Hence, the decision of the DENR Secretary, declaring that the Application for Exploration Permit of AMTC was valid and may be given due course, and canceling the Small-Scale Mining Permits issued by the Provincial Governor,&nbsp; emanated from the power of review granted to the DENR Secretary under R.A. No. 7076 and its Implementing Rules and Regulations. The DENR Secretary's power to review and, therefore, decide, in this case, the issue on the validity of the issuance of the Small-Scale Mining Permits by the Provincial Governor as recommended by the PMRB, is a quasi-judicial function, which involves the determination of what the law is, and what the legal rights of the contending parties are, with respect to the matter in controversy and, on the basis thereof and the facts obtaining, the adjudication of their respective rights.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> The DENR Secretary exercises quasi-judicial function under R.A. No. 7076 and its Implementing Rules and Regulations to the extent necessary in settling disputes, conflicts or litigations over conflicting claims. This quasi-judicial function of the DENR Secretary can neither be equated with “substitution of judgment” of the Provincial Governor in issuing Small-Scale Mining Permits nor “control” over the said act of the Provincial Governor as it is a determination of the rights of AMTC over conflicting claims based on the law.<br><br>In determining whether Section 17 (b)(3)(iii) of the Local Government Code of 1991 and Section 24 of R.A. No. 7076&nbsp; are unconstitutional, the Court has been guided by <b><i>Beltran v. The Secretary of Health</i></b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> which held:<br><br><blockquote>The fundamental criterion is that all reasonable doubts should be resolved in favor of the constitutionality of a statute. Every law has in its favor the presumption of constitutionality. For a law to be nullified, it must be shown that there is a clear and unequivocal breach of the Constitution. The ground for nullity must be clear and beyond reasonable doubt. Those who petition this Court to declare a law, or parts thereof, unconstitutional must clearly establish the basis therefor. Otherwise, the petition must fail.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup></blockquote><br>In this case, the Court finds that the grounds raised by petitioner to challenge the constitutionality of Section 17 (b)(3)(iii) of the Local Government Code of 1991 and Section 24 of R.A. No.7076 failed to overcome the constitutionality of the said provisions of law.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DISMISSED</b> for lack of merit.<br><br>No costs.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED</b>.<br><br><i>Carpio, Velasco, Jr., Leonardo-De Castro, Brion, Bersamin, Del Castillo, Abad, Villarama, Jr., Perez, Mendoza, Reyes</i>, and <i>Bernabe, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><i>Sereno, C.J</i>., see concurring opinion.<br><i>Leonen, J.</i>, see separate concurring opinion.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>&nbsp; Under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> DENR Decision, <span style="font-style: italic;">rollo</span>, pp. 53,54.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>, p. 54.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Id.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Id.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Id.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Id. at&nbsp; 55.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Id.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Comment of Respondents, id. at 74.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Annex “B,” id. at 25.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Annexes “D” to “D-3,” id. at 30-33.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Annexes “E” to “E-3,” id. at 34-49.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Decision of the DENR Secretary, id. at 56.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>, p. 53.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Id. at 58-59.

However, there appears to be a need to address the issue of whether petitioner League of Provinces of the Philippines has legal standing to assail the constitutionality of the subject laws.<br><br>Petitioner is a duly organized league of local governments incorporated under Republic Act No. 7610, otherwise known as the Local Government Code. It claims that it is composed of 81 local governments, including the province of Bulacan. It further claims that the instant case is a collective action of all provinces – in that, a favorable ruling will not only benefit the province of Bulacan, but also all the other provinces and local governments.<br><br>The <i>ponencia</i> upheld petitioner’s legal standing to file this petition because the latter is tasked, under Section 504 of the Local Government Code, to promote local autonomy at the provincial level, adopt measures for the promotion of the welfare of all provinces and its officials and employees, and exercise such other powers and perform such duties and functions as the league may prescribe for the welfare of the provinces.<br><br>I concur that the League has legal standing to assail the constitutionality of the subject laws.<br><br>A divergent position had been advanced by Justice Marvic M.V.F. Leonen. He says that, “[i]n case of a <b>citizen’s suit</b>, the ‘interest of the person assailing the constitutionality of a statute must be direct and personal. He must be able to show, not only that the law is invalid, but also that he has sustained or is in immediate danger of sustaining some <b>direct injury</b> as a result of its enforcement, and not merely that he <b>suffers thereby in some indefinite way</b>.’”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> He further claims that, “[A]s an organization that represents all provinces, it did not suffer an <b>actual injury</b> or an <b>injury in fact</b>, resulting from the implementation of the subject provisions.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> He, therefore, concludes that the League has no standing to assail the constitutionality of the subject laws.<br><br>A public action is a suit brought to vindicate a right belonging to the public <i>qua</i> public. Based on present jurisprudence, except in cases involving issues of transcendental importance,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> it can only be brought by the proper representative of the public – one who has standing. Generally, the one who has standing is the one who suffered or immediately stands to suffer actual injury or injury in fact.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Injury in fact means damage that is distinct from those suffered by the public.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> This is different from legal injury or injury in law, which results from a violation of a right belonging to a person.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>The divergent position appears to confuse the general requirement for standing with standing in citizens’ suits. The latter normally presupposes that there is no one who suffered injury in fact. Therefore, any citizen is allowed to bring the suit to vindicate the public’s right. Instructive are the pronouncements of this Court in the seminal case of <i>Severino v. Governor-General</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br><blockquote>It is true, as we have stated, that <b>the right which he seeks, to enforce is not greater or different from that of any other qualified elector</b> in the municipality of Silay. It is also true that the injury which he would suffer in case he fails <b>to obtain the relief sought would not be greater or different from that of the other electors; but he is seeking to enforce a public right as distinguished from a private right. The real party in interest is the public</b>, or the qualified electors of the town of Silay. Each elector has the same right and would suffer the same injury. Each elector stands on the same basis with reference to maintaining a petition to determine whether or not the relief sought by the relator should be granted.<br><br>x x x<br><br>We are therefore of the opinion that the weight of authority supports the proposition that <b>the relator is a proper party to proceedings of this character when a public right is sought to be enforced</b>. If the general rule in America were otherwise, we think that it would not be applicable to the case at bar for the reason “that it is always dangerous to apply a general rule to a particular case without keeping in mind the reason for the rule, because, if under the particular circumstances the reason for the rule does not exist, the rule itself is not applicable and reliance upon the rule may well lead to error.”<br><br>No reason exists in the case at bar for applying the general rule insisted upon by counsel for the respondent. The circumstances which surround this case are different from those in the United States, inasmuch as <b>if the relator is not a proper party to these proceedings no other person could be</b>, as we have seen that it is not the duty of the law officer of the Government to appear and represent the people in cases of this character. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>Also, the divergent position appears to confuse public actions with class suits (a species of private action) when it stated that “[p]rovinces do not have a common or general interest on matters related to mining that the League of Provinces can represent.” Under Section 12 of Rule 3 of the Rules of Court, “common or general interest” is a requirement in class suits. It is not a requirement for standing in public actions.<br><br>Finally, the divergent position also appears to confuse the general requirement for standing and standing in citizens’ suits, with organizational or associational standing. The latter does not require an association to suffer injury in fact. The question is whether such organization can bring a suit on behalf of its members who have suffered the injury in fact. In short, can the representatives of the public be themselves represented in a suit.<br><br>In this jurisdiction, we have acknowledged the standing of associations to sue on behalf of their members.&nbsp; In <i>Executive Secretary v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> we held that:<br><br><blockquote>The modern view is that an association has standing to complain of injuries to its members. This view fuses the legal identity of an association with that of its members. An association has standing to file suit for its workers despite its lack of direct interest if its members are affected by the action. An organization has standing to assert the concerns of its constituents.<br></blockquote><br>Thus, based on jurisprudence, the League has legal standing to question the constitutionality of the subject laws, not only in behalf of the province of Bulacan, but also its other members.<br><br>Apart from jurisprudence, the League is also vested with statutory standing. The League of Provinces’ primary purpose is clear from the provisions of the Local Government Code, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 502. <i>Purpose of Organization</i>. - There shall be an organization of all provinces to be known as the League of Provinces for <b>the primary purpose of ventilating, articulating and crystallizing issues affecting provincial and metropolitan political subdivision government administration, and securing, through proper and legal means, solutions thereto</b>. For this purpose, the Metropolitan Manila Area and any metropolitan political subdivision shall be considered as separate provincial units of the league.

The main question was when did the subject area become open for small scale mining applications. At that time, the provincial government did not question whether it had concurrent or more superior jurisdiction vis-a-vis the national government.<br><br>It was upon query by MGB R-III Director Arnulfo Cabantog that DENR-MGB Director Horacio Ramos stated that the denial of Golden Falcon’s application became final fifteen days after the denial of its appeal to the Central Office or on August 11, 2004.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Hence, the area of Golden Falcon’s application became open to permit applications only on that date.<br><br>After the MGB Director issued the statement, however, the Provincial Legal Officer of Bulacan, Atty. Eugenio F. Ressureccion issued a legal opinion on the issue, stating that the subject area became open for new applications on the date of the first denial on April 29, 1998.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>On the basis of the Provincial Legal Officer’s opinion, Director Cabantog of MGB R-III endorsed the applications for quarry permit, now converted to applications for small-scale mining permit, to the Governor of Bulacan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Later on, the Governor issued the small-scale mining permits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Upon appeal by the AMTC, the DENR Secretary declared as null the small-scale mining permits issued by the Governor on the ground that they have been issued in violation of Section 4 of R.A.

It may not be classified as a quarry resource, hence, the provincial governor had no authority to issue the quarry permits in the first place. Probably realizing this error, the applications for quarry permit were converted to applications for small-scale mining permit.<br><br>Even so, the issuance of the small-scale mining permit was still beyond the authority of the provincial governor. Small-scale mining areas must first be declared and set aside as such before they can be made subject of small-scale mining rights.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> The applications for small-scale mining permit, in this case, involved covered areas, which were never declared as people’s small-scale mining areas. This is enough reason to deny an application for small-scale mining permit. Permits issued in disregard of this fact are void for having been issued beyond the authority of the issuing officer.<br><br>Therefore, there was no issue of local autonomy. The provincial governor did not have the competence to issue the questioned permits.<br><br>Neither does the League of Provinces have any standing to raise the present constitutional issue.<br><br><i>Locus standi</i> is defined as “a right of appearance in a court of justice on a given question.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> The fundamental question is “whether a party alleges such personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court depends for illumination of difficult constitutional questions.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>In case of a citizens’ suit, the “interest of the person assailing the constitutionality of a statute must be direct and personal.

It cannot be said either that the provinces that Petitioner represents suffered the same injury when the Central Office nullified the permits issued by the Governor of Bulacan.<br><br>Provinces do not have a common or general interest on matters related to mining that the League of Provinces can represent. Each province has a particular interest to protect and claims to pursue that are separate and distinct from the others. Therefore, each is unique as to its reasons for raising issues to the Court. The League of Provinces cannot represent all provinces on mining-related issues. The perceived wrong suffered by the Province of Bulacan when the Central Office allegedly exercised control does not necessarily constitute a wrong suffered by the other provinces.<br><br>Furthermore, the Constitution provides for two types of local governance other than the national government: 1) The territorial and political subdivisions composed of provinces, cities, municipalities and barangays; and 2) autonomous regions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> The division of Article X of the Constitution distinguishes between their creation and relationship with the national government.<br><br>The creation of autonomous regions takes into consideration the “historical and cultural heritage, economic and social structures, and other relevant characteristics”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> which its constituent geographical areas share in common. These factors are not considered in the creation of territorial and political subdivisions.<br><br>Autonomous regions are not only created by an act of the Congress. The Constitution also provides for a plebiscite requirement before the organic act that creates an autonomous region becomes effective.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> This constitutes the creation of autonomous regions a direct act of the people. It means that the basic structure of an autonomous region, consisting of the executive department and legislative assembly, its special courts, and the provisions on its powers may not be easily amended or superseded by a simple act of the Congress.<br><br>Moreover, autonomous regions have powers, e.g. over their administrative organization, sources of revenues, ancestral domain, natural resources, personal, family and property relations, regional planning development, economic, social and tourism development, educational policies, cultural heritage and other matters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, the creation of territorial and political subdivisions is subject to the local government code enacted by the Congress without a plebiscite requirement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> While this does not disallow the inclusion of provisions requiring plebiscites in the creation of provinces, cities, and municipalities, the local government code may be amended or superseded by another legislative act that removes such requirement. Their government structure, powers, and responsibilities, therefore, are always subject to amendment by legislative acts.<br><br>The territorial and political subdivisions and autonomous regions are granted autonomy under the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> The constitutional distinctions between them imply a clear distinction between the kinds of autonomy that they exercise.<br><br>The oft-cited case of <i>Limbona v. Mangelin</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> penned by Justice Sarmiento distinguishes between two types of autonomy:<br><br><blockquote>…autonomy is either decentralization of administration or decentralization of power. There is decentralization of administration when the central government delegates administrative powers to political subdivisions in order to broaden the base of government power and in the process to make local governments ‘more responsive and accountable,’&nbsp; and ‘ensure their fullest development as self-reliant communities and make them more effective partners in the pursuit of national development and social progress’…<br><br>Decentralization of power, on the other hand, involves an abdication of political power in the favor of local governments units declared to be autonomous. In that case, the autonomous government is free to chart its own destiny and shape its future with minimum intervention from central authorities. According to a constitutional author, decentralization of power amounts to "self-immolation," since in that event, the autonomous government becomes accountable not to the central authorities but to its constituency.<br><br>xxx<br><br>An autonomous government that enjoys autonomy of the latter category [CONST. (1987), art. X sec. 15.] is subject alone to the decree of the organic act creating it and accepted principles on the effects and limits of "autonomy." On the other hand, an autonomous government of the former class is, as we noted, under the supervision of the national government acting through the President (and the Department of Local Government)…</blockquote><br>I agree that autonomy, as phrased in Section 2 of Article X of the Constitution, which pertains to provinces, cities, municipalities and barangays, refers only to administrative autonomy.<br><br>In granting autonomy, the national government does not totally relinquish its powers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> The grant of autonomy does not make territorial and political subdivisions sovereign within the state or an “imperium in imperio”.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> The aggrupation of local government units and the creation of regional development councils in Sections 13 and 14 of Article X of the Constitution do not contemplate grant of discretion to create larger units with a recognized distinct political power that is parallel to the state. It merely facilitates coordination and exchange among them, still, for the purpose of administration.<br><br>Territorial and political subdivisions are only allowed to take care of their local affairs so that governance will be more responsive and effective to their unique needs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> The Congress still retains control over the extent of powers or autonomy granted to them.<br><br>Therefore, when the national government invalidates an act of a territorial or political subdivision in the exercise of a power that is constitutionally and statutorily lodged to it, the territorial or political subdivision cannot complain that its autonomy is being violated. This is especially so when the extent of its autonomy under the Constitution or law does not include power or control over the matter, to the exclusion of the national government.<br><br>However, I do not agree that <i>Limbona v. Mangelin</i> correctly categorized the kind of autonomy that autonomous regions enjoy.<br><br>In that case, the court tried to determine the extent of self-government of autonomous governments organized under Presidential Decree No. 1618 on July 25, 1979. This is prior to the autonomous regions contemplated in the 1987 Constitution.<br><br>Autonomous regions are granted more powers and less intervention from the national government than territorial and political subdivisions. They are, thus, in a more asymmetrical relationship with the national government as compared to other local governments or any regional formation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> The Constitution grants them legislative powers over some matters, <i>e.g.</i> natural resources, personal, family and property relations, economic and tourism development, educational policies, that are usually under the control of the national government. However, they are still subject to the supervision of the President. Their establishment is still subject to the framework of the Constitution, particularly, sections 15 to 21 of Article X, national sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of the Philippines.<br><br>The exact contours of the relationship of the autonomous government and the national government are defined by legislation such as Republic Act No. 9054 or the Organic Act for the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao.
