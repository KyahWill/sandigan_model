However, we find more credence in the positive and categorical statements of Albert, against whom no ill motive was ascribed by the defense, on one hand, than in the testimonies of persons, who are in one way or another are related to Lowhen.&nbsp; Further, there is no proof of absolute physical impossibility for Lowhen to be in Amparo Subdivision in the morning of April 11, 2002, considering that Parañaque is not very far off.&nbsp; In Albert’s testimony, he merely made an estimate of the time in the morning of April 11, 2002, when Lowhen, along with six other men, went to the basement.&nbsp; Although Albert testified that it was around 6:00 a.m., he could have miscalculated the time considering that he no longer had a watch and they were in a basement.&nbsp; Besides, Lowhen was the link between Jubert and Morey, whose participations in the kidnapping incident on April 7, 2002 were clearly established.&nbsp; This renders dubious Lowhen’s claim of having introduced Jubert and Morey to each other only on April 11, 2002, or four days after the latter two had taken part in the abduction of Pinky and Albert near the Coliseum.<br><br>Jose and Roger proffered nary an explanation anent where they were on April 7, 2002.&nbsp;

He thus claimed that contrary to Albert’s claim, he could not have been in the basement of the safehouse at 6:00 a.m. of April 11, 2002.&nbsp; On the other hand, Roger alleged that at around 6:00 a.m. of April 11, 2002, while he was walking along Bravo Street, Signal Village, Bicutan, Taguig on his way to his brother’s wake, he was arrested by CIDG officers.&nbsp; However, like in the cases of Marcelo, Jubert and Robert, Jose and Roger’s averments were bare and unsupported by any corroborative evidence.<br><br>All told, we find that the RTC and the CA did not overlook essential facts or circumstances which may otherwise justify the acquittal of Marcelo, Ricky, Jubert, Robert, Morey, Lowhen, Jose and Roger for having conspired in kidnapping Albert for the purpose of extorting ransom.&nbsp;

No such motions were filed by the accused-appellants.<br><br>Further, without meaning to downplay or take the allegations of the accused-appellants lightly, we, however, note that these were unsubstantiated as to the identities of the offenders and uncorroborated by other pieces of evidence.&nbsp; To date, no complaints against the supposed abusive police officers had yet been filed by the accused-appellants.&nbsp; If the abuses were indeed committed, we exhort the accused-appellants to initiate the proper administrative and criminal proceedings to make the erring police officers liable.&nbsp; We stress that while the criminal justice system is devised to punish the offenders, it is no less the State’s duty to ensure that those who administer it do so with clean hands.<br><br><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td style="font-weight: bold;" width="40%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Betty and Monico are to be held as co-conspirators because they knowingly provided the venue for Albert’s detention.</div></td> <td width="60%"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br>In implicating Monico, Albert testified:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY">PROS.
