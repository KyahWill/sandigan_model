Villanueva <i>(Villanueva</i>) to nullity the decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated May 28, 2009 and the resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated January 11, 2010 of the Court of Appeals <span style="font-style: italic;">(CA)</span> in CA-G.R. SP No. 102128 insofar as it reversed the disposition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> of the Secretary of Justice <i>(Secretary)</i> in LS. No. 05-3813 (docketed before the Quezon City Regional Trial Court <i>(RTC)</i>, Branch 97, as Criminal Case No. Q-06-14.3 768 ). The Secretary set aside the resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> of the City Prosecutor of Quezon City <i>(prosecutor)</i> and directed tile withdrawal of the information for homicide filed against Villanueva.<br><br><center><b><u>The Factual Antecedents</u></b><br></center><br>As the CA summarized in its decision, an altercation occurred between Renato Caparas, husband of respondent Edna R. Caparas, and Villanueva in the morning of August 24, 2005, which altercation led to the death of Renato. On September 7, 2005, Edna filed a criminal complaint for murder against Villanueva.<br><br>During the preliminary investigation, Edna submitted her affidavit; the affidavit of her neighbor, Fernando Gonzales, who witnessed the incident; and the autopsy report of the Philippine National Police-Central Police District Crime Laboratory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Villanueva, for his part, submitted his affidavit; the affidavit of Joan Miguel, Villanueva’s girlfriend and the niece of Edna; the affidavit of Lourdes Miguel, Renato’s sister; and the affidavit of Jovita Caparas, Renato and Lourdes’ mother, who were all witnesses to the incident. Villanueva submitted as well as the opinion of Dr. Valentin T. Bernales of the National Bureau of Investigation Medico-Legal Division <span style="font-style: italic;">(NBI opinion)</span> as to the cause of Renato’s head injuries.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Finding probable cause, the prosecutor filed a criminal information for homicide<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> against Villanueva on October 3, 2006.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Villanueva sought reconsideration of the prosecutor’s resolution, but the prosecutor denied the motion on March 22, 2007. Before he could be arraigned,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Villanueva filed a petition for review before the Department of Justice.<br><br><b><i>The DOJ Secretary’s Resolution</i></b><br><br>On July 27, 2007, the Secretary set aside the prosecutor’s resolution and directed the prosecutor to move for the withdrawal of the information. The Secretary found the evidence against Villanueva insufficient to support a <i>prima facie</i> case. With the Secretary’s denial of Edna’s motion for reconsideration on January 4, 2008, Edna sought recourse with the CA via a Rule 65 petition for <i>certiorari.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br><b><i>The Ruling of the CA</i></b><br><br>The CA reversed the Secretary’s resolution and ordered the reinstatement of the prosecutor’s resolution and the corresponding information. It held that the Secretary exceeded the functional requirements of a preliminary investigation in passing upon the validity of matters essentially evidentiary in nature; grave abuse of discretion intervened when he passed upon the merits of Villanueva’s defenses, a matter best ventilated in the trial proper. The CA concluded that the facts and the pieces of evidence presented sufficiently supported the finding of probable cause to indict Villanueva for Homicide.<br><br>The CA also denied Villanueva’s motion to dismiss, based on the order dated February 16, 2009 of the RTC<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> granting the motion for the withdrawal of the information. The CA’s denial of Villanueva’s motion for reconsideration gave rise to and prompted the present recourse.<br><br><center><b><u>The Petition</u></b></center><br>Villanueva argues in the petition before us that the CA decided questions of substance in a way not in accord with law and jurisprudence, and it departed from the accepted and usual course of judicial proceedings when the CA:<br><br><ol><li>ordered the reinstatement of the information; and<br><br></li><li>reversed and set aside the resolution of the Secretary that was fully in accord with law and the facts established by the evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br></li></ol><br><center><b><u>The Case for the Respondents</u></b></center><br>Edna, in her response,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> argues that, <i>first</i>, the issue raised before the CA is whether the Secretary committed grave abuse of discretion in issuing his resolution which was cited as basis for Villanueva’s motion to withdraw the information; thus, after setting aside the Secretary’s resolution and finding probable cause, the CA correctly ordered the reinstatement of the information; and <i>second,</i> the CA correctly ruled that the Secretary gravely abused his discretion when he reversed the finding of probable cause as he relied on the unconfirmed affidavit of Jovita and on the NBI opinion, and disregarded the testimony of Edna and her witness and the autopsy report.<br><br><center><b><u>The Court’s Ruling</u></b></center><br>The petition poses to us the issue of whether the CA correctly ruled that the Secretary exceeded the bounds of his jurisdiction when he reversed the prosecutor’s resolution finding probable cause to indict Villanueva for homicide and, pursuant to this conclusion, ordered the withdrawal of the resolution.<br><br>The petitioner posits that: (1) the CA passed upon the findings of the RTC although the latter’s findings were not in issue before the CA; (2) the Secretary is specifically granted the power, among others, to reverse the findings of the prosecutor when, as in this case, they are contrary to the evidence; and (3) the CA completely disregarded the affidavits of Lourdes and Jovita, and the NBI opinion, among others.<br><br>We find the CA decision and resolution in accord with law and jurisprudence in finding that the Secretary acted with grave abuse of discretion when he reversed the prosecutor’s resolution finding probable cause to charge Villanueva with homicide.<br><br>Probable cause, for purposes of filing criminal information, pertains to facts and circumstances sufficient to incite a well-founded belief that a crime has been committed and the accused is probably guilty thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>&nbsp; Only such facts sufficient to support a <i>prima facie </i>case against the respondent are required, not absolute certainty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Probable cause implies mere probability of guilt, i.e., a finding based on more than bare suspicion but less than evidence that would justify a conviction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> The strict validity and merits of a party's accusation or defense, as well as admissibility of testimonies and pieces of evidence, are better ventilated during the trial proper of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>The determination of probable cause is essentially an executive function,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> lodged in the first place on the prosecutor who conducted the preliminary investigation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> on the offended party’s complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> The prosecutor’s ruling is reviewable by the Secretary<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> who, as the final determinative authority on the matter, has the power to reverse, modify or affirm the prosecutor’s determination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> As a rule, the Secretary’s findings are not subject to interference by the courts,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> save only when he acts with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> or when he grossly misapprehends facts;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> or acts in a manner so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined by law; or when he acts outside the contemplation of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>In order to arrive at probable cause, the elements of the crime charged, homicide in this case, should be present.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>&nbsp; Jurisprudence laid out the elements of homicide as: (1) a person was killed; (2) the accused killed him without any justifying circumstance; (3) the accused had the intention to kill, which is presumed; and (4) the killing was not attended by any of the qualifying circumstances of murder, or by that of parricide or infanticide.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>&nbsp; All of these elements are present in this case, as adequately shown by the affidavits of Edna and her witness, and by the autopsy report.<br><br>We agree with the CA that the Secretary, in this case, calibrated the evidentiary weight of the NBI opinion <i>vis-a-vis</i> the autopsy report, as well as Edna’s complaint-affidavit <i>vis-à-vis</i> the affidavit of Jovita, and in so doing, already went into the strict merits of Villanueva’s defenses. We note that the NBI opinion was procured at Villanueva’s instance and was based on the documents and in response to the questions Villanueva posed,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> while Jovita was unable to recall the events that transpired relative to Renato’s death when asked during the preliminary investigation. Whether the alternative scenario on the cause of Renato’s injuries and death (as supported by Jovita’s affidavit and the NBI opinion and which Villanueva proposed by way of defense) is more credible and more likely than the narrations of Edna in her complaint-affidavit, in the affidavit of her witness, and the NBI autopsy report should best be left for the trial court to determine after a full- blown trial on the merits. When the Secretary made a determination based on his own appreciation of the pieces of evidence for and against Villanueva, he effectively assumed the function of a trial judge in the evaluation of the pieces of evidence and, thereby, acted outside his jurisdiction.<br><br>Finally, while the CA may have discussed the propriety of the RTC's order granting the withdrawal of the information&nbsp; a matter not directly raised in the petition before the appellate court the discussion was done only in response to Villanueva's own manifestation and motion tor the dismissal of the petition by reason of the order of the RTC:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> In this light, the CA's discussion of the matter is fully justifiable and understandable. We agree with the CA that the order of the RTC for the withdrawal of information simply relied on the Secretary's resolution granting the withdrawal of the information.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Since the Secretary's resolution is void, the consequent order of the RTC, made on the basis of this void resolution, should likewise be void and of no effect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>In sum, the CA did not commit any reversible error when it nullified and set aside the resolution rendered by the Secretary with grave abuse of discretion. Accordingly, the CA also did not err in ordering the reinstatement of the prosecutor's resolution of probable cause and its accompanying information.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, we <b>DENY</b> the petition for lack of merit, and accordingly <b>AFFIRM</b> the decision of the Court of Appeals dated May 28, 2009 and its resolution dated January 11, 2010 in CA-G.R.
