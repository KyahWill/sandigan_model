preliminary hearing be set in order to determine first the integrity of the ballots and the ballot boxes used in the elections. He further urged that, should it be shown during such hearing that the ballots and ballot boxes were not preserved, the HRET should direct the printing of the picture images of the ballots of the questioned precincts stored in the data storage device for said precincts.<br><br>The motion was prompted by certain irregularities<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> in the condition of the ballot boxes subject of the revision, which Panotes described as follows:<br><blockquote><u>Outer condition</u>:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">a. The top cover of the ballot box is loose and can be lifted, so the election documents – e.g. ballots, minutes of voting, election returns – can be taken out.<br><br>b. In some ballot boxes, when the key was inserted into the padlock, the upper portion of the lock disconnected from its body, which means that the lock had been previously tampered with.<br><br>c. In the municipalities where Petitioner (Panotes) was able to seal the ballot boxes with packing tape, this tape seal was broken/cut/sliced, which means that the ballot boxes had been opened prior to the initial revision.<br><br>d. Some of the self-locking security seal was not properly attached.<br></div><br><u>Inner condition</u>:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">a. The contents of the ballot box – e.g. ballots and the documents – were in total disarray, which means that it was tampered with.<br><br>b. Some of the Minutes of Voting and Election Returns were MISSING and only the ballots were found inside the ballot box.<br><br>c. The ballots were unnecessarily folded and/or crumpled in the clustered precincts where the votes of (Panotes) were substantially reduced.</div></blockquote><br>Consequently, in its Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> No. 11-208, the HRET directed the copying of the picture image files of ballots relative to the protest, which was scheduled to commence on April 25, 2011 and everyday thereafter until completion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Chato,&nbsp; however,&nbsp; moved<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> for the cancellation of the decryption and copying of ballot images arguing <i>inter alia</i> that there was no legal basis therefor and that the HRET had not issued any guidelines governing the exercise thereof.<br><br>Notwithstanding, the decryption and copying proceeded as scheduled. <br><br>Chato then&nbsp; filed an Urgent Motion to Prohibit the Use by Protestee of the Decrypted and Copied Ballot Images in the Instant Case<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> reiterating the lack of legal basis for the decryption and copying of ballot images inasmuch as no preliminary hearing had been conducted showing that the integrity of the ballots and ballot boxes was not preserved. She cited Section 10(d) of the HRET Guidelines on the Revision of Ballots, which reads:<br><br><blockquote>(d) When it has been shown, in a preliminary hearing set by the parties or by the Tribunal, that the integrity of the ballots and ballot boxes used in the May 10, 2010 elections was not preserved, as when there is proof of tampering or substitutions, the Tribunal shall direct the printing of the picture images of the ballots of the subject precinct stored in the data storage device for the same precinct. The Tribunal shall provide a non- partisan technical person who shall conduct the necessary authentication process to ensure that the data or image stored is genuine and not a substitute.&nbsp; It is only upon such determination that the printed picture image can be used for the revision, (<i>as amended per Resolution of February 10, 2011</i>).</blockquote><br>Moreover, Chato alleged that the ballot images were taken from polluted Compact Flash (CF) cards. Atty. Anne A. Romero-Cortez (Atty. Cortez), the Camarines Norte Provincial Elections Supervisor, was said to have admitted during canvassing proceedings that the CF cards for the Municipalities of Labo, Vinzons and Basud were defective and had to be replaced. The pertinent portion of the Transcript of Stenographic Notes (TSN) taken during the canvassing proceedings for President and Vice- President held on June 2, 2010 is reproduced hereunder:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="25%"><div align="JUSTIFY">REP.

Marie Grace T. Javier- Ibay, who formally requested on February 10, 2011 the copying of the picture image files of ballots and election returns in 13 election protests pending before it. Should he then decide to use the decrypted and copied ballot images, there is nothing in the HRET rules that prohibit the same.<br><br>With respect to the allegation that certain defective CF cards were replaced, Panotes argued<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> that it was during the election day, May 10, 2010, that the CF cards were found to be not working so they had to be re- configured. Consequently, the voting in some precincts in the Municipalities of Labo, Vinzons and Basud started late, but the voting period was extended accordingly. For this reason, the canvassing before the Provincial Board of Canvassers was halted in order to wait for the transmission of the results from the Municipal Board of Canvassers, which could not be done until each and every clustered precinct was duly accounted for.<br><br>The case was subsequently set for preliminary hearing on May 27, 2011 in order to determine the integrity of the CF cards used in the questioned elections.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp; In said hearing, Chato presented the following witnesses: (1) Oscar Villafuerte, Vice-Chairman of the Provincial Board of Canvassers of Camarines Norte; (2) Reynaldo Mago, a media practitioner; and (3) Angel Abria, an Information Technology (IT) expert.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>On June 8, 2011, the HRET issued the assailed Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> No. 11- 321 denying Chato's Urgent Motion to Prohibit the Use by Protestee of the Decrypted and Copied Ballot Images in the Instant Case on the ground that she failed to show proof that the CF cards used in the twenty (20) precincts in the Municipalities of Basud and Daet with substantial variances were not preserved or were violated. The Tribunal stressed that, since Atty. Cortez was not presented in court to clarify the matter of the alleged replacement of CF cards, it remained unclear whether the replacement was done before or after the elections, and which precincts were involved. Moreover, the testimonies of the witnesses that were actually presented were found to be irrelevant and immaterial.<br><br>Significantly, the HRET declared that, although the actual ballots used in the May 10, 2010 elections are the best evidence of the will of the voters, the picture images of the ballots are regarded as the equivalent of the original, citing Rule 4 of the Rules on Electronic Evidence, which reads:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 1. <i>Original of an electronic document. </i>– An electronic document shall be regarded as the equivalent of an original document under the Best Evidence Rule if it is a printout or output readable by sight or other means, shown to reflect the data accurately.<br><br>Sec. 2. <i>Copies as equivalent of the originals.</i> – When a document is in two or more copies executed at or about the same time with identical contents, or is a counterpart produced by the same impression as the original, or from the same matrix, or by mechanical or electronic re- recording, or by chemical reproduction, or by other equivalent techniques which accurately reproduces the original, such copies or duplicates shall be regarded as the equivalent of the original.<br><br>Notwithstanding the foregoing, copies or duplicates shall not be admissible to the same extent as the original if:<br><br>(a) a genuine question is raised as to the authenticity of the original; or (b) in the circumstances it would be unjust or inequitable to admit the copy in lieu of the original.</blockquote><br>Aggrieved, Chato filed a Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>, which was denied in the Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> No. 11-487 dated September 15, 2011.&nbsp; The HRET categorically held that:<br><br><blockquote>x x x (T)he votes determined after the revision in the <b>20 precincts in Basud and Daet, which yielded reversal of votes</b>, cannot be relied upon, as they do not reflect the true will of the electorate. Hence, the Tribunal has to rely on what is reflected in the election returns and/or statement of votes by precinct the same being the best evidence of the results of the election in said precincts in lieu of the altered ballots.</blockquote><br><center><b>The Issues</b><br></center><br><b><i>G.R.

No. 8436, as amended by R.A. No. 9369, which reads in part as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Sec.15.<i> Official Ballot.</i> – x x x<br><br>x x x x<br><br>With respect to a paper-based election system, the official ballots shall be printed by the National Printing Office and/or the <i>Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas</i> at the price comparable with that of private printers under proper security measures which the Commission shall adopt.

Accredited political parties and deputized citizen's arms of the Commission shall assign watchers in the printing, storage and distribution of official ballots.<br><br>x x x x</blockquote><br>Section 2 (3) of R.A. No. 9369 defines “official ballot” <b>where AES is utilized</b> as the “paper ballot, whether printed or generated by the technology applied, that faithfully captures or represents the votes cast by a voter recorded or to be recorded in electronic form.”<br><br>An automated election system, or AES, is a system using appropriate technology which has been demonstrated in the voting, counting, consolidating, canvassing, and transmission of election result, and other electoral process.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> There are two types of AES identified under R.A. No. 9369: (1) paper-based election system; and (2) direct recording electronic election system. A <i>paper-based election system</i>, such as the one adopted during the May 10, 2010 elections, is the type of AES that “use paper ballots, records and counts votes, tabulates, consolidates/canvasses and transmits electronically the results of the vote count.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>&nbsp; On the other hand, <i>direct recording electronic election system</i> “uses electronic ballots, records, votes by means of a ballot display provided with mechanical or electro-optical component that can be activated by the voter, processes data by means of computer programs, record voting data and ballot images, and transmits voting results electronically.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>As earlier stated, the May 10, 2010 elections used a paper-based technology that allowed voters to fill out an official paper ballot by shading the oval opposite the names of their chosen candidates. Each voter was then required to personally feed his ballot into the Precinct Count Optical Scan (PCOS) machine which scanned both sides of the ballots simultaneously,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> meaning, in just one pass.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>&nbsp; As established during the required demo tests, the system captured the images of the ballots in encrypted format which, when decrypted for verification, were found to be digitized representations of the ballots cast.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>We agree, therefore, with both the HRET and Panotes that the picture images of the ballots, as scanned and recorded by the PCOS, are likewise “official ballots” that faithfully captures in electronic form the votes cast by the voter, as defined by Section 2 (3) of R.A. No. 9369.&nbsp; As such, the printouts thereof are the functional equivalent of the paper ballots filled out by the voters and, thus, may be used for purposes of revision of votes in an electoral protest.<br><br>It bears stressing that the digital images of the ballots captured by the PCOS machine are stored in an <b>encrypted format</b> in the CF cards.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> “<b>Encryption</b> is the process of encoding messages (or information) in such a way that eavesdroppers or hackers cannot read it, but that authorized parties can.&nbsp; In an encryption scheme, the message or information (referred to as plaintext) is encrypted using an encryption algorithm, turning it into an unreadable ciphertext.&nbsp; This is usually done with the use of an encryption key, which specifies how the message is to be encoded. Any adversary that can see the ciphertext, should not be able to determine anything about the original message. An authorized party, however, is able to decode the ciphertext using a <b>decryption</b> algorithm, that usually requires a secret&nbsp; decryption key, that adversaries do not have access to.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Despite this security feature, however, the possibility of tampering or substitution of the CF cards did not escape the HRET, which provided in its Guidelines on the Revision of Ballots that:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 11.&nbsp; <i>Printing of the picture images of the ballots in lieu of photocopying. </i>– Unless it has been shown, in a preliminary hearing set by the parties or motu propio, that the integrity of any of the Compact Flash (CF) Cards used in the May 10, 2010 elections was not preserved or the same was violated, as when there is proof of tampering or substitution, the Tribunal, in lieu of photocopying of ballots upon any motion of any of the parties, shall direct the printing of the picture image of the ballots of the subject precinct stored in the data storage device for the same precinct. The Tribunal shall provide a non-partisan technical person who shall conduct the necessary authentication process to ensure that the data or image stored is genuine and not a substitute.</blockquote><br>Accordingly, the HRET set the instant case for preliminary hearing on May 27, 2011, and directed Chato, the protestant, to present testimonial and/or documentary evidence to show proof that the integrity of the CF cards used in the May 10, 2010 elections was not preserved or was violated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>However, in the assailed Resolution No. 11-321, the HRET found Chato's evidence insufficient. The testimonies of the witnesses she presented were declared irrelevant and immaterial as they did not refer to the CF cards used in the 20 precincts in the Municipalities of Basud and Daet with substantial variances. Pertinent portions of the transcripts of stenographic notes during the May 27, 2011 preliminary hearing are quoted hereunder:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br><blockquote><u>REYNANTE B.

Thus, for failure of Chato to discharge her burden of proving that the integrity of the questioned CF cards had not been preserved, no further protestations to the use of the picture images of the ballots as stored in the CF cards should be entertained.<br><br>Moreover, after having participated and presented her evidence at the May 27, 2011 preliminary hearing, Chato cannot now be heard to complain that the proceedings therein did not amount to a full blown trial on the merits required in the case of <i>Tolentino v.

As correctly pointed out by the HRET, the same concerns only one (1) precinct out of the 20 precincts with substantial variances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> At any rate, the following explanation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> proferred by the HRET should put the issue to rest, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>x x x [O]n November 2, 2011, John Rex C. Laudiangco of the COMELEC Law Department, filed <i>Comelec's Compliance with Manifestation and Motion to Admit the Attached Fact-Finding Investigation Report</i> explaining the delay in the conduct of the investigation which was duly conducted on October 7, 2011, and submitting therewith a comprehensive Fact-Finding Investigation Report on the said investigation which was docketed in the Law Department as Case No. FF.INV. (LD) 11-46 entitled <i>“In the Matter of Investigation on What Happened to the Main CF (Compact Flash) card for Clustered Precinct No. 44 for the Municipality of Daet, Camarines Norte.”</i><br><br>In sum, the investigation revealed that the main CF Card for CP No. 44 of the Municipality of Daet could possibly be located inside the ballot box of the Municipal Board of Canvassers (MBOC) of Daet, Camarines Norte (serial no. CE-07-166991), after having been allegedly submitted in an improvised envelope, by the Board of Election Inspectors (BEI) of said CP 44 to the MBOC. It was, therefore, recommended that said ballot box be opened to retrieve the said CF card.<br><br>Accordingly, in her January 6, 2012 letter to public respondent, Atty. Anne A. Romero-Cortez submitted certain documents relative to the opening of the ballot box of the MBOC of Daet, Camarines Norte (serial no. CE-07-166991) so the main CF Card for CP 44 of Daet may be retrieved and its custody turned over to the Election Records and Statistics Department (ERSD), COMELEC.<br><br>Likewise, in her January 6, 2012 letter to public respondent, ERSD Director Ester L. Villaflor-Roxas requested that a representative from public respondent be present on the day to witness the verification and backing-up of the contents of the main CF card for CP No. 44 of Daet, Camarines Norte.<br><br>Verily, the case of the alleged missing CF Card for Clustered Precinct No. 44 is no mystery at all.</blockquote><br><b><i>G.R. No. 201350</i></b><br><br>In the main, Panotes ascribes grave abuse of discretion on the part of the HRET in ordering the continuation of the revision of ballots in the remaining&nbsp; 75%&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; protested&nbsp; clustered&nbsp; precincts&nbsp; despite&nbsp; having previously ruled that the votes determined after the revision in the 20 precincts in the Municipalities of Basud and Daet, which yielded reversal of votes, cannot be relied upon, as they do not reflect the true will of the electorate.<br><br>The Constitution mandates that the HRET “shall be the sole judge of all contests relating to the election, returns and qualifications” of its members. By employing the word “sole”, the Constitution is emphatic that the jurisdiction of the HRET in the adjudication of election contests involving its members is intended to be its own – full, complete and unimpaired.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> The Tribunal, thus, unequivocally asserted its exclusive control in Rule 7 of the 2011 HRET Rules, as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Rule 7. <i>Exclusive Control of Functions</i>. – The Tribunal shall have exclusive control, direction, and supervision of all matters pertaining to its own functions and operation.</blockquote><br>There can be no challenge, therefore, to such exclusive control absent any clear showing, as in this case, of arbitrary and improvident use by the Tribunal of its power that constitutes a denial of due process of law, or upon a demonstration of a very clear unmitigated error, manifestly constituting such grave abuse of discretion that there has to be a remedy therefor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>Contrary to Panotes' posturing, there existed legal and factual bases for the revision of the remaining 75% of the protested clustered precincts. Rule 37 of the 2011 HRET Rules clearly provides that, after post-revision determination of the merit or legitimacy of the protest, the Tribunal may proceed with the revision of the ballots in the remaining contested precincts, thus:<br><br><blockquote>Rule 37. <i>Post-Revision Determination of the Merit or Legitimacy of Protest Prior to Revision of Counter-Protest; Pilot Precincts; Initial Revision</i>. – Any provision of these Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, as soon as the issues in any contest before the Tribunal have been joined, the Protestant, in case the protest involves more than 50% of the total number of precincts in the district, shall be required to state and designate in writing within a fixed period at most twenty five (25%) percent of the total number of precincts involved in the protest which said party deems as best exemplifying or demonstrating the electoral irregularities or fraud pleaded by him; and the revision of the ballots or the examination, verification or re-tabulation of election returns and/or reception of evidence shall begin with such pilot precincts designated. Otherwise, the revision of ballots or the examination, verification and re-tabulation of election returns and/or reception of evidence shall begin with all the protested precincts. The revision of ballots or the examination, verification and re-tabulation of election returns in the counter-protested precincts shall not be commenced until the Tribunal shall have determined through appreciation of ballots or election documents and/or reception of evidence, which reception shall not exceed ten (10) days, the merit or legitimacy of the protest, relative to the pilot protested precincts. Based on the results of such post-revision determination, the Tribunal may dismiss the protest without further proceedings, if and when no reasonable recovery was established from the pilot protested precincts, or proceed with the revision of the ballots or the examination, verification and re-tabulation of election returns in the remaining contested precincts.<br></blockquote><br>Panotes argues that Chato had not made a reasonable recovery in the initial revision of ballots in the 25% pilot protested clustered precincts and, as such, the HRET should have dismissed the protest in accordance with the aforequoted provision instead of ordering further the revision of the remaining 75% of the protested clustered precincts.<br><br>It should be pointed out, however, that the provision in question is couched in the permissive term "may" instead of the mandatory word "shall." Therefore, it is merely directory, and the HRET is not without authority to opt to proceed with the revision of ballots in the remaining contested precincts even if there was no reasonable recovery made by the protestant in the initial revision.<br><br>In the assailed Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> No. 12-079, the HRET justified its action by its need “to re-examine what appears to be a peculiar design to impede the will of the electorate,” and that a revision of all the protested clustered precincts will allow it “to see the whole picture of the controversy.” Thus said the HRET:<br><br><blockquote>The evidence as presented by the parties involving the twenty-five percent (25%) pilot protested clustered precincts is still insufficient to justify an indubitable conclusion.&nbsp; There are still material issues that should be taken into account. The substantial increase in the number of ballots for protestant and the substantial decrease in the number of ballots for protestee after comparing the election returns with the physical counts of the ballots are <i>prima facie</i> findings that should not be trivialized. Also, the reliability of the compact flash cards including its admissibility was raised by the protestant as an area of concern which needs precise and definitive ruling by the Tribunal.&nbsp; A complete disavowal of the constitutional duty will be debased if the Tribunal is not going to see the whole picture of the controversy. After all, the revision proceedings will not unduly toll the precious time of the Tribunal. All of the ballot boxes involved in this protest are already in the custody of the Tribunal and will not require sizeable manpower to revise it.</blockquote><br>At the risk of unduly encroaching on the exclusive prerogative of the HRET as the sole judge of e!ection contests involving its members, we cannot substitute our own judgment for that of the HRET on the issues of whether the evidence presented during the initial revision could affect the officially proclaimed results and whether the continuation of the revision proceedings could lead to a determination of the true will of the electorate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>In any case, as pointed out by the HRET, the revision proceedings for the remaining 75% protested clustered precincts had already been conducted from May 2-9, 2012 thereby rendering the issue moot and academic.<br><br>Having, thus, established the futility of Panotes' case, we need not belabor the other issues raised in this petition.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petitions are hereby <b>DISMISSED</b> for lack of merit.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Carpio, Leonardo-De Castro, Del Castillo, Abad, Villarama, Jr., Perez, Mendoza, Sereno, Reyes, </span>and<span style="font-style: italic;"> Leonen, JJ</span>., concur.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Velasco, Jr., J.</span>, no part, HRET&nbsp; Chairman.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Brion, J.,</span> on leave.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Peralta</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Bersamin, JJ</span>., no part, members of HRET.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Roque, Jr. v.
