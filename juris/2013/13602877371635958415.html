CR-H.C. No. 02045 which affirmed her conviction for illegal sale of dangerous drugs by the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Las Piñas City, Branch 275 in Criminal Case No. 99-1127.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br><b><i>Factual Antecedents</i></b><br><br>Appellant, together with her mother, Primitiva M. Seraspe (Seraspe), and Melba L. Espiritu (Espiritu) were charged with violation of Section 15, Article II of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 6425 (The Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972), as amended, in an Amended Information,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> the accusatory portion of which reads as follows:<br><br><blockquote>That on or about June 1, 1999 in Las Piñas City and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, [the] above-named accused, <b><u>conspiring, conniving, confederating, and helping one&nbsp; another</u></b>, did, then and there willfully, unlawfully, feloniously and knowingly sell, dispense, transport, deal in, administer, deliver, negotiate and distribute 983.5 grams of methamphetamine hydrochloride (shabu), a regulated drug, to Ms. Criselda Manila, who acted as poseur buyer, said accused, selling, dispensing, transporting, administering and distributing the aforementioned regulated drug without any license, permit or authority from the government to do so, in consideration of an amount of money which accused demanded and received from the poseur buyer.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br></blockquote><br>The three entered separate pleas of “not guilty” to the crime charged during their arraignment on December 1, 1999.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Thereafter, trial ensued.<br><br><b><i>Version of the Prosecution</i></b><br><br>The key witnesses presented by the prosecution were Police Chief Inspector Ricardo Dandan (P/Chief Insp. Dandan), a member of the now defunct Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Task Force (PAOCTF), and Criselda Manila, a.k.a., Carla (Carla), liaison officer of PAOCTF.&nbsp; From their testimonies,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> the following facts emerge:<br><br>On May 15, 1999, P/Chief Insp. Dandan received a telephone call from a confidential informant who told him about the drug trafficking activities of Espiritu in Cainta and in the Cities of Las Piñas, Muntinlupa, Taguig and Parañaque. He immediately reported this information to Senior Police Superintendent Cesar Mancao, who, in turn, instructed him to create a police team to conduct an operation relative thereto. P/Chief Insp. Dandan thus formed Team Golf composed of SPO4 Bahadi (also referred to as SPO4 Bajade), SPO4 Tuanggang, SPO2 Roberto O. Agbalog, PO3 Osmundo B. Cariño (PO3 Cariño), SPO1 Leopoldo Platilla, SPO2 Laroga (also referred to as SPO2 Laruga), PO3 Olaya and Carla. Carla was to act as the poseur-buyer and PO3 Cariño as her husband.<br><br>On the same day, Team Golf proceeded to SM Southmall in Las Piñas City and met the confidential informant. Thereafter Carla, PO3 Cariño and the civilian informant headed to Espiritu’s house and presented themselves to Espiritu. After the introductions, negotiation for the sale of <i>shabu</i> followed. Carla ordered two kilos of <i>shabu</i> for a discounted price of P750,000.00.&nbsp; Espiritu, in turn, took Carla’s cellphone number and promised to call once the <i>shabu</i> becomes available.<br><br>On May 27, 1999, Espiritu called Carla and asked the latter to wait. She again called two days later and arranged for a meeting at noon of the next day in SM Bacoor. Hence, on May 30, 1999, Carla proceeded to the agreed place while Espiritu arrived thereat together with appellant. Espiritu directed appellant to give a sample of the <i>shabu</i> to Carla inside the rest room so the latter could examine it. Appellant obliged. After they parted ways, Carla gave the sample to P/Chief Insp. Dandan, who readily knew that the same was <i>shabu</i> because of his familiarity with the drug.<br><br>At around 7:00 p.m. of the same day, Espiritu again called Carla and told her that she already has two kilos of <i>shabu</i> but would deliver only one kilo. She would deliver the rest after receipt of the payment for the first. The two then agreed to meet in the food court of RFC Manuela (RFC Food Court), Las Piñas City for the delivery of the drugs.<br><br>Upon learning this, P/Chief Insp. Dandan immediately gathered the buy- bust team, gave them instructions and prepared <b>four marked 500 peso bills and boodle money</b>. The team then repaired to the meeting place on June 1, 1999. At about 3:00 p.m., Carla and PO3 Cariño occupied one of the tables in the RFC Food Court while the rest of the team positioned themselves nearby. Espiritu and appellant arrived at around 5:00 p.m. After ascertaining from Carla if she brought the money, Espiritu ordered appellant to get the <i>shabu</i>. Appellant left and returned 30 minutes later with her mother, Seraspe, who was then carrying a bag. Appellant took the said bag and handed it to Espiritu, who, together with Carla, proceeded to the restroom to examine the contents thereof. When Carla emerged from the restroom, she made the pre-arranged signal by scratching her head. Whereupon, the buy-bust team arrested Espiritu, Seraspe and appellant. The marked money was recovered from Espiritu while the plastic bag containing the substance subject of the buy-bust operation was marked by PO3 Cariño with the Visayan word “<i>tigulang</i>.”&nbsp; Upon laboratory examination, the seized specimen weighing 983.5 grams was found positive for methamphetamine hydrochloride or <i>shabu</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br><b><i>Version of the Defense</i></b><br><br>Espiritu, Seraspe and appellant claimed that they were merely induced by the PAOCTF operatives to sell the dangerous drug. Their testimonies<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> revealed the following circumstances:<br><br>Espiritu first met Carla when the latter went to her house together with the civilian informant in the second week of April 1999. Carla wanted to talk to Espiritu’s husband, who is a lawyer and a casino financier, in the hope of getting his help in purchasing <i>shabu</i> from his Chinese clients. When Espiritu told Carla that her husband does not want to get involved in that kind of business, Carla instead sought her help. Carla promised to pay P750,00.00 for a kilo of <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span>. Fearing that her husband would get mad about it, Espiritu declined the offer.<br><br>After a couple of days, Carla returned to Espiritu’s house, this time with PO3 Cariño whom she introduced as her husband. Again, they sought her assistance in purchasing <i>shabu</i> and showed her an attaché case containing P1.5 million. Espiritu again declined. But as Carla and PO3 Cariño returned four more times with the same request and showing her the money each time, Espiritu finally told them that she would see what she can do. At that time, she was in need of money for the tuition fees of her grandchildren and the medicines of her son. Espiritu thus introduced Carla and PO3 Cariño to appellant, an employee of her husband in the casino.<br><br>Appellant claimed that during her first meeting with Carla and PO3 Cariño, the two asked her to help them look for <i>shabu</i> and showed her money in an attaché case. She initially refused but changed her mind when the couple kept on returning to her place to convince her. Thinking that she would be able to pay her debts and provide for the needs of her children with the money being offered by Carla and PO3 Cariño, she acceded and told them that she would try to look for <i>shabu</i>.<br><br>On May 30, 1999, appellant and Espiritu went to the house of a certain Aida Go (Aida) to get the <i>shabu</i>. Appellant then kept the <i>shabu</i> in her house as instructed by Espiritu. On June 1, 1999, she and Espiritu went to RFC Food Court to meet with Carla and PO3 Cariño. Appellant handed the <i>shabu</i> to Espiritu, who entered the restroom with Carla. However, when they came out, they were already surrounded by policemen and were arrested.<br><br>Seraspe, for her part, claimed that she had no knowledge of the transaction as she just accompanied her daughter, appellant, to the RFC Food Court.<br><br><b><i>Ruling of the Regional Trial Court</i></b><br><br>In its Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> of July 29, 2002, the trial court found that all the accused conspired to deliver and sell <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>&nbsp; And contrary to accused’s claim that they were merely instigated by the authorities to commit the crime charged, it found that their arrest was the result of a valid entrapment operation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> It thus disposed:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered finding accused MELBA L.

The Court granted the motion in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> dated December 1, 2004 and the case was declared closed and terminated with respect to her.

She cannot therefore isolate her act of merely accompanying Espiritu to the RFC Food Court or carrying the <i>shabu</i> since in conspiracy the act of one is the act of all.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>&nbsp; “To be a conspirator, one need not participate in every detail of the execution; he need not even take part in every act or need not even know the exact part to be performed by the others in the execution of the conspiracy.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br><i>Appellant’s defense of instigation is unworthy of belief.</i><br><br>Appellant raises the defense of instigation to gain her acquittal. She argues that the government, through the PAOCTF operatives, induced her to commit the offense when they repeatedly approached and asked her to sell them <i>shabu</i>.<br><br>The Court is unswayed.<br><br>“Instigation means luring the accused into a crime that he, otherwise, had no intention to commit, in order to prosecute him.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>&nbsp; It differs from entrapment which is the employment of ways and means in order to trap or capture a criminal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> In instigation, the criminal intent to commit an offense originates from the inducer and not from the accused who had no intention to commit and would not have committed it were it not for the prodding of the inducer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> In entrapment, the criminal intent or design originates from the accused and the law enforcers merely facilitate the apprehension of the criminal by using ruses and schemes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>Instigation results in the acquittal of the accused, while entrapment may lead to prosecution and conviction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Here, the evidence clearly established that the police operatives employed entrapment, not instigation, to capture appellant and her cohorts in the act of selling <i>shabu</i>. It must be recalled that it was only upon receipt of a report of the drug trafficking activities of Espiritu from the confidential informant that a buy- bust team was formed and negotiations for the sale of <i>shabu</i> were made. Also, appellant testified that she agreed to the transaction of her own free will when she saw the same as an opportunity to earn money. Notably too, appellant was able to quickly produce a sample. This confirms that she had a ready supply of the illegal drugs. Clearly, she was never forced, coerced or induced through incessant entreaties to source the prohibited drug for Carla and PO3 Cariño and this she even categorically admitted during her testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>Moreover, a police officer’s act of soliciting drugs from appellant during the buy-bust operation, or what is known as the “decoy solicitation,” is not prohibited by law and does not invalidate the buy-bust operation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>&nbsp; In <i>People v. Legaspi</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> this Court pronounced that in a prosecution for sale of illicit drugs, any of the following will not exculpate the accused: “(1) that facilities for the commission of the crime were intentionally placed in his way; or (2) that the criminal act was done at the solicitation of the decoy or poseur-buyer seeking to expose his criminal act; or (3) that the police authorities feigning complicity in the act were present and apparently assisted in its commission.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup>&nbsp; Hence, even assuming that the PAOCTF operatives repeatedly asked her to sell them <i>shabu</i>, appellant’s defense of instigation will not prosper. This is “especially true in that class of cases where the offense is the kind that is habitually committed, and the solicitation merely furnished evidence of a course of conduct. Mere deception by the police officer will not shield the perpetrator, if the offense was committed by him free from the influence or instigation of the police officer.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>All told, we find no reason to disturb the findings of the trial court as affirmed by the appellate court, and thus sustain the conviction of appellant for illegal sale of dangerous drugs.<br><br><b><i>The Penalty</i></b><br><br>Under Section 15, Article III, in relation to Section 20, Article IV, of the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972, as amended by R.A. No. 7659, the unauthorized sale of 200 grams or more of <i>shabu</i> or methamphetamine hydrochloride is punishable by <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death and a fine ranging from five hundred thousand pesos to ten million pesos.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>The total weight of the <i>shabu</i> confiscated in this case is 983.5 grams. Hence, the proper penalty should be <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death. But since the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death consists of two indivisible penalties, appellant was correctly meted the lesser penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, conformably with Article 63(2) of the Revised Penal Code which provides that when there are no mitigating or aggravating circumstances in the commission of the deed, the lesser penalty shall be applied. Considering the quantity of <i>shabu</i> sold, we likewise find reasonable the fine of P500,000.00 imposed by the trial court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the assailed Decision dated July 25, 2007 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.-H.C.
