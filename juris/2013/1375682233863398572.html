Finding of guilt based on the testimony of a lone witness is not uncommon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>&nbsp; “For although the number of witnesses may be considered a factor in the appreciation of evidence, preponderance is not necessarily with the greatest number and conviction can still be had on the basis of the credible and positive testimony of a single witness.&nbsp; Corroborative evidence is deemed necessary ‘only when there are reasons to warrant the suspicion that the witness falsified the truth or that his observation had been inaccurate.’”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>&nbsp; This is not obtaining in this case.<br><br>Moreover, appellant also failed to attribute any improper motive to Valenciano to falsely testify against him.&nbsp; There was no evidence to establish that Valenciano harbored any ill-will against appellant or that he had reasons to fabricate his testimony.&nbsp; In the absence of proof to the contrary, the presumption is that the witness was not moved by any ill-will and was untainted by bias, and thus worthy of belief and credence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>&nbsp; Furthermore, appellant’s immediate departure from the scene of the crime and successful effort to elude arrest until his apprehension more than five years later are not consistent with his claim of innocence.&nbsp; Flight from the scene of the crime and failure to immediately surrender militate against appellant’s contention of innocence “since an innocent person will not hesitate to take prompt and necessary action to exonerate himself of the crime imputed to him.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Under these circumstances, the rule that “where the prosecution eyewitness was familiar with both the victim and the accused, and where the <span style="font-style: italic;">locus criminis</span> afforded good visibility, and where no improper motive can be attributed to the witness for testifying against the accused, then [his] version of the story deserves much weight,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> thus applies.&nbsp; We are therefore convinced that appellant’s culpability for the killing of the victim was duly established by the testimony of the lone prosecution witness, Valenciano.<br><br><i>The crime committed by appellant is <br>murder qualified by treachery.&nbsp; </i><br><br>Murder is the unlawful killing by the accused of a person, which is not parricide or infanticide, committed with any of the attendant circumstances enumerated in Article 248<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> of the Revised Penal Code, one of which is treachery.<br><br>The killing committed in this case is neither parricide nor infanticide and the same was attended with treachery.&nbsp; “There is treachery when the offender commits any of the crimes against the person, employing means, methods or forms in the execution thereof which tend directly and specially to insure its execution, without risk to himself arising from the defense which the offended party might make.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>&nbsp; “The essence of treachery is that the attack comes without a warning and in a swift, deliberate, and unexpected manner, affording the hapless, unarmed, and unsuspecting victim no chance to resist or escape.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>In this case, treachery is evident from the fact that the victim could not have been aware of the imminent peril to his life.&nbsp; He was unprepared for the sudden, unexpected and unprovoked attack on his person when appellant stabbed his back with a knife then swiftly run away.&nbsp; Clearly, appellant’s execution of the killing left the victim with no opportunity to defend himself or retaliate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br><b><i>The Proper Penalty</i></b><br><br>Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code provides that the penalty for the crime of murder is <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death.&nbsp; As correctly imposed by the trial court and as affirmed by the CA, appellant must suffer the prison term of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, the lower of the said two indivisible penalties, due to the absence of an aggravating circumstance attending the commission of the crime.<br><br><b><i>The Civil Liability</i></b><br><br>Appellant must indemnify the heirs of the victim since death resulted from the crime.&nbsp;&nbsp; The heirs of the victim are entitled to an award of civil indemnity in the amount of P75,000.00, which is mandatory and is granted without need of evidence other than the commission of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>&nbsp; Hence, we increase the award for civil indemnity made by the trial court and affirmed by the CA from P50,000.00 to P75,000.00.&nbsp; Also, while the CA correctly ordered appellant to pay the heirs of the victim exemplary damages, the amount awarded must be increased from P25,000.00 to P30,000.00 in line with current jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Aside from these, moral damages in the sum of P50,000.00 must likewise be awarded “despite the absence of proof of mental and emotional suffering of the victim’s heirs.&nbsp; As borne out by human nature and experience, a violent death invariably and necessarily brings about emotional pain and anguish on the part of the victim’s family.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>&nbsp; Moreover, while actual damages cannot be awarded since there was no evidence of actual expenses incurred for the death of the victim, in lieu thereof, the sum of P25,000.00 may be granted, as it is hereby granted, by way of temperate damages “as it cannot be denied that the heirs of the [victim] suffered pecuniary loss although the exact amount was not proved.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>&nbsp; “This award is adjudicated so that a right which has been violated may be recognized or vindicated, and not for the purpose of indemnification.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>&nbsp; An interest at the legal rate of 6% percent from the finality of this judgment until fully paid should also be awarded to the heirs of the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appeal is <b>DISMISSED</b>.&nbsp; The assailed June 7, 2007 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
