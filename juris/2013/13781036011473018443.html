No. 6713 (The Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees) under Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated June 28, 2005 of the Sandiganbayan in Crim. Case Nos. 25465-66.<br><br><center><b><u>The Facts</u></b></center><br>Petitioner Dr. Roger R. Posadas (Dr. Posadas), a Ph.D. in Relativity Physics graduate from the University of Pittsburgh, is a longtime professor and former Dean of the College of Science at the University of the Philippines-Diliman Campus (UP Diliman).&nbsp; He was appointed by the Board of Regents (BOR) of the University of the Philippines System as UP Diliman Chancellor for a three-year term starting November 1, 1993 and ending October 31, 1996.<br><br>During his term as Chancellor, Dr. Posadas is one of the leading figures in the emerging inter-disciplinary field of technology management in the Philippines.Upon the recommendation of the UP Diliman Task Force on Science and Technology Assessment, Management and Planning composed of deans and professors from the various colleges in UP Diliman, the BOR on February 23, 1995 approved the establishment of the Technology Management Center (TMC)&nbsp; under the direct supervision of the Office of the Chancellor, UP Diliman.When the TMC became operational in June 1995, the Task Force on Science and Technology Assessment, Management and Planning wrote then UP President Dr. Emil Q. Javier, nominating Dr. Posadas for the position of TMC Director. For undisclosed reason, Dr. Posadas declined the nomination and instead he (Dr. Posadas) designated Prof. Jose Tabbada of the College of Public Administration as Acting Director of TMC.<br><br>On July 26, 1995, Dr. Posadas submitted to the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) an Application for Funding of his proposed project entitled “Institutionalization of Technology Management at the University of the Philippines in Diliman” (TMC Project).&nbsp;&nbsp; The TMC Project, to be funded by a grant from the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), aimed to design and develop ten new graduate courses in technology management for the diploma, master’s and doctoral programs to be offered by TMC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>On September 18, 1995, a Memorandum of Agreement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> (MOA) was executed between Dr. Posadas, on behalf of UP-Diliman, and the Philippine Institute for Development Studies (PIDS) as the Local Executing Agency of the Policy, Training and Technical Assistance Facility (PTTAF) of CIDA.&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the MOA, CIDA shall provide the funding for the total project cost (P5,442,400.00), with the NEDA as the designated PTTAF Project Implement or for the Government of the Philippines, while UPDiliman shall direct, manage and implement all activities under the approved project with counterpart funding in the amount of P4,228,524.00.<br><br>In a letter dated July 30, 1995, the President of Hua Qiao University in Fujian Province, China invited Dr. Posadas and a delegation from UP Diliman to visit on October 30 to November 6, 1995.&nbsp; On October 5, 1995, then Senior Deputy Executive Secretary Leonardo A. Quisumbing (retired Member of this Court) issued the Authority to Travel for the UP Diliman delegation headed by Dr. Posadas.&nbsp; Among those who joined the delegation were Dr. Amaryllis Torres and Dr. Rosario Yu, UPDiliman’s Vice-Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Vice-Chancellor for Student Affairs, respectively.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>Under Administrative Order (AO) No. 95-170 dated October 24, 1995, Dr. Posadas designated petitioner Dr. Rolando P. Dayco (Dr. Dayco), Vice-Chancellor for Administrative Affairs, as Officer-In-Charge (OIC) of UP Diliman effective October 30, 1995 until November 6, 1995.&nbsp; This was followed by AO No. 95-170-A dated October 27, 1995, which amended the previous order by extending the OIC designation of Dr. Dayco to November 7, 1995.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>On November 7, 1995, Dr. Dayco appointed Dr. Posadas as Project Director of UP TMC effective September 18, 1995 up to September 17, 1996.In another undated “Contract for Consultancy Services” signed by Dr. Dayco, Dr. Posadas was hired as Consultant for the TMC Project for the same period.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>As evidenced by disbursement vouchers and admitted by Dr. Posadas, the latter received his “honoraria” (P30,000.00 per month) and consultancy fees (totaling P100,000.00) as Project Director and Consultant of the TMC Project until May 1996 when the Commission on Audit (COA) raised questions on the legality of the said fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>In August 1996, payment of the subject “honoraria” and fees was suspended by COA Resident Auditor Romeo J. Pulido who noted the following deficiencies:<br><br><blockquote><ol><li>Honoraria were in excess of the rates provided for under the National Compensation Circular No. 73, dated March 1, 1996, x x x.<br><br></li><li>Legal basis for designating the incumbent Chancellor as Project Director by the Officer-In-Charge (OIC), considering that the latter can assume the post only in the absence of the former.&nbsp; An OIC cannot validly designate since the authority to designate/appoint is among the functions of the Chancellor which cannot be delegated as provided in the University Charter.&nbsp; Moreover, the authority to appoint can never be delegated since it involves discretion.<br><br></li><li>On the assumption that the designation of the Chancellor as Project Director and Consultant is valid, collecting the remuneration for both positions amount to double compensation which is contrary to existing auditing rules and regulations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></li></ol></blockquote><br>In a Memorandum<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> dated September 16, 1996, UP’s Chief Legal Officer Marichu C. Lambino addressed the foregoing concerns of COA Auditor Pulido.Atty. Lambino stated that (a) the compensation received by Dr. Posadas are in the nature of consultancy fees and hence expressly exempted by Department of Budget and Management (DBM)National Compensation Circular (NCC) No. 75 dated March 11, 1995; (b)&nbsp; the TMC Project, being a training program, is likewise exempted from the coverage of NEDA Guidelines on the Procurement of Consulting Services for Government Projects; and (c) under Civil Service Commission (CSC) Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 43, series of 1993 “Streamlining and Deregulating Human Resource Development Functions” UP is authorized, without prior approval from the CSC, to determine the rates of honorarium for government personnel participating as resource persons, coordinator, and facilitator, in training programs.&nbsp; On the issue of double compensation, Atty. Lambino pointed out that Dr. Posadas was appointed Project Director because of managerial expertise, and his skills in supervising personnel who are involved in an academic undertaking, and as Consultant because of his expertise in technology management. Finding these explanations/justifications acceptable, Auditor Pulido lifted the notices of suspension in September 1997.<br><br>However, even before the issuance of the suspension notices, then UP President Dr. Emil Q. Javier, ordered an investigation on the basis of an administrative complaint filed by Mrs. Ofelia L. Del Mundo, a staff of the University Library who was detailed at the TMC as its Administrative Officer. On July 24, 1996, President Javier created a Fact-Finding Committee to gather, review and evaluate pertinent documents regarding certain transactions of the TMC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>&nbsp; After the conduct of a preliminary investigation and finding a <i>prima facie</i> case against the petitioners, President Javier issued the formal charges<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> for Grave Misconduct and Abuse of Authority.&nbsp; Pursuant to the University’s “Rules and Regulations on the Discipline of Faculty Members and Employees approved at the 704<sup>th</sup> Meeting of the Board of Regents on January 11, 1963,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> an Administrative Disciplinary Tribunal (ADT) was constituted, chaired by Atty. Arturo E. Balbastro, a faculty member of the UP College of Law.<br><br>On August 21, 1998, the ADT submitted its Report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> (ADT Case 96-001) to President Javier.&nbsp; The ADT found petitioners guilty of serious or grave misconduct and recommended the penalty of dismissal in accordance with CSC Memorandum Circular No. 30, series of 1989, as well as Article 250 of the University Code.&nbsp; The Report likewise stated that the acts of petitioners for which they were held administratively liable may warrant prosecution under Section 3(h) and (i) of R.A. No. 3019.&nbsp; Under the Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> dated August 25, 1998 signed by President Javier, petitioners were dismissed from the service.<br><br>On September 3, 1998, Atty. Carmelita Yadao-Guno in her capacity as General Counsel of UP formally endorsed the findings and recommendations of the ADT to the Ombudsman.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>&nbsp; The case was docketed as OMB-0-98-1843.<br><br>Meanwhile, the BOR at its 1126<sup>th</sup> meeting on November 26, 1998, resolved petitioners’ appeal in ADT Case 96-001, as follows:<br><br><blockquote><ol><li>The Board affirmed the ADT decision finding the respondents guilty of grave misconduct and imposed on them the penalty of forced resignation with the accessory penalties defined in the Omnibus Rules Implementing Book V of Executive Order 292 and other Pertinent Civil Service Laws – i.e., cancellation of eligibility, forfeiture of all leave credits and retirement benefits, and disqualification from government service for one year.<br><br></li><li>If after one year they should reapply to the University, they must render an apology to the University and their reappointments will be subject to Board approval.<br><br></li><li>The respondents are permanently disqualified from holding any administrative position in the University.<br><br></li><li> The decision takes effect immediately.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></li></ol></blockquote><br>Satisfied with the BOR’s action, petitioners caused the withdrawal of their appeal before the CSC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>On June 9, 1999, the Evaluation and Preliminary Investigation Bureau of the Office of Ombudsman recommended the dismissal of the charges against petitioners for insufficiency of evidence. However, said recommendation was disapproved by then Ombudsman Aniano A. Desierto who ordered that petitioners be indicted for violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 and Section 7(b) in relation to Section 11 of R.A. No. 6713.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>The corresponding Informations<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>were thus filed against the petitioners before the Sandiganbayan (Criminal Case Nos. 25465-66), as follow:<br><br><blockquote><i><u>Criminal Case No. 25465</u></i><br><br>That on or about 7 November 1995, or sometime prior or subsequent thereto, in Quezon City, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, both high-ranking public officers, ROGER DELA ROSA POSADAS, being then the Chancellor and a faculty member of the University of the Philippines-Diliman Campus, and ROLANDO PASCUAL DAYCO, being then the Vice-Chancellor of the said university and Officer-In-Charge of the Office of the Chancellor, committing the crime herein charged in relation to, while in the performance and taking advantage of their official and administrative functions,and conspiring and confederating with and mutually helping each other, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and criminally give unwarranted benefits, privilege or advantage to accused POSADAS, when accused DAYCO appointed or designated accused POSADAS as a Project Director of the lone project, Institutionalization of the Management of Technology at U.P. Diliman, of the Technology Management Center (TMC) of the Office of the Chancellor, U.P. Diliman, which enabled or caused the disbursement and payment of monthly salary of P30,000.00 of accused POSADAS, duly received by the latter, for the period 18 September 1995 to 17 September 1996, with accused POSADAS also receiving his salaries as Chancellor and faculty member of U.P. Diliman during this period, and both accused knowing fully well that the appointment of accused POSADAS was beyond the power or authority of accused DAYCO as an OIC and likewise violative of the law, rules and regulations against multiple positions, double compensation and retroactivity of appointment, thereby causing undue injury to the Government in the amount of&nbsp; <i>PESOS: THREE HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND (P360,000.00),</i> to the damage and prejudice of the Government.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<br><br><i><u>Criminal Case No. 25466</u></i><br><br>That on or about 7 November 1995, or sometime prior or subsequent thereto, in Quezon City, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, both high-ranking public officers, ROGER DELA ROSA POSADAS, being then the Chancellor and a faculty member of the University of the Philippines-Diliman Campus, and ROLANDO PASCUAL DAYCO, being then the Vice-Chancellor of the said university and Officer-In-Charge of the Office of the Chancellor, committing the crime herein charged in relation to, while in the performance and taking advantage of their official and administrative functions, and conspiring and confederating with and mutually helping each other, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and criminally engage in the unauthorized private practice of accused POSADAS’s profession as a technology manager, when accused DAYCO appointed or designated accused POSADAS as a consultant to the project, Institutionalization of the Management of Technology at U.P. Diliman, of the Technology Management Center (TMC) of the Office of the Chancellor, U.P. Diliman, which enabled or caused the disbursement and payment of consultancy fees in the amount of P100,000.00 to accused POSADAS, duly received by the latter, with respondent POSADAS also receiving his salaries as Chancellor and faculty member of U.P. Diliman, and both accused knowing fully well that the appointment to and acceptance of the position of consultant by respondent POSADAS was without authority from the latter’s superior(s) or the U.P. Board of Regents, to the damage and prejudice of the Government service.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.</blockquote><br>Dr. Dayco and Dr. Posadas were duly arraigned on June 15, 2000 and May 28, 2001, respectively, both pleading not guilty to the charges against them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br><center><b><u>Ruling of the Sandiganbayan</u></b></center><br>After due proceedings, the Sandiganbayan rendered its Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> dated June 28, 2005, the decretal portion of which reads:<br><br><blockquote><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, this Court finds both accused Roger R. Posadas and Rolando P. Dayco <b>GUILTY</b> beyond reasonable doubt of violating Section 3(e) of RA 3019 and Section 7(b) of RA 6713 and are sentenced to suffer the following penalties:<br><br>For violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019: accused Posadas and Dayco are sentenced to suffer in prison the indeterminate penalty of nine (9) years and one day as minimum and twelve (12) years as maximum, with the accessory penalty of perpetual disqualification from public office.&nbsp; Both accused are directed to jointly and severally indemnify the Government of the Republic of the Philippines the amount of THREE HUNDRED THIRTY SIX THOUSAND PESOS (P336,000.00).<br><br>For violation of Section 7(b) of RA 6713: accused Posadas and Dayco are sentenced to suffer in prison the maximum penalty of five (5) years and disqualification to hold public office.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></blockquote><br>The Sandiganbayan held that the evidence supports a finding of&nbsp;&nbsp; evident bad faith on the part of petitioners who, knowing very well the limitations of Dr. Dayco’s power as OIC, effected the appointment of Dr. Posadas as TMC Project Director and Consultant.&nbsp; These limitations are based on the nature of the power to appoint which is merely delegated to the Chancellor by the BOR, Section 204 of the Government Accounting and Auditing Manual, and CSC MC No. 38, s. 1993 on non-retroactivity of appointments.<br><br>The Sandiganbayan concluded that petitioners’ acts caused undue injury to the Government with the receipt by Dr. Posadas of salaries and consultancy fees.&nbsp; Petitioners’ contention that the Government did not suffer loss or damage since the funding for the TMC Project came from CIDA was rejected by the Sandiganbayan which stated that from the moment UP received the CIDA funds intended for the TMC Project, said funds became “impressed with public attributes or character,” as in fact it was subjected to the control of UP and audited by the COA.<br><br>The Sandiganbayan likewise found no merit in petitioners’ claim that they were just victims of “university politics”as they were staunch critics of President Javier. Petitioners adduced documentary and testimonial evidence to show that Ms. Del Mundo’s filing of a complaint against petitioners was triggered by the fact that it was Dr. Posadas who ordered an administrative investigation against her and recalled her to the University Library, which incident led to the resignation of Prof. Tabbada from TMC.&nbsp; However, the Sandiganbayan stressed that regardless of the reason for the filing of the cases against petitioners at the university level, these cases would not have come into being if no law has been violated in the first place.<br><br>Petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration but it was denied due course for the reason that it has not been set for hearing as required by the rules, hence the motion <i>ispro forma</i>.<br><br>In this petition for certiorari, petitioners allege grave abuse of discretion and blatant violation of their constitutionally guaranteed right to due process.<br><br><center><b><u>The Issues</u></b></center><br>The Court is asked to resolve whether the Sandiganbayan committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of or in excess of jurisdiction: (1) in denying petitioners’ motion for reconsideration on the ground that it was not set for hearing; and (2) in convicting petitioners of Violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 and Section 7(b) of R.A. No. 6713 on the basis of facts not supported by evidence and on inapplicable rules and principles.<br><br><center><b><u>Petitioners’ Arguments</u></b></center><br>Petitioners argue that the July 19, 2005 Resolution denying their motion for reconsideration is not only baseless, but capricious, arbitrary and most unjust because the <u>Revised Internal Rules of the </u><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sandiganbayan</span> does not require that the motion for reconsideration be set for hearing.&nbsp; They cite the case of <i>Alvarez v. Sandiganbayan</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> where this Court ruled that motions for reconsideration of decisions or final orders of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Sandiganbayan</span> are not governed by Rule 15 of the Rules of Court, as these may be filed within 15 days from promulgation or notice of the judgment or final order “upon the grounds, in the form and subject to the requirements, for motions for new trial in criminal cases under Rule 121 of the <u>Rules of Court</u>.”<br><br>On the charges of graft, petitioners assert that they did not act with bad faith, manifest partiality or gross inexcusable negligence. They reiterate that Dr. Dayco’s designation as OIC Chancellor was adjusted for one day merely to accommodate the change in the official travel schedule of Dr. Posadas to China.&nbsp; The appointment of Dr. Posadas as TMC Project Director and Consultant was a valid appointment and was made retroactive for no other reason than to synchronize the activities relative to the TMC Project with the project schedule as approved by the funding agency.&nbsp; The power of appointment was within the power of the Chancellor to delegate to the OIC Chancellor, it not being expressly prohibited by the University rules.&nbsp; Such practice, in fact, is not an unusual occurrence in UP.<br><br>Petitioners also contend that no injury was caused to the government because the TMC Project budget came from foreign funds, hence not an expense incurred by the Government and neither did UP incur any expense in relation to the said project, its counterpart funding was not in the form of money.Consequently, there can be no conviction under the law in the absence of real or actual damage suffered.<br><br>On the “honoraria” and fees received by Dr. Posadas as Project Director and Consultant, petitioners insist they cannot be held liable for double compensation because these were given for separate services rendered by Dr. Posadas.&nbsp; As opined by the UP Chief Legal Officer, the compensation were in the nature of consultancy fees being received by UP personnel in their capacity as private persons for services to a project outside of their official time, hence it is not covered by the DBM NCC No. 75.&nbsp; Moreover, petitioners stress that Dr. Posadas did not receive any unwarranted benefit, advantage or preference in his appointment as TMC Project Director and Consultant.&nbsp; Dr. Posadas possesses the superior qualifications and expertise in the field of technology management necessary to ensure that the project was a success.&nbsp; In fact, his colleagues were expecting him to head the TMC Project and did not oppose his appointment.<br><br>As to the charge of unauthorized outside employment, petitioners point out that the University rules do not require clearance from the UP President to engage in consultancy work and the same rules do not prohibit him from performing consultancy work for a project such as TMC.&nbsp; Therefore, Dr. Posadas’ appointment as TMC Project Director and Consultant were not prohibited outside employment.<br><br>Petitioners reiterate their“university politics” defense, claiming that President Javier at the time chose to champion Del Mundo’s complaint motivated by vengeance and spite against two of his staunch critics.&nbsp; Thus, despite knowledge of the opinion of the UP Chief Legal Officer clearing petitioners of any wrongdoing, President Javier underhandedly caused the filing of administrative charges in the ADT.<br><br>Petitioners further submit that the complainant before the Ombudsman, Atty. Carmelita Yadao, was incompetent as she had no personal knowledge of the contents thereof, which were merely narrated or reported to her in her capacity as General Counsel of UP at that time.&nbsp; The letter-complaint should not have been given due course as it was based on pure hearsay and its main proponent suffered from conflicting interests because she had earlier endorsed the MOA which included the compensation package for TMC Project Director and Consultant.<br><br>Finally, petitioners deny having acted in conspiracy as there was no evidence to prove it. The only assumed fact considered by the Sandiganbayan is based on its erroneous hypothesis – the alleged act of “extending” the period of OIC Chancellor for one day to accommodate Dr. Posadas. Dr. Dayco did not even gain anything from his designation of Dr. Posadas.&nbsp; Thus, in the absence of clear and convincing proof, petitioners cannot be held liable as conspirators.<br><br><center><b><u>Our Ruling</u></b></center><br><br>The petition has no merit.<br><br><b><i>Notice of Hearingin Motions for<br>Reconsideration Is Mandatory</i></b><br><br>Contrary to petitioners’ stance, the <u>2002 Revised Internal Rules of the Sandiganbayan</u> requires a motion for reconsideration to be set for hearing, as it provides under Rule VII:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 1. <i>Motion Day.</i> -&nbsp; Except for motions which may be acted upon <span style="font-style: italic;">ex parte,</span> all motions <b>shall be scheduled for hearings</b> on a Friday, or if that day is a non-working holiday, on the next working day.<br><br>Motions requiring immediate action may be acted upon on shorter notice.<br><br>In appealed cases, the provisions of Sec. 3, Rule 49 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, as amended, on Motions shall apply.&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>Under the Rules of Sandiganbayan, effective January 10, 1979, a petition for reconsideration of a judgment or final order may be filed upon the grounds, in the form and subject to the requirements, for motions for new trial in criminal cases under Rule 121 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>&nbsp; In the case of <i>Alvarezv. Sandiganbayan</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> decided in 1991, the Court upheld the Sandiganbayan in not considering “the failure of the movant to fix the place, date and time of the hearing of his motion a substantial defect, for instead of giving the motion a short shrift, it set the incident for hearing, and even granted the prosecution ten days from [notice] within which to oppose/comment.” The Court noted what was then the practice of the Sandigabayan itself, rather than the movant, to determine the date and time of hearings of motions.&nbsp; The peculiar circumstances of said case heavilyweighed in favor of relaxation of the rules, with the Court’s finding that the evidence presented against the petitioner does not fulfill the test of moral certainty and may not be deemed sufficient to support a conviction.&nbsp; Hence, the Court was not prepared “to declare that [petitioner’s] omission to set his motion for hearing is so grievous an error as to foreclose the award to him of the relief to which he is otherwise entitled.”<br><br>In any event, the mandatory setting for hearing a motion for reconsideration to reverse or modify a judgment or final order of the Sandiganbayan is already settled.&nbsp; This Court categorically ruled in the recent case of <i>Flores v. People</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br><blockquote>Flores filed a motion for the reconsideration. As the motion did not contain any notice of hearing, the Prosecution filed its Motion to Expunge from the Records Accused’s Motion for Reconsideration.”<br><br>In its Resolution, dated November 29, 2007, the Sandiganbayan denied the motion for being a mere scrap of paper as it did not contain a notice of hearing and disposed as follows:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of the foregoing, the <i>Motion for Reconsideration</i> of accused Flores is considered pro forma which did not toll the running of the period to appeal, and thus, the assailed judgment of this Court has become <b>FINAL</b> and <b>EXECUTORY.</b><br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>x x x x</blockquote>Flores claims that the outright denial of his motion for reconsideration by the Sandiganbayan on a mere technicality amounts to a violation of his right to due process. The dismissal rendered final and executory the assailed decision which was replete with baseless conjectures and conclusions that were contrary to the evidence on record. He points out that a relaxation of procedural rules is justified by the merits of this case as the facts, viewed from the proper and objective perspective, indubitably demonstrate self-defense on his part.<br><br>Flores argues that he fully complied with the requirements of Section2 of Rule 37 and Section 4 of Rule 121 of the Rules of Court when the motion itself was served upon the prosecution and the latter, in fact,admitted receiving a copy. For Flores, such judicial admission amounts to giving due notice of the motion which is the intent behind the said rules. He further argues that a hearing on a motion for reconsideration is not necessary as no further proceeding, such as a hearing, is required under Section 3 of Rule 121.<br><br>Flores’ argument fails to persuade this Court.<br><br>Section 5, Rule 15 of the Rules of Court reads:<br><blockquote>SECTION 5. <i>Notice of hearing</i>. – The notice of hearing shall be addressed to all parties concerned, and shall specify the time and date of the hearing which must not be later than ten (10) days after the filing of the motion.<br></blockquote>Section 2, Rule 37 provides:<br><blockquote>SEC. 2. <i>Contents of motion for new trial or reconsideration and notice thereof.</i> – The motion shall be made in writing stating the ground or grounds therefore, a written notice of which shall be served by the movant on the adverse party.<br><br>x x x x<br></blockquote>A <i>pro forma</i> motion for new trial or reconsideration shall not toll the reglementary period of appeal.<br><br>Section 4, Rule 121 states:<br><blockquote>SEC. 4. <i>Form of motion and notice to the prosecutor</i>. – The motion for a new trial or reconsideration shall be in writing and shall state the grounds on which it is based. x x x. Notice of the motion for new trial or reconsideration shall be given to the prosecutor.</blockquote>As correctly stated by the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP), <b>Sec.2 of Rule 37 and Sec. 4 of Rule 121 should be read in conjunction with Sec.5 of Rule 15 of the Rules of Court</b>. Basic is the rule that every motion must be set for hearing by the movant except for those motions which the court may act upon without prejudice to the rights of the adverse party. <b>The notice of hearing must be addressed to all parties and must specify the time and date of the hearing, with proof of service.</b><br><br>This Court has indeed held, time and again, that <b>under Sections 4 and5 of Rule 15 of the Rules of Court, the requirement is mandatory. Failure to comply with the requirement renders the motion defective. “As a rule, a motion without a notice of hearing is considered <i>pro forma</i> and does not affect the reglementary period for the appeal or the filing of the requisite pleading.”</b><br><br>In this case, as Flores committed a procedural lapse in failing to include a notice of hearing, his motion was a worthless piece of paper with no legal effect whatsoever.

Apparently, Dr. Posadas’ appointment by Dr. Dayco in an OIC capacity was pre-conceived. Prof. Jose Tabbada testified that when he was summoned by Dr. Posadas to his office, the latter asked him how he (Posadas) could be appointed TMC Project Director.&nbsp; He then suggested that Dr. Dayco as OIC Chancellor can appoint him to the position and even drafted the memo for this purpose.&nbsp; He admitted that he gave such advice with some reservations but it turned out to have been pursued by petitioners.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>However, the Sandiganbayan ruled that the delegated authority of the OIC Chancellor has limitations and did not include the power to appoint.<br><br>Section 204 of the Government Accounting and Auditing Manual (Volume I on Government Auditing Rules and Regulations) provides:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 204. <i>Appointment issued by an officer-in-charge.</i> --&nbsp; A person designated in an acting capacity&nbsp; may be differentiated from one who is designated merely as an Officer-in-Charge (OIC).&nbsp; In the latter case, the OIC enjoys limited powers which, are confined to functions of administration and ensuring that the office continues its usual activities.&nbsp; The OIC may not be deemed to possess the power to appoint employees as the same involves the exercise of discretion which is beyond the power of an OIC (CSC Res. 1692, Oct. 20, 1978).<br></blockquote><br>To prove the alleged practice in the University of an OIC appointing a Chancellor to a certain position, petitioners presented copies of temporary appointment papers issued by OIC Chancellor Paz G.

Both Gregorio and Roman signed the Notification of Approval of Temporary Appointment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>Petitioners nonetheless argue that the appointments made by Dr. Dayco were valid on the basis of Section 9(a) of the Resolution of the BOR reorganizing UP into the UP System adopted at its 828th meeting on December 21, 1972, as amended at its 863<sup>rd</sup> meeting on July 31, 1975.&nbsp; Under said resolution, the BOR authorized the Chancellor of an autonomous university of the UP System to delegate his functions and responsibilities which have been assigned or delegated to him by the BOR, unless instructed otherwise by the BOR.&nbsp; It also enumerated those functions that may not be delegated, among which is:<br><br><blockquote>B. <u>Functions That May Not Be Delegated</u><br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">x x x x<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Authority to approve the following appointments –<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(1) those covered in II, C, 1, and e of the President’s Memorandum Circular No. 30 dated August 28, 1975; and<br><br>(2) those covered in II, C, 4, a through c of the aforecited memorandum circular of the President;<br><br>x x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></div></div></blockquote><br>MC No. 30 dated August 28, 1975 issued by former UP President Onofre D.

The Chancellor, on the other hand, is the executive officer and the head of the faculty of the Constituent University, who likewise performs other functions that the BOR or the President may delegate to her/him.&nbsp; This is clearly indicated in the organizational structure of the UP Diliman, sourced from the <i>Faculty Manual of the University of the Philippines Diliman</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>:<br><br>* (see flowchart Decision G.R.

Indeed, the Chancellor cannot exercise the delegated authority to appoint in the situations covered by II, C, 5 when he himself is the appointee.&nbsp; The designated OIC likewise had no authority to make the appointment.<br><br>As to the prohibition on government officials and employees, whether elected or appointed, from holding any other office or position in the government, this is contained in Section 7, Article IX-B of the 1987 Constitution, which provides:<br><br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br>Unless otherwise allowed by law or by the primary functions of his position, no appointive official shall hold any other <b>office or employment </b>in the Government, or any subdivision, agency or instrumentality thereof, including government-owned or controlled corporations or their subsidiaries.&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>The prohibition on dual employment and double compensation in the government service is further specified under Sections 1 and 2, Rule XVIII of the Omnibus Rules Implementing Book V of E.O.

As with our conclusion on the issue of authority to appoint the TMC Project Director, considering that it is the Chancellor himself who was engaged as TMC Project Consultant, the contract for consultancy services of Dr. Posadas should have been authorized by the University President as the chief executive officer of the UP System.&nbsp; To hold otherwise is to leave the matter of determining the criteria or conditions for allowing the private practice of profession provided in the University rules entirely to Dr. Posadas himself as then UP Diliman Chancellor. Consistent with the Civil Service rules that prior authorization by the <i>head of the agency or institution</i> must be sought by the government officer or employee who desires to accept a consultancy job, it is no less than the University President who should have given permission to Dr. Posadas, the latter being directly under his administrative supervision.<br><br>Upon the established facts and applicable law and jurisprudence, we hold that no grave abuse of discretion was committed by the Sandiganbayan in convicting petitioners for violation of Section 7(b) of R.A. No. 6713.<br><br><b><i>Conspiracy</i></b><br><br>A conspiracy is proved by evidence of actual cooperation; of acts indicative of an agreement, a common purpose or design, a concerted action or concurrence of sentiments to commit the felony and actually pursue it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup>For the accused to be held as conspirators, it is not necessary to show that two or more persons met together and entered into an explicit agreement setting out the details of an unlawful scheme or the details by which an illegal objective is to be carried out.” Therefore, if it is proved that two or more persons aimed by their acts towards the accomplishment of the same unlawful object, each doing a part so that their acts, though apparently independent, were in fact connected and cooperative, indicating a closeness of personal association and a concurrence of sentiment, then a conspiracy may be inferred though no actual meeting among them to concert means is proved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>The Sandiganbayan’s finding of conspiracy rests on firm factual support.&nbsp; Although Dr. Dayco tried to downplay his participation, stating that he did not benefit from the subject appointments and that there were many other appointment papers he had signed in the absence of Dr. Posadas, it is clear as daylight that he had a principal and indispensable role in effecting the said appointments. To stress the point, the Sandiganbayan quoted the relevant portions of the Report submitted by the ADT, as follows:<br><br><blockquote>It would be the height of naiveté to assume that before making the two (2) appointments of respondent Posadas as Director of the TMC Project and as Consultant to the TMC, respondent Dayco did not, in any manner, confer with respondent Posadas about the matter.&nbsp; To believe the claim of respondent Posadas that he just saw his appointment papers at his desk when he came back from his trip is to tax human credulity too much.<br><br>Under the said circumstances, the natural course of events necessarily points to connivance between respondent Posadas and respondent Dayco in the making of the questioned appointments.<br><br>Despite the claim of respondent Posadas that he just saw the appointment papers on his desk when he returned from his trip, the admitted fact is that respondent Dayco made those appointments for respondent Posadas and the latter acted upon the same favourably as he (respondent Posadas) collected the compensation therein (Exhibits :E” and “E-1”). In fact, as Chancellor, respondent Posadas approved his own Disbursement Voucher for payment from the coffers of the University, covering his honoraria and consultancy fees as Project Director for the TMC Project and as consultant to the TMC, respectively (Exhibit “E-2”).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup></blockquote><br><b><i>Penalty</i></b><br><br>Any person guilty of violating Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 is punishable with imprisonment for not less than six (6) years and one (1) month nor more than fifteen (15) years and perpetual disqualification from public office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, the penalty imposed by the Sandiganbayan which is an indeterminate penalty of nine (9) years and one day as minimum and twelve (12) years as maximum, with the accessory penalty of perpetual disqualification from public office, is in accord with law. Petitioners shall also indemnify the Government of the Republic of the Philippines the amount of THREE HUNDRED THIRTY SIX THOUSAND PESOS (P336,000.00) representing the compensation/salaries paid to Dr. Posadas as TMC Project Director.<br><br>As to the offense defined in Section 7(b) of R.A. No. 6713, Section 11 of said law provides that violations of Section 7 shall be punishable with imprisonment not exceeding five (5) years, or a fine not exceeding five thousand&nbsp; pesos (P5,000), or both, and, in the discretion of the court, disqualification to hold public office. The Sandiganbayan imposed the maximum penalty of five (5) years imprisonment and disqualification to hold public office.<br><br>The Court is aware of the sentiments of the succeeding BOR who agonized while deliberating whether to readmit petitioners into the faculty of UP Diliman, with majority of the Regents lamenting the loss of two of its distinguished intellectuals and scientists who had served the University for so long despite the meager compensation UP has to offer compared to private educational institutions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup>&nbsp; The BOR eventually allowed them to teach part-time in the TMC even waiving the conditions the previous BOR had imposed -- a move perceived to be a first step in the healing process for the academic community that was “torn into pieces” by the issue.<br><br>However, this Court’s mandate is to uphold the Constitution and the laws.Our Constitution stresses that a public office is a public trust and public officers must at all times be <i>accountable </i>to the people, serve them with utmost responsibility, integrity, loyalty, and efficiency, act with patriotism and justice, and lead modest lives.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> These constitutionally-enshrined principles, oft-repeated in our case law, are not mere rhetorical flourishes or idealistic sentiments.

Posadas served as Chancellor of the University of the Philippines (UP) Diliman from November 1, 1993 to October 31, 1996.&nbsp; This made him chief operating officer or overall administrator of UP Diliman.<br><br>On September 19, 1994 Dr. Posadas, as Chancellor, formed a <i>Task Force on Science and Technology Assessment, Management and Policy</i> (Task Force) “to prepare curricular proposals for the institution of masteral and doctoral programs in ‘technology management, innovation studies, science and technology and related areas.’”&nbsp; On June 6, 1995 the university established, upon the Task Force’s recommendation, the <i>UP Technology Management Center</i> (UP TMC).&nbsp; The Task Force members nominated Dr. Posadas for the position of Center Director but he declined it, resulting in the designation of Professor Jose B. Tabbada as Acting UP TMC Director.<br><br>Shortly after, Dr. Posadas asked the <i>Philippine Institute of Development Studies/Policy, Training and Technical Assistance Facility</i> (PIDS/PTTAF) to fund the UP TMC’s 10 new graduate courses.&nbsp; This resulted in the execution on September 18, 1995 of a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between UP PIDS/PTTAF and the National Economic Development Authority.&nbsp; The MOA established a project they named <i>Institutionalization of Management and Technology in the University of the Philippines in Diliman</i> (the TMC Project).&nbsp; The Canadian International Development Agency agreed to fund the same.<br><br>Two weeks later or on October 5, 1995 Malacañang granted Chancellor Posadas and 15 other UP Diliman officials authority to travel to Fujian, China, from October 30 to November 6, 1995 to attend a state university’s foundation day.&nbsp; Anticipating his departure, on October 27, 1995 Chancellor Posadas issued Administrative Order 95-170-A, designating petitioner Dr. Rolando P. Dayco, then UP Diliman Vice-Chancellor for Administration, as Officer-in-Charge (OIC) in Dr. Posadas’ absence.<br><br>On November 7, 1995, his last day as OIC Chancellor, Dr. Dayco designated Dr. Posadas as “Project Director of the PIDS/PTTAF-UP Diliman on the TMC Project effective September 18, 1995 until September 17, 1996.”&nbsp; In an undated letter, Dr. Dayco also appointed Dr. Posadas Consultant to the TMC Project.&nbsp; The designation and appointment were to retroact to September 18, 1995 when the project began.<br><br>On August 22, 1996 the Commission on Audit (COA) Resident Auditor issued a Notice of Suspension covering payments made to the personnel of UP TMC, including the second payment to Dr. Posadas of P36,000 for his services as TMC Project’s Local Consultant.&nbsp; On August 23 the Resident Auditor issued another Notice of Suspension covering the payment to Dr. Posadas of a P30,000 honorarium per month as Project Director from September 18 to October 17, 1995.<br><br>On September 16, 1996 the UP Diliman Legal Office issued a Memorandum to the COA Resident Auditor, explaining to him that the amounts due to the personnel of the TMC Project “were legal, being in the nature of consultancy fees.”&nbsp; The legal office also “confirmed the authority of Dr. Dayco, while he was OIC Chancellor, to appoint Dr. Posadas as Project Director and Consultant of the TMC Project.”&nbsp; Finding this explanation “acceptable,” the COA Resident Auditor lifted his previous notices of suspension.<br><br>Notwithstanding the lifting of the suspension, UP President Emil Javier constituted an <i>Administrative Disciplinary Tribunal </i>(ADT) to hear and decide the administrative complaint that he himself filed against Dr. Posadas and Dr. Dayco for grave misconduct and abuse of authority.&nbsp; On August 18, 1998, after hearing, the ADT recommended the dismissal of the two from the service.<br><br>On appeal to the UP Board of Regents, however, it modified the penalties against them to “forced resignation with the accessory penalties defined in the Omnibus Rules Implementing Book V of Executive Order 292 and other Pertinent Civil Service Laws x x x.”&nbsp; Further, the Board of Regents stated in its decision that Dr. Posadas and Dr. Dayco may reapply after one year provided they render a public apology.&nbsp; Relying on this decision, the UP General-Counsel filed on behalf of UP a complaint that led to the filing of the present cases against the respondents before the Sandiganbayan.<br><br>On June 28, 2005, after trial, the Sandiganbayan found petitioners Dr. Posadas and Dr. Dayco guilty of violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. 3019 and imposed on them an indeterminate penalty of imprisonment for 9 years and 1 day as minimum and 12 years as maximum, with the accessory penalty of perpetual disqualification from public office.&nbsp; The court also found them guilty of violation of Section 7(b) of R.A. 6713 and imposed on them the penalty of imprisonment for 5 years and disqualification to hold public office. They were further ordered to indemnify the government in the sum of P336,000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br><center><b>The Issues Presented</b></center><br>The issues in this case are:<br><br>1.&nbsp; Whether or not, acting in conspiracy with one another, Dr. Dayco, then OIC Chancellor, caused undue injury to the government or gave unwarranted advantage to a private party through manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence when he appointed Dr. Posadas as Project Director of the TMC Project and further designated him as its consultant in violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. 3019; and<br><br>2. Whether or not the same acts of Dr. Dayco and Dr. Posadas constitute a violation of Section 7(b) of R.A. 6713.<br><br><center><b>The Dissenting View</b></center><br>Since the evidence and the rationalization for the two issues are the same, they shall be jointly discussed.<br><br>Clearly, the prosecution evidence failed to prove the guilt of petitioners beyond reasonable doubt and the Sandiganbayan committed grave abuse of discretion in ruling otherwise.<br><br><u>First</u>. The prosecution did not prove that Dr. Dayco, then OIC Chancellor, was prompted by “manifest partiality or evident bad faith” in appointing Dr. Posadas as Project Director and designating him as Project Consultant of the TMC Project.<br><br>No evidence was presented to show that there were others more qualified than Dr. Posadas to serve as its Project Director and Consultant.&nbsp; The idea for the project was essentially his.&nbsp; And it came within his area of expertise—technical management.&nbsp; Further, it was he, applying that expertise, who worked to convince the PIDS/PTTAF to arrange funding for the project. In the world of the academe, that project was the equivalent of his thesis.&nbsp; The choice of Dr. Posadas to head the project was not a case of “manifest partiality” but of simple “manifest fairness.”<br><br>The only weakness in petitioners’ case is that, apparently, they took advantage of Dr. Posadas’ official travel to China and his designation of Dr. Dayco as OIC Chancellor, so the latter could use his authority as such OIC to designate Dr. Posadas as Project Director and Consultant of the TMC Project. That looks bad from the point of view of the justices of the Sandiganbayan who just assumed that all public officials know that an OIC does not have such power.<br><br>The bottom issue, truly, is whether or not Dr. Dayco and Dr. Posadas acted in bad faith knowing fully well that an OIC Chancellor cannot make the questioned appointment and designation.&nbsp; True, it appears that the two officials expressly or impliedly agreed that Dr. Dayco could officially take those actions, relying on his OIC powers.&nbsp; They probably thought that by doing this, they could get around the fact that Dr. Posadas, as Chancellor of UP Diliman, could not designate himself to head the project even if he was really entitled to it.&nbsp; Still, Dr. Dayco’s subsequent action and Dr. Posadas’ concurrence to it cannot amount to bad faith.<br><br>Actually, the test of bad faith in this case is whether or not Dr. Dayco and Dr. Posadas were in fact aware that the law did not empower Dr. Dayco as OIC Chancellor to make the questioned designation and appointment.&nbsp; If they thought that it could be legally done, Dr. Posadas’ travel grant to China presented an opportunity for Dr. Dayco to make the designations in question.&nbsp; After all, to his mind, there is no question that Dr. Posadas was highly qualified for the job.&nbsp; No evidence has been adduced to show that UP academic officials were prohibited from receiving compensation for work they render outside the scope of their normal duties as administrators or faculty professors.<br><br>The prosecution, which carried the burden of proof, did not present evidence that Dr. Dayco or Dr. Posadas knew beforehand that the designations were void for lack of authority of Dr. Dayco to make such designations.&nbsp; The Sandiganbayan merely assumed that they were familiar with the rules and regulations of the Civil Service Commission regarding the matter.&nbsp; But such assumption is unwarranted.&nbsp; The two UP officials were scientists, not lawyers.&nbsp; Familiarity with those rules and regulations does not exist in their world. Indeed, even the UP Diliman Legal Office was unfamiliar with the limitation to the OIC’s power.&nbsp; It rendered a legal opinion that “confirmed the authority of Dr. Dayco, while he was OIC Chancellor, to appoint Dr. Posadas as Project Director and Consultant of the TMC Project.”<br><br>Besides, the COA Resident Auditor, who at first thought that the payments were invalid, expressed satisfaction at the explanation that the head of the UP Diliman Legal Office gave.&nbsp; In fact, the Resident Auditor officially withdrew the Notices of Suspension of payment that he issued.&nbsp; Since the Office of the Ombudsman did not implicate these two officials in the charge of conspiracy that it filed against Dr. Dayco and Dr. Posadas, it may be assumed that the head of that legal office and the COA Resident Auditor acted in good faith in affirming Dr. Dayco’s authority.<br><br>Parenthetically, had the UP Diliman Legal Office and the COA Resident Auditor rendered opinions or rulings against Dr. Dayco and Dr. Posadas, the next step would have been for the latter to reimburse what he received as payments for his services in the project in view of the disallowance order or appeal such order.&nbsp; But they did not give him that chance.<br><br>In other government offices, the case against Dr. Dayco and Dr. Posadas would have been treated as purely partaking of an administrative character. COA’s orders of suspension or disallowance are abundant and commonplace and are hardly regarded as cause for filing criminal charges of corruption.&nbsp; But, undoubtedly, other considerations entered the picture.<br><br>Dr. Posadas had earlier created a Fact-Finding Committee at UP Diliman that investigated UP Library Administrative Officer Ofelia del Mundo, resulting in her being charged with grave abuse of authority, neglect of duty, and other wrongdoings.&nbsp; This prompted Professor Tabbada, the Acting UP TMC Director, to resign from his post in protest to the recall of Ms. Del Mundo.&nbsp; In turn, the latter instigated the UP President to go after Dr. Posadas and Dr. Dayco in this case.&nbsp; Apparently, the Office of the Ombudsman and the Sandiganbayan played into these intense mutual hatred and rivalry that enlarged what was a simple administrative misstep.<br><br>As the Court said in <i>Marcelo v. Sandiganbayan (Third Division),</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> bad faith partakes of the nature of fraud.<br><br><blockquote>“Bad faith does not simply connote bad judgment or negligence; it imputes a dishonest purpose or some moral obliquity and conscious doing of a wrong; a breach of sworn duty through some motive or intent or ill will; it partakes of the nature of fraud.&nbsp; (<i>Spiegel v. Beacon Participations</i>, 8 NE 2nd Series, 895, 1007).&nbsp; It contemplates a state of mind affirmatively operating with furtive design or some motive of self interest or ill will for ulterior purposes.&nbsp; (<i>Air France v. Carrascoso,</i> 18 SCRA 155, 166-167).&nbsp; Evident bad faith connotes a manifest deliberate intent on the part of the accused to do wrong or cause damage.”<br></blockquote><br>Dr. Dayco and Dr. Posadas did not willfully defraud the government. Dr. Posadas was qualified for the job of Project Director and Consultant of the TMC Project more than any other.&nbsp; There is no evidence that he did not adequately discharge the extra responsibilities and labor that were given him.&nbsp; In the future, disallowances of benefits paid to government officials and employees will provide ground for treating the disallowed payment as equivalent to giving “unwarranted advantage to a private party through manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence,” a mode of corruption.<br><br><u>Second</u>.&nbsp; The fault of these professors-scientists, who have spent the best parts of their lives in the service of UP, does not warrant their going to jail for 9 years, minimum, to 12 years, maximum, for what they did.&nbsp; They did not act with manifest partiality or evident bad faith.&nbsp; Indeed, the UP Board of Regents, the highest governing body of that institution and the most sensitive to any attack upon its revered portals, did not believe that Dr. Dayco and Dr. Posadas committed outright corruption.&nbsp; Indeed, it did not dismiss them from the service; it merely ordered their forced resignation and the accessory penalties that went with it.<br><br>The Board did not also believe that the two deserved to be permanently expelled from UP.&nbsp; It meted out to them what in effect amounted to mere suspension for one year since the Board practically invited them to come back and teach again after one year provided they render a public apology for their actions.&nbsp; The Board of Regents did not regard their offense so morally detestable as to take away from them the privilege of again teaching the young.<br><br><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, I vote to grant the petition, reverse and set aside the judgment of conviction of the Sandiganbayan in Criminal Cases 25465-66 dated June 28, 2005, and acquit Dr. Roger R. Posadas and Dr. Rolando P. Dayco for failure of the State to prove their guilt of the two offenses beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>&nbsp; <i>Rollo</i>, pp. 48-70.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>&nbsp; 263 Phil. 1060, 1065 (1990), cited in <i>Sidro v.
