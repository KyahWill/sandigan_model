P-3163 and P-3178, finding appellant Jaime Fernandez <span style="font-style: italic;">y</span> Hertez guilty as charged, is <b>AFFIRMED</b> with the <b>MODIFICATION</b> that the fine of One Hundred Thousand Pesos (P100,000.00) imposed in Criminal Case No. P-3163 is <span style="font-weight: bold;">DELETED</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></blockquote><br><center><b>Assignment of Errors</b><br></center><br>Undaunted, appellant comes to this Court and insists on his innocence by adopting the same errors he raised before the CA, as follows:<br><br><blockquote><center>I</center><br>THE LOWER COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN RENDERING A VERDICT OF CONVICTION DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE GUILT OF THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT WAS NOT PROVEN BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.<br><br><center>II<br></center><br>THE LOWER COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN GIVING CREDENCE TO THE INCONSISTENT AND INCREDIBLE TESTIMONIES OF THE PROSECUTION WITNESSES.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br></blockquote><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b></center><br>The present appeal lacks merit.<br><br><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td width="40%"><div align="JUSTIFY"><em>This Court accords respect to the findings and conclusions of the RTC with regard to the credibility of the witnesses and the sufficiency of evidence of the prosecution.</em></div></td> <td width="60%">&nbsp;</td> </tr> </tbody></table><br><br>Indeed, as intimated by the appellant, prosecutions involving illegal drugs largely depend on the credibility of police officers serving as prosecution witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp; When a case involves violation of the Dangerous Drugs Act, “credence should be given to the narration of the incident by the prosecution witnesses especially when they are police officers who are presumed to have performed their duties in a regular manner, unless there be evidence to the contrary.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>&nbsp; In this regard and as this Court held in <i>People v. Dela Cruz,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> “the rule is that the findings of the trial court, its calibration of the testimonies of the witnesses and its assessment of the probative weight thereof, as well as its conclusions anchored on said findings, are accorded respect, if not conclusive effect.&nbsp; This is more true if such findings were affirmed by the appellate court[, because in such a case,] said findings are generally binding upon this Court.”<br><br>In this case, the RTC found the witnesses for the prosecution credible.&nbsp; There is no showing that the members of the search team were actuated by any ill motive or that they planted the seized items.&nbsp; Hence, the RTC gave full faith and credit to the prosecution witnesses’ version of the events that transpired on July 21, 2001.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>&nbsp; Moreover, the evidence of the prosecution sufficiently established that (1) by virtue of a lawful search, PO3 Villano, PO2 Bienvenido C. Amador, Jr. (PO2 Amador) and Inspector Cristino Pa-ac were able to seize from appellant’s house suspected<i> shabu </i>and marijuana, among others; and, (2) when these specimens were qualitatively examined, they yielded positive results for the said prohibited drugs.&nbsp; The appellate court sustained these findings and conclusions of the RTC after satisfying itself that there was no clear misapprehension of facts.&nbsp; In view of the CA’s affirmance of the said findings of the RTC, and there being no material facts that were overlooked by the lower courts, this Court finds no reason to disturb their findings and conclusions and, hence, accords respect to the same.<br><br>With regard to the alleged inconsistent statements of PO3 Villano and PO2 Amador with respect to appellant’s exact location during the search and seizure, the number of rooms inside the house, and the place where the <i>shabu</i> and rolled marijuana leaves were found, suffice it to say that these matters are not vital and of such significance as compared to the circumstances and the very act of finding the dangerous drugs in the possession of the appellant which constitute the elements of the crime.&nbsp; Criminal law jurisprudence invariably holds that inconsistencies in the testimonies of witnesses on minor details do not impair their credibility.&nbsp; As the Court ruled in<i> People v. Bernabe,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> “[w]hile witnesses may differ in their recollections of an incident, it does not necessarily follow from their disagreement that all of them should be disbelieved as liars and their testimonies completely discarded as worthless.&nbsp; As long as the mass of testimony jibes on material points, the slightly clashing statements neither dilute the witnesses’ credibility or the veracity of their testimony, for indeed, such inconsistencies are but natural and even enhance credibility as these discrepancies indicate that the responses are honest and unrehearsed.”<br><br><i>Identity of the drugs established;<br>chain of custody not broken</i><br><br>Appellant next contends that the prosecution failed to establish the identity of the prohibited drugs which constitute the <span style="font-style: italic;">corpus delicti</span> of the offense.<br><br>The Court finds otherwise.&nbsp; The totality of the prosecution’s evidence sufficiently proved the identity of the seized prohibited items despite the intervening changes in their custody and possession.&nbsp; The chain of custody of the seized items from the time they were confiscated and eventually marked until the time they were presented during the trial has likewise been established.&nbsp; As the appellate court correctly observed:<br><br><blockquote>x x x.&nbsp; The fact however that the dangerous drugs presented in court were the same items recovered from appellant can be gleaned from the testimonies of PO3 Villena and PO3 Amador, Jr., who narrated the incident from the time the dangerous drugs were recovered from appellant, to the time the same were inventoried in the presence of appellant and the witnesses, brought to the police station, and finally referred to the forensic chemist for qualitative examination.&nbsp; The integrity and identity of the confiscated items, particularly the dangerous drugs, were thus properly safeguarded.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote><br>Like the courts below, this Court finds no circumstance whatsoever that would raise any doubt as to the identity, integrity and evidentiary value of the items subject matter of this case.&nbsp; The chain of custody was clearly not broken.&nbsp; “Besides, the integrity of the evidence is presumed preserved unless there is a showing of bad faith, ill will or proof that the evidence has been tampered with”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> in which the burden of proof falls on the appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>&nbsp; Appellant failed to discharge this burden.<br><br><i>Appellant’s defenses of denial and<br>frame-up were properly rejected by the <br>lower courts.</i><br><br>Appellant’s defenses hinge primarily on denial and frame-up.&nbsp; He claims that while denial, like alibi, is generally considered a weak defense, it is not always false and bereft of merit where the evidence for the prosecution is even weaker.&nbsp; This is true but not in all cases and certainly not in this case.&nbsp; It bears to stress that “the defense of denial or frame-up, like alibi, has been invariably viewed with disfavor [by this Court] for it can easily be concocted and is a common defense ploy in most prosecutions for violation of the Dangerous Drugs Act.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>&nbsp; Here, the lower courts properly rejected this defense not only because the prosecution’s evidence against appellant is so overwhelming but also because he miserably failed to substantiate such defense with clear and convincing evidence.<br><br>In the light of the foregoing analysis and the applicable jurisprudence on the matter, this Court sustains the CA’s assailed Decision affirming appellant’s conviction by the RTC of the crimes charged.<br><br><b><i>The Penalty</i></b><br><br>The penalty prescribed under Section 8, Article II in relation to Section 20, Article IV of RA 6425, as amended by RA 7659,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> for unauthorized possession of 750 grams or more of marijuana is <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death and a fine of P500,000.00 to P10 million. Since appellant was found guilty of possessing 1,188.7 grams of marijuana in Criminal Case No. P-3178, this Court thus affirms the penalties of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and fine of P500,000.00 imposed upon the appellant by the RTC and affirmed by the CA.<br><br>As regards appellant’s unauthorized possession of 2.85 grams of <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span> in Criminal Case No. P-3163, a quantity which is less than the ceiling of 200 grams provided in Section 20 of Article IV of RA 6425 as amended by RA 7659, the imposable penalty is <i>prision correccional</i> as provided in the same law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>&nbsp; Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, and there being no aggravating or mitigating circumstance that attended the commission of the crime, the maximum period is <i>prision correccional</i> in its medium period which has a duration of two (2) years, four (4) months and one (1) day to four (4) years and two (2) months.&nbsp; The minimum period is within the range of the penalty next lower in degree which is <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor</span>, the duration of which is one (1) month and one (1) day to six (6) months.&nbsp; Hence, we likewise affirm the penalty of six (6) months of <i>arresto mayor</i>, as minimum, to four (4) years and two (2) months of <i>prision correccional,</i> as maximum, imposed upon the appellant for the said crime.&nbsp; We also affirm the CA’s deletion of the fine of P100,000.00 imposed by the RTC since the second paragraph of Section 20 of RA 6425, as amended, provides only for the penalty of imprisonment.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appeal is <b>DISMISSED</b>.
