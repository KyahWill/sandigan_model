(PALI), is the owner and developer of Vista de Loro Condominium (Vista de Loro), a condominium project that straddles on eight (8) parcels of land located at the Puerto Azul Beach and Hotel Complex, Ternate, Cavite. The lots are registered in PALI’s name under Transfer Certificates of Title (TCT) Nos. 404201, 404202, 404203, 404204, 404432, 404433, 404434 and 404425 of the Cavite Province Registry of Deeds.<br><br>On May 17, 1993, the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (HLURB) issued in favor of PALI, relative to Vista de Loro, a License to Sell pursuant to Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 957, otherwise known as “The Subdivision and Condominium Buyers’ Protective Decree”.<br><br>On May 13, 1994, PALI and PNB entered into a “Credit Agreement” by virtue of which PNB loaned to PALI P150,000,000.00 to finance the construction and development of Vista de Loro. As security, PALI mortgaged to PNB the eight (8) lots mentioned above. In the “Credit Agreement”, PALI made several representations, one of which is as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Section 6. Representation and Warranties.<br><br>The Borrower [PALI] represents and warrants to the Bank [PNB] as follows:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>6.02. Authority; Corporate Action; No Violation. At the time of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Note/s and the other documentation contemplated thereby, their execution and delivery as well as the performance and observance by the borrower of the respective terms and provisional (sic) thereof, (I) will have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate actions, (II) will have received such approvals, if any, of any court, office or administrative or regulatory agency or authority having jurisdiction over the transactions contemplated thereby, and (III) will not contravene or violate any applicable provision of law or the Borrower[’]s Articles of Incorporation or By[-]Laws, or of any contract [or] agreement or indenture or other instrument to which the borrower is a party or by which any of its properties may be bound.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></blockquote><br>On June 8, 1995 and September 25, 1996, PNB loaned to PALI additional amounts of P120,000,000.00 and P50,000,000.00. It was agreed that these two (2) subsequent loans shall likewise be secured by the same mortgage which was earlier constituted on the eight (8) lots owned by PALI.<br><br>On September 8, 1997, PALI and its co-respondent in the instant petition, Rina Parayno Lim (Lim), entered into a Contract to Sell, covering Unit 48C in Cluster Dominiko of Vista de Loro. Unit 48C is covered by Condominium Certificate of Title (CCT) No. 408 and Cluster Dominiko is situated on the land covered by TCT No. 404201. PNB’s mortgage is annotated on both titles.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>PALI defaulted in the payment of its loans. Thus, PNB moved for the foreclosure of the subject mortgage and a Notice of Sale dated April 19, 1999 was thereafter issued, scheduling the sale of the eight (8) lots at public auction on May 25, 1999.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br><b>1<sup>st</sup> Annulment of Mortgage Case</b><br><br>On May 24, 1999, PALI filed with the Regional Trial Court of Naic, Cavite (RTC) a Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> against PNB for the annulment of the subject mortgage with application for the issuance of a temporary restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction. PALI alleged that the subject mortgage is void as it was not approved by the HLURB as required by Section 18<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> of P.D. No. 957. PALI’s complaint was docketed as Civil Case No. NC-99-1005 and raffled to Branch 15.<br><br>In an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> dated August 29, 2003, the RTC dismissed PALI’s complaint stating that:<br><br><blockquote>The failure on the part of the plaintiff [PALI] to comply with its undertaking to secure the approval of the mortgage by the HLURB does not invalidate the mortgage or render it unenforceable. It would be rank injustice to hold otherwise for then the validity of the contract would be left to the entire discretion and whim of the plaintiff.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>In the instant case, it is the claim of plaintiff that it did not have free disposal of the mortgaged properties at the time the mortgage was constituted. Contrary to plaintiff’s submission, as the registered owner of the real properties covered by the mortgage, plaintiff had absolute title to such properties and may make use of it in such manner it may deem fit for its advantage so long as such use is not injurious or harmful to others.<br><br>Plaintiff can validly constitute the mortgage under consideration since the validity thereof does not depend on the written approval of the HLURB. Even in the absence of such approval, the mortgage remains valid and enforceable since PD No. 957 merely prohibits the owner or developer from mortgaging any unit or lot without such approval. Nowhere in the said Decree is it provided that a mortgage entered into by the owner or developer in violation thereof is not valid. x x x.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>It is quite evident from the foregoing that plaintiff intended to be bound by its contract of mortgage with defendant PNB. Plaintiff may not now be heard to complain that its contract with PNB is invalid for its failure to seek the written approval from the HLURB of the mortgage it has entered into and hide behind the mantle of PD No. 957 which is meant for the protection of subdivision lot or condominium unit buyers and not the owner or developer which in the instant case is the plaintiff.<br><br>WHEREFORE, premises considered, let judgment be rendered in favor of the defendants and against the plaintiff: (I) declare the Real Estate Mortgage [s]ubject matter of this case as valid and enforceable; (II) lifting the temporary restraining order issued; and (III) allowing the foreclosure of the mortgaged properties.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></blockquote><br>PALI moved for reconsideration, which was denied by the RTC in an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> dated March 30, 2004. The RTC declared the subject mortgage as voidable since there is nothing in Section 18 of P.D. No. 957 suggesting that the failure to secure the approval of the HLURB relative to the execution of the said mortgage would render the same as void. Nonetheless, the RTC ruled that while the subject mortgage is voidable, PALI is estopped from questioning its validity. The RTC explained that:<br><br><blockquote>The point of contention is Section 18 of P.D. No. 957 which provides in part, to wit: “No mortgage on any unit or lot shall be made by the owner or developer without prior written approval of the authority (now the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board or HLURB).” Certainly, the prohibition is mandatory since it commands and leaves no discretion in the matter. It is true that as provided by Article 5, Civil Code, “Acts executed against the provisions of mandatory or prohibitory laws shall be void, except when the law itself authorizes their validity.” But the word “void” refers to both acts which are ipso facto void and to acts which are merely voidable (Municipality of Camiling vs. Lopez, 99 Phil. 187, cited in Aquino and Griño-Aquino, The Civil Code of the Philippines and Family Code, 1990 ed., p. 12). In the cited case, it was held that the lease of fishponds executed by a municipality, without the consent of the provincial governor as required by law, was merely voidable and not <u>void ab initio</u>. The instant controversy is akin to the Municipality of Camiling case in that a prior approval or consent by a specific authority is a pre-requisite to the validity of a given transaction. Yet, the absence of such previous consent merely makes the transaction voidable, or valid unless and until made void. Consequently, the real estate mortgage between the parties without the antecedent HLURB written approval is only voidable, and remains valid until set aside.<br><br>But may not Plaintiff have the mortgage be (sic) annulled now, which is in fact the remedy it prays for? PALI has the principle of estoppel against it, having misrepresented itself to have free disposal of the property subject of the mortgage. It is PALI’s responsibility to seek HLURB approval of the mortgage. Note that Section 18 of P.D. No. 957 prohibits a mortgage by an owner or developer without HLURB approval. PALI is the owner and developer of the Vista de Loro Condominium Project, subject of the mortgage. Since the prohibition covers Plaintiff, it is incumbent upon it to secure the consent of HLURB before the property can be mortgaged to PNB. PALI cannot pass the buck to PNB by arguing that it is new in the business and PNB being vastly experienced, the responsibility lies with the latter. Ignorance of the law excuses no one from compliance therewith (Article 3, Civil Code). Truly, to nullify the real estate mortgage due to Plaintiffs’ failure to secure the required written HLURB approval would be to allow Plaintiff to unjustly benefit from its own inaction or negligence at the expense of PNB.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></blockquote><br>PALI filed with this Court a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>, which was docketed as G.R. No. 163377. In a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> dated June 7, 2004, this Court denied PALI’s petition. Thus:<br><br><blockquote>Considering the allegations, issues, and arguments adduced in the petition for review on certiorari of the orders of the Regional Trial Court, Naic, Cavite, Branch 15, dated August 29, 2003 and March 30, 2004, the Court Resolves to <b><i>DENY</i></b> the petition for failure of the petitioner to sufficiently show that the Regional Trial Court committed any reversible error in the challenged orders as to warrant the exercise by this Court of its discretionary appellate jurisdiction in this case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></blockquote><br>This Court’s Resolution dated June 7, 2004 became final and executory on September 10, 2004.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br><b>2<sup>nd</sup> Annulment of Mortgage Case</b><br><br>On July 19, 1999, Lim filed with the HLURB a complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> against PALI, PNB, the Registrar of Deeds of the Province of Cavite and Atty. Jude Jose F. Latorre, Sr., a Notary Public for Cavite City, seeking for the nullification of the subject mortgage, suspension of PALI’s license to sell, and award of damages. Lim claimed that apart from the fact that the subject mortgage is prejudicial to her interest, it is void for lack of the requisite approval of the HLURB. Lim likewise emphasized that by the time she learned of the subject mortgage, she had already paid PALI the total amount of P5,752,215.24.<br><br><center><b>The Ruling of the HLURB</b><br></center><br>On October 25, 2000, the HLURB gave due course to Lim’s complaint and rendered a Decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> the dispositive portion of which states:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered as follows:<br><ol><li>Declaring the Real Estate Mortgage between PALI and PNB dated March 22,

fine.</li></ol>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br></blockquote><br>The HLURB ruled that PALI’s failure to secure its approval rendered the subject mortgage void. Thus:<br><br><blockquote>From the arguments of respondents as well as the documentary exhibits presented by complainant, more particularly the Complaint and Affidavit of Merit of Cynthia Hermoso, it was strongly established that indeed the required Mortgage Clearance was not procured before the Mortgage Contract between PALI and PNB was executed. This act is not only prohibited but also penalized under P.D. No. 957.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></blockquote><br>Likewise ruling that <i>litis pendentia</i> will not bar Lim from having the subject mortgage annulled, the HLURB ratiocinated as follows:<br><br><blockquote>The defense of litis pendentia and forum-shopping presupposes dual actions involving the same parties with identical reliefs sought. Respondent PALI failed to submit any evidence to prove that complainant was a party to the case pending before the Regional Trial Court of Naic, Cavite. Jurisdiction falls within this Board over this case since the same involves the relief for violation of P.D. 957.

On March 18, 2004, PNB filed with the CA a Petition for Review<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court, assailing the OP’s June 18, 2003 and February 10, 2004 Orders. PNB argued that: (a) it is not bound by the contract between Lim and PALI as it is not a party thereto; (b) the power to annul the subject mortgage is judicial in nature and exclusively vested with the RTCs; (c) in <i>Dy v. Court of Appeals,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> this Court stated that there is nothing in Section 18 of P.D. No. 957 which provides that a mortgage without the HLURB’s approval is null and void; (d) the remedy provided by Section 25 of P.D. No. 957 is redemption and not the nullification of the mortgage; and (e) it is a mortgagee in good faith as PALI’s titles do not bear an annotation of any lien or encumbrance at the time of the constitution of the subject mortgage.<br><br>PNB thereafter moved for substitution of parties stating that it had assigned its interest in PALI’s loan and the subject mortgage to Tranche 1 (SPV-AMC), Inc. (Tranche 1) pursuant to Republic Act No. 9182.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> This was granted by the CA in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> dated September 2, 2005.<br><br><center><b>The Ruling of the CA</b></center><br>On September 29, 2005, the CA rendered the herein assailed Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> partially granting PNB’s petition. The CA upheld the HLURB’s jurisdiction to annul the subject mortgage and dismissed PNB’s claim that it is a mortgagee in good faith, the rights of which should prevail over Lim’s rights as the buyer of Unit 48C. The CA, however, reversed the award of moral damages and attorney’s fees in Lim’s favor for lack of factual basis. The CA ratiocinated that:<br><br><blockquote>Clearly, PALI’s act of mortgaging parcels of land on which the condominium project is located without the approval of the HLURB was not only an unsound real estate business practice but also highly prejudicial to the buyer. The jurisdiction of the HLURB to regulate the real estate trade is broad enough to include jurisdiction over complaints for annulment of the mortgage with damages (<i>Home Bankers Savings and Trust Co. vs. Court of Appeals, et. al.</i>, April 26, 2005 citing <i>Union Bank of the Philippines vs. Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board</i>, 210 SCRA 558).<br><br>PNB likewise contends that it is a mortgagee in good faith and for value, hence, should not be prejudiced by declaring the mortgage null and void.<br><br>Such claim is without merit.<br><br>Judicial notice can be taken of the uniform practice of banks to investigate, examine and assess the real estate offered as security for the application of a loan. We cannot overemphasize the fact that the Bank cannot barefacedly argue that simply because the title or titles offered as security were clean of any encumbrances or lien, that it was thereby relieved of taking any other step to verify the over-reaching implications should the subdivision be auctioned on foreclosure (<i>Home Bankers Savings and Trust Co. vs. Court of Appeals, et. al.,</i> April 26, 2005). Thus, the claim of PNB that it is a mortgagee in good faith cannot be sustained.<br><br>As to the award of damages, We find the same improper. The decision of the HLU[RB] Arbiter (which was modified by the Board which decision was in turn affirmed <i>in toto</i> by the Office of the President) states that the award of moral damages was based on the speculated moral suffering of Lim. No proof of pecuniary loss is necessary in order that moral damages may be adjudicated. However, there must be proof that petitioner caused physical suffering, mental anguish, fright, serious anxiety, besmirched reputation, wounded feelings, moral shock, social humiliation, and similar injury to the plaintiff (Lim). Speculated moral suffering as found by the HLU[RB] Arbiter is not sufficient to sustain the award.<br><br>The decision likewise failed to state in the body of the decision the basis of the award of attorney’s fees. Whatever attorney’s fees are awarded, the court must explicitly state in the body of its decision, and not only in the dispositive portion thereof, the legal reason for the award. The power of the courts to grant damages and attorney’s fees demands factual, legal and equitable justification; its basis cannot be left to speculation or conjecture (<i>Ranola vs. Court of Appeals, 322 SCRA 1</i>). Consequently, the issue of whether or not PNB can be held solidarily liable with PALI for damages, is moot and academic.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br></blockquote><br>On November 2, 2005, Tranche 1 filed a Motion for Partial Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> but this was denied by the CA in its Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> dated February 23, 2006.<br><br><center><b>Issues</b><br></center><br>The instant petition seeks the reversal of the herein assailed Decision dated September 29, 2005 and Resolution dated February 23, 2006 of the CA, which declared the subject mortgage as null and void.

No 957 confers upon the HLURB the authority to decide cases involving “unsound real estate business practices” and “specific performance of contractual and statutory obligations filed by buyers of subdivision or condominium unit against the owner, developer, broker or salesman”. However, there is nothing in P.D. No. 957 or P.D. No. 134442 which vests in the HLURB the jurisdiction to annul mortgage contracts over subdivision lots and condominium units entered into between the owners and developers, on one hand, and third party lenders, on the other.<br><br>Quoting Dy,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Tranche 1 likewise argues that “there is nothing in the said provision [of P.D. No. 957] which states that a mortgage executed without the approval of the National Housing Authority [now HLURB] is null and void”. Besides, in <i>Lopez and Javelona v. El Hogar Filipino</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> this Court was unequivocal that “prohibitory statute may itself point out the consequences of its violation; and if on a consideration of the whole statute, it appears that the legislature intended to define such consequences and to exclude any other penalty or forfeiture than such as is declared in the statute itself, no other will be enforced, and if an action can be maintained on the transaction of which the prohibited transaction was a part, without sanctioning the illegality, such action will be entertained.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> In P.D. No. 957, penalties are provided for, to wit, revocation of both the registration of the subdivision or condominium project and the developer’s license to sell, imposition of fines, and/or imprisonment against the persons responsible for the violations.<br><br>Tranche 1 also maintains that PNB is a mortgagee in good faith, the rights of which should prevail over the rights of Lim, who is a buyer in bad faith. At the time the subject mortgage was constituted, PALI’s titles bore no annotation of any lien or encumbrance. In contrast thereto, at the time Lim purchased Unit 48C, the subject mortgage was already annotated on TCT No. 404201 and CCT No. 408. Hence, it can be presumed that Lim had constructive knowledge of the existence of the subject mortgage.<br><br>Section 25<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> of P.D. No. 957 explicitly provides for redemption as a remedy available to a buyer of a condominium unit in case an outstanding mortgage covering the purchased property exists.<br><br><center><b>Lim’s Arguments</b></center><br>In her Comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Lim stresses that she was not a party to the first annulment of mortgage case filed with the RTC. Further, the HLURB’s jurisdiction over her complaint cannot be assailed since the relief she sought was posed against PALI and PNB’s acts which were violative of P.D. No. 957.<br><br>While Lim admits that she was not privy to the subject mortgage executed between PALI and PNB, she was directly affected by the same.<br><br>Besides, it is beyond dispute that no mortgage clearance was obtained from the HLURB. Thus, the subject mortgage cannot be enforced against her and the other buyers of units in the condominium project.<br><br>As to PNB, it failed to exercise due diligence relative to the execution of the subject mortgage. PNB cannot be considered as a mortgagee in good faith in the light of this Court’s pronouncement in pertinent cases, that the rule stating that persons dealing with registered lands can rely solely on the certificates of title, does not apply to banks.<br><br><center><b>PALI’s Contentions</b><br></center><br>In its Comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> PALI reiterates the arguments it had raised in the first annulment of mortgage case filed with the RTC and proceedings before the HLURB.<br><br>PALI contends that the subject mortgage is void for having been constituted sans HLURB’s approval, hence, in contravention of Section 18 of P.D. No. 957. Consonant to the foregoing, this Court ruled in <i>Far East Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Marquez</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> that “the avowed purpose of [P.D. No.] 957 compels the reading of Section 18 as prohibitory-acts committed contrary to it are void.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>Further, Article 5 of the New Civil Code is explicit that “acts executed against the provisions of mandatory or prohibitory laws shall be void, except when the law itself authorizes their validity.” Therefore, even if P.D. No. 957 only provides for fines and imprisonment as penalties, they are not the sole consequences of violations of its provisions.

The said resolution affirmed the RTC’s finding that even if the subject mortgage is voidable, PALI is already estopped from challenging its validity for to rule otherwise would be tantamount to rewarding the latter to benefit from its own inaction or negligence.<br><br>PALI refutes the above and cites<i> Alonso</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> to argue that a minute resolution is not a precedent.<br><br>In <i>Alonso,</i> we declared that a “minute resolution may amount to a final action on the case but it is not a precedent.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> However, we continued to state that “it can not bind non-parties to the action.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Corollary thereto, we can conclude that a minute resolution, while not a precedent relative to strangers to an action, nonetheless binds the parties therein, and calls for<i> res judicata’s </i>application.<br><br><i>Nationwide Security and Allied Services, Inc. v.

When we dismissed the petition, we effectively affirmed the CA ruling being questioned. As a result, our ruling in that case has already become final. x x x.<br><br><u>With respect to the same subject matter and the same issues concerning the same parties, it constitutes <i>res judicata</i>.

No. 957 affords Lim the remedy of redemption. Under the said section, PALI shall be compelled to redeem from PNB at least the portion of the mortgage corresponding to Unit 48C within six months from the issuance of CCT No. 408 to Lim.
