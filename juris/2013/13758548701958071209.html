The only reason the mortgaged properties were not foreclosed in 1977 was because of the restraining order from the court.&nbsp; In 1978, petitioners made a partial payment of P902,800.00.&nbsp; No subsequent payments were made.&nbsp; It was only in 1989 that petitioners tried to negotiate the settlement of their loan obligations.&nbsp; And although DBP could have foreclosed the mortgaged properties, it instead agreed to restructure the loan.&nbsp; In fact, from 1989 to 1994, DBP gave several extensions for petitioners to settle their loans, but they never did, thus, prompting DBP to cancel the Restructuring Agreement.<br><br>Petitioners, however, insist that DBP’s cancellation of the Restructuring Agreement justifies the extinguishment of their loan obligation under the Principle of Constructive Fulfillment found in Article 1186 of the Civil Code.<br><br>We do not agree.<br><br>As aptly pointed out by the CA, Article 1186 of the Civil Code, which states that “the condition shall be deemed fulfilled when the obligor voluntarily prevents its fulfillment,” does not apply in this case,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup> <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>Article 1186 enunciates the doctrine of constructive fulfillment of suspensive conditions,&nbsp; which applies when the following three (3) requisites concur, <i>viz</i>: (1) The condition is suspensive; (2) The obligor actually prevents the fulfillment of the condition;&nbsp; and (3) He acts voluntarily.&nbsp; Suspensive condition is one the happening of which gives rise to the obligation.&nbsp; It will be irrational for any Bank to provide a suspensive condition in the Promissory Note or the Restructuring Agreement that will allow the debtor-promissor to be freed from the duty to pay the loan without paying it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup></blockquote><br>Besides, petitioners have no one to blame but themselves for the cancellation of the Restructuring Agreement.&nbsp; It is significant to point out that when the Regional Credit Committee reconsidered petitioners’ proposal to restructure the loan, it imposed additional conditions.&nbsp; In fact, when DBP’s General Santos Branch forwarded the Restructuring Agreement to the Legal Services Department of DBP in Makati, petitioners were required to pay the amount of P1,300,672.75, plus a daily interest of P632.15 starting November 16, 1993 up to the date of actual payment of the said amount.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup>&nbsp; This, petitioners failed to do.&nbsp; DBP therefore had reason to cancel the Restructuring Agreement.<br><br>Moreover, since the Restructuring Agreement was cancelled, it could not have novated or extinguished petitioners’ loan obligation.&nbsp; And in the absence of a perfected Restructuring Agreement, there was no impediment for DBP to exercise its right to foreclose the mortgaged properties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup><br><br><b><i>The foreclosure sale is not valid.</i></b><br><br>But while DBP had a right to foreclose the mortgage, we are constrained to nullify the foreclosure sale due to the bank’s failure to send a notice of foreclosure to petitioners.<br><br>We have consistently held that <b>unless the parties stipulate</b>, “personal notice to the mortgagor in extrajudicial foreclosure proceedings is not necessary”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup> because Section 3<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup> of Act 3135 only requires the posting of the notice of sale in three public places and the publication of that notice in a newspaper of general circulation.<br><br>In this case, the parties stipulated in paragraph 11 of the Mortgage that:<br><br><blockquote>11.&nbsp; All correspondence relative to this mortgage,&nbsp; including demand letters, summons, subpoenas,&nbsp; or notification of any judicial or extra-judicial action shall be sent to the Mortgagor at xxx or at the address that may hereafter be given in writing by the Mortgagor or the Mortgagee;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup></blockquote><br>However, no notice of the extrajudicial foreclosure was sent by DBP to petitioners about the foreclosure sale scheduled on July 11, 1994.&nbsp; The letters dated January 28, 1994 and March 11, 1994 advising petitioners to immediately pay their obligation to avoid the impending foreclosure of their mortgaged properties are not the notices required in paragraph 11 of the Mortgage. The failure of DBP to comply with their contractual agreement with petitioners, i.e., to send notice, is a breach sufficient to invalidate the foreclosure sale.<br><br>In <i>Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company v. Wong,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup> we explained that:<br><br><blockquote>x x x a contract is the law between the parties and, that absent any showing that its provisions are wholly or in part contrary to law, morals, good customs, public order, or public policy, it shall be enforced to the letter by the courts. Section 3, Act No. 3135 reads:<br><blockquote>Sec.&nbsp; 3. Notice shall be given by posting notices of the sale for not less than twenty days in at least three public places of the municipality or city where the property is situated, and if such property is worth more than four hundred pesos, such notice shall also be published once a week for at least three consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality and city.</blockquote>The Act only requires (1) the posting of notices of sale in three public places, and (2) the publication of the same in a newspaper of general circulation. Personal notice to the mortgagor is not necessary. Nevertheless, the parties to the mortgage contract are not precluded from exacting additional requirements. In this case, petitioner and respondent in entering into a contract of real estate mortgage, agreed inter alia:<br><blockquote>all correspondence relative to this mortgage, including demand letters, summonses, subpoenas, or notifications of any judicial or extra-judicial action shall be sent to the MORTGAGOR at 40-42 Aldeguer St. Iloilo City, or at the address that may hereafter be given in writing by the MORTGAGOR to the MORTGAGEE.</blockquote>Precisely, the purpose of the foregoing stipulation is to apprise respondent of any action which petitioner might take on the subject property, thus according him the opportunity to safeguard his rights. <b>When petitioner failed to send the notice of foreclosure sale to respondent, he committed a contractual breach sufficient to render the foreclosure sale on November 23, 1981 null and void.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup>&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>In view of foregoing, the CA erred in finding the foreclosure sale valid.<br><br><b><i>Penalties and interest rates should <br>be expressly stipulated in writing.</i></b><br><br>As to the imposition of additional interest and penalties not stipulated in the Promissory Notes, this should not be allowed.&nbsp; Article 1956 of the Civil Code specifically states that “no interest shall be due unless it has been expressly stipulated in writing.” Thus, the payment of interest and penalties in loans is allowed only if the parties agreed to it and reduced their agreement in writing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[121]</sup><br><br>In this case, petitioners never agreed to pay additional interest and penalties.&nbsp; Hence, we agree with the RTC that these are illegal, and thus, void.&nbsp; Quoted below are the findings of the RTC on the matter, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Moreover, in its various statements of account, [respondent] Bank charged [petitioners] for additional interests and penalties which were not stipulated in the promissory notes.<br><br>In the Promissory Note, Exhibit “A,” for the principal amount of P960,000.00,&nbsp; only the following interest and penalty charges were stipulated:<br><blockquote>(1) interest at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum;<br>(2) penalty charge of one-third percent (1/3%) per month on overdue amortization;<br>(3) attorney’s fees equivalent to ten percent (10%) of the total indebtedness then unpaid;&nbsp; and<br>(4) advances and interest thereon at one percent (1%) per month.</blockquote>[Respondent] bank, however,&nbsp; charged [petitioners] the following items as shown in its Statement of Account for the period as of 31 January 1989, Exhibit “D:”<br><blockquote>(1) regular interest in the amount of P561,037.14;<br>(2) advances in the amount of P34,589.45;<br>(3) additional interest in the amount of P2,590,786.26;&nbsp; and<br>4) penalty charges in the amount of P1,068,147.19.</blockquote>The Court finds no basis under the Promissory Note, Exhibit “A,” for charging the additional interest in the amount of P2,590,786.26.&nbsp; Moreover, it is incomprehensible how the penalty charge of 1/3% per month on the overdue amortization could amount to P1,086,147.19 while the regular interest, which was stipulated at the higher rate of 12% per annum, amounted to only P561,037.14 or about half of the amount allegedly due as penalties.<br><br>In Exhibit “N,”&nbsp; which is the statement of account x x x as of 15 June 1992,&nbsp; [respondent] bank charged plaintiffs the following items:<br><blockquote>(1) regular interest in the amount of P561,037.14;<br>(2) advances in the amount of P106,893.93;<br>(3) additional interest on principal in the amount of P1,233,893.79;<br>(4) additional interest on regular interest in the amount of P859,966.83;<br>(5) additional interest on advances in the amount of P27,206.45;<br>(6) penalty charges on principal in the amount of P1,639,331.15;<br>(7) penalty charges on regular interest in the amount of P1,146,622.55;<br>(8) penalty charges on advances in the amount of P40,520.53.</blockquote>Again, the Court finds no basis in the Promissory Note,&nbsp; Exhibit “A,” for the imposition of additional interest on principal in the amount of P1,233,893.79, additional interest on regular interest in the amount of P859,966.83, penalty charges on regular interest in the amount of P1,146,622.55 and penalty charges on advances in the amount of P40,520.53.<br><br>In the Promissory Note,&nbsp; Exhibit “C,” for the principal amount of P40,000.00,&nbsp; only the following charges were stipulated:<br><blockquote>(1) interest at the rate of nine percent (9%) per annum;<br>(2) all unpaid amortization[s] shall bear interest at the rate of&nbsp; eleven percent (11%) per annum;&nbsp; and,<br>(3) attorney’s fees equivalent to ten percent (10%) of the total indebtedness then unpaid.</blockquote>In its statement of account x x x as of 31 January 1989, Exhibit “E,” [respondent] bank charged [petitioners] with the following items:<br><blockquote>(1) regular interest in the amount of P5,046.97<br>(2) additional interest in the amount of P92,113.56; and<br>(3) penalty charges in the amount of P39,915.46.</blockquote>There was nothing in the Promissory Note, Exhibit “C,” which authorized the imposition of additional interest. Again, this Court notes that the additional interest in the amount of P92,113.56 is even larger than the regular interest in the amount of P5,046.97.&nbsp; Moreover, based on the Promissory Note,&nbsp; Exhibit “C,” if the 11% interest on unpaid amortization is considered an “additional interest,” then there is no basis for [respondent] bank to add penalty charges as there is no other provision providing for this charge.&nbsp; If,&nbsp; on the other hand,&nbsp; the 11% interest on unpaid amortization is considered the penalty charge,&nbsp; then there is no basis to separately charge plaintiffs additional interest.&nbsp; The same provision cannot be used to charge plaintiffs both interest and penalties.<br><br>In Exhibit “O,” which is the statement of account x x x as of 15 June 1992, [respondent] charged [petitioners] with the following:<br><blockquote>(1) regular interest in the amount of P4,621.25;<br>(2) additional interest on principal in the amount of P65,303.33;<br>(3) additional interest on regular interest in the amount of P7,544.58;<br>(4) penalty charges on principal in the amount of P47,493.33;<br>(5) penalty charges on regular interest in the amount of P5,486.97;<br>(6) penalty charges on advances in the amount of P40,520.53.</blockquote>[Respondent] bank failed to show the basis for charging additional interest on principal, additional interest on regular interest and penalty charges on principal and penalty charges on regular interest under items (2), (3), (4) and (5) above.<br><br>Moreover, [respondent] bank charged [petitioners] twice under the same provisions in the promissory notes.&nbsp; It categorically admitted that the additional interests and penalty charges separately being charged [petitioners] referred to the same provision of the Promissory Notes,&nbsp; Exhibits “A” and “C.”&nbsp; Thus,&nbsp; for the Lim Account in the amount of P40,000.00, [respondent’s] Mr. Ancheta stated:<br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Q:</div></td> <td width="90%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">In Exhibit 14, it is stated that for a principal amount of P40,000.00 you imposed an additional interest in the amount of P65,303.33 in addition to the regular interest of P7,544.58, can you tell us looking [at] the mortgage contract and promissory note what is your basis for charging that additional interest?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">The same as that when I answered Exhibit No. 3, which shall cover amortization on the principal and interest at the above-mentioned rate.

(TSN, 19 March 1996, pp. 23-24.)&nbsp; This banking policy,&nbsp; however,&nbsp; has been declared null and void in Philippine National Bank vs. CA, 196 SCRA 536 (1991).&nbsp; The act of [respondent] bank in unilaterally changing the stipulated interest rate is violative of the principle of mutuality of contracts under 1308 of the Civil Code and contravenes 1956 of the Civil Code. [Respondent] bank completely ignored [petitioners’] “right to assent to an important modification in their agreement and (negated) the element of mutuality in contracts.” (Philippine National Bank vs. CA, G.R. No. 109563, 9 July 1996; Philippine National Bank vs.&nbsp; CA, 238 SCRA 20 1994).&nbsp; As in the PNB cases, [petitioners] herein never agreed in writing to pay the additional interest, or the penalties, as fixed by [respondent] bank; <b>hence [respondent] bank’s imposition of additional interest and penalties is null and void</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Consequently, this case should be remanded to the RTC for the proper determination of petitioners’ total loan obligation based on the interest and penalties stipulated in the Promissory Notes.<br><br><b><i>DBP did not act in bad faith or in a<br>wanton, reckless, or oppressive manner.</i></b><br><br>Finally, as to petitioners’ claim for damages, we find the same devoid of merit.<br><br>DBP did not act in bad faith or in a wanton, reckless, or oppressive manner in cancelling the Restructuring Agreement.&nbsp; As we have said, DBP had reason to cancel the Restructuring Agreement because petitioners failed to pay the amount required by it when it reconsidered petitioners’ request to restructure the loan.<br><br>Likewise, DBP’s failure to send a notice of the foreclosure sale to petitioners and its imposition of additional interest and penalties do not constitute bad faith.&nbsp; There is no showing that these contractual breaches were&nbsp; done in bad faith or in a wanton, reckless, or oppressive manner.<br><br>In <i>Philippine National Bank v. Spouses Rocamora</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup>&nbsp; we said that:<br><br><blockquote>Moral damages are not recoverable simply because a contract has been breached. They are recoverable only if the defendant acted fraudulently or in bad faith or in wanton disregard of his contractual obligations. The breach must be wanton, reckless, malicious or in bad faith, and oppressive or abusive. Likewise, a breach of contract may give rise to exemplary damages only if the guilty party acted in a wanton, fraudulent, reckless, oppressive or malevolent manner.<br><br><b>We are not sufficiently convinced that PNB acted fraudulently, in bad faith, or in wanton disregard of its contractual obligations, simply because it increased the interest rates and delayed the foreclosure of the mortgages.</b> Bad faith cannot be imputed simply because the defendant acted with bad judgment or with attendant negligence. Bad faith is more than these; it pertains to a dishonest purpose, to some moral obliquity, or to the conscious doing of a wrong, a breach of a known duty attributable to a motive, interest or ill will that partakes of the nature of fraud. Proof of actions of this character is undisputably lacking in this case. Consequently, we do not find the spouses Rocamora entitled to an award of moral and exemplary damages. Under these circumstances, neither should they recover attorney’s fees and litigation expense. These awards are accordingly deleted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[124]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition is <b>PARTLY GRANTED.</b> The assailed February 22, 2007 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
