Hence, the Tribunal has to rely on what is reflected in the election returns and/or statement of votes by precinct[,] the same being the best evidence of the results of the election in said precincts in lieu of the altered ballots.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The votes of the parties per physical count in all the 120 [sic] protested CPs in the concerned district are 40,209 for protestant [Chato] and 33,459 for protestee [Panotes].<br><br>Considering that <b>69 CPs have substantial variances</b>, the Tribunal decided to disregard the ballots therein, <i>i.e.</i>, 18,535 for protestant and 10,858 for protestee, and to consider, instead, the <b>results in the election returns,<i> i.e</i>., <u>16,802</u> for protestant and <u>19,202</u> for protestee.</b><br><br>Hence, only the ballots in the <b>91 CPs without substantial variances</b>,<i> i.e.</i>, <b><u>21,674</u> for protestant and <u>22,601</u> for protestee</b>, had undergone appreciation of ballots. Of the ballots appreciated, the Tribunal <b>rejected two (2)</b> ballots for <b>protestant</b> and <b><u>two</u> (2)</b> ballots for <span style="font-weight: bold;">protestee</span>, while it <b>admitted <u>176</u></b> ballots claimed by the <b>protestant</b> and <b><u>183</u></b> claimed by the <b>protestee.</b><br><br>The votes of the parties in the <b>uncontested municipalities</b> are <b><u>9,338</u></b> for protestant and <b><u>9,894</u></b> for protestee.<br><br>Accordingly, the parties’ votes, after recount and appreciation and examination of the evidence presented in the 160 protested CPs as well as in the uncontested municipalities, are summarized below:<br><br><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="2" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="70%"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td style="font-weight: bold;" valign="TOP" width="15%"><div align="CENTER">[Chato]</div></td> <td style="font-weight: bold;" valign="TOP" width="15%"><div align="CENTER">[Panotes]</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td style="text-align: left;">Votes in the 91 revised protested CPs <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">without SV</span> [substantial variance] per recount and appreciation</td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="CENTER">21,674</div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="CENTER">22,601</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Add</span>: Votes per ER/SOVP in 69 revised protested CPs <span style="font-weight: bold;">with SV</span></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="CENTER">16,802</div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="CENTER">19,202</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Less:</span> Rejected Ballots Objected to in the 91 revised protested CPs <span style="font-weight: bold;">without SV</span></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="CENTER">(2)</div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="CENTER">(2)</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Add</span>: Admitted PCOS Rejected Ballots Claimed in the 91 revised protested CPs<span style="font-weight: bold;"> without SV</span></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="CENTER">176</div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="CENTER">183</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Add:</span> Votes in the uncontested municipalities</td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="CENTER">9,338</div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="CENTER">9,894</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Equals</span>: Total votes of the parties in the congressional district</td> <td style="font-weight: bold;" valign="TOP"><div align="CENTER">47,988</div></td> <td style="font-weight: bold;" valign="TOP"><div align="CENTER">51,878</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td style="text-align: left; font-weight: bold;">Winning Margin of Protestee</td> <td style="font-weight: bold;" valign="TOP"><div align="CENTER"></div></td> <td style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;" valign="TOP"><div align="CENTER">3,890</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br><br>The foregoing results of revision and appreciation of ballots in the protested CPs, and the evidence of the parties indicate that protestee’s proclamation margin of 3,882 [votes] <b>increased</b> by <b>eight (8)</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote><br>On December 3, 2012, the HRET denied Chato’s motion for reconsideration to the Decision dated October 15, 2012.<br><br>Central to the resolution of the instant petition are the issues of whether or not the HRET committed grave abuse of discretion when it:<br><br>(a) disregarded the results of the physical count in the 69 CPs when the HRET had previously held that the integrity of the ballot boxes was preserved and that the results of the revision proceedings can be the bases to overturn those reflected in the election returns;<br><br>(b) resorted to the PIBs, regarded them as the equivalent of the paper ballots, and thereafter ruled that the integrity of the latter was doubtful;<br><br>(c) held that Chato had failed to prove by substantial evidence that the CF cards used in the May 10, 2010 elections were not preserved.<br><br>In support of the instant petition, Chato reiterates her allegations in the proceedings before the HRET.&nbsp; She stresses that in the Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> issued on April 10, 2012, the HRET ruled that as regards the conditions of the ballot boxes in Basud and Daet, the self-locking security seals and padlocks were attached and locked, hence, “there was substantial compliance with statutory safety measures to prevent reasonable opportunity for tampering with their contents x x x.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>&nbsp; Chato likewise argues that under Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9369,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> the May 10, 2010 Automated Election System was paper-based<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> and the PIBs are not the official ballots.&nbsp; Further, under Section 15 of R.A. No. 8436, what should be regarded as the official ballots are those printed by the National Printing Office (NPO) and/or the <i>Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas</i> (BSP), or by private printers contracted by the COMELEC in the event that the NPO and the BSP both certify that they cannot meet the printing requirements.&nbsp; Chato once again referred to the statements allegedly made by Atty. Cortez, Averia and Panotes himself to prove that serious doubt exists relative to the integrity of the CF cards used in the May 10, 2010 elections.<br><br>Panotes refutes the foregoing in his Comment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> to the instant petition. He points out that in <i>Liwayway Vinzons-Chato v. HRET and Elmer Panotes,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> we sustained the PIBs as the functional equivalent of paper ballots, thus, they may be used for revision purposes.&nbsp; Further, the HRET had categorically ruled in the herein assailed decision that the physical ballots were altered or tampered, hence, not reflective of the true will of the electorate.&nbsp; Besides, Chato’s electoral protest was flimsily anchored on the alleged missing CF card in CP No. 44 of Daet.&nbsp; Panotes emphasizes that the CF card had already been retrieved. Even if it were not found, there are 14 CPs in Daet and one incident of a missing CF card cannot create a strong presumption that all such cards in the entire Second District of Camarines Norte had been tampered.<br><br>There is no merit in the instant petition.<br><br>Chato posits that since the HRET, in its Order dated April 10, 2012, had already considered the conditions of the ballot boxes as indicative of having substantially complied with “statutory safety measures to prevent reasonable opportunity for tampering with their contents”,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> its subsequent disregard of the results of the physical count in the 69 CPs in Daet and Basud was tainted with grave abuse of discretion.<br><br>We do not agree.<br><br>It bears stressing that the HRET’s Order dated April 10, 2012 was issued to resolve Panotes’ motion to suspend the continuance of the revision proceedings in 75% of the contested CPs.&nbsp; The HRET’s findings then anent the integrity of the ballot boxes were at the most, preliminary in nature.&nbsp; The HRET was in no way estopped from subsequently holding otherwise after it had the opportunity to exhaustively observe and examine in the course of the entire revision proceedings the conditions of all the ballot boxes and their contents, including the ballots themselves, the MOV, SOVs and ERs.<br><br>We need not belabor the second and third issues raised herein as the same had been resolved in the following wise in <i>Liwayway Vinzons-Chato v.

No. 9369 defines “official ballot” <b>where AES</b> [Automated Election System] <b>is utilized</b> as the “paper ballot, whether printed or generated by the technology applied, that faithfully captures or represents the votes cast by a voter recorded or to be recorded in electronic form.”<br><br>x x x x<br><br>[T]he May 10, 2010 elections used a paper-based technology that allowed voters to fill out an official paper ballot by shading the oval opposite the names of their chosen candidates. Each voter was then required to personally feed his ballot into the Precinct Count Optical Scan (PCOS) machine which scanned both sides of the ballots simultaneously, meaning, in just one pass.&nbsp; <u>As established during the required demo tests, the system captured the images of the ballots in encrypted format which, when decrypted for verification, were found to be digitized representations of the ballots cast.</u><br><br><u>As such, the printouts thereof [PIBs] are the functional equivalent of the paper ballots filled out by the voters and, thus, may be used for purposes of revision of votes in an electoral protest.</u><br><br>x x x x<br><br>x x x [T]he HRET found Chato’s evidence insufficient. <u>The testimonies of the witnesses she presented were declared irrelevant and immaterial as they did not refer to the CF cards used in the 20 precincts in the Municipalities of Basud and Daet with substantial variances x x x.</u><br><br><u>To substitute our own judgment to the findings of the HRET will doubtless constitute an intrusion into its domain and a curtailment of its power to act of its own accord on its evaluation of the evidentiary weight of testimonies presented before it. Thus, for failure of Chato to discharge her burden of proving that the integrity of the questioned cards had not been preserved, no further protestations to the use of the picture images of the ballots as stored in the CF cards should be entertained</u>.&nbsp; (Citations omitted)</blockquote><br>Chato attempts to convince us that the integrity of the physical ballots was preserved, while that of the CF cards was not. As mentioned above, the integrity of the CF cards is already a settled matter.&nbsp; Anent that of the physical ballots, this is a factual issue which calls for a re-calibration of evidence.&nbsp; Generally, we do not resolve factual questions unless the decision, resolution or order brought to us for review can be shown to have been rendered or issued with grave abuse of discretion.<br><br>In <i>Dueñas, Jr. v. HRET</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> we defined grave abuse of discretion, viz:<br><br><blockquote>It is such capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment which is tantamount to lack of jurisdiction.&nbsp; Ordinary abuse of discretion is insufficient.&nbsp; The abuse of discretion must be grave, that is, the power is exercised in an arbitrary or despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility.&nbsp; It must be so patent and gross as to amount to evasion of positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined by or to act at all in contemplation of the law.&nbsp; In other words, for a petition for <i>certiorari</i> to prosper, there must be a clear showing of caprice and arbitrariness in the exercise of discretion.&nbsp; There is also grave abuse of discretion when there is a contravention of the Constitution, the law or existing jurisprudence. x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>&nbsp; (Citation omitted)</blockquote><br>In the case at bar, the HRET disposed of Chato’s electoral protest without grave abuse of discretion.&nbsp; The herein assailed decision and resolution were rendered on the bases of existing evidence and records presented before the HRET.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE, IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING</b>, the instant petition is <b>DISMISSED</b> for lack of merit.&nbsp; The Decision dated October 15, 2012 and Resolution dated December 3, 2012 of the House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal in HRET Case No. 10-040 (EP) are <b>AFFIRMED</b>.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">SO ORDERED.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Sereno, C.J., Carpio,&nbsp; Leonardo-De Castro, Del Castillo, Abad, Villarama, Jr., Perez, Mendoza, Perlas-Bernabe</span>, and<span style="font-style: italic;"> Leonen, JJ.</span>, concur. <br><span style="font-style: italic;">Velasco, Jr., J.</span>, no part due to participation in HRET.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Brion, J.</span>, no part, previous HRET member.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Peralta</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Bersamin, JJ</span>., no part, member of HRET.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>, pp. 3-54.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Id. at 55-87.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Id. at 116.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Chato named Daet, Vinzons, Basud and Mercedes as the four towns where irregularities allegedly took place.
