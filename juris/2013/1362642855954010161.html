The pertinent portions of the Informations, both dated June 15, 2004, are hereby quoted as follows:<br><br><blockquote><i>Criminal Case No. 056-07-2004:</i><br><br>That on or about the 15<sup>th</sup> day of June 2004, Purok 6, Barangay Poblacion, Tubod, Lanao del Norte, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, without being authorized by law did, then and there willfully and feloniously sell and deliver one (1) Deck of Methamphetamine Hydrochloride or SHABU weighing more or less 0.1 gram to a Police Poseur/Buyer in the amount of P200.00, said accused knowing the same to be Methamphetamine Hydrochloride or SHABU, a dangerous [drug].<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br><i>Criminal Case No. 057-07-2004:</i><br><br>That on or about the 15<sup>th</sup> day of June 2004, Purok 6, Barangay Poblacion, Tubod, Lanao del Norte, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, without being authorized by law did, then and there willfully and feloniously have in his possession and control Three (3) Decks of Methamphetamine Hydrochloride or SHABU weighing more or less 0.4 [grams], said accused knowing the same to be Methamphetamine Hydrochloride or SHABU, a dangerous [drug].<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></blockquote><br>Manalao pleaded not guilty to both charges upon his arraignment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> on August 9, 2004.<br><br>During the pre-trial conference, the parties agreed on a joint trial of the cases as filed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>During the trial, the prosecution put on the witness stand Senior Police Inspector Mary Leocy Jabonillo Mag-abo, the Forensic Chemist who conducted the qualitative examination of the items seized from Manalao;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> and Police Officer 1 (PO1) Michael Solarta, a detached member of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) assigned with the Provincial Intelligence and Investigation Division of the Philippine National Police (PNP) in Pigcarangan, Tubod, Lanao del Norte, who was part of the team that conducted the buy-bust operation against Manalao.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>PO1 Solarta said that their office had received reports of Manalao’s drug pushing and using activities in the area of Poblacion, Tubod, Lanao del Norte. Thus, upon instructions of their Officer-in-Charge,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Police Inspector (P/Insp.) Renato Salazar, they prepared to conduct an entrapment or buy-bust operation against Manalao. PO1 Solarta narrated that on June 15, 2004, the buy-bust operation team composed of P/Insp. Salazar, Senior Police Officer 3 (SPO3) Expedito Daulong, and himself, prepared two P100.00 bills as drug money by having them signed by P/Insp. Salazar and then photocopying them. At around seven in the evening, the team, together with a civilian agent who was to act as the poseur-buyer, proceeded to the <i>carenderia</i> of Josephine Tamarong, located along the national highway, Poblacion, Tubod, Lanao del Norte. At the <i>carenderia</i>, the team pretended to be customers and had some coffee while waiting for Manalao, who arrived at around 8:00 p.m. PO1 Solarta, who claimed to have been only around three to four meters away from the scene, testified that when Manalao arrived, the civilian agent immediately established contact with him. Following a brief conversation, the civilian agent handed Manalao the buy-bust money and in turn, Manalao “got something from his pocket, opened it, and gave something” to the civilian agent. After the “give and take” transaction, the civilian agent approached the buy-bust team, who without delay arrested Manalao. During the arrest, the buy-bust team introduced themselves to Manalao and bodily searched him, from which three decks of <i>shabu</i> and money, including the buy-bust money of two pieces of P100.00 bills, were recovered. Manalao, together with the items seized from him, were brought to the police station. Thereafter, P/Insp. Salazar marked the seized items in front of the other apprehending officers and Manalao. PO1 Solarta, aside from narrating his account of the entrapment operation, also identified the certificate of inventory of the items seized from Manalao, which he enumerated to be one deck of <i>shabu</i>, three decks of <i>shabu</i>, two P100.00 bills, and one small, black and white, lady’s purse. He likewise identified the <i>shabu</i> presented in court to be the same one recovered from Manalao and examined by Forensic Chemist Mag-abo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>For the defense, Manalao testified that it was on June 9, 2004 and not June 15, 2004 that he was arrested. He claimed that in the evening of June 9, 2004, he went to take his supper at a restaurant at Purok 6, Tubod, Lanao del Norte. Before he could enter the restaurant, his friend, Paquito Pido, along with two more companions, arrived. His nephew likewise arrived. Manalao said that his nephew was asking for money, thus he requested Paquito to have his P500.00 bill changed into smaller bills. Paquito did so, but in return, he asked Manalao to hand a wrapped item to a certain Mr. Posadas, who at that time was shouting from a distance. Manalao obliged Paquito, who by then had already left with his companions towards Poblacion. Five minutes later, Manalao saw P/Insp. Salazar’s vehicle approaching, who after passing by him, alighted from the vehicle together with PO1 Solarta. Thereafter, Manalao said that he was cuffed, brought to the police station, and then frisked. Manalao then admitted that more than P600.00 was taken from him, including the P500.00 Paquito had changed into P100.00 bills.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>On July 26, 2005, the RTC convicted Manalao in a Consolidated Decision on Criminal Case Nos. 056-07-0224 and 057-07-2004, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the Court finds accused MALIK MANALAO y ALAUYA guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime in violation of Section 5, Article II, of Republic Act No. 9165, otherwise known as Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002, and sentences him to a penalty of Life Imprisonment and to pay a fine of P500,000.00, without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency. And accused is also found guilty beyond reasonable doubt [of] having violated Section 11, Article II, of the same Act, and imposes upon him the indeterminate penalty of imprisonment of Six (6) Years and One (1) Day of Prision Mayor as minimum to Twelve (12) Years and One (1) Day of Reclusion Temporal as maximum, and as fine of P300,000.00, without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency.

The Court of Appeals was not persuaded, and on November 27, 2008, it affirmed <i>in toto</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> the RTC in its Decision in CA-G.R. CR.-H.C.

Manalao contends that the civilian agent who posed as the buyer should have been presented in court because PO1 Solarta, the only one who testified to witnessing the buying and selling of the <i>shabu</i>, did not even see what the civilian agent supposedly bought from him as PO1 Solarta could only see Manalao giving “something” to the civilian agent, as he said so during his testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Manalao also claims that the buy-bust team did not follow the proper procedure in the custody and control of seized drugs as they failed to mark, make an inventory, and photograph the confiscated drugs immediately and at the place of the incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br><center><b><i>This Court’s Ruling</i></b><br></center><br>This Court has reviewed with scrutiny the records of the case and has found no reason to overturn the courts <i>a quo</i>.<br><br>Manalao was charged and convicted for the sale and possession of dangerous drugs in violation of Sections 5 and 11, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165 or the Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002.

and<br>(2) [T]he delivery of the thing sold and the payment therefor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> (Citation omitted.)</blockquote><br>Simply put, the prosecution must establish that the illegal sale of the dangerous drugs actually took place together with the presentation in court of the <i>corpus delicti </i>or the dangerous drugs seized in evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>It is clear from the records that the prosecution was able to establish the above elements.<br><br>Manalao was positively identified by PO1 Solarta, who knew him even before the operation, as the one who sold the seized <i>shabu</i> subject of this case to the poseur-buyer. Manalao was caught<i> in flagrante delicto</i> in the entrapment operation conducted by the PNP of Tubod, Lanao del Norte. Moreover, the <i>corpus delicti </i>of the crime was also established with certainty and conclusiveness. Manalao handed to the poseur-buyer one deck of shabu upon his receipt of the P200.00 buy-bust money. In <i>People v. Legaspi</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> this Court said:<br><br><blockquote>The delivery of the contraband to the poseur-buyer and the receipt by the seller of the marked money successfully consummated the buy-bust transaction between the entrapping officers and Legaspi. (Citation omitted.)</blockquote><br>Manalao’s insistence that the non-presentation of the civilian agent, who posed as the buyer, weakens the prosecution’s case is without merit. In <i>People v. Berdadero</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> this Court, presented with the exact query, held:<br><br><blockquote>The appellant’s final contention that the failure to present the poseur-buyer is fatal and entitles him to an acquittal, again fails to impress.&nbsp; The non-presentation of the poseur-buyer is fatal only if there is no other eyewitness to the illicit transaction. The testimonies of PO3 Balmes and PO2 Villas sufficiently established that the appellant is guilty of selling a dangerous drug.&nbsp; Their referral to the <i>shabu</i> handed by the appellant to the poseur-buyer as “something” merely indicates that at the time of the sale, they could only presume that the specimen sold by the appellant was <i>shabu</i> since they were conducting a buy-bust operation.&nbsp; They still had to submit the specimen to the crime laboratory for testing which later tested positive for <i>shabu</i>.&nbsp; Thus, the fact that the poseur-buyer was not presented does not weaken the evidence for the prosecution. (Citation omitted.)</blockquote><br>This Court would also like to emphasize the fact that Manalao himself testified that when the police officers recovered some money from him, P/Insp. Salazar, immediately, without leaving his sight, took out the photocopy of the buy-bust money and told him to compare it to the two P100.00 bills found on him.26 Manalao admitted, both in his direct and cross-examination, that the serial numbers of the bills obtained from him matched the serial numbers of the bills in the photocopy.27 Moreover, while he claimed that he only had P500.00 with him, with P400.00 meant for his nephew and P100.00 meant for him, he contradicted himself by saying that the police officers recovered more than P600.00 of his money on his person.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br><center><b><i>Chain of Custody of Evidence</i></b></center><br>Paragraph 1, Section 21, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165 outlines the procedure on the chain of custody of confiscated, seized, or surrendered dangerous drugs, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 21. <i>Custody and Disposition of Confiscated, Seized, and/or Surrendered Dangerous Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous Drugs, Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, Instruments/Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment. </i>– The PDEA shall take charge and have custody of all dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, as well as instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment so confiscated, seized and/or surrendered, for proper disposition in the following manner:<br><br>(1) The apprehending team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof[.]</blockquote><br>The foregoing is implemented by Section 21(a), Article II of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of Republic Act No. 9165, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 21. <i>Custody and Disposition of Confiscated, Seized and/or Surrendered Dangerous Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous Drugs, Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, Instruments/Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment. —</i> The PDEA shall take charge and have custody of all dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, as well as instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment so confiscated, seized and/or surrendered, for proper disposition in the following manner:<br><br>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp; The apprehending officer/team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof: Provided, that the physical inventory and photograph shall be conducted at the place where the search warrant is served; or at the nearest police station or at the nearest office of the apprehending officer/team, whichever is practicable, in case of warrantless seizures;<b> Provided, further, that non-compliance with these requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and invalid such seizures of and custody over said items</b>[.] (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>A perusal of the law reveals that failure to strictly comply with Section 21 of Republic Act No. 9165 will not render an arrest illegal or the items seized from the accused inadmissible in evidence. What is crucial is that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are preserved for they will be used in the determination of the guilt or innocence of the accused.29<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[]</sup><br><br>In <i>People v. Llanita and Buar</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> this Court elucidated on the concept of “chain of custody” and, quoting <i>People v.

Such record of movements and custody of seized item shall include the identity and signature of the person who held temporary custody of the seized item, the date and time when such transfer of custody was made in the course of safekeeping and use in court as evidence, and the final disposition.<br><br>In the case of <i>People v. Kamad</i>, the Court had the opportunity to enumerate the different links that the prosecution must prove in order to establish the chain of custody in a buy-bust operation, namely:<br><br><i>First</i>, the seizure and marking, if practicable, of the illegal drug recovered from the accused by the apprehending officer;<br><br><i>Second</i>, the turnover of the illegal drug seized by the apprehending officer to the investigating officer;<br><br><i>Third</i>, the turnover by the investigating officer of the illegal drug to the forensic chemist for laboratory examination; and<br><br><i>Fourth</i>, the turnover and submission of the marked illegal drug seized by the forensic chemist to the court. (Citations omitted.)</blockquote><br>In the case at bar, the Court finds that the prosecution was able to establish that the integrity and evidentiary value of the confiscated illegal drugs had been maintained. P/Insp. Salazar, who was one of the apprehending officers, marked the seized items in front of Manalao and the other apprehending officers. P/Insp. Salazar, who was also the investigating officer, thereafter signed a request for the laboratory examination of the seized drugs, which was received by Forensic Chemist Mag-abo, together with the items enumerated therein. She then testified in open court on how her examination confirmed that the seized items, which she submitted in court, tested positive for shabu.<br><br>Besides, unless there is a showing of bad faith, ill will, or proof that the evidence has been tampered or meddled with, the presumptions that the integrity of such evidence had been preserved and that the police officers who handled the seized drugs had discharged their duties properly and with regularity remain.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> The burden to overcome such presumptions lies on Manalao, and this Court finds that he failed to do so.<br><br><center><i><b>Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs</b></i>&nbsp; </center><br>When prosecuting an illegal possession of dangerous drugs case, the following elements must be established: (1) the accused is in possession of an item or object, which is identified to be a prohibited drug; (2) such possession is not authorized by law; and (3) the accused freely and consciously possessed the drug.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>The prosecution was able to satisfy all the foregoing elements during the joint trial of the cases. The three decks of <i>shabu</i> subject of the case for illegal possession of drugs were validly obtained upon searching Manalao after he was arrested <i>in flagrante delicto </i>for the illegal sale of dangerous drugs. The following section in Rule 126 of the Rules of Court provides:<br><br><blockquote><b>Section 13</b>. <i>Search incident to lawful arrest.</i> — A person lawfully arrested may be searched for dangerous weapons or anything which may have been used or constitute proof in the commission of an offense without a search warrant.</blockquote><br>Mere possession of a prohibited drug, without legal authority, is punishable under Republic Act No. 9165.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Since Manalao failed to adduce any evidence showing that he had legal authority to possess the seized drugs, then he was correctly charged with its illegal possession.<br><br>We have time and again looked upon the defense of denial with disfavor for being easily fabricated.
