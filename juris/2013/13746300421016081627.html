				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an appeal filed by herein accused Benedict Homaky Lucio (Lucio) from the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) affirming the decision of conviction rendered by the Regional Trial Court, Branch 61 of Baguio City for violation of Sections 5 and 11, Article II of Republic Act (R.A.) No . 9165.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br><center><b><u>Factual Antecedents</u></b></center><br>The prosecution presented a buy-bust case.<br><br>On 31 March 2004, at around 7:00 o’clock in the evening, a male informant went to the office of Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency-Cordillera Administrative Region (PDEA-CAR) in Baguio City to give information regarding an illegal sale or distribution of dangerous drugs, particularly dried marijuana being done in Barangay Lucnab, Baguio City by a couple identified as Wilma and Ben. Upon receiving this information, PO1 Cesario Castro (PO1 Castro), then on-duty as a member of PDEA-CAR, immediately referred the informant to his senior officers, Police Senior Inspectors Edgar S. Apalla (PSI Apalla) and Paul John Mencio (PSI Mencio).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>&nbsp; PSI Apalla and PSI Mencio interviewed the informant regarding the alleged illegal activities of the couple. Giving merit to the statement of the informant, PSI Apalla and PSI Mencio decided to conduct a buy-bust operation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Thereafter, a buy-bust team was formed composed of PO1 Castro, as the poseur-buyer, SPO4 Arthur Lucas (SPO4 Lucas) as the arresting officer, Officer Lito Labbutan (Officer Labbutan) as the seizing officer and PO1 Harold Estacio (PO1 Estacio) as the back-up officer. Correlative to his duty as poseur-buyer, PO1 Castro was given two (2) pieces of five hundred peso (P500.00) bill marked money by PSI Apalla to be used in buying marijuana from the couple.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>&nbsp; PO1 Castro then placed his initials in the marked money and gave it to PO3 Dorotheo T. Supa (PO3 Supa) for the purpose of writing the details of the money in the blotter of Police Precint 3, Pacdal, Baguio City and coordinating the PDEA’s buy-bust operation with the police.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>At around 8:15 in the evening, the members of the buy-bust team, together with the informant proceeded to the area of operation in Barangay Lucnab, Baguio City on board the PDEA’s service vehicle.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>&nbsp; Upon arrival, the informant led PO1 Castro to the shanty of the couple, while the back-up police officers followed from behind.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>&nbsp; The informant then called for the name Ben several times.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>&nbsp; A male individual came out from the shanty and asked what their business was.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>&nbsp; Both standing in front of the door, the informant introduced PO1 Castro to Ben (identified as the accused Benedict Homaky Lucio during trial) as a taxi driver from Manila interested in buying marijuana to be transported back to Manila.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Afterwards, PO1 Castro and Lucio transacted which led to the latter’s offer that he was selling the marijuana brick for P1000.00 each. Lucio further offered that he would sell the brick for P800.00 each if PO1 Castro would buy at least five (5) bricks. PO1 Castro then asked for a sample to determine the quality of the marijuana which prompted Lucio to ask his female companion Wilma Padillo Tomas (Wilma) to get one inside. Upon examination of the brick handed by Wilma, PO1 Castro requested Lucio and Wilma if he could see other samples.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Lucio heeded to his request and allowed him to go inside and look for something of bigger size. Inside the shanty, PO1 Castro noticed a white nylon sack just behind the door with marijuana bricks inside.&nbsp; Lucio pointed at the nylon sack and asked if he can choose the brick he wanted.&nbsp; PO1 Castro examined one from the sack but opted to choose the one given by Wilma. During this time, the informant only entered half of his body to observe the transaction while Wilma stood in the middle of the half-opened door.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>&nbsp; Afterwards, Lucio and PO1 Castro went out in order to examine the brick because the shanty was only lighted by a candle. PO1 Castro decided to buy one (1) brick of marijuana from the accused and handed the two (2) five hundred bills to Lucio as payment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>After handling the money, he then switched off his flashlight several times as his pre-arranged signal that transaction has been consummated. Immediately thereafter, the arresting and back-up officers hiding from behind approached them and arrested Lucio and Wilma. The officers then informed the couple that they were being arrested for selling marijuana and informed them of their constitutional rights in Tagalog and Ilocano.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Lucio immediately denied ownership of the marijuana bricks.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp; A body search was conducted against Lucio and the marked money, still being held by him, was recovered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>&nbsp; Thereafter the officers confiscated the sack containing the marijuana bricks and made an inventory of the bricks inside the shanty in the presence of the couple<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> which yielded thirty six (36) marijuana bricks on initial count, thirty (35) bricks inside the sack and one (1) brick sold to PO1 Castro.<br><br>Lucio and Wilma, together with the confiscated marijuana bricks, were brought by the arresting officers to the PDEA Office for proper documentation and identification.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Inside the office, PO1 Castro then put his initial “<i>GCPC</i>,” signature “<i>GCP Castro</i>” and the date on the marijuana brick sold to him as well as on the confiscated 35 marijuana bricks.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Other members of the buy-bust team also affixed their initials on the bricks for proper identification as evidenced by the markings “LPL” as the initial of Officer Labbutan as the seizing officer, “<i>HPE</i>” as the initial of PO1 Estacio as the back-up element and “<i>AAL</i>” as the initial of SPO4 Lucas as the arresting officer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>&nbsp; Inside the office, a recounting of the confiscated bricks was done in the presence of the Prosecutor E. Sagsago, the buy-bust team, the Barangay Officials and media personalities who thereafter affixed their signatures on the Inventory of the Seized Item<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> prepared in relation to the operation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>&nbsp; Thereafter, the seized marijuana bricks were sent to the PNP Crime Laboratory Service-CAR for laboratory examination. The laboratory examination conducted by Forensic Officer Emilia Gracio Montes yielded positive results for marijuana, a dangerous drug on all the thirty-five bricks tested.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>The other prosecution witnesses SPO4 Lucas and Officer Labbutan corroborated the statements of PO1 Castro on materials points.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>The defense interposed frame-up.<br><br>On his part, accused Lucio denied both illegal sale and possession of marijuana bricks that occurred on 31 March 2004 at Lucnab, Baguio City. He testified that on 28 March 2004, he met his uncle Alex Accatan (Alex), a cousin of his father, at the trading post at Km. 5, La Trinidad, Benguet. He was there with his live-in partner Wilma to bring vegetables; while Alex was there to get some vegetables for his pigs. During the course of their conversation, Alex told him and Wilma that he has a house located at Lucnab, Baguio City and invited them to come on 31 March 2004 as his son will be graduating from elementary education.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> For them to know how they can reach the house on the 31st, Alex asked them go with him on that day to his residence. At around 3:00 in the afternoon, they all went to Alex’s house as planned where the couple met for the first time Alex’s wife. After a brief talk, Lucio and Wilma went back to their residence at Bugias, Ifugao.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>On 31 March 2004, Lucio and Wilma went to the house of Alex as requested and arrived there at around 4:30 in the afternoon. Upon arrival, Lucio was told by his uncle’s minor child that Alex went to Teacher’s Camp. As it was already getting late, Lucio called his uncle through his cellular phone and was told by the latter that they can spend the night at the house of his neighbor identified as Kollit. This Kollit, as told by his uncle, permitted them to use the house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> He was then instructed to get the key from his uncle’s daughter Arlene Accatan (Arlene).&nbsp; Lucio and Wilma proceeded to the house of Kollit to rest but left their small bag inside the house of Alex.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>While resting inside, somebody knocked at the door and shouted the name, “Kollit, Kollit.” Lucio answered that Kollit was not there but the persons outside responded by kicking the door open and entered the house. These persons inquiring about Kollit introduced themselves as policemen and asked about marijuana. When the accused denied any knowledge, these policemen, whom he noticed as armed, searched the room and recovered a sack under the bed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Afterwards, Lucio was handcuffed to the left hand of PO1 Estacio and was brought to another house located below the place of Kollit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>&nbsp; The policemen inquired again about Kollit and destroyed the door of the second house adjacent to the first house where Lucio and Wilma were resting.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; Thereafter, the couple were brought to the PDEA Office where they were told that marijuana was recovered from them. They denied ownership of the marijuana found inside the sack and reiterated their plea that they were only allowed to sleep inside the house of Kollit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Lucio and Wilma were brought to the Baguio General Hospital for physical examination. Upon their return to the PDEA Office, the PDEA Officers then called a media representative, a member of the Department of Justice and a <i>barangay</i> official for inventory witnessing. Afterwards, pictures of the sack allegedly recovered from them together with the two pieces of five hundred peso (P500.00) bill were taken.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Alex corroborated the testimony of Lucio that he invited him and his companion Wilma into his house on 31 March 2004 when they met at the trading post on 28 March 2004.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>&nbsp; He narrated that when Lucio called him, he was doubtful if the latter was already at his residence or just on his way. Alex told Lucio that if he would still be going, there might be several visitors in his home at that time. He added that he can get the key of his neighbor’s house from his daughter Arlene. He identified the name of his neighbor Kullit<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> as Arthur Basilan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Upon returning home, he was surprised to know that Lucio was arrested by policemen and was being investigated for a sack of marijuana allegedly taken from him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Another witness for the defense is Martisio Paguli, the Barangay Chairman of Lucnab, Baguio City. He testified that at around 9:00 in the morning of 1 April 2004, he received a message that somebody was arrested in his <i>purok</i>. He then proceeded to the PDEA Office and was asked by PSI Mencio to identify Lucio and Wilma. He replied that he did not know them and that was the first time he saw the two accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> He was able to talk to Lucio who informed him of his name and that the purpose of his visit to Lucnab was to attend the graduation of Alex’s son.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>&nbsp; He also identified that a certain Arthur Basilan owned the house where Lucio and Wilma were arrested.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>Wilma and Arlene, daughter of Alex, were also presented to corroborate the testimony of Lucio regarding the real circumstances of what transpired on 31 March 2004.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>Lucio and Wilma were eventually charged with Illegal Sale and Possession of Dangerous Drugs punishable under Sections 5 and 11 of Article II of R.A. No. 9165. Two sets of information were eventually filed by the Office of the Prosecutor of Baguio City. The accusatory portion of the Information in violation of Section 5 of Article II of R.A. No. 9165 reads:<br><br><blockquote><center>Criminal Case No. 22910-R<br></center><br>That on or about the 31st day of March, 2004, in the City of Baguio, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused [referring to Lucio and Wilma] conspiring, confederating and mutually aiding one another and without the authority of law, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously sell, distribute and/or deliver one (1) brick of dried marijuana leaves, weighing 741.7 grams for One Thousand Pesos (P1,000.00), Philippine Currency, to PO1 Gil Cesario P. Castro, a member of the PNP who acted as poseur buyer, knowing fully well that said dried marijuana leaves, is a dangerous drug, in violation of the aforementioned provision of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br></blockquote><br>On the other hand, the accusatory portion of the Information in violation of Section 11 of Article II of R.A. No. 9165 reads:<br><br><blockquote><center>Criminal Case No. 22911-R</center><br>That on or about the 31<sup>st</sup> day of March, 2004, in the City of Baguio, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused [referring to Lucio and Wilma] conspiring, confederating and mutually aiding one another and without the authority of law, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have in their possession and control thirty five (35) bricks of dried marijuana leaves with approximate total weight of twenty four (24) kilos, a dangerous drug, without the corresponding license or prescription, in violation of the aforecited provision of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></blockquote><br>When arraigned, both accused pleaded not guilty to the offenses charged.<br><br><center><b><u>Ruling of the Trial Court</u></b></center><br>The trial court on 12 December 2006 rendered a decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> the dispositive portion reads:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, judgment is rendered finding the accused Benedict Homaky Lucio <b>GUILTY</b> beyond reasonable doubt in both cases and he is sentenced to suffer Life Imprisonment in <u>each case</u> and likewise to pay a fine of P500,000.00 in <u>each case</u> and the costs.<br><br>The accused Wilma Padillo Tomas is <b>ACQUITTED</b> in both cases on grounds of reasonable doubt and she is hereby <b>ORDERED RELEASED</b> from the custody unless being held for some other offense requiring her continued detention.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></blockquote><br>The trial court justified the guilty verdict against Lucio as it was convinced that the elements of both illegal sale and possession of dangerous drug were sufficiently established by the prosecution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>&nbsp; It also recognized the credibility of the testimonies of the police officers pertaining to the buy-bust operation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> and the positive identification of the accused as the seller of the bricks of marijuana.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br><center><b><u>Ruling of the Court of Appeals</u></b></center><br>The appellate court affirmed the ruling of the trial court, the dispositive portion<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 61, Baguio City, in Criminal Case Nos. 22910-R &amp; 22911-R finding appellant Benedict Homaky Lucio guilty of Violation of R.A. 9165 is AFFIRMED <i>in toto</i>.</blockquote><br>It ruled that all the elements of illegal sale and illegal possession of dangerous drug were proven by the prosecution. It also upheld the credibility of the witnesses and placed highest respect on the findings of facts of the trial court. It likewise disregarded the absence of surveillance or test buy prior to the buy-bust operation as well as the strict compliance of the requirements to establish chain of custody under Sec. 21 of R.A. No. 9165.<br><br><center><b><u>Our Ruling</u></b></center><br>After a careful review of the evidence, we affirm the ruling of conviction of both the trial court and CA.<br><br>In <i>People v. Llanita</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> citing <i>People v. Unisa</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> the Court ruled that in order to successfully prosecute an offense of illegal sale of dangerous drugs, like shabu, the following elements must first be established: (1) the identity of the buyer and the seller, the object and consideration of the sale; and (2) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment therefor.<br><br>In illegal sale, what the prosecution needs to present is proof that a transaction or sale actually took place, coupled with the presentation in court of evidence of the <i>corpus delicti</i>. The commission of illegal sale merely requires the consummation of the selling transaction, which happens the moment the buyer receives the drug from the seller. As long as the police officer went through the operation as a buyer, whose offer was accepted by appellant, followed by the delivery of the dangerous drugs to the former, the crime is already consummated. In this case, the prosecution has amply proven all the elements of the drugs sale with moral certainty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>Upon examination of the testimonies of PO1 Castro on both his direct and cross examinations, we are convinced of Lucio’s guilt on both charges.<br><br>The following narrates the course of buying and selling to constitute illegal sale:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Q:</div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">While you were transacting with the other accused Benedict Homaky Lucio where were you again situated?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Just infront of their shanty, Sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q:</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Who was beside you?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">The male Informant, Sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">x x x x</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">What was the gist of your conversation then with Benedict Lucio?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">We were transacting with the marijuana he was selling it for [P]1,000.00 per brick so during our conversation I made some bargain, Sir.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">x x x x</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br>His cross-examination supplants further details:<br><blockquote><br><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">And so after huddling (sic) you decided to buy just one (1) brick?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Yes, Sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">And you said that you delivered the buy-bust money to one of the accused?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Yes, Sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q:</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">How did you deliver it?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">I handed to him the two (2) 500.00 peso bills, Sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q:</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Where did he place it?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">He was holding it, Sir.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br>In this case, the police officers positively identified Lucio as the one who transacted and sold marijuana bricks to PO1 Castro in exchange of the marked money consisting of two (2) five hundred peso (P500.00) bills.&nbsp; As per Chemistry Report of Police Inspector Emilia Gracio Montese, the submitted items consisting of thirty five suspected marijuana bricks to the Benguet Provincial Crime Laboratory Office for examination yielded positive results for presence of dangerous drugs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup>&nbsp; The marijuana brick marked as Exhibit A was likewise presented in court with the proper identification by PO1 Castro.<br><br>Lucio’s conviction on illegal possession is likewise affirmed.&nbsp; To prosecute Lucio of illegal possession of dangerous drugs, there must be a showing that (1) the accused is in possession of an item or object which is identified to be a prohibited drug; (2) such possession is not authorized by law; and (3) the accused freely and consciously possessed the drug.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>It must be noted that possession of dangerous drugs constitutes <i>prima facie</i> evidence of knowledge or <i>animus possidendi</i>, which is sufficient to convict him, unless there is a satisfactory explanation of such possession. The burden of evidence is, thus, shifted to Lucio to explain the absence of knowledge or <i>animus possidendi</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> In this case, the illegal possession came about when Lucio allowed PO1Castro to look for other bricks inside the sack.

elements, Lucio was in possession of marijuana bricks identified to be prohibited drugs, such possession was not authorized by law and he freely and consciously possessed the said drugs.<br><br>In his appellant’s brief, Lucio questions the full credence given by the lower courts to the version of the prosecution despite their irregularities and inconsistencies. Among the lapses asserted was the lack of previous surveillance prior to the buy-bust operation. No test buy was conducted to confirm the truthfulness of the statements given by the informant which prompted the operation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>It must be stressed that prior surveillance is not a prerequisite for the validity of an entrapment operation.&nbsp; This issue in the prosecution of illegal drugs cases, again, has long been settled by this Court.&nbsp; We have been consistent in our ruling that prior surveillance is not required for a valid buy-bust operation, especially if the buy-bust team is accompanied to the target area by their informant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>In <i>People v.

PO1 Castro recalled that it was recovered from the hand of Lucio while PO1 Labbutan and SPO4 Lucas testified that the same was recovered from the pocket of the accused after a body search.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>We cannot sustain his argument.&nbsp; In order for a discrepancy or inconsistency between the testimonies of witnesses to serve as basis for acquittal, it must refer to significant facts vital to the guilt or innocence of the accused x x x.&nbsp; An inconsistency which has nothing to do with the elements of the crime cannot be a ground for the acquittal of the accused.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>As stated in <i>People v.

Further, in <i>People vs. Maglente</i>, this Court ruled that inconsistencies in details which are irrelevant to the elements of the crime are not grounds for acquittal. x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup></blockquote><br>In this case, the question as to what part of the body of the accused did the police officers recover the money does not dissolve the elements of illegal sale and possession as minor inconsistencies do not negate or dissolve the eyewitnesses’ positive identification of the appellant as the perpetrator of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> Minor inconsistencies in the narration of PO1 Castro, PO1 Labbutan and SPO4 Lucas do not detract from their essential credibility as long as their testimony on the whole is coherent and intrinsically believable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>The accused also put into issue the capacity of the back-up officers to witness the alleged transaction as the place was very dark and without electricity.
