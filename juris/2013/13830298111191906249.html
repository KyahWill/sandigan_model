Victoria, Jr. (<i>Daniel, Jr.</i>), in Land Registration Case (<i>LRC</i>) No. N-11489.<br><br><b><u>The Facts</u></b><br><br>On October 24, 2002, Belmonte filed before the RTC her Application for Registration and Confirmation of Titles of two (2) lots identified as Lot No. 3766, measuring around 5,817 square meters, and Lot No. 5194, with an approximate area of 7,123 square meters, located in Barangay Hagonoy and Barangay Bambang, Taguig City, respectively.<br><br>Daniel Victoria, Jr., Belmonte’s attorney-in-fact and younger sibling, alleged that Belmonte inherited the subject properties from Daniel Osorio Victoria and Rufina Cruz Victoria, their parents, as evidenced by an extrajudicial settlement of estate. He presented a photocopy of the said document claiming that the original copy got lost. Belmonte narrated that her parents had been in possession of the said lots since the Japanese occupation in 1943. Accordingly, she attached the following documents in support of her application for registration:<br><blockquote><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><b><u>Lot No. 3766</u></b><br></div><ol type="a"><li>Approved Conversion Plan for Swo-00-001613;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br></li><li>Technical Description of Lot No. 3766;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br></li><li>Geodetic Engineer’s Certificate;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br></li><li>Tax Declaration No. EL-008-01718;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br></li><b><u><br>Lot No. 5194</u></b><br><br><li>Approved Conversion Plan Swo-00-001752;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br></li><li>Technical Description of Lot 5194-A;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br></li><li>Geodetic Engineer’s Certificate;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br></li><li>Tax Declaration No. FL-010-00581;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br></li><li>Extrajudicial Settlement of the Estate of the Deceased Daniel Osorio Victoria and Rufina Cruz Victoria;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br></li><br><li>Special Power of Attorney.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote>The OSG opposed the application arguing that Belmonte failed to comply with the jurisdictional requirements of Presidential Decree (<i>P.D.</i>) No. 1529.<br><br>On July 24, 2006, the RTC granted Belmonte’s application for registration of land title.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> It held that she was able to successfully establish her ownership over the lots in question and that the land sought to be registered was the same land described in her application for registration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Thus, the decretal portion of said decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS, judgment is hereby rendered granting the verified application for registration of land title under Property Registration Decree (P.D. 1529) filed by applicant Carmen Victoria Belmonte, represented by her Attorney-in-fact, Daniel C.

The CA explained that although Belmonte was not able to present the original tracing cloth plan, she sufficiently established the identity of the subject properties through the certified blueprint copies of the conversion plan, specifically: (1) Conversion Plan for Lot 3766 and (2) Conversion Plan of Lot 5194, which were prepared by Geodetic Engineer Emilia Rivera Sison and duly approved by the Department of Natural Resources Land Management Services. “The Conversion Plan for Lot 3766, was certified correct by Ernesto S. Erive, Chief, Regional Surveys Division and approved by Roquesta E. De Castro, Regional Technical Director on July 29, 1996. Similarly, the Conversion Plan of Lot 5194 was approved on December 18, 1996.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>The CA further stated that Belmonte successfully established the possession and occupation of her predecessors-in-interest since 1943. The CA gave credence to the testimonies of (1) Daniel, Jr. who disclosed that, before the Japanese invasion, he used to come with his mother to survey the lots and they had a tenant, Reyes; and (2) Marietta Reyes (Marietta) who narrated that, from the Japanese period up to 1967, her father-in-law cultivated the subject lots, which was continued by her husband up to 1995.<br><br>The OSG moved for a reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> but the motion was denied by the CA in its May 18, 2011 Resolution.<br><br>Hence, this petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>In advocacy of its position, the OSG submits this lone issue:<br><blockquote><b>THE RECORD IS BEREFT OF PROOF THAT PRIVATE RESPONDENT HAS BEEN IN OPEN, CONTINUOUS, EXCLUSIVE AND NOTORIOUS POSSESSION OF THE SUBJECT LAND SINCE JUNE 12, 1945, OR EARLIER.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br></blockquote>The OSG argued that Belmonte failed to prove open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession of the subject properties since June 12, 1945 or earlier. The tax declarations she submitted for the lots did not indicate possession since June 12, 1945 or earlier. The earliest tax declaration for Lot No. 5194 was dated 1949 and that for Lot No. 3766 only showed 1969. The OSG likewise called the attention of the Court to the fact that the payments of real estate taxes for the subject properties were intermittent. As to the size or the actual area of the subject properties, according to the OSG, there were discrepancies which created doubt as to the identities of the properties being sought to be registered. The OSG wrote that “[t]he tax declaration for Lot No. 3766 for the year 1966 describes the area as six thousand eighty four (6,084) square meters. However, the tax declarations for the year 1974, 1979, 1985, 1991 and 1994 show that the area is measured at six thousand eight hundred eighty four (6,884) square meters. Finally, for 1998, the tax declaration reflects an area of five thousand eight hundred seventeen (5,817) square meters.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>The crux of the controversy before the Court now is whether Belmonte has successfully proven possession and occupation since June 12, 1945.<br><br>As a rule, the Court, in a petition for review on certiorari, is limited to reviewing only errors of law, as it is not a trier of facts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> There are, however, exceptions to this rule such as when: (1) the conclusion is grounded on speculations, surmises or conjectures; (2) the inference is manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible; (3) there is grave abuse of discretion; (4) the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts; (5) the findings of fact are conflicting; (6) there is no citation of specific evidence on which the factual findings are based; (7) the findings of absence of facts are contradicted by the presence of evidence on record; (8) the findings of the Court of Appeals are contrary to those of the trial court; (9) the Court of Appeals manifestly overlooked certain relevant and undisputed facts that, if properly considered, would justify a different conclusion; (10) the findings of the Court of Appeals are beyond the issues of the case; and (11) such findings are contrary to the admissions of both parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>After a careful review of the records, the Court is of the considered view that the disputed decision should be revisited as it appears that the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> and the CA manifestly overlooked certain relevant and undisputed facts, that if properly considered, would warrant a different conclusion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>P.D. No. 1529<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> or the Property Registration Decree specifies who are qualified to apply for registration of land. In particular, Section 14(1) thereof in relation to Section 48(b) of Commonwealth Act 141, as amended by Section 4 of P.D.

The following described citizens of the Philippines, occupying lands of the public domain or claiming to own any such lands or an interest therein, but whose titles have not been perfected or completed, may apply to the Court of First Instance [now Regional Trial Court] of the province where the land is located for confirmation of their claims and the issuance of a certificate of title therefor, under the Land Registration Act, to wit:<br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br>(b) Those who by themselves or through their predecessors-in-interest have been in open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and occupation of agricultural lands of the public domain, under a <i>bona fide</i> claim of acquisition of ownership, <b>since June 12, 1945, or earlier,</b> immediately preceding the filing of the application for confirmation of title except when prevented by war or <i>force majeure</i>.

Possession and occupation alone, for 30 years or more, does not suffice. As provided in P.D. No. 1073, it is mandatory that possession and occupation of the piece of land by the applicant, by himself or through his predecessors-in-interest, had commenced on June 12, 1945 or earlier.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> The burden of proving adverse, continuous, open, and public possession in the concept of an owner rests upon the applicant, by no less than clear, positive and convincing evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>The earliest tax declaration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> that Belmonte showed for Lot No. 5194 was dated <b>1949</b>. Evidently, it falls short of the time requirement of possession since 1945 or earlier. More importantly, the Court cannot give any probative value to the 1949 tax declaration because the property was declared in the name of a certain Francisca Osorio (<i>Osorio</i>). Belmonte failed to establish the connection between Francisca Osorio and her father and predecessor-in-interest, Daniel Victoria (<i>Daniel</i>). Hence, the Court cannot tack the possession of Osorio, the name entered in the earliest tax declaration with that of Daniel, which was the name entered in later tax declarations. As to Lot No. 3766, records show that Belmonte’s predecessor-in-interest started declaring the property for tax purposes only in <b>1966</b>.<br><br>Furthermore, the Court has held that intermittent and sporadic assertion of alleged ownership does not prove open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession and occupation. In this case, Belmonte’s irregular and erratic declaration and payment of real property taxes belie her claim of open and continuous possession of the said lots.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>Corollarily, tax declarations are merely <i>indicia</i> of a claim of ownership.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> The subject lots may have been declared for taxation purposes in the name of Belmonte’s predecessor-in-interest, but it does not automatically prove ownership especially when the details in the tax declarations do not match. As aptly observed by the OSG, some tax declarations contain discrepancies in the area. With regard to Lot No. 3766, several tax declarations indicated the area as measuring 5,817 sq.m., while the other tax declarations showed the area as 6,884 sq.m. With Lot No. 5194, some tax declarations stated an area of 7,123 sq.m., while others had 4,235 sq.m. These inconsistencies coupled by the erratic declarations for tax, in the absence of other competent evidence, negate open and continuous possession in the concept of an owner.<br><br>As to the requirement of possession and occupation, the Court is likewise of the view that these prerequisites were not sufficiently established. It is undisputed that Belmonte resides outside the country and is not in actual possession of the said lots. Daniel, Jr. testified that his sister, Belmonte, had a tenant who cultivated the land on her behalf. To establish the tenancy, a certain Marietta took the witness stand to corroborate his statement. She was allegedly the widow of the land’s previous tenant. Unfortunately, her testimony was not persuasive enough to prove the open and notorious possession and occupation of Belmonte over the disputed lots. She did not even know the sharing arrangement between her husband and Belmonte as tenant and landlord.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> She was not able to describe how her husband tended the subject lots. Other equally relevant details as to what crops were planted, the frequency of crop planting and harvest or how her husband and his ancestors took care of the land on behalf of Belmonte were not supplied. Evidence to be acceptable must be credible, substantial and satisfactory. General, and often vague, statements as to how Belmonte, through her supposed tenant, possessed the land in question, are mere verbal assertions that do not satisfy possession and occupation as required by law. <i>Republic v. Alconaba</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> explained the indispensable requirement of possession and occupation in this manner:<br><blockquote>The law speaks of possession and occupation. Since these words are separated by the conjunction and, the clear intention of the law is not to make one synonymous with the other. Possession is broader than occupation because it includes constructive possession. When, therefore, the law adds the word occupation, it seeks to delimit the all encompassing effect of constructive possession. Taken together with the words open, continuous, exclusive and notorious, the word occupation serves to highlight the fact that for an applicant to qualify, his possession must not be a mere fiction. Actual possession of a land consists in the manifestation of acts of dominion over it of such a nature as a party would naturally exercise over his own property.<br></blockquote>Assuming <i>arguendo</i> that somebody cultivated the land, mere casual cultivation of the land does not amount to exclusive and notorious possession that would give rise to ownership.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> Except as to the self-serving declaration made by Marietta, no other evidence was shown by Belmonte to substantiate her statements.<br><br>Moreover, Daniel, Jr. admitted that he did not know the sharing arrangement between Belmonte and the supposed tenant, creating a cloud of doubt as to whether there was really a tenancy at all. He even conceded that the subject properties were, at that time, idle which admission, all the more weakens Belmonte’s claim of possession in the concept of an owner. Vital portions of Daniel, Jr.’s testimony are herein reproduced:<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%"><div align="justify">Atty.
