On May 28, 2005, the respondents arrived in Manila.&nbsp; On June 10, 2005, the respondents received the settlement pay under their letter of acceptance.&nbsp; The respondents then signed a waiver and quitclaim<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> and the corresponding cash vouchers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>On November 16, 2005, the respondents filed a complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> before the Labor Arbitration Branch of the NLRC, National Capital Region for illegal termination of employment with prayer for the payment of their salaries for the unexpired portion of their contracts; and for non-payment of salaries, overtime pay and vacation leave pay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>&nbsp; The respondents also prayed for moral and exemplary damages and attorney’s fees.<br><br>The respondents anchored their claim on their May 25, 2005 agreement with Goran, and contended that their subsequent execution of the waiver and quitclaim in favor of Poseidon and Van Doorn should not be given weight nor allowed to serve as a bar to their claim.&nbsp; The respondents alleged that their dire need for cash for their starving families compelled and unduly influenced their decision to sign their respective waivers and quitclaims.&nbsp; In addition, the complicated language employed in the document rendered it highly suspect.<br><br>In their position paper,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Poseidon and Van Doorn argued that the respondents had no cause of action to collect the remaining 50% of their unpaid wages.&nbsp; To Poseidon and Van Doorn, the respondents’ voluntary and knowing agreement to the settlement pay, which they confirmed when they signed the waivers and quitclaims, now effectively bars their claim.&nbsp; Poseidon and Van Doorn submitted before the LA the signed letter of acceptance, the waiver and quitclaim, and the cash vouchers to support their stance.<br><br>In a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> dated May 2006, the LA dismissed the respondents’ complaint for lack of merit, declaring as valid and binding their waivers and quitclaims.&nbsp; The LA explained that while quitclaims executed by employees are generally frowned upon and do not bar them from recovering the full measure of what is legally due, excepted from this rule are the waivers knowingly and voluntarily agreed to by the employees, such as the waivers assailed by the respondents.&nbsp; Citing jurisprudence, the LA added that the courts should respect, as the law between the parties, those legitimate waivers and quitclaims that represent voluntary and reasonable settlement of employees’ claims.&nbsp; In the respondents’ case, this pronouncement holds more weight, as they understood fully well the contents of their waivers and knew the consequences of their acts.<br><br>The LA did not give probative weight to the May 25, 2005 agreement considering that the entities which contracted the respondents’ services -Poseidon and Van Doorn — did not actively participate.&nbsp; Moreover, the LA noted that the respondents’ signed letter of acceptance superseded this agreement.&nbsp; The LA likewise considered the respondents’ belated filing of the complaint as a mere afterthought.<br><br>Finally, the LA dismissed the issue of illegal dismissal, noting that the respondents already abandoned this issue in their pleadings.&nbsp; The respondents appealed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> the LA’s decision before the NLRC.<br><br><b><i>The Ruling of the NLRC</i></b><br><br>By Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> dated December 29, 2006, the NLRC affirmed <i>in toto</i> the LA’s decision.&nbsp; As the LA did, the NLRC ruled that the respondents’ knowing and voluntary acquiescence to the settlement and their acceptance of the payments made bind them and effectively bar their claims.&nbsp; The NLRC also regarded the amounts the respondents received as settlement pay to be reasonable; despite the cessation of the fishing operations, the respondents were still paid their full wages from December 2004 to January 2005 and 50% of their wages from February 2005 until their repatriation in May 2005.<br><br>On February 12, 2007, the NLRC denied<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> the respondents’ motion for reconsideration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> prompting them to file with the CA a petition for certiorari<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court.<br><br><b><i>The Ruling of the CA</i></b><br><br>In its September 30, 2008 Decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> the CA granted the respondents’ petition and ordered Poseidon and Van Doorn to pay the respondents the amounts tabulated below, representing the difference between the amounts they were entitled to receive under the May 25, 2005 agreement and the amounts that they received as settlement pay:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="80%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="50%"><div align="CENTER">Artemio A.

No. 8042 to justify the amounts it awarded to the respondents is misplaced, as the respondents never raised the issue of illegal dismissal before the NLRC and the CA.&nbsp; It claims that the respondents, in assailing the NLRC ruling before the CA, mainly questioned the validity of the waivers and quitclaims they signed and their binding effect on them.&nbsp; While the respondents raised the issue of illegal dismissal before the LA, they eventually abandoned it in their pleadings — a matter the LA even pointed out in her May 2006 Decision.<br><br>Poseidon further argues that the NLRC did not exceed its jurisdiction nor gravely abuse its discretion in deciding the case in its favor, pointing out that the respondents raised issues pertaining to mere errors of judgment before the CA.&nbsp; Thus, as matters stood, these issues did not call for the grant of a writ of <i>certiorari</i> as this prerogative writ is limited to the correction of errors of jurisdiction committed through grave abuse of discretion, not errors of judgment.<br><br>Finally, Poseidon maintains that it did not illegally dismiss the respondents.&nbsp; Highlighting the CA’s observation and the respondents’ own admission in their various pleadings, Poseidon reiterates that it simply ceased its fishing operations as a business decision in the exercise of its management prerogative.<br><br><center><b><u>The Case for the Respondents</u></b></center><br>The respondents point out in their comment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> that the petition raises questions of fact, which are not proper for a Rule 45 petition.&nbsp; They likewise point out that the petition did not specifically set forth the grounds as required under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.&nbsp; On the merits, and relying on the CA ruling, the respondents argue that Poseidon dismissed them without a valid cause and without the observance of due process.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u>The Issues</u></b><br></div><br>At the core of this case are the validity of the respondents’ waivers and quitclaims and the issue of whether these should bar their claim for unpaid salaries.&nbsp; At the completely legal end is the question of whether Section 10 of R.A.

No. 8042.<br><br><b><i>The respondents are not entitled to<br>the unpaid portion of their salaries<br>under Section 10 of R.A. No. 8042</i></b><br><br>The application of Section 10 of R.A. No. 8042 presumes a finding of illegal dismissal.&nbsp; The pertinent portion of Section 10 of R.A. No. 8042 reads:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 10.&nbsp;MONEY CLAIMS. — x x x<br><br>x x x x<br><br>In case of <b><i>termination of overseas employment&nbsp;without&nbsp;just, valid or authorized cause</i></b> as defined by law or contract[.] [emphasis and italics ours]</blockquote><br>A plain reading of this provision readily shows that it applies only to <b><i>cases of illegal dismissal or dismissal without any just, authorized or valid cause</i></b> and finds no application in cases where the overseas Filipino worker was not illegally dismissed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; We found the occasion to apply this rule in <i>International Management Services v.

No. 8042 applies only to an illegally dismissed overseas contract worker or&nbsp;a worker dismissed from overseas employment without just, valid or authorized cause</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Whether the respondents in the present case were illegally dismissed is a question we resolve in the negative for three reasons.<br><br><i>First,</i> the respondents’ references to illegal dismissal in their several pleadings were mere cursory declarations rather than a definitive demand for redress.&nbsp; The LA’s May 2006 Decision clearly enunciated this point when she dismissed the respondents’ claim of illegal dismissal "as complainants themselves have lost interest to pursue the same."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br><i>Second,</i> the respondents, in their motion for reconsideration filed before the NLRC, positively argued that the fishing operations for which they were hired ceased as a result of the <u>business decision of Van Doorn and of its partners</u>;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> thus, negating by omission any claim for illegal dismissal.<br><br><i>Third,</i> the CA, in its assailed decision, likewise made the very same inference – that the fishing operations ceased as a result of a <u>business decision of Van Doorn and of its partners</u>.&nbsp; In other words, the manner of dismissal was not a contested issue; the records clearly showed that the respondents’ employment was terminated because <i>Van Doorn and its partners simply <b>decided to stop their fishing operations</b> in the exercise of their management prerogative</i>, which prerogative even our labor laws recognize.<br><br>We confirm in this regard that, by law and subject to the State’s corollary right to review its determination,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> management has the right to regulate the business and control its every aspect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>&nbsp; Included in this management right is the <u>freedom to close or cease its operations for any reason, as long as it is done in good faith and the employer faithfully complies with the substantive and procedural requirements laid down by law and jurisprudence</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>&nbsp; Article 283 of our Labor Code provides:<br><br><blockquote>Art. 283.&nbsp; Closure of establishment and reduction of personnel.&nbsp;- The <u>employer may also terminate the employment of any employee due to</u> the installation of labor-saving devices, redundancy,&nbsp;retrenchment&nbsp;to prevent losses or the closing or <b><i>cessation of operation of the</i></b> establishment or <b><i>undertaking</i></b> <u>unless the closing is for the purpose of circumventing the provisions of this Title, by serving a written notice on the workers and the [Department of Labor and Employment] at least one (1) month before the intended date thereof</u>.&nbsp; x x x In case of retrenchment to prevent losses and <u>in cases of closures or cessation of operations</u> of establishment or undertaking <u>not due to serious business losses or financial reverses, the separation pay shall be equivalent to one (1) month pay or at least one-half (1/2) month pay for every year of service, whichever is higher</u>. A fraction of at least six (6) months shall be considered as one (1) whole year. [Italics, underscores and emphases ours]</blockquote><br>This provision applies in the present case as under the contract the employer and the workers signed and submitted to the Philippine Overseas Employment Agency <i>(POEA)</i>, the Philippine labor law expressly applies.<br><br>This legal reality is reiterated under Section 18-B, paragraph 2,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> in relation with Section 23<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> of the POEA Standard Employment Contract (POEA-SEC) (which is deemed written into every overseas employment contract) which recognizes the validity of the cessation of the business operations as a valid ground for the termination of an overseas employment.&nbsp; This recognition is subject to compliance with the following requisites:<br><br><ol><li>The <b>decision to close or cease operations must be <i>bona fide</i></b> in character;<br><br></li><li>Service of <b>written notice</b> on the affected employees and on the Department of Labor and Employment <i>(DOLE)</i> <b>at least one (1) month prior to the effectivity of the termination</b>; and</li><li>Payment to the affected employees of <b>termination or separation pay</b> equivalent to one (1) month pay or at least one-half (1/2) month pay for every year of service, whichever is higher.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></li></ol><br>We are sufficiently convinced, based on the records, that Van Doorn’s termination of the respondents’ employment arising from the cessation of its fishing operations complied with the above requisites and is thus valid.<br><br>We observe that the records of the case do not show that Van Doorn ever intended to defeat the respondents’ rights under our labor laws when it undertook its decision to close its fishing operations on November 20, 2004.&nbsp; From this date until six months after, the undertaking was at a complete halt.&nbsp; That Van Doorn and its partners might have suffered losses during the six-month period is not entirely remote.&nbsp; Yet, Van Doorn did not immediately repatriate the respondents or hire another group of seafarers to replace the respondents in a move to resume its fishing operations.&nbsp; Quite the opposite, the respondents, although they were no longer rendering any service or doing any work, still received their full salary for November 2004 up to January 2005.&nbsp; In fact, from February 2005 until they were repatriated to the Philippines in May 2005, the respondents still received wages, albeit half of their respective basic monthly salary rate.&nbsp; Had Van Doorn intended to stop its fishing operations simply to terminate the respondents’ employment, it would have immediately repatriated the respondents to the Philippines soon after, in order that it may hire other seafarers to replace them — a possibility that did not take place.<br><br>Considering therefore the absence of any indication that Van Doorn stopped its fishing operations to circumvent the protected rights of the respondents, our courts have no basis to question the reason that might have impelled Van Doorn to reach its closure decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>In sum, since Poseidon ceased its fishing operations in the valid exercise of its management prerogative, Section 10 of R.A. No. 8042 finds no application.&nbsp; <b>Consequently, we find that the CA erroneously imputed grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC in not applying Section 10 of R.A. No. 8042 and in awarding the respondents the unpaid portion of their full salaries.</b><br><br><b><i>The waivers and quitclaims signed<br>by the respondents are valid and<br>binding</i></b><br><br>We cannot support the CA’s act of giving greater evidentiary weight to the May 25, 2005 agreement over the respondents’ waivers and quitclaims; not only do we find the latter documents to be reasonable and duly executed, we also find that they superseded the May 25, 2005 agreement.<br><br>Generally, this Court looks with disfavor at quitclaims executed by employees for being contrary to public policy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Where the person making the waiver, however, has done so <b><i>voluntarily, with a full understanding of its terms and with the payment of credible and reasonable consideration,</i></b> we have no option but to recognize the transaction to be valid and binding.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>We find the requisites for the validity of the respondents’ quitclaim present in this case.&nbsp; We base this conclusion on the following observations:<br><br><i>First,</i> the respondents acknowledged in their various pleadings, as well as in the very document denominated as "waiver and quitclaim," that they <u>voluntarily signed the document</u> after receiving the agreed settlement pay.<br><br><i>Second,</i> the <u>settlement pay is reasonable under the circumstances</u>, especially when contrasted with the amounts to which they were respectively entitled to receive as termination pay pursuant to Section 23 of the POEA-SEC and Article 283 of the Labor Code.&nbsp; The comparison of these amounts is tabulated below:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="80%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="31%"><div align="CENTER"></div></td> <td width="34%"><div align="CENTER">Settlement Pay</div></td> <td width="35%"><div align="CENTER">Termination Pay</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">Joel S.
