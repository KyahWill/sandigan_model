Lazaro (Lazaro).<br><br><center><b><i>Version of the Prosecution</i></b></center><br>According to PO2 Medrano, a week prior to Aguilar’s arrest on November 30, 2004, he had already received some phone calls from “concerned citizens”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> regarding the drug-dealing activities of one “Baby Mata” at Pildera, Pasay City.&nbsp; PO2 Medrano verified the information by calling on Eva, his informant, who was also a drug user.&nbsp; Eva confirmed that she personally knew Baby Mata, who was her regular drug-supplier.&nbsp; PO2 Medrano thereafter learned of Baby Mata’s residence at Road IV near the <i>barangay</i> hall, and that she was plying her trade at Road I.&nbsp; Although he placed Baby Mata under surveillance, PO2 Medrano admitted that he did not actually see her selling drugs to customers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>On November 30, 2004, a team, led by Senior Police Officer (SPO) 2 Rey Millare, was formed to conduct an entrapment operation against Aguilar.&nbsp; The team submitted a pre-operation report to the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) and PO2 Medrano was designated as the poseur-buyer.&nbsp; He was provided with two P500.00 bills, the serial numbers of which he noted and thereafter marked with “JG,” the initials of P/Supt. Jose Gentiles, the Chief of the District Intelligence and Investigation Branch.&nbsp; At around 6:20 in the evening, the team was in place at Pildera to conduct the buy-bust operation.&nbsp; With Eva, PO2 Medrano went to Road I, where they saw Baby Mata talking to someone.&nbsp; When the person left, Eva approached Baby Mata and after about five minutes, waved at PO2 Medrano to come over.&nbsp; Eva introduced PO2 Medrano as a security guard and a fellow “scorer.”&nbsp; Baby Mata then asked how much PO2 Medrano wanted, to which he answered “<i>isang bulig lang</i>,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> which was half a gram of <i>shabu</i>, worth P1,000.00.&nbsp; Upon Baby Mata’s request, PO2 Medrano gave her the two pre-marked P500.00 bills, which she took with her left hand.&nbsp; Baby Mata, with her right hand, thereafter reached for a plastic sachet containing crystalline substance from the right pocket of her jeans, and handed it to PO2 Medrano.&nbsp; After examining the sachet, PO2 Medrano pocketed the shabu and pressed the call button of his mobile phone, to signal his team that the sale had been consummated.&nbsp; PO2 Benedicto A. Mendoza (Mendoza), who was then only seven to eight meters away, rushed towards them and arrested Baby Mata.&nbsp; The police officers immediately introduced themselves as such, showed Baby Mata their identification cards, and apprised her of her constitutional rights.&nbsp; PO2 Medrano confiscated the buy-bust money he earlier handed Baby Mata, which were still in her left hand, and another sachet of <i>shabu</i>, which turned up after she was ordered to empty her pockets.&nbsp; PO2 Medrano accordingly marked the two sachets of <i>shabu</i> with “RM-1” and “RM-2” and thereafter brought Baby Mata to the Southern Police District Station at Fort Bonifacio, Taguig.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>The seized items were brought by PO2 Medrano on the same day to the PNP Crime Laboratory in Camp Crame, Quezon City.&nbsp; They were received and examined by P/Insp.Timario who made the following findings, as embodied in Chemistry Report No. D-1171-04:<br><br><blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">SPECIMEN SUBMITTED:</span><br><br>A – One (1) staple-sealed brown envelope with names and signatures containing two (2) heat-sealed transparent plastic sachets each containing white crystalline substance having the following markings and net weights:<br><blockquote>A-1 - (RM-1 301104) = 0.45 gram<br>A-2 - (RM-2 301104) = 0.31 gram<br></blockquote><b>PURPOSE OF LABORATORY EXAMINATION:&nbsp; </b><br><br>To determine the presence of dangerous drugs.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">FINDINGS:</span><br><br>Qualitative examination conducted on the above-stated specimens gave POSITIVE result to the tests for Methylamphetamine hydrochloride, a dangerous drug.<br><br>CONCLUSION:<br><br>Specimens A-1 and A-2 contain Methylamphetamine hydrochloride, a dangerous drug.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>REMARKS:<br><br>TIME AND DATE COMPLETED:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 360px;">0120H 01 December 2004<br><br>EXAMINED BY:<br><br></div><div style="margin-left: 400px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (SGD.)<br>ANGEL C.

The apprehending officer/team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof; Provided, that the physical inventory and photograph shall be conducted at the place where the search warrant is served; or at the nearest police station or at the nearest office of the apprehending officer/team, whichever is practicable, in case of warrantless seizures; <b>Provided, further, that non-compliance with these requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and invalid such seizures of and custody over said items[.]</b> (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>While a testimony about a perfect and unbroken chain is ideal, such is not always the standard as it is almost always impossible to obtain an unbroken chain.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>&nbsp; A perusal of the law reveals, however, that failure to strictly comply with the procedure in Section 21 will not render the arrest illegal or the items seized inadmissible in evidence, provided that the integrity and evidentiary value of such items are preserved since they will be used in the determination of the guilt or innocence of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Despite the failure of the apprehending officers to make an inventory of and to photograph the items seized from Aguilar, they were nevertheless able to prove that the integrity and evidentiary value of the evidence had been preserved, the chain of custody of such items, having been adequately established in the case at bar.&nbsp; As aptly observed by the Court of Appeals:<br><br><blockquote>It was undisputed that at about 6:20 in the evening of November 30, 2004, PO2 Medrano bought a sachet of shabu from accused-appellant which he paid with two (2) P500.00 marked bill[s].&nbsp; PO2 Medrano placed the shabu in his pocket then executed the pre-arranged signal.&nbsp; After arresting accused-appellant, PO2 Medrano seized the marked money from the former’s left hand then frisked accused-appellant and found another sachet of shabu.&nbsp; He marked the sachet of shabu he bought “RM-1” and the one he found in accused-appellant’s pocket “RM-2”.&nbsp; They brought accused-appellant and the seized items to the headquarters.&nbsp; While accused-appellant was being booked, the team prepared the request for laboratory examination.&nbsp; The request and the seized drugs were personally brought by PO2 Medrano to the PNP Crime Laboratory in Quezon City that same evening.&nbsp; P/Insp. Angel Timario received the request and specimens brought by PO2 Medrano.&nbsp; He weighed and examined the contents of the sachets, confirming that the items were methamphetamine hydrochloride or shabu.&nbsp; His findings are embodied in Chemistry Report No. D-1171-04.&nbsp; The specimens which bore the markings “RM-1” and “RM-2” were identified by PO2 Medrano during trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> (Citations omitted.)</blockquote><br>Moreover, Aguilar was not able to show that there was bad faith or ill will on the part of the police officers, or tampering with the evidence, thus the presumption that the integrity of the evidence was preserved remains.&nbsp; The same applies to the presumption that the police officers properly discharged their duties.&nbsp; Since Aguilar failed to overcome the foregoing presumptions, it cannot be disputed that the drugs seized from her were the same ones examined in the crime laboratory and presented in court during trial.&nbsp; The crucial link in the chain of custody of the seized drugs was therefore established by the prosecution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br><b><i>Proof Beyond Reasonable Doubt Established</i></b><br><br>Aguilar, having failed to convince this Court that the consistent findings of the lower courts are tainted with arbitrariness, capriciousness, or palpable errors, then the hornbook doctrine that the factual findings of the Court of Appeals, affirming those of the RTC, are binding, applies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><b><i>1.

Del Rosario</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> held:<br><br><blockquote>In a prosecution for the sale of a dangerous drug, the following elements must be proven: (1) the identity of the buyer and the seller, the object, and the consideration; and (2) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment therefor.&nbsp; Simply put, “[in] prosecutions for illegal sale of <i>shabu</i>, what is material is the proof that the transaction or sale actually took place, coupled with the presentation in court of the <i>corpus delicti </i>as evidence.” (Citations omitted.)</blockquote><br>As the poseur-buyer, PO2 Medrano was able to positively identify<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Aguilar as the seller of the <i>shabu</i> during his testimony.&nbsp; He also testified on the exchange of the marked money and <i>shabu</i> that he and Aguilar had during their transaction.&nbsp; More importantly, the prosecution was able to present the very same marked money and <i>shabu</i>, the corpus delicti, to the court as evidence.<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><b><i>2. Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs</i></b><br></div><br>With respect to the charge of illegal possession of dangerous drugs, this Court finds that the prosecution sufficiently established the following elements:<br><br><blockquote>1) the accused is in possession of an item or object, which is identified to be a prohibited or regulated drug;<br>(2) such possession is not authorized by law; and<br>(3) the accused freely and consciously possessed the drug.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Aside from the <i>shabu</i> Aguilar sold to PO2 Medrano, another sachet of shabu was recovered in her possession.&nbsp; Mere possession of a prohibited drug constitutes <i>prima facie</i> evidence of intent to possess, <i>animus possidendi,</i> sufficient to convict an accused absent a satisfactory explanation of such possession.&nbsp; The burden of evidence, thus, is shifted to the accused to explain the absence of intent to possess.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>&nbsp; Aguilar miserably failed to discharge such burden.<br><br><b><i>Defenses of Denial and Frame-up</i></b><br><br>Time and again, this Court has looked at the defenses of denial and frame-up with disfavor.&nbsp; While Aguilar’s niece, Lazaro, did testify in her defense, this Court, in agreement with the observation of the Court of Appeals, cannot give such testimony full faith and credit as Lazaro herself declared that she would testify on anything for her aunt<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> and she came to court to help in the release of her aunt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; This admission of absolute willingness to make declarations in court for the singular purpose of judicial proceedings to ascertain the truth and adversely affects the credibility of the witness.<br><br>The explanation of this Court in <i>People v. Cruz</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> with regard to the defenses of denial and frame-up finds applicability in this case, given that Aguilar also accused the police officers of extorting money from her, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Denial or frame-up is a standard defense ploy in most prosecutions for violation of the Dangerous Drugs Law.&nbsp; As such, it has been viewed by the court with disfavor for it can just as easily be concocted.&nbsp; It should not accord a redoubtable sanctuary to a person accused of drug dealing unless the evidence of such frame up is clear and convincing.&nbsp; Without proof of any intent on the part of the police officers to falsely impute appellant in the commission of a crime, the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty and the principle that the findings of the trial court on the credibility of witnesses are entitled to great respect, deserve to prevail over the bare denials and self-serving claims of appellant that he had been framed up.&nbsp; Neither can appellant’s claim of alleged extortion by the police operatives be entertained.&nbsp; Absent any proof, appellant’s assertion of extortion allegedly committed by the police officers could not be successfully interposed.&nbsp; It remains one of those standard, worn-out, and impotent excuses of malefactors prosecuted for drug offenses.&nbsp; What appellant could have done was to prove his allegation and not just casually air it. (Citations omitted.)</blockquote><br><b><i>Defense of Instigation</i></b><br><br>Aguilar further claims that the validity of the buy-bust operation is doubtful as she was instigated to sell <i>shabu</i> to PO2 Medrano.&nbsp; In support, Aguilar quotes PO2 Medrano’s own testimony wherein he agreed to the possibility that his informant may have instigated the sale.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>In resolving issues involving the validity of a buy-bust operation, specifically the question of whether the government had induced the accused to commit the offense as charged, this Court usually finds it instructive to first distinguish between entrapment and instigation.&nbsp; This Court’s distinction in the recent case of <i>People v. Legaspi</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> is elucidative, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Entrapment is sanctioned by the law as a legitimate method of apprehending criminals.&nbsp; Its purpose is to trap and capture lawbreakers in the execution of their criminal plan.&nbsp; Instigation, on the other hand, involves the inducement of the would-be accused into the commission of the offense.&nbsp; In such a case, the instigators become co-principals themselves.<br><br>Where the criminal intent originates in the mind of the instigating person and the accused is lured into the commission of the offense charged in order to prosecute him, there is instigation and no conviction may be had.&nbsp; Where, however, the criminal intent originates in the mind of the accused and the criminal offense is completed, even after a person acted as a decoy for the state, or public officials furnished the accused an opportunity for the commission of the offense, or the accused was aided in the commission of the crime in order to secure the evidence necessary to prosecute him, there is no instigation and the accused must be convicted.&nbsp; The law in fact tolerates the use of decoys and other artifices to catch a criminal. (Citations omitted.)<br></blockquote><br>This Court recognizes instigation as a valid defense that can be raised by the accused.&nbsp; However, for this defense to prosper, the accused must prove, with sufficient evidence, that the government induced him or her to commit the offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>&nbsp; Aguilar claims that she was instigated by the informant to sell <i>shabu</i> to PO2 Medrano.&nbsp; Her only evidence to support this claim was her interpretation of PO2 Medrano’s testimony.<br><br>This Court finds Aguilar’s defense of instigation unworthy of belief.&nbsp; It has been established that when the accused is charged with the sale of illicit drugs, the following defenses cannot be set up:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"><div align="JUSTIFY">(1)</div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="JUSTIFY">that facilities for the commission of the crime were intentionally placed in his way; or</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">(2) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">that the criminal act was done at the solicitation of the decoy or poseur-buyer seeking to expose his criminal act; or</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">(3)</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">that police authorities feigning complicity in the act were present and apparently assisted in its commission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> (Citation omitted.)</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br></blockquote>In <i>Legaspi</i>, we added: “[t]he foregoing are especially true in that class of cases where the offense is the kind that is habitually committed, and the solicitation merely furnished evidence of a course of conduct.&nbsp; Mere deception by the police officer will not shield the perpetrator, if the offense was committed by him free from the influence or the instigation of the police officer.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>&nbsp; The illegal sale and possession of dangerous drugs belong to such class of cases and buy-bust operations employing poseur-buyers are legally permissible to expose the offender and catch him in the act.<br><br>This Court agrees with the Court of Appeals’ pronouncement that “[t]here was no showing that the informant employed any act of inducement such as repeated requests for the sale of prohibited drugs or offers of exorbitant prices.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>&nbsp; Aguilar was never forced or coerced to sell the prohibited drug to PO2 Medrano.&nbsp; In fact, PO2 Medrano did not even have to say anything as Aguilar immediately asked him how much he wanted after he was introduced as a “scorer.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>&nbsp; When PO2 Medrano mentioned the quantity he desired to purchase, Aguilar promptly took the marked money from him and readily handed him the <i>shabu</i>.&nbsp; All these show that Aguilar had been habitually engaged in the sale of drugs.&nbsp; Also, such circumstances not only authorized, but obligated the police officers to arrest Aguilar, despite the lack of arrest warrant, as the crime was committed in their presence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>It is worthy to note that, aside from the fact that this defense was only brought up on appeal, it is being submitted along with the defenses of denial and frame-up.&nbsp; Aguilar cannot logically claim on one hand that she did not commit the acts constituting the charges against her, and at the same time ask this Court to consider that while she may have committed the act, she had been instigated to commit such crime.&nbsp; The defense of instigation is simply contradictory to the defenses of denial<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> and frame-up.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the Court hereby <b>AFFIRMS</b> the November 26, 2009 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
