[(New York State Law)], without regard to, or legal effect of, the conflicts of law provisions thereof”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> and that any dispute, controversy or claim arising therefrom “shall be solely and finally settled by arbitration.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>In May 1996, Sumitomo paid Asian Construction the amount of US$2,997,300.00 as advance payment to be recovered in accordance with the terms of the Agreement. Later, an additional advance payment of US$1,998,200.00 was made in October 1997.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> In all, Asian Construction received from Sumitomo the amount of US$9,731,606.62, inclusive of the advance payments (before withholding tax of US$97,308.44).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>On September 1, 1998, Sumitomo informed Asian Construction that it was terminating the Agreement effective September 5, 1998 due to the following reasons: (a) Asian Construction’s failure “to perform and complete the civil work for [Notice to Proceed] issued construction areas within the duration of the Time Schedule in [the] ‘Contract Specification of Civil and Architectural Works (Station No. 8 to Station No. 13) x x x’”; (b) Asian Construction’s failure to “provide adequate traffic management as required in the Scope of Works [pursuant to] subparagraph 5.2.4 of the Contract Specification of Civil and Architectural Work”; and (c) Asian Construction’s failure to “[pay] the suppliers of certain materials and equipment used in the construction of the Project in violation of [p]aragraph 3.1.3[,] Article 3 of the Agreement.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> In view of the foregoing, Sumitomo requested Asian Construction to “make the necessary arrangements for the proper turnover of the Project x x x.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Asian Construction, however, claimed that the accomplishments under Progress Billing No. (PB) 018<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> dated June 10, 1998 and PB 019<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> dated July 6, 1998, as well as other various claims, were still left unpaid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Hence, on December 22, 1998, it sent Sumitomo a letter,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> demanding payment of the total amount of US$6,371,530.89. This was followed by several correspondences between the parties through 1999 to 2007 but no settlement was achieved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br><center><b>The Proceedings Before the Arbitral Tribunal</b><br></center><br>On September 2, 2008, Asian Construction filed a complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> with the CIAC, docketed as CIAC Case No. 28-2008, seeking payment for its alleged losses and reimbursements amounting to US$9,501,413.13, plus attorney’s fees in the amount of P2,000,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> As a matter of course, an Arbitral Tribunal was constituted, with Alfredo F. Tadiar being designated as Chairman, and Salvador P. Castro and Jesse B. Grove as Members.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>For its part, Sumitomo filed a Motion to Dismiss,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> questioning the CIAC’s jurisdiction over the dispute on the ground that the arbitration should proceed in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of Japan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> However, the aforesaid motion was denied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> As such, Sumitomo filed an Answer,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> reiterating the CIAC’s alleged lack of jurisdiction and further asserting that the claim was already time-barred. It added that had Asian Construction discharged its obligations under the Agreement to itemize and justify its claims, the same could have been amicably settled years ago. In this respect, it made a counterclaim for the unutilized portion of the advance payments, attorney’s fees and costs of litigation in the amount of at least P10,000,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Subsequently, the parties signed a TOR,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> stipulating the admitted facts and defining the issues to be determined in the arbitration proceedings.<br><br>On December 15, 2009, the Arbitral Tribunal rendered the Partial Award<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> which affirmed its jurisdiction over the dispute but held that the parties were bound by their Agreement that the substantive New York State Law shall apply in the resolution of the issues.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> It proceeded to dismiss both the claims and counterclaims of the parties on the ground that these had already prescribed under New York State Law’s six-year statute of limitations<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> and ruled that, in any case, were it to resolve the same on the merits, “it would not produce an affirmative recovery for the claimant.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Aggrieved, Asian Construction filed before the CA, on January 5, 2010, a Rule 43 Petition for Review,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 112127 (First CA Petition), seeking the reversal of the Partial Award.<br><br>Meanwhile, notwithstanding its dismissal of the claims and counterclaims, the Arbitral Tribunal further directed the parties to itemize their respective claims for costs and attorney’s fees and to submit factual proof and legal bases for their entitlement thereto.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Pursuant to this directive, Sumitomo submitted evidence to prove the costs it had incurred and paid as a result of the arbitration proceedings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Asian Construction, on the other hand, did not present any statement or document to substantiate its claims but, instead, submitted an Opposition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> dated March 8, 2010 (opposition) to Sumitomo’s claim for costs. The Arbitral Tribunal did not act upon the opposition because it was treated, in effect, as a motion for reconsideration which was prohibited under the CIAC Revised Rules of Procedure Governing Construction Arbitration (CIAC Revised Rules).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>On March 17, 2010, the Arbitral Tribunal rendered the Final Award<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> which granted Sumitomo’s claim for attorney’s fees in the amount of US$200,000.00. It held that while the filing of the arbitration suit cannot be regarded as “clearly unfounded” because of the two progress billings that were left unpaid, Asian Construction’s disregard of the Agreement to have the dispute resolved in accordance with New York State Law had forced Sumitomo to incur attorney’s fees in order to defend its interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> It further noted that if Asian Construction had accepted the settlement offered by Sumitomo, then, the arbitration proceedings would have even been aborted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> On the other hand, a similar claim for attorney’s fees made by Asian Construction was denied by reason of the latter’s failure to submit, as directed, proof of its entitlement thereto.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> As to the matter of costs, the Arbitral Tribunal declared Sumitomo relieved from sharing <i>pro-rata</i> in the arbitration costs and, consequently, directed Asian Construction to shoulder the same costs in full and reimburse Sumitomo the amount of P849,532.45. However, it ordered Sumitomo to bear all the expenses related to the appointment of the foreign arbitrator considering that such service was secured upon its own initiative and without the participation and consent of Asian Construction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Dissatisfied with the Arbitral Tribunal’s ruling, Asian Construction filed another Rule 43 Petition for Review<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> before the CA, on May 3, 2010, docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 113828 (Second CA Petition), this time, to set aside the Final Award. In this light, it claimed gross negligence and partiality on the part of the Arbitral Tribunal and asserted, <i>inter alia</i>, that, apart from being a non-arbitrable issue, an award of attorney’s fees would be premature since the prevailing party can only be determined when the case is decided with finality. Moreover, it maintained that both claims of Asian Construction and the counterclaims of Sumitomo had already been dismissed for being time-barred.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br><center><b>The CA Ruling</b><br></center><br>On July 23, 2010, the CA rendered a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> (July 23, 2010 Resolution), dismissing Asian Construction’s First CA Petition against the Partial Award on the ground of forum-shopping, after it was shown that: (<i>a</i>) the aforesaid petition was filed while the arbitration case was still pending final resolution before the Arbitral Tribunal; and (<i>b</i>) Asian Construction’s opposition to Sumitomo’s claim for costs filed before the Arbitral Tribunal had, in fact, effectively sought for the same relief and stated the same allegations as those in its First CA Petition. The CA also noted Asian Construction’s premature resort to a petition for review because what was sought to be nullified was not a final award, but only a partial one. The CA eventually denied Asian Construction’s motion for reconsideration in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> dated April 18, 2011. Hence, Asian Construction’s petition before the Court, docketed as G.R. No. 196723.<br><br>Meanwhile, the CA gave due course to Asian Construction’s Second CA Petition assailing the Final Award and rendered a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> on January 26, 2011, upholding the Arbitral Tribunal’s ruling except the award of attorney’s fees in favor of Sumitomo. The CA held that the fact that Asian Construction initiated an action or refused to compromise its claims cannot be considered unjustified or made in bad faith as to entitle Sumitomo to the aforesaid award. Consequently, Sumitomo moved for reconsideration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> asserting that Asian Construction’s Second CA Petition should have instead been dismissed in its entirety considering their Agreement that the Arbitral Tribunal’s decisions and awards would be final and non-appealable. However, in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> dated April 29, 2011, the CA denied the motion for reconsideration. Thus, Sumitomo’s petition before the Court, docketed as G.R. No. 196728.<br><br><center><b>The Issues Before the Court</b><br></center><br>The essential issues for the Court’s resolution are as follows: (a) in G.R. No. 196723, whether or not the CA erred in dismissing Asian Construction’s First CA Petition on the ground of forum shopping; and (b) in G.R. No. 196728, whether or not the CA erred in reviewing and modifying the Final Award which Sumitomo insists to be final and unappealable.<br><br><center><b>The Court’s Ruling</b><br></center><br>The petitions should be denied.<br><br><b><i>A. Dismissal of Asian Construction’s First CA Petition; forum shopping</i>.</b><br><br>Forum shopping is the act of a litigant who repetitively availed of several judicial remedies in different courts, simultaneously or successively, all substantially founded on the same transactions and the same essential facts and circumstances, and all raising substantially the same issues, either pending in or already resolved adversely by some other court, to increase his chances of obtaining a favorable decision if not in one court, then in another. More particularly, forum shopping can be committed in three ways, namely: (<i>a</i>) by filing multiple cases based on the same cause of action and with the same prayer, the previous case not having been resolved yet (where the ground for dismissal is <i>litis pendentia</i>); (<i>b</i>) by filing multiple cases based on the same cause of action and with the same prayer, the previous case having been finally resolved (where the ground for dismissal is <i>res judicata</i>); and (<i>c</i>) by filing multiple cases based on the same cause of action but with different prayers (splitting of causes of action, where the ground for dismissal is also either <i>litis pendentia</i> or <i>res judicata</i>).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Forum shopping is treated as an act of malpractice and, in this accord, constitutes a ground for the summary dismissal of the actions involved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> To be sure, the rule against forum shopping seeks to prevent the vexation brought upon the courts and the litigants by a party who asks different courts to rule on the same or related causes and grant the same or substantially the same reliefs and in the process creates the possibility of conflicting decisions being rendered by the different fora upon the same issues.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>In this case, the Court finds that the CA committed no reversible error in dismissing Asian Construction’s First CA Petition on the ground of forum shopping since the relief sought (<i>i.e.</i>, the reconsideration of the Partial Award) and the allegations stated therein are identical to its opposition to Sumitomo’s claim for costs filed before the Arbitral Tribunal while CIAC Case No. 28-2008 was still pending. These circumstances clearly square with the first kind of forum shopping which thereby impels the dismissal of the First CA Petition on the ground of <i>litis pendentia</i>.<br><br>On this score, it is apt to point out that Asian Construction’s argument that it merely complied with the directive of the Arbitral Tribunal cannot be given any credence since it (as well as Sumitomo) was only directed to submit evidence to prove the costs it had incurred and paid as a result of the arbitration proceedings. However, at variance with the tribunal’s directive, Asian Construction, in its opposition to Sumitomo’s claim for costs, proceeded to seek the reversal of the Partial Award in the same manner as its First CA Petition. It cannot, therefore, be doubted that it treaded the course of forum shopping, warranting the dismissal of the aforesaid petition.<br><br>In any case, the Court observes that the First CA Petition remains dismissible since the CIAC Revised Rules provides for the resort to the remedy of a petition for review only against a final arbitral award,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> and not a partial award, as in this case.<br><br>In fine, the Court upholds the CA’s dismissal of Asian Construction’s petition in CA-G.R. SP No. 112127 (First CA Petition) and based on this, denies its petition in G.R. No. 196723.<br><br><b><i>B. Review and modification of the Final Award.</i></b><br><br>Sumitomo Corporation faults the CA for reviewing and modifying a final and non-appealable arbitral award and insists that the Asian Construction’s Second CA Petition should have been, instead, dismissed outright. It mainly argues that by entering into stipulations in the arbitration clause – which provides that “the order or award of the arbitrators will be the sole and exclusive remedy between the parties regarding any and all claims and counterclaims with respect to the matter of the arbitrated dispute”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> and that “the order or award rendered in connection with an arbitration shall be final and binding upon the parties.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Asian Construction effectively waived any and all appeals from the Arbitral Tribunal’s decision or award.<br><br>Sumitomo’s argument is untenable.<br><br>A brief exegesis on the development of the procedural rules governing CIAC cases clearly shows that a final award rendered by the Arbitral Tribunal is not absolutely insulated from judicial review.<br><br>To begin, Executive Order No. (EO) 1008,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> which vests upon the CIAC original and exclusive jurisdiction over disputes arising from, or connected with, contracts entered into by parties involved in construction in the Philippines, plainly states that the arbitral award “shall be final and inappealable except on questions of law which shall be appealable to the [Court].”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> Later, however, the Court, in Revised Administrative Circular (RAC) No. 1-95,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> modified this rule, directing that the appeals from the arbitral award of the CIAC be first brought to the CA on “questions of fact, law or mixed questions of fact and law.” This amendment was eventually transposed into the present CIAC Revised Rule which directs that “a petition for review from a final award may be taken by any of the parties within fifteen (15) days from receipt thereof in accordance with the provisions of Rule 43 of the Rules of Court.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> Notably, the current provision is in harmony with the Court’s pronouncement that “despite statutory provisions making the decisions of certain administrative agencies ‘final,’ [the Court] still takes cognizance of petitions showing want of jurisdiction, grave abuse of discretion, violation of due process, denial of substantial justice or erroneous interpretation of the law” and that, in particular, “voluntary arbitrators, by the nature of their functions, act in a quasi-judicial capacity, such that their decisions are within the scope of judicial review.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>In this case, the Court finds that the CA correctly reviewed and modified the Arbitral Tribunal’s Final Award insofar as the award of attorney’s fees in favor of Sumitomo is concerned since the same arose from an erroneous interpretation of the law.<br><br>To elucidate, jurisprudence dictates that in the absence of a governing stipulation, attorney’s fees may be awarded only in case the plaintiff's action or defendant's stand is so untenable as to amount to gross and evident bad faith.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> This is embodied in Article 2208 of the Civil Code which states:<br><blockquote>Article 2208. In the absence of stipulation, attorney's fees and expenses of litigation, other than judicial costs, cannot be recovered, except:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(5) Where the defendant acted in gross and evident bad faith in refusing to satisfy the plaintiff's<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> plainly valid, just and demandable claim;<br><br>x x x x<br></blockquote>In this case, the parties agreed that reasonable attorney’s fees shall be paid by the defaulting party if it fails to perform any of its obligations under the Agreement or by the party not prevailing, if any dispute concerning the meaning and interpretation thereto arises.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> However, since the parties’ respective claims under the Agreement had already prescribed pursuant to New York State Law, considering as well that the dispute was not regarding the meaning or construction of any provision under the Agreement,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> their stipulation on attorney’s fees should remain inoperative. Therefore, discounting the application of some stipulation, the Court proceeds to examine the matter under the lens of bad faith pursuant to the above-discussed rules on attorney’s fees.<br><br>After a careful scrutiny of the records, the Court observes that there was no gross and evident bad faith on the part of Asian Construction in filing its complaint against Sumitomo since it was merely seeking payment of its unpaid works done pursuant to the Agreement. Neither can its subsequent refusal to accept Sumitomo’s offered compromise be classified as a badge of bad faith since it was within its right to either accept or reject the same owing to its contractual nature.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> Verily, absent any other just or equitable reason to rule otherwise,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> these incidents are clearly off-tangent with a finding of gross and evident bad faith which altogether negates Sumitomo’s entitlement to attorney’s fees.<br><br>Hence, finding the CA’s review of the Final Award and its consequent deletion of the award of attorney’s fees to be proper, the Court similarly denies Sumitomo’s petition in G.R. No. 196728.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petitions are <b>DENIED</b>. The Resolutions dated July 23, 2010 and April 18, 2011 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

Besides, Section 19, EO 1008, expressly provides that monetary awards by the CIAC are final and unappealable.<br><br>We disagree with the solicitor general. As pointed out earlier, factual findings of quasi-judicial bodies that have acquired expertise are generally accorded great respect and even finality, if they are supported by substantial evidence. <b>The Court, however, has consistently held that despite statutory provisions making the decisions of certain administrative agencies "final," it still takes cognizance of petitions showing want of jurisdiction, grave abuse of discretion, violation of due process, denial of substantial justice or erroneous interpretation of the law.
