(Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote><br>In the opinion of the RTC, respondent’s Complaint did not make out a case for unlawful detainer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> It maintained that respondent’s supposed acts of tolerance must have been present right from the start of petitioner’s possession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Since the possession was sanctioned by the issuance of P.D. 293, and respondent’s tolerance only came after the law was declared unconstitutional, petitioner thus exercised possession under color of title.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> This fact necessarily placed the Complaint outside the category of unlawful detainer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>On 24 September 2008, respondent appealed to the CA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> The appellate court rendered a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> on 25 May 2010, the dispositive portion of which states:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of the foregoing, the petition is <b>GRANTED.</b> The assailed decision dated April 30, 2008 of the RTC (Branch 121) of Caloocan City in Civil Case No. C-22018 is <b>REVERSED and SET ASIDE</b> and the Decision dated November 9, 2007 of the MTC (Branch 52) of Caloocan City in Civil Case No. 03-27114 is hereby <b>REINSTATED.</b><br><br><b>SO ORDERED</b>. (Emphases in the original)</blockquote><br>In disposing of the issues, the CA observed that petitioner’s arguments could not be upheld.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> The question of whether tolerance had been exercised before or after the effectivity of P.D. 293 would only matter if what was at issue was the timeliness of the Complaint or whether the Complaint was one for unlawful detainer or forcible entry.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Since the Complaint specifically alleged that the possession of respondent was by petitioner’s tolerance, and that respondent’s dispossession had not lasted for more than one year, it then follows that the MeTC rightly acquired jurisdiction over the Complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Moreover, with the determination of who was the lawful and registered owner of the property in question, the owner necessarily enjoyed or had a better right to the possession and enjoyment there.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Hence, petitioner had no right to the continued possession of the property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Neither could he be considered a builder in good faith who could avail himself of the benefits under Article 448 of the Civil Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> From the moment P.D. 293 was declared unconstitutional and the title to the property restored to respondent, petitioner could no longer claim good faith.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Thus, as provided under Article 449, petitioner loses what he would be building, planting, or sowing without right of indemnity from that time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>On 25 May 2010, petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration, but it was denied in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> issued by the CA on 15 October 2010.<br><br>Hence, the instant Petition.<br><br>On 2 May 2011, respondent filed a Comment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> on the Petition for Review; and on 17 May 2011, petitioner filed a Reply.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br><center><b>ISSUES</b><br></center><br>From the foregoing, we reduce the issues to the following:<br><br><ol><li>Whether or not the MeTC had jurisdiction over the case;<br></li><li> Whether or not <i>Tuason</i> may be applied here, despite petitioner not being a party to the case; and<br></li><li>Whether or not petitioner is a builder in good faith.<br></li></ol><br><center><b>THE COURT’S RULING</b></center><br>We shall discuss the issues seriatim.<br><br><b><i>The MeTC rightly exercised <br>jurisdiction, this case being <br>one of unlawful detainer.</i></b><br><br>Petitioner alleges that the MeTC had no jurisdiction over the subject matter, because respondent had filed the Complaint beyond the one-year prescriptive period for ejectment cases. Despite losing ownership and possession of the property as early as 14 September 1973 when P.D. 293 took effect, respondent allegedly still failed to take the necessary action to recover it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>Petitioner also insists that tolerance had not been present from the start of his possession of the property, as respondent extended its tolerance only after P.D. 293 was declared unconstitutional.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> This situation necessarily placed respondent’s cause of action outside the category of unlawful detainer<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Consequently, the presence of an ownership dispute should have made this case either an <i>accion publiciana</i> or an <i>accion reivindicatoria.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>Unfortunately, petitioner’s contentions are without merit. The MeTC rightly exercised jurisdiction, this case being one of unlawful detainer.<br><br>An action for unlawful detainer exists when a person unlawfully withholds possession of any land or building against or from a lessor, vendor, vendee or other persons, after the expiration or termination of the right to hold possession by virtue of any contract, express or implied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Here, possession by a party was originally legal, as it was permitted by the other party on account of an express or implied contract between them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> However, the possession became illegal when the other party demanded that the possessor vacate the subject property because of the expiration or termination of the right to possess under the contract, and the possessor refused to heed the demand.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>The importance of making a demand cannot be overemphasized, as it is jurisdictional in nature.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> The one-year prescriptive period for filing a case for unlawful detainer is tacked from the date of the last demand, the reason being that the other party has the right to waive the right of action based on previous demands and to let the possessor remain on the premises for the meantime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>In this case, it is clear from the facts that what was once a legal possession of petitioner, emanating from P.D. 293, later became illegal by the pronouncement in <i>Tuason</i> that the law was unconstitutional. While it is established that tolerance must be present at the start of the possession,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> it must have been properly tacked <b>after</b> P.D. 293 was invalidated. At the time the decree was promulgated, respondent had no option but to allow petitioner and his predecessor-in-interest to enter the property. This is not the “tolerance” envisioned by the law. As explained in <i>Tuason</i>, the decree “was not as claimed a licit instance of the application of social justice principles or the exercise of police power. It was in truth a disguised, vile stratagem deliberately resorted to favor a few individuals, in callous and disdainful disregard of the rights of others. <b>It was in reality a taking of private property without due process and without compensation whatever, from persons relying on the indefeasibility of their titles in accordance with and as explicitly guaranteed by law.”</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>When respondent sent petitioner a demand letter in April 2002 and subsequently filed the Complaint in January 2003, it did so still within the<br><br>one-year prescriptive period imposed by the rules. It matters not whether there is an ownership issue that needs to be resolved, for as we have previously held, a determination of the matter would only be provisional. In <i>Heirs of Ampil v. Manahan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> we said:<br><br><blockquote>In an unlawful detainer case, the physical or material possession of the property involved, independent of any claim of ownership by any of the parties, is the sole issue for resolution. But where the issue of ownership is raised, the courts may pass upon said issue in order to determine who has the right to possess the property. This adjudication, however, is only an initial determination of ownership for the purpose of settling the issue of possession, the issue of ownership being inseparably linked thereto. As such, the lower court’s adjudication of ownership in the ejectment case is merely provisional and would not bar or prejudice an action between the same parties involving title to the property.</blockquote><br><b><i>Tuason may be applied despite petitioner <br>not being a party to that case, because an<br> unconstitutional law produces no effect<br> and confers no right upon any person.</i></b><br><br>Petitioner argues that respondent has no cause of action against him, because under the doctrine of operative fact and the doctrine of <i>res inter alios judicatae nullum aliis praejudicium faciunt, </i>petitioner should not be prejudiced by Tuason; the declaration of the unconstitutionality of P.D. 293 should not affect the rights of other persons not party to the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>Again, petitioner’s argument deserves scant consideration. In declaring a law null and void, the real issue is whether the nullity should have prospective, not retroactive, application.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> <i>Republic v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> is instructive on the matter:<br><br><blockquote>The strict view considers a legislative enactment which is declared unconstitutional as being, for all legal intents and purposes, a total nullity, and it is deemed as if had never existed.&nbsp; x x x.<br><br>A judicial declaration of invalidity, it is also true, may not necessarily obliterate all the effects and consequences of a void act occurring prior to such a declaration. Thus, in our decisions on the moratorium laws, we have been constrained to recognize the interim effects of said laws prior to their declaration of unconstitutionality, but<br><br>there we have likewise been unable to simply ignore strong considerations of equity and fair play. x x x.</blockquote><br>As a general rule, a law declared as unconstitutional produces no effect whatsoever and confers no right on any person. It matters not whether the person is a party to the original case, because “[n]ot only the parties but all persons are bound by the declaration of unconstitutionality, which means that no one may thereafter invoke it nor may the courts be permitted to apply it in subsequent cases. It is, in other words, a total nullity.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Thus, petitioner’s invocation of the doctrine of <i>res inter alios judicatae nullum aliis praejudicium faciunt</i> cannot be countenanced. We have categorically stated that the doctrine does not apply when the party concerned is a “successor in interest by title subsequent to the commencement of the action, or the action or proceeding is <i>in rem</i>, the judgment in which is binding against him.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> While petitioner may not have been a party to <i>Tuason</i>, still, the judgment is binding on him because the declaration of P.D. 293 as a nullity partakes of the nature of an <i>in rem</i> proceeding.<br><br>Neither may petitioner avail himself of the operative fact doctrine, which recognizes the interim effects of a law prior to its declaration of unconstitutionality.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> The operative fact doctrine is a rule of equity. As such, it must be applied as an exception to the general rule that an unconstitutional law produces no effects.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> The doctrine is applicable when a declaration of unconstitutionality will impose an undue burden on those who have relied on the invalid law,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> but it can never be invoked to validate as constitutional an unconstitutional act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>In this case, petitioner could not be said to have been unduly burdened by reliance on an invalid law. Petitioner merely anchored his right over the property to an Affidavit allegedly issued by Pelagio M. Juan, a member of the MHIA, authorizing petitioner to occupy the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> However, this Affidavit was executed only sometime in 1995, or approximately seven years after the <i>Tuason</i> case was promulgated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> At the time petitioner built the structures on the premises, he ought to have been aware of the binding effects of the <i>Tuason</i> case and the subsequent unconstitutionality of P.D. 293. These circumstances necessarily remove him from the ambit of the operative fact doctrine.<br><br><b><i>Petitioner may not be deemed<br>to be a builder in good faith.&nbsp; </i></b><br><br>Petitioner also argues that he is a builder in good faith for want of knowledge of any infirmity in the promulgation of P.D. 293.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> Being a builder in good faith, he believes that he is entitled to the reimbursement of his useful expenses and that he has a right to retain possession of the premises, pending reimbursement of the value of his improvements to be proven during trial, in accordance with Article 545 of the Civil Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>Upon perusal of the records, however, we hold that petitioner is not a builder in good faith. A builder in good faith is “one who builds with the belief that the land he is building on is his, or that by some title one has the right to build thereon, and is ignorant of any defect or flaw in his title.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> Since petitioner only started occupying the property sometime in 1995 (when his predecessor-in-interest executed an Affidavit in his favor), or about seven years after <i>Tuason</i> was promulgated, he should have been aware of the binding effect of that ruling. Since all judicial decisions form part of the law of the land, its existence should be “[o]n one hand, x x x matter of mandatory judicial notice; on the other, <i>ignorantia legis non excusat.</i>”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> He thus loses whatever he has built on the property, without right to indemnity, in accordance with Article 449 of the Civil Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is hereby <b>DISMISSED</b>.
