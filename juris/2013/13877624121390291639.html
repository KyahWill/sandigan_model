It found that the impending blacklisting of PGAI constitutes a good reason for allowing the execution pending appeal (also known as “discretionary execution”) considering that the imposition of international sanctions on any single local insurance company puts in grave and immediate jeopardy not only the viability of that company but also the integrity of the entire local insurance system including that of the state insurance agency. It pointed out that the insurance business thrives on credibility which is maintained by honoring financial commitments.<br><br>On the claimed exemption of GSIS funds from execution, the CA held that such exemption only covers funds under the Social Insurance Fund which remains liable for the payment of benefits like retirement, disability and death compensation and not those covered under the General Insurance Fund, as in this case, which are meant for investment in the business of insurance and reinsurance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>GSIS’ motion for reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> was denied by the CA in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> dated October 6, 2004.

No. 165585</b>, whether the CA erred in (1) upholding the RTC’s February 14, 2002 Order authorizing execution pending appeal, and (2) ruling that only the Social Insurance Fund and not the General Fund of the GSIS is exempt from garnishment; and (b) in <b>G.R. No. 176982</b>, whether the CA erred in sustaining the RTC’s January 11, 2002 Order rendering judgment on the pleadings.<br><br><center><b>The Court’s Ruling</b></center><br>The petitions are partly meritorious.<br><br><b><i>A. Good reasons to allow execution pending<br> appeal and the nature of the exemption under<br> Section 39 of RA 8291.</i></b><br><br>The execution of a judgment pending appeal is an exception to the general rule that only a final judgment may be executed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> In order to grant the same pursuant to Section 2,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> Rule 39 of the Rules, the following requisites must concur: (a) there must be a motion by the prevailing party with notice to the adverse party; (b) there must be a good reason for execution pending appeal; and (c) the good reason must be stated in a special order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup><br><br>Good reasons call for the attendance of compelling circumstances warranting immediate execution for fear that favorable judgment may yield to an empty victory. In this regard, the Rules do not categorically and strictly define what constitutes “good reason,” and hence, its presence or absence must be determined in view of the peculiar circumstances of each case. As a guide, jurisprudence dictates that the “good reason” yardstick imports a superior circumstance that will outweigh injury or damage to the adverse party.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> Corollarily, the requirement of “good reason” does not necessarily entail unassailable and flawless basis but at the very least, an invocation thereof must be premised on solid footing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, the RTC, as affirmed by the CA, granted PGAI’s motion for execution pending appeal on the ground that the impending sanctions against it by foreign underwriters/reinsurers constitute good reasons therefor. It must, however, be observed that PGAI has not proffered any evidence to substantiate its claim, as it merely presented bare allegations thereon. It is hornbook doctrine that mere allegations do not constitute proof. As held in <i>Real v. Belo</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> “[i]t is basic in the rule of evidence that bare allegations, unsubstantiated by evidence, are not equivalent to proof. In short, mere allegations are not evidence.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> Hence, without any sufficient basis to support the existence of its alleged “good reasons,” it cannot be said that the second requisite to allow an execution pending appeal exists. To reiterate, the requirement of “good reasons” must be premised on solid footing so as to ensure that the “superior circumstance” which would impel immediate execution is not merely contrived or based on speculation. This, however, PGAI failed to demonstrate in the present case. In fine, the Court therefore holds that the CA’s affirmance of the RTC’s February 14, 2002 Order authorizing execution pending appeal, as well as the February 19, 2002 issuances related thereto, was improper.<br><br>Nevertheless, while an execution pending appeal should not lie in view of the above-discussed reasons, it must be noted that the funds and assets of GSIS may – after the resolution of the appeal and barring any provisional injunction thereto – be subject to execution, attachment, garnishment or levy since the exemption under Section 39 of RA 8291<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> does not operate to deny private entities from properly enforcing their contractual claims against GSIS.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> This has been established in the case of <i>Rubia </i>wherein the Court held as follows:<br><br><blockquote>[T]he declared policy of the State in <b>Section 39</b> of the GSIS Charter granting GSIS an exemption from tax, lien, attachment, levy, execution, and other legal processes should be read together with the grant of power to the GSIS to invest its “excess funds” under Section 36 of the same Act.&nbsp; Under Section 36, the GSIS is granted the ancillary power to invest in business and other ventures for the benefit of the employees, by using its excess funds for investment purposes. In the exercise of such function and power, the GSIS is allowed to assume a character similar to a private corporation.&nbsp; Thus, it may sue and be sued, as also explicitly granted by its charter.&nbsp; <b>Needless to say, where proper, under Section 36, the GSIS may be held liable for the contracts it has entered into in the course of its business investments</b>.&nbsp; For GSIS cannot claim a special immunity from liability in regard to its business ventures under said Section. <b> Nor can it deny contracting parties, in our view, the right of redress and the enforcement of a claim, particularly as it arises from a purely contractual relationship of a private character between an individual and the GSIS.</b> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> (Emphases supplied and citations omitted)</blockquote><br>Thus, the petition in <b>G.R. No. 165585</b> is partly granted.<br><br><b><i>B. Propriety of judgment on the pleadings.</i></b><br><br>Judgment on the pleadings is appropriate when an answer fails to tender an issue, or otherwise admits the material allegations of the adverse party’s pleading. The rule is stated in Section 1, Rule 34 of the Rules which reads as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 1. <i>Judgment on the pleadings.</i> – Where an answer fails to tender an issue, or otherwise admits the material allegations of the adverse party’s pleading, the court may, on motion of that party, direct judgment on such pleading. x x x.</blockquote><br>In this relation, jurisprudence dictates that an answer fails to tender an issue if it does not comply with the requirements of a specific denial as set out in Sections 8<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> and 10,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> Rule 8 of the Rules, resulting in the admission of the material allegations of the adverse party’s pleadings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> As such, it is a form of judgment that is exclusively based on the submitted pleadings without the introduction of evidence as the factual issues remain uncontroverted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup><br><br>In this case, records disclose that in its Answer, GSIS admitted the material allegations of PGAI’s complaint warranting the grant of the relief prayed for. In particular, GSIS admitted that: (a) it made a request for reinsurance cover which PGAI accepted in a reinsurance binder effective for one year;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> (b) it remitted only the first three reinsurance premium payments to PGAI;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> (c) it failed to pay PGAI the fourth and final reinsurance premium installment;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> and (d) it received demand letters from PGAI.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> It also did not refute the allegation of PGAI that it settled reinsurance claims during the reinsured period. On the basis of these admissions, the Court finds that the CA did not err in affirming the propriety of a judgment on the pleadings.<br><br>GSIS’ affirmative defense that the non-payment of the last reinsurance premium merely rendered the contract ineffective pursuant to Section 77<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> of PD 612 no longer involves any factual issue, but stands solely as a mere question of law in the light of the foregoing admissions hence allowing for a judgment on the pleadings. Besides, in the case of <i>Makati Tuscany</i>, the Court already ruled that the non-payment of subsequent installment premiums would not prevent the insurance contract from taking effect; that the parties intended to make the insurance contract valid and binding is evinced from the fact that the insured paid – and the insurer received – several reinsurance premiums due thereon, although the former refused to pay the remaining balance, <i>viz</i>.:<br><br><blockquote>We hold that the subject policies are valid even if the premiums were paid on installments. The records clearly show that petitioner and private respondent intended subject insurance policies to be binding and effective notwithstanding the staggered payment of the premiums. The initial insurance contract entered into in 1982 was renewed in 1983, then in 1984. In those three (3) years, the insurer accepted all the installment payments. Such acceptance of payments speaks loudly of the insurer’s intention to honor the policies it issued to petitioner. Certainly, basic principles of equity and fairness would not allow the insurer to continue collecting and accepting the premiums, although paid on installments, and later deny liability on the lame excuse that the premiums were not prepaid in full.<br><br>We therefore sustain the Court of Appeals. <b> </b>contained in its Resolution denying the motion to reconsider its Decision —<br><br><b>While the import of Section 77 is that prepayment of premiums is strictly required as a condition to the validity of the contract, We are not prepared to rule that the request to make installment payments duly approved by the insurer, would prevent the entire contract of insurance from going into effect despite payment and acceptance of the initial premium or first installment.</b> Section 78 of the Insurance Code in effect allows waiver by the insurer of the condition of prepayment by making an acknowledgment in the insurance policy of receipt of premium as conclusive evidence of payment so far as to make the policy binding despite the fact that premium is actually unpaid. <b>Section 77 merely precludes the parties from stipulating that the policy is valid even if premiums are not paid, but does not expressly prohibit an agreement granting credit extension, and such an agreement is not contrary to morals, good customs, public order or public policy</b> (De Leon, the Insurance Code, at p. 175). So is an understanding to allow insured to pay premiums in installments not so proscribed. <b>At the very least, both parties should be deemed in estoppel to question the arrangement they have voluntarily accepted.</b><br><br>[I]n the case before Us,<b> petitioner paid the initial installment and thereafter made staggered payments resulting in full payment of the 1982 and 1983 insurance policies.</b> For the 1984 policy, <b>petitioner paid two (2) installments although it refused to pay the balance.</b><br><br><b>It appearing from the peculiar circumstances that the parties actually intended to make three (3) insurance contracts valid, effective and binding, petitioner may not be allowed to renege on its obligation to pay the balance of the premium after the expiration of the whole term of the third policy</b> (No. AH-CPP-9210651) in March 1985. Moreover, as correctly observed by the appellate court, where the risk is entire and the contract is indivisible, the insured is <b>not entitled to a refund of the premiums paid if the insurer was exposed to the risk insured for any period, however brief or momentary</b>. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> (Emphases supplied and citation omitted)</blockquote><br>Thus, owing to the identical complexion of <i>Makati Tuscany</i> with the present case,&nbsp; the Court upholds PGAI’s right to be paid by GSIS the amount of the fourth and last reinsurance premium pursuant to the reinsurance contract between them.
