Labrador (Labrador) despite his adjudged dismissal from service.<br><br><center><b>The Facts</b></center><br>Labrador was the former Chief of the POEA’s Employment Services Regulation Division (ESRD). On May 2, 1997, then Labor Secretary Leonardo A. Quisumbing (Quisumbing) ordered his dismissal from service as he was found to have bribed a certain Madoline Villapando, an overseas Filipino worker, in the amount of P6,200.00 in order to expedite the issuance of her overseas employment certificate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>&nbsp; Labrador’s dismissal was affirmed on appeal by the Civil Service Commission (CSC) through CSC Resolution No. 03-0339 dated March 12, 2003,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> and his subsequent motion for reconsideration was denied through CSC Resolution No. 040547 dated May 17, 2004.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Aside from the foregoing administrative proceedings, a criminal case for direct bribery was instituted against Labrador in view of the same infraction. Consequently, on August 31, 1999, the Sandiganbayan (SB) promulgated a Decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> convicting him of the aforementioned crime and thereby sentenced him to: (a) suffer an indeterminate penalty of six (6) months of <i>arresto mayor</i>, as minimum, to two (2) years of <i>prision correccional</i>, as maximum; (b) pay a fine of P3,000.00; (<i>c</i>) suffer the penalty of temporary special disqualification from public office; and (<i>d</i>) pay costs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Labrador’s motion for reconsideration was denied in a Resolution dated November 17, 1999,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> prompting him to elevate the matter to the Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>In a Resolution dated January 26, 2000<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> (January 26, 2000 Resolution), the Court affirmed Labrador’s conviction and subsequently denied his motion for reconsideration with finality on March 15, 2000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Likewise, in a Resolution dated June 28, 2000,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> the Court denied Labrador’s motion for leave to file a second motion for reconsideration with motion for new trial and prayer for referral to the Court <i>En Banc,</i> resulting in the January 26, 2000 Resolution’s entry of judgment. On October 26, 2000, the SB received copies of the same resolution and its corresponding entry of judgment through a Letter of Transmittal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> dated August 23, 2000 which contained an explicit directive from the Court for the SB to submit proof of execution within fifteen (15) days from receipt. As such, the SB immediately set the case for this purpose.<br><br>On February 26, 2001, Labrador’s counsel <i>de oficio</i>, Atty.

Thus, in an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> of even date, the SB resolved to accord Labrador a period of fifteen (15) days within which to file such application, and, in the meantime, suspended the execution proceedings.<br><br>Eventually, upon favorable recommendation of the Parole and Probation Office, the SB, in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> dated September 28, 2001, granted Labrador’s application for probation and likewise cancelled the bail bond he posted for his provisional liberty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Thereafter, at the end of Labrador’s probation period, a Probation Officer’s Final Report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> dated November 4, 2003 was issued, recommending that his probation be terminated and that he be discharged from its legal effects.

Yet, the COA no longer responded to the said plea, prompting Dimapilis-Baldoz to file this petition for <i>certiorari</i>.<br><br><center><b>The Issue Before the Court</b></center><br>The primordial issue for the Court’s resolution is whether or not grave abuse of discretion attended the COA’s disallowance in this case.<br><br><center><b>The Court’s Ruling</b></center><br>The petition is partly meritorious<br><br><b><i>A.&nbsp; Grave abuse of discretion; reckoning <br>point of period of disallowance.&nbsp; </i></b><br><br>It is fundamental that the COA has the authority to rule on the legality of the disbursement of government funds. This finds force in Section 2, Article IX-D of the 1987 Philippine Constitution (Constitution) which explicitly provides that:<br><br><blockquote>D. THE COMMISSION ON AUDIT<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Section 2.<br><ol><li> The Commission on Audit shall have the power, authority, and duty to examine, audit, and settle all accounts pertaining to the revenue and receipts of, and expenditures or uses of funds and property, owned or held in trust by, or pertaining to, the Government, or any of its subdivisions, agencies, or instrumentalities, including government-owned or controlled corporations with original charters, and on a post- audit basis:<br><br>a. constitutional bodies, commissions and offices that have been granted fiscal autonomy under this Constitution;<br><br>b. autonomous state colleges and universities;<br><br>c. other government-owned or controlled corporations and their subsidiaries; and<br><br>d. such non-governmental entities receiving subsidy or equity, directly or indirectly, from or through the Government, which are required by law or the granting institution to submit to such audit as a condition of subsidy or equity. x x x<br><br>x x x x<br><br></li><li>The Commission shall have exclusive authority, subject to the limitations in this Article, to define the scope of its audit and examination, establish the techniques and methods required therefor, and promulgate accounting and auditing rules and regulations, including those for the prevention and disallowance of irregular, unnecessary, excessive, extravagant, or unconscionable expenditures or uses of government funds and properties.</li></ol></blockquote><br>Section 11, Chapter 4, Subtitle B, Title I, Book V of Executive Order No. 292, otherwise known as the “Administrative Code of 1987” (Administrative Code), echoes this constitutional mandate, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 11. <i>General Jurisdiction</i>. – (1) The Commission on Audit shall have the power, authority, and duty to examine, audit, and settle all accounts pertaining to the revenue and receipts of, and expenditures or uses of funds and property, owned or held in trust by, or pertaining to, the Government, or any of its subdivisions, agencies, or instrumentalities, including government-owned or controlled corporations with original charters, and on a post-audit basis: (a) constitutional bodies, commissions and offices that have been granted fiscal autonomy under this Constitution; (b) autonomous state colleges and universities; (c) other government-owned or controlled corporations and their subsidiaries; and (d) such non-governmental entities receiving subsidy or equity, directly or indirectly, from or through the Government, which are required by law or the granting institution to submit to such audit as a condition of subsidy or equity. x x x<br><br>(2) The Commission shall have exclusive authority, subject to the limitations in this Article, to define the scope of its audit and examination, establish the techniques and methods required therefor, and promulgate accounting and auditing rules and regulations, including those for the prevention and disallowance of irregular, unnecessary, excessive, extravagant, or unconscionable expenditures, or uses of government funds and properties.</blockquote><br>In view of the foregoing, it has been pronounced that the COA’s exercise of its general audit power is among the constitutional mechanisms that gives life to the check and balance system inherent in our form of government. Furthermore, it has also been declared that the COA is endowed with enough latitude to determine, prevent, and disallow irregular, unnecessary, excessive, extravagant or unconscionable expenditures of government funds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Pursuant to its mandate, the COA disallowed the disbursements pertaining to the personnel benefits paid to Labrador, reasoning that the latter should have stopped reporting for work as early as June 28, 2000 when the denial of his appeal from the SB’s August 31, 1999 Decision rendered his conviction for the crime of direct bribery final and executory, notwithstanding the grant of his application for probation. In this regard, it opines that the period of disallowance should be reckoned from <b><u>May 3, 2000</u></b> which is the date the SB’s August 31, 1999 Decision had become final and executory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>While Dimapilis-Baldoz takes no exception to the COA’s authority to disallow any illegal disbursements, she argues that its disallowance of the subject amounts pertaining to Labrador’s salaries and benefits should have been reckoned only from <b><u>March 2, 2004</u></b>, which is the time the SB set aside its initial resolution granting Labrador’s application for probation and directing the latter to finally serve the penalties imposed against him, more significantly, his temporary special disqualification from public office.<br><br>The Court holds that neither of these positions adopts a proper perspective toward the attendant facts of the case.<br><br>Significant to the determination of the appropriate period of the disallowance is the undisputed fact that, pursuant to an order issued by then Labor Secretary Quisumbing, <b><i><u>Labrador had already been made to suffer the administrative penalty of dismissal from service on May 2, 1997</u></i></b>, which was long before the SB convicted him of direct bribery on August 31, 1999. As a matter of law, a department secretary’s decision confirming the removal of an officer under his authority is immediately executory, even pending further remedy by the dismissed public officer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>&nbsp; On this score, Section 47(2), Chapter 6, Subtitle A, Title I, Book V of the Administrative Code, as amended,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> expressly provides:<br><br><blockquote>(2) The <b>Secretaries</b> and heads of agencies and instrumentalities, provinces, cities and municipalities shall have jurisdiction to investigate and decide matters involving <b>disciplinary action against officers and employees under their jurisdiction</b>. Their decisions shall be final in case the penalty imposed is suspension for not more than thirty days or fine in an amount not exceeding thirty days' salary. In case the decision rendered by a bureau or office head is appealable to the Commission, the same may be initially appealed to the department and finally to the Commission and pending appeal, the same shall be executory <b><u>except when the penalty is removal, in which case the same shall be executory only after confirmation by the Secretary concerned</u></b>. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>In <i>Bangalisan v. CA</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> the Court upheld the immediate execution of the Education Secretary’s decision dismissing or suspending a band of striking public school teachers pursuant to the above-cited provision (Section 47<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">[2]</span>):<br><br><blockquote>As to the immediate execution of the decision of the Secretary against petitioners, the same is authorized by Section 47, paragraph (2), of Executive Oder No. 292, thus: “The Secretaries and heads of agencies and instrumentalities, provinces, cities and municipalities shall have jurisdiction to investigate and decide matters involving disciplinary action against officers and employees under their jurisdiction. Their decisions shall be final in case the penalty imposed is suspension for not more than thirty days or fine in an amount not exceeding thirty days' salary. In case the decision rendered by a bureau or office head is appealable to the Commission, the same shall be executory except when the penalty is removal, in which case the same shall be executory only after confirmation by the Secretary concerned.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></blockquote><br>Likewise, in the subsequent cases of <i>De la Cruz v. CA</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> and <i>Hon. Gloria v. CA</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> the Court similarly affirmed the import of Section 47(2) on the immediate effect of administrative sanctions upon final order by the department secretary or head of agency.<br><br>Hence, based on these authorities, then Labor Secretary Quisumbing’s order of dismissal in this case should have also been executed immediately upon its issuance on May 2, 1997. In this accord, Labrador should not have been allowed to report for work from such date, much less receive any salary or benefit accruing from his previous post.<br><br>At this juncture, it is well to note that neither the grant nor subsequent revocation of Labrador’s probation should hold any relevance to his disqualification from office.<br><br>As correctly argued by the COA, the grant of probation does not justify a public employee’s retention in the government service. This was settled in the case of the <i>Office of the Court Administrator v. Librado</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> wherein the Court declared:<br><br><blockquote>x x x While indeed the purpose of the Probation Law (P.D. No. 968, as amended) is to save valuable human material, it must not be forgotten that unlike pardon probation does not obliterate the crime [for] which the person under probation has been convicted.&nbsp; <b><u>The reform and rehabilitation of the probationer cannot justify his retention in the government service</u>.&nbsp; He may seek to re-enter government service, but only after he has shown that he is fit to serve once again</b>. It cannot be repeated too often that a public office is a public trust, which demands of those in its service the highest degree of morality. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>Thus, irrespective of the incidents concerning Labrador’s probation, the concomitant effects of his conviction, more significantly, his disqualification to hold public office, were already left for him to suffer at the time the SB’s August 31, 1999 Decision became final and executory on May 3, 2000 which is the same date the COA posits as the reckoning point of its period of disallowance. However, as earlier discussed, the proper reckoning point for the said disallowance should be pegged at <b><u>May 2, 1997</u></b>, since Labrador had already been dismissed from the service at such time and hence, had already been disqualified from receiving any salary or benefit attendant to his post. In this light, the Court finds no reason to engage in a discussion on the date the SB’s August 31, 1999 Decision had actually become final and executory. It is key, however, to ascertain how the fact of Labrador’s May 2, 1997 dismissal figures into the finding of grave abuse of discretion in this case.<br><br>Jurisprudence instructs that not every error in the proceedings, or every erroneous conclusion of law or fact, constitutes grave abuse of discretion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> The abuse of discretion to be qualified as “grave” must be so patent or gross as to constitute an evasion of a positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform the duty or to act at all in contemplation of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>Applying these principles to the case at bar, no grave abuse of discretion can be attributed to the COA in fixing the reckoning point of the period of disallowance at May 3, 2000, since records are bereft of any showing that it had any knowledge of Labrador’s prior dismissal on May 2, 1997. To hold otherwise would be simply antithetical to the concept of grave abuse of discretion, much less countenance a speculative endeavor.<br><br>Be that as it may, the Court cannot, nevertheless, sanction the erroneous finding that the disallowance of the POEA’s illegal disbursements to Labrador should only be reckoned from May 3, 2000 when he was, in fact, already dismissed as early as May 2, 1997. The salaries of government employees clearly constitute public funds<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> which should, at all times, be properly accounted for. In this relation, the Constitution vests the COA with the primary responsibility to ensure that any irregularity in the disbursement of the same is cleared, or any attendant illegality be proscribed. Yet, when a significant fact which would impact this process is missed – as in this case, the May 2, 1997 dismissal of Labrador – the public nature of the above-mentioned interests impels the Court to judiciously mind the COA of such fact if only to aid the latter to fulfill its constitutional mandate as well as to avert any loss on the part of the government. <b><i><u>Verily, public funds are the property of the people and must be used prudently at all times with a view to prevent dissipation and waste.</u></i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> As such, the COA must correct its previous issuances in this case in order to reflect the actual date of Labrador’s dismissal which would also be the proper reckoning point of the period of disallowance.<br><br><b><i>B. Grave abuse of discretion; personal<br> liability of Dimapilis-Baldoz.&nbsp; </i></b><br><br>An equally compelling incident relevant to the finding of grave abuse of discretion in this case is the adjudged personal liability of Dimapilis-Baldoz, among other POEA personnel.<br><br>Essentially, Dimapilis-Baldoz tries to exculpate herself from the foregoing by arguing that she and her office were not officially notified of the orders, resolutions, and decisions of the SB or that of the Court, affirming Labrador’s conviction of the crime of direct bribery, and even the notices on the subsequent actions and proceedings undertaken by the SB.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> In fact, In her letter for reconsideration addressed to the COA’s Legal and Adjudication Office,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Dimapilis-Baldoz alleged that Labrador’s 201 file is bereft of any records regarding the SB case. While admitting that Labrador did indeed continue to report for work despite the SB’s August 31, 1999 Decision convicting him of direct bribery, these antecedents show that she merely acted in good faith and lawfully exercised her duties when she approved the payment of Labrador’s salaries, wages, and other personnel benefits for the period beginning August 31, 1999 to March 2, 2004.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>The Court finds the defense to be well-taken.<br><br>It is a standing rule that every public official is entitled to the presumption of good faith in the discharge of official duties,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> such that, in the absence of any proof that a public officer has acted with malice or bad faith, he should not be charged with personal liability for damages that may result from the performance of an official duty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> <b><i><u>Good faith is always presumed and he who alleges the contrary bears the burden</u></i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> <b><i><u>to convincingly show that malice or bad faith attended the public officer’s performance of his duties</u></i></b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>Keeping with these principles, the Court observes that Dimapilis-Baldoz’s actuations were only impressed with good faith which perforce, negates her personal liability in this case.<br><br>To elucidate, while the COA correctly affirmed the disallowance of the salaries and benefits which Labrador unduly received when he continued to hold office despite his conviction, the liability for refund cannot be imposed upon Dimapilis-Baldoz because she had no knowledge or any reasonable indication that the payment of salaries to Labrador was actually improper. Two important incidents impel this conclusion: <b><i><u>first</u></i></b>, Labrador’s 201 File with the POEA was without any record of the SB case; and <b><i><u>second</u></i></b>, Dimapilis-Baldoz was only apprised of his conviction when her office was furnished a copy of the SB’s March 2, 2004 Resolution which ordered the revocation of Labrador’s probation. In addition, Dimapilis-Baldoz’s good faith is further strengthened by the fact that she lost no time in issuing the Separation Order as soon as she was apprised of Labrador’s situation. Thus, absent any proof to the contrary, it cannot be gainsaid that Dimapilis-Baldoz’s approval was spurred only by the honest belief that the payment of salaries disbursed to Labrador was due and owing to him.<br><br>It is well to stress that neither will it do justice to hold Dimapilis-Baldoz personally liable simply because she possessed the final authority for the disbursements and had direct supervision over her subordinates.&nbsp; Case law exhorts that <b><i><u>although a public officer is the final approving authority and the employees who processed the transaction were directly under his supervision, personal liability does not automatically attach to him but only upon those directly responsible for the unlawful expenditures.</u></i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> As Dimapilis-Baldoz’s direct responsibility therefor had not been demonstrated, in addition to her good faith as above-discussed, there is no cogent factual or legal basis to hold her personally liable. In this respect, the Court finds that the COA gravely abused its discretion.<br><br>As to how the matter of Labrador’s administrative penalty of dismissal from the service escaped notice – not to mention, implementation – is not revealed in the records before the Court; but it can be easily surmised that the POEA’s incapability to deal with a twice-dismissed employee was largely attributable to bureaucratic incompetence. It bears emphasizing that it is the policy of the State to maintain honesty and integrity in the public service and take positive and effective measures against graft and corruption.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup>&nbsp; It should, therefore, be the responsibility of each government agency, such as the POEA, to know matters pertaining to the conduct of its own employees in the performance of their duties and to readily take action against those undeserving of the public’s trust.&nbsp; To be an effective agent at exacting accountability from those under its direct authority, government agencies would do well to devise a coordinative system to ensure that records of personnel actions concerning its individual employees are properly updated and secured on file, especially all administrative and criminal cases decided against them.<br><br>In view of the foregoing pronouncements, the Court finds it unnecessary to delve on the other ancillary issues raised in this case.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>PARTLY GRANTED</b>. Accordingly, Notice of Disallowance No. 2006-002 dated January 18, 2006 and Decision No. 2009-121 dated October 29, 2009 issued by respondent Commission on Audit is <b>AFFIRMED</b> with <b>MODIFICATION</b>, (a) deleting the portions pertaining to petitioner Rosalinda Dimapilis-Baldoz’s personal liability; and (b) adjusting the proper period of disallowance from the date of Leonel P. Labrador’s dismissal on May 2, 1997. The foregoing is without prejudice to any subsequent action or proceeding to recover any undue amount/s received by Labrador.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Sereno, C.J.
