CV No. 85751, the appeal questioned the trial court’s P1,960.00 valuation, claiming that in arriving at such amount, the trial court disregarded other documentary evidence such as the assessed value, tax declaration, the BIR zonal valuation, and the appraisal report of the Lipa City Assessor.<br><br>The CA sustained the trial court’s reliance on the Lipa City Assessor and the Registrar of Deeds’s May 3, 2005 Joint Commissioners’ Report, finding that the same took into consideration the fair market value of the subject portion, the condition of the surroundings, the improvements introduced, the character of the property, and the value of adjacent and nearby properties as shown by the deeds of sale covering the same.&nbsp; The CA also noted that in 2000, petitioner bought a 36-square meter portion of respondents’ property at P1,300.00 per square meter, which means that as of 2000, respondents’ property already had a market value of P1,300.00 per square meter.<br><br>The CA added that with the passage of time and construction of the STAR tollway beside respondents’ property, the value thereof has appreciated.&nbsp; These factors and circumstances were not taken into consideration in Mecate’s April 25, 2005 report.<br><br>The CA further held that the May 3, 2005 Joint Commissioners’ Report is the majority decision of the constituted board of commissioners.&nbsp; Such being the case, the trial court may not be faulted for relying thereon.&nbsp; In the absence of abuse on the part of the commissioners or the trial court, their determination regarding just compensation must be sustained.<br><br>The CA thus affirmed the trial court’s Decision, with the modification that the amount deposited by petitioner shall be deducted from the adjudged just compensation of P2,263,800.00, thus:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the appealed Decision dated August 18, 2005 is affirmed, subject to the modification that the preliminary deposit of P115,000.00 with Land Bank of the Philippines shall be deducted from the total amount of just compensation of P2,263,800.00.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></blockquote><br>Unable to obtain a reconsideration of the appellate court’s Decision, petitioners filed the present Petition.<br><br><center><b>Issues</b></center><br>Petitioner assigns the following issues for resolution:<br><br><blockquote><center>I</center><br>THE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED IN AFFIRMING THE TRIAL COURT’S DECISION FIXING THE JUST COMPENSATION AT P1,960.00 PER SQUARE METER DESPITE ITS FAILURE TO CONSIDER ALL FACTORS IN ARRIVING AT SAID AMOUNT OF JUST COMPENSATION PRESCRIBED UNDER THE APPLICABLE LAWS.<br><br><center>II</center><br>THE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED IN AFFIRMING THE TRIAL COURT’S ERRONEOUS RELIANCE ON THE JOINT COMMISSIONERS’ REPORT RECOMMENDING THE AMOUNT OF P1,960.00 PER SQUARE METER, AN AMOUNT WHICH IS EXCESSIVE, HIGHLY SPECULATIVE, UNSUBSTANTIATED AND CONTRARY TO THE RULES AND APPLICABLE JURISPRUDENCE FOR DETERMINING JUST COMPENSATION.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></blockquote><br><b><i>Petitioner’s Arguments</i></b><br><br>Petitioner argues that the CA’s reliance on the Joint Commissioners’ Report is erroneous because the said report failed to consider all factors prescribed by law specifically Republic Act (RA) No. 8974<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> in determining just compensation.&nbsp; Petitioner asserts that under RA 8974, there are standards for the assessment of the value of the expropriated land which the trial court and the commissioners concerned failed to consider, thus:<br><br><blockquote>Section 5. Standards for the Assessment of the Value of the Land Subject of Expropriation Proceedings or Negotiated Sale. - In order to facilitate the determination of just compensation, the court may consider, among other well-established factors, the following relevant standards:<br><br>(a) The classification and use for which the property is suited;<br><br>(b) The developmental costs for improving the land;<br><br>(c) The value declared by the owners;<br><br>(d) The current selling price of similar lands in the vicinity;<br><br>(e) The reasonable disturbance compensation for the removal and/or demolition of certain improvement on the land and for the value of improvements thereon;<br><br>(f) The size, shape or location, tax declaration and zonal valuation of the land;<br><br>(g) The price of the land as manifested in the ocular findings, oral as well as documentary evidence presented; and<br><br>(h) Such facts and events as to enable the affected property owners to have sufficient funds to acquire similarly-situated lands of approximate areas as those required from them by the government, and thereby rehabilitate themselves as early as possible.</blockquote><br>Petitioner adds that under Section 6<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> of Rule 67 of the Rules of Court, commissioners in an expropriation case should assess the consequential damages to the property not taken and deduct from such consequential damages the consequential benefits to be derived by the owner from the public use or purpose of the property taken, the operation of its franchise by the corporation or the carrying on of the business of the corporation or person taking the property; but in no case shall the consequential benefits assessed exceed the consequential damages assessed, or the owner be deprived of the actual value of his property so taken.<br><br>Petitioner also argues that it is erroneous for the CA to affirm the trial court’s Decision, which disregarded absolutely Mecate’s April 25, 2005 Commissioner’s Report, which properly took into consideration the BIR zonal valuation, the assessed value, tax declarations covering the property, and the character of the subject portion sought to be expropriated.&nbsp; It adds that the trial court’s valuation is grossly excessive, considering that the subject portion is merely agricultural land.<br><br>Petitioner thus prays that the CA Decision be reversed and set aside, and that the Court render judgment modifying the trial court’s Decision, thus reducing the amount of just compensation for the subject portion from P1,960.00 per square meter to between P400.00 and P600.00 per square meter.<br><br><b><i>Respondents’ Arguments</i></b><br><br>Respondents insist in their Comment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> that the trial court’s judgment, as affirmed by the CA, is supported by evidence, in accord with existing jurisprudence, and, echoing the trial court, reasonable, fair, and realistic.&nbsp; On the other hand, Mecate’s Commissioner’s Report fails to take into consideration the previous acquisition by the petitioner of a portion of their property at P1,300.00 per square meter in 2000; the fair market value of the property; and decisions of the Court which emphasize that in the determination of just compensation, it is not only the value appearing on the tax declarations and BIR zonal valuations that are considered, but also the nature, character and condition of the land, as well as its surroundings, improvements and capabilities.<br><br>Respondents conclude that the adjudged just compensation in the amount of P1,960.00 per square meter for the subject portion is not excessive.<br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b></center><br>The Petition must be denied.<br><br>This Court is not a trier of facts.&nbsp; Questions of fact may not be raised in a petition brought under Rule 45, as such petition may only raise questions of law.&nbsp; This rule applies in expropriation cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup>&nbsp; Moreover, factual findings of the trial court, when affirmed by the CA, are generally binding on this Court.&nbsp; An evaluation of the case and the issues presented leads the Court to the conclusion that it is unnecessary to deviate from the findings of fact of the trial and appellate courts.<br><br>Under Section 8<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> of Rule 67 of the Rules of Court, the trial court sitting as an expropriation court may, after hearing, accept the commissioners’ report and render judgment in accordance therewith.&nbsp; This is what the trial court did in this case.&nbsp; The CA affirmed the trial court’s pronouncement <i>in toto.</i>&nbsp; Given these facts, the trial court and the CA’s identical findings of fact concerning the issue of just compensation should be accorded the greatest respect, and are binding on the Court absent proof that they committed error in establishing the facts and in drawing conclusions from them.&nbsp; There being no showing that the trial court and the CA committed any error, we thus accord due respect to their findings.<br><br>The only legal question raised by the petitioner relates to the commissioners’ and the trial court’s alleged failure to take into consideration, in arriving at the amount of just compensation, Section 5 of RA 8974 enumerating the standards for assessing the value of expropriated land taken for national government infrastructure projects.&nbsp; What escapes petitioner, however, is that the courts are not bound to consider these standards; the exact wording of the said provision is that “in order to facilitate the determination of just compensation, the courts <b>may</b> consider” them.&nbsp; The use of the word “may” in the provision is construed as permissive and operating to confer discretion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>&nbsp; In the absence of a finding of abuse, the exercise of such discretion may not be interfered with.&nbsp; For this case, the Court finds no such abuse of discretion.<br><br>Besides, a cursory review of the May 3, 2005 Joint Commissioners’ Report leads one to the conclusion, without need of further elaboration, that the commissioners and the trial court did not ignore absolutely the standards enumerated in Section 5.&nbsp; Quite the contrary, they took into consideration several of these standards in arriving at the amount of just compensation, specifically:<br><blockquote>(a) The classification and use for which the property is suited;<br><br>(b) The current selling price of similar lands in the vicinity;<br><br>(c) The size, shape or location, and tax declaration of the land; and<br><br>(d) The price of the land as manifested in the ocular findings, oral as well as documentary evidence presented.<br></blockquote><br>In fact, the May 3, 2005 Joint Commissioners’ Report took into consideration four out of the eight standards enumerated in Section 5.&nbsp; This can hardly be termed a total disregard of Section 5.<br><br>On the other hand, Mecate’s April 25, 2005 Commissioner’s Report evidently failed to consider factors other than the value of the subject portion as reflected in the tax declarations, the BIR zonal valuation, and its classification as an agricultural land.&nbsp; Although Mecate professes to base her Report on the fair market value of the property, current values of like properties, the property’s actual or potential uses, and location, still in reality these factors were not taken into account in arriving at the conclusions contained in her Report.&nbsp; To make matters worse, Mecate based her Report on the 1998 Appraisal Committee Report of the Lipa City Appraisal Committee, which is clearly obsolete and does not reflect 2004 property values. The Complaint for expropriation was filed in 2004; thus, just compensation should be based on 2004 valuations.&nbsp; “Where the institution of the action precedes entry into the property, the just compensation is to be ascertained as of the time of the filing of the complaint.” <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>It is quite evident that petitioner is a desperate buyer of the subject portion.&nbsp; It needs the property for the Balete-Lipa City Interchange Ramp B, and no property other than the subject portion could answer this need.&nbsp; Having purchased a portion of respondents’ property in 2000 at P1,300.00 per square meter – by <b>negotiated sale</b> at that – there appears to be no reason why it should not be made to pay just compensation at a premium four years later.&nbsp; It is evidently unfair and absurd that, after negotiating a sale at a higher price of P1,300.00, petitioner should later insist on a lower P600.00, P400.00, or even P100.00 valuation for the same land four years after such negotiated sale.&nbsp; It should be bound by the higher P1,300.00 valuation, at the very least.&nbsp; Given the increase in population and rate of growth and progress in the country, it is highly unlikely if not impossible that property values would take a downward trend. This applies to Lipa City especially; the Joint Commissioners’ Report indicates how the city has rapidly progressed through the years – where once there was grass, concrete structures now stand.<br><br>Moreover, of note are petitioner’s several purchases of land within the vicinity, ranging from P500.00 up to P3,000.00 per square meter, from 1997 up to 2003.&nbsp; The average price of all these purchases within the vicinity amounts to P1,960.00 per square meter.&nbsp; Although it may be said that from the facts this amount is low, the respondents have nonetheless given their assent to this valuation in their June 23, 2005 Comment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> as well as in their July 25, 2008 Comment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> filed before this Court.&nbsp; Thus, as to them, the market value of the subject portion is P1,960.00 per square meter.&nbsp; As for the petitioner – a desperate buyer of the subject portion which is absolutely necessary to link the existing highway to the city – this is what it should be made to pay for the subject portion.&nbsp; It must be remembered that “[t]he market value of the property is the price that may be agreed upon by parties willing but not compelled to enter into a sale.&nbsp; Not unlikely, a buyer desperate to acquire [it] would agree to pay more, and a seller in urgent need of funds would agree to accept less, than what it is actually worth.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition is <b>DENIED</b>.&nbsp; The assailed October 31, 2007 Decision and January 11, 2008 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
