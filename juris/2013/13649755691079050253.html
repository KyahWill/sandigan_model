Arnado; and the nine salesmen led by Geronimo S. Banquirigo, had been granted a writ of execution.&nbsp; They further submit that the May 24, 1995 writ of execution issued in favor of the first group of employees, including themselves, had only been partially satisfied because no backwages or separation pay from March 16, 1995 onwards had yet been paid to them; that the reduced award granted to the second group of employees was in violation of the April 12, 1995 notice of computation/execution; that no writ of execution had been issued in favor of the other groups of employees; and that DOLE Secretary Sto. Tomas thus committed grave abuse of discretion in refusing to fully execute the December 26, 1990 and December 5, 1991 orders.<br><br>In its comment, IPI counters that the petition for <i>certiorari</i> should be dismissed for being an improper remedy, the more appropriate remedy being a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>; that a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> should have been filed within 15 days from receipt of the denial of the motion for reconsideration, as provided in Section 1 and Section 2 of Rule 45; and that the petition must also be outrightly dismissed for being filed out of time.<br><br>IPI contends that the finality of the December 24, 1997 and March 27, 1998 orders of the DOLE Secretary rendered them unalterable; that Atty. Arnado had already brought the December 24, 1997 and March 27, 1998 orders to this Court for review (G.R. No. 134118); and that the Court had dismissed the petition for having been filed out of time and for the petitioners’ failure to comply with Rule 13 and Rule 45 of the <i>Rules of Court.</i><br><br><center><b>Ruling</b></center><br>We dismiss the petition for <i>certiorari</i>.<br><br>Firstly, an appeal by petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 45 of the <i>Rules of Court, </i>to be taken to this Court within 15 days from notice of the judgment or final order raising only questions of law, was the proper remedy available to the petitioners. Hence, their filing of the petition for <i>certiorari </i>on January 9, 2004 to assail the CA’s May 30, 2003 decision and October 30, 2003 resolution in C.A.-G.R. SP No. 65970 upon their allegation of grave abuse of discretion committed by the CA was improper. The averment therein that the CA gravely abused its discretion did not warrant the filing of the petition for <i>certiorari</i>, unless the petition further showed how an appeal in due course under Rule 45 was not an adequate remedy for them.&nbsp; By virtue of its being an extraordinary remedy, <i>certiorari </i>cannot replace or substitute an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, like an appeal in due course.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>We remind them that an appeal may also avail to review and correct any grave abuse of discretion committed by an inferior court, provided it will be adequate for that purpose.<br><br>It is the adequacy of a remedy in the ordinary course of law that determines whether a special civil action for <i>certiorari</i> can be a proper alternative remedy. We reiterate what the Court has discoursed thereon in <i>Heirs of Spouses Teofilo M. Reterta and Elisa Reterta v. Spouses Lorenzo Mores and Virginia Lopez,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>Specifically, the Court has held that the availability of appeal as a remedy does not constitute sufficient ground to prevent or preclude a party from making use of<i> certiorari</i> if appeal is not an adequate remedy, or an equally beneficial, or speedy remedy.<b> It is inadequacy, not the mere absence of all other legal remedies and the danger of failure of justice without the writ, that must usually determine the propriety of <i>certiorari.</i> A remedy is plain, speedy and adequate if it will promptly relieve the petitioner from the injurious effects of the judgment, order, or resolution of the lower court or agency. It is understood, then, that a litigant need not mark time by resorting to the less speedy remedy of appeal in order to have an order annulled and set aside for being patently void for failure of the trial court to comply with the <b>Rules of Court</b>.</b><br><br>Nor should the petitioner be denied the recourse despite <i>certiorari </i>not being available as a proper remedy against an assailed order, because it is better on balance to look beyond procedural requirements and to overcome the ordinary disinclination to exercise supervisory powers in order that a void order of a lower court may be controlled to make it conformable to law and justice. Verily, the instances in which <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari</span> will issue cannot be defined, because to do so is to destroy the comprehensiveness and usefulness of the extraordinary writ. The wide breadth and range of the discretion of the court are such that authority is not wanting to show that <i>certiorari</i> is more discretionary than either prohibition or <i>mandamus</i>, and that in the exercise of superintending control over inferior courts, a superior court is to be guided by all the circumstances of each particular case “as the ends of justice may require.” Thus, the writ will be granted <i>whenever necessary to prevent a substantial wrong or to do substantial justice.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Even so, Rule 65 of the <i>Rules of Court</i> still requires the petition for <i>certiorari</i> to comply with the following requisites, namely:&nbsp; (1) the writ of <i>certiorari</i> is directed against a tribunal, a board, or an officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions; (2) such tribunal, board, or officer has acted without or in excess of jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction; and (3) there is no appeal or any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Jurisprudence recognizes certain situations when the extraordinary remedy of <i>certiorari</i> may be deemed proper, such as: (<i>a</i>) when it is necessary to prevent irreparable damages and injury to a party; (<i>b</i>) where the trial judge capriciously and whimsically exercised his judgment; (<i>c</i>) where there may be danger of a failure of justice; (d) where an appeal would be slow, inadequate, and insufficient; (<i>e</i>) where the issue raised is one purely of law; (<i>f</i>) where public interest is involved; and (<i>g</i>) in case of urgency.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Yet, a reading of the petition for <i>certiorari</i> and its annexes reveals that the petition does not come under any of the situations. Specifically, the petitioners have not shown that the grant of the writ of <i>certiorari</i> will be necessary to prevent a substantial wrong or to do substantial justice to them.<br><br>In dismissing the petitioners’ petition for <i>certiorari</i>, the CA in effect upheld the Secretary of Labor’s declaration in her assailed July 4, 2001 decision that the full satisfaction of the writs of execution had completely closed and terminated the labor dispute.<br><br>Yet, the petitioners have ascribed grave abuse of discretion to the CA for doing so.<br><br>We do not agree. We find no just cause to now issue the writ of <i>certiorari</i> in order to set aside the CA’s assailed May 30, 2003 decision. Indeed, the following well stated justifications for the dismissal of the petition show that the CA was correct, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br>It is worthy to note that all the decisions and incidents concerning the case between petitioners and private respondent IPI have long attained finality.&nbsp; The records show that petitioners have already been granted a writ of execution.&nbsp; In fact, the decision has been executed.&nbsp; Thus, there is nothing for this Court to modify.&nbsp; The granting of the instant petition calls for the amendment of the Court of a decision which has been executed.&nbsp; In this light, it is worthy to note the rule that final and executory decisions, more so with those already executed, may no longer be amended except only to correct errors which are clerical in nature. Amendments or alterations which substantially affect such judgments as well as the entire proceedings held for that purpose are null and void for lack of jurisdiction (<i>Pio Barretto Realty Development Corporation v. Court of Appeals, 360 SCRA 127</i>).<br><br>This Court in the case of<i> CA GR No. 54041 dated February 28, 2001</i>, has ruled that the Orders of the Secretary of Labor and Employment dated December 24, 1997 and March 27, 1998 have become final and executory.&nbsp; It may be noted that the said orders affirmed the earlier orders of the Secretary of Labor and Employment dated December 22, 1995 and August 27, 1996 granting the execution of the decision in the case between petitioners and IPI.<br><br>There is nothing on the records to support the allegation of petitioners that the Secretary of Labor and Employment abused her discretion.&nbsp; The pertinent portion of the assailed order reads:<br><br><blockquote>“Given that this office had already ruled on all incidents of the case in its March 27, 1998 order and the Writ of Execution dated June 5, 1995 had already attained finality and had in fact been completely satisfied through the deposit with the Regional Office of the amount covered by the Writ, the subsequent Motions filed by Atty. Arnado can no longer be entertained, much less granted by this Office.&nbsp; Thus, at this point, there is nothing more to grant nor to execute.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>x x x x</blockquote></blockquote><br>In a special civil action for <i>certiorari</i> brought against a court with jurisdiction over a case, the petitioner carries the burden to prove that the respondent tribunal committed not a merely reversible error but a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in issuing the impugned order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Showing mere abuse of discretion is not enough, for the abuse must be shown to be grave.&nbsp; Grave abuse of discretion means either that the judicial or quasi-judicial power was exercised in an arbitrary or despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility, or that the respondent judge, tribunal or board evaded a positive duty, or virtually refused to perform the duty enjoined or to act in contemplation of law, such as when such judge, tribunal or board exercising judicial or quasi-judicial powers acted in a capricious or whimsical manner as to be equivalent to lack of jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Under the circumstances, the CA committed no abuse of discretion, least of all grave, because its justifications were supported by the history of the dispute and borne out by the applicable laws and jurisprudence.<br><br>And, secondly, the records contradict the petitioners’ insistence that the two writs of execution to enforce the December 26, 1990 and December 5, 1991 orders of the DOLE Secretary were only partially satisfied. To recall, the two writs of execution issued were the one for P4,162,361.50, later reduced to P3,416,402.10,&nbsp; in favor of the 15 employees represented by Atty. Arnado, and that for P1,200,378.92 in favor of the second group of employees led by Banquerigo.<br><br>There is no question that the 15 employees represented by Atty. Arnado, inclusive of the petitioners, received their portion of the award covered by the September 3, 1996 writ of execution for the amount of P3,416,402.10 through the release of the garnished deposit of IPI at China Banking Corporation. That was why they then executed the satisfaction of judgment and quitclaim/release, the basis for the DOLE Secretary to expressly declare in her July 4, 2001 decision that the full satisfaction of the writ of execution “completely CLOSED and TERMINATED this case.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>Still, the 15 employees demand payment of their separation pay and backwages from March 16, 1995 onwards pursuant to their reservation reflected in the satisfaction of judgment and quitclaim/release they executed on September 11, 1996.<br><br>The demand lacked legal basis. Although the decision of the DOLE Secretary dated December 5, 1991 had required IPI to reinstate the affected workers to their former positions with full backwages reckoned from&nbsp; December 8, 1989 until actually reinstated without loss of seniority rights and other benefits, the reinstatement thus decreed was no longer possible. Hence, separation pay was instead paid to them. This alternative was sustained in law and jurisprudence, for “separation pay may avail in lieu of reinstatement if reinstatement is no longer practical or in the best interest of the parties. Separation pay in lieu of reinstatement may likewise be awarded if the employee decides not to be reinstated.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>Under the circumstances, the employment of the 15 employees or the possibility of their reinstatement terminated by March 15, 1995. Thereafter, their claim for separation pay and backwages beyond March 15, 1995 would be unwarranted. The computation of separation pay and backwages due to illegally dismissed employees should not go beyond the date when they were deemed to have been actually separated from their employment, or beyond the date when their reinstatement was rendered impossible. Anent this, the Court has observed in <i>Golden Ace Builders v. Talde</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br><blockquote>The basis for the payment of backwages is different from that for the award of separation pay. Separation pay is granted where reinstatement is no longer advisable because of strained relations between the employee and the employer.&nbsp; Backwages represent compensation that should have been earned but were not collected because of the unjust dismissal.&nbsp; The basis for computing backwages is usually the length of the employee’s service while that for separation pay is the actual period when the employee was unlawfully prevented from working.<br><br>As to how both awards should be computed, <i>Macasero v. Southern Industrial Gases Philippines</i> instructs:<br><br><blockquote>[T]he award of separation pay is inconsistent with a finding that there was no illegal dismissal, for under Article 279 of the Labor Code and as held in a catena of cases, an employee who is dismissed without just cause and without due process is entitled to <u>backwages</u> <b><i>and</i></b> <u>reinstatement or payment of separation pay in lieu thereof</u>:<br><br>Thus, an <u>illegally dismissed employee</u> is entitled to two reliefs: backwages and reinstatement.&nbsp; The two reliefs provided are separate and distinct. In instances <u>where reinstatement is no longer feasible because of strained relations between the employee and the employer, separation pay is granted</u>.&nbsp; In effect, an illegally dismissed employee is entitled to either reinstatement, if viable, or separation pay if reinstatement is no longer viable, and backwages.<br><br><b>The normal consequences of respondents’ illegal dismissal, then, are reinstatement without loss of seniority rights, and payment of backwages computed from the time compensation was withheld up to the date of actual reinstatement.&nbsp; Where reinstatement is no longer viable as an option, separation pay equivalent to one (1) month salary for every year of service should be awarded as an alternative.&nbsp; The payment of separation pay is in addition to payment of backwages</b>.&nbsp; (emphasis, italics and underscoring supplied)<br><br>x x x x</blockquote><br>Clearly then, respondent is entitled to backwages <i>and</i> separation pay as his reinstatement has been rendered impossible due to strained relations. As correctly held by the appellate court, the backwages due respondent must be computed from the time he was unjustly dismissed until his actual reinstatement, or from February 1999 until June 30, 2005 when his reinstatement was rendered impossible without fault on his part.<br><br>The Court, however, does not find the appellate court’s computation of separation pay in order. The appellate court considered respondent to have served petitioner company for only eight years.&nbsp; Petitioner was hired in 1990, however, and he must be considered to have been in the service not only until 1999, when he was unjustly dismissed, but until June 30, 2005, the day he is deemed to have been actually separated (his reinstatement having been rendered impossible) from petitioner company or for a total of 15 years.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup></blockquote><br>As for the portions of the award pertaining to the rest of the employees listed in the April 12, 1995 notice of execution/computation (i.e., those allegedly similarly situated as the employees listed in the December 5, 1991 order of the DOLE Secretary) still remaining unsatisfied, the petitioners are definitely not the proper parties to ventilate such concern in this or any other forum. At any rate, the concern has already been addressed and resolved by the Court in G.R.
