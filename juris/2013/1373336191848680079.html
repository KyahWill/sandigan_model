				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This administrative case arose from the financial audit conducted by the Court Management Office (<i>CMO</i>), Office of the Court Administrator (<i>DCA</i>), in the Municipal Trial Court of Candelaria, Quezon (<i>MTC</i>). The audit covered the accountabilities of Lorenza M. Martinez (Martinez), Clerk of Court, from March 1985 to November 2005.<br><br>In September 2004, the salaries of Martinez were withheld. Beginning December 2005, she was excluded from the payroll because of her failure to submit the monthly reports of collections and deposits as required by SC Circular No. 32-93.<br><br>The audit disclosed that Martinez incurred cash shortages in the Judicial Development Fund (<i>JDF</i>) in the amount of P12,273.33 and in the Fiduciary Fund (<i>FF</i>) in the amount of P882,250.00. The breakdown of Martinez’ cash accountabilities were as follows:<br><br><blockquote><center>Judiciary Development Fund<br></center><br><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Total Collections</div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT">P 917,847.69</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Less: Total Remittances </div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT">905,574,36</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Balance of Accountabilities </div></td> <td style="text-decoration: underline;"><div align="RIGHT">P 12,273.33</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br><br><center>Fiduciary Fund</center><br><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="70%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Total Collections </div></td> <td width="30%"><div align="RIGHT">P 4,288,212.50</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Less: Total Withdrawals </div></td> <td style="text-decoration: underline;"><div align="RIGHT">3,020,712.50</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Unwithdrawn Fiduciary Fund as of November 30, 2005</div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT">P 1,267,500.00</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Less: Bank Balance per LBP SA No. 2611-0011-02 net of unwithdrawn Interest of P816.98, as of November 30, 2005</div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT">385,250.00</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Balance of Accountabilities </div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">P 882,250.00</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br>The audit team discovered that the shortages were due to the following manipulation of Martinez:<br><blockquote>1.

However, this was not observed by Ms. Martinez, instead she issued official receipts for collections received with the date of actual receipt posted on the original OR, while the duplicate and triplicate copies were left undated. She first used the money received as collections and when she regained it, the same was deposited, and that was the time when she posted a date on the duplicate and triplicate OR which is different from the date of the riginal OR. This was to cover her practice of delaying the remittance of collections. There were also times that the collections were not remitted at all, and the duplicate and triplicate ORs were remained undated up to date, as what had happened to the above undeposited collections of P120,000.00.<br><br>2. Ms. Martinez used a single OR for both JDF and FF collections, the original OR was used for FF and its corresponding duplicate and triplicate copies were used for JDF (Annexes 2.1 to 2.11), viz:<br><br><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="15%"><div align="CENTER">OR No.</div></td> <td colspan="2"><div align="CENTER">JDF</div></td> <td colspan="3"><div align="CENTER">FF</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER"></div></td> <td width="17%"><div align="CENTER">Date of Collection</div></td> <td width="17%"><div align="CENTER">Amount</div></td> <td width="17%"><div align="CENTER">Date of Collection</div></td> <td width="17%"><div align="CENTER">Case No.</div></td> <td width="17%"><div align="CENTER">Amount</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">9972099</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">12-10-98</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">P 10.00</div></td> <td style="text-align: center;">6-6-95</td> <td style="text-align: center;">4470</td> <td><div align="RIGHT">P 6,000.00</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">14392168</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">10-17-01</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">10.00</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">10-18-01</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">01-234</div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT">5,000.00</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">11445533</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">11-9-00</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">10.00</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">5-21-99</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">99-103 to 106</div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT">30,000.00</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">9972266</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">5-7-99</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">10.00</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">2-23-99</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">99-50</div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT">30,000.00</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">9972267</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">5-7-99</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">10.00</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">2-24-99</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">99-50</div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT">30,000.00</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">9972789</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">4-18-00</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">10.00</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">11-20-99</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">99-235</div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT">40,000.00</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">9972410</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">7-9-99</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">10.00</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">5-15-99</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">99-97</div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT">15,000.00</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">9972265</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">5-7-99</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">10.00</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">1-20-98</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">5561</div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT">10,000.00</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">9972838</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">5-24-00</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">10.00</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">11-12-96</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">5098</div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT">2,000.00</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">11445534</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">11-9-00</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">10.00</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">10-7-98</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">5619</div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT">10,000.00</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">14392156</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">10-12-01</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">10.00</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">6-27-01</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">01-128</div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT">10,000.00</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">15381554</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">7-10-02</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">10.00</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">6-7-02</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">02-135</div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT">12,000.00</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">15381257</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">2-4-02</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">10.00</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">2-1-02</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">01-28</div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT">30,000.00</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER"><strong>Total</strong></div></td> <td><div align="CENTER"></div></td> <td><div align="CENTER"><strong>130.00</strong></div></td> <td><div align="CENTER"></div></td> <td><div align="CENTER"></div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT"><strong>P 230,000.00</strong></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br><br>Verification revealed that the P130.00 collections for JDF were reported and deposited.

Hon. Felix A. Caraos, Presiding Judge, when informed on this matter, immediately wrote a letter to the manager of LBP, Candelaria Branch (Annex 3), notifying the same that he will be jointly allowed to withdraw from the FF account of the court with Mr. Apolonio M. Sugay, designated Officer-in-Charge on December 6, 2005.<br><br>4. The bonds posted in Case Nos. 5528 and 5529 entitled “<i>PP. vs. Amelita Ramilo for Violation of BP 22</i>” amounting to P26,000.00 each were reported as withdrawn on November 1999. However, records revealed that there were no court orders that were issued to support the withdrawals. Therefore, the withdrawals made were unauthorized. The signatures of Ms. Ramilo on the herein attached acknowledgement receipt (Annex 4) were clearly forged as these were totally different to her signatures that were retrieved on the casefolders of the above cases (Annex 5.1 to 5.2).<br><br>5. The bond posted in Case No. 00-88 under OR No. 9972398 in the amount of P10,000.00 was withdrawn on August 16, 2000. However, through a fictitious court order (Annex 6), the same was again withdrawn on February 8, 2001. Said fictitious court order was accomplished by altering the Case No. from 5662 to 00-88. All the entries in the herein attached court order of Case No. 5662 (Annex 7) were the same with the entries in the fictitious court order except that of the case number. Also, the signature in the acknowledgment receipt of Ms. Lerma M. Mediavillo (Annex 8), the accused of Case No. 00-88 and not Ms. Nila Carreon as appearing in the fictitious court order, was forged because this was entirely unlike her signature that was retrieved on the casefolder of Case No. 00-88 (Annex 9).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></blockquote>Acting on the report and recommendation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> of the OCA, the Court, in its Resolution,5 dated August 2, 2006, directed Martinez to (1) explain her failure 1.a] to collect fees accruing to the General Fund and Mediation Fund, 1.b] to present the JDF official receipts and monthly reports covering the period from March 1985 to December 1995, and 1.3] to deposit her collections on time; (2) explain the discrepancies of the entries in the original and triplicate copies of the official receipts of the FF collections; (3) explain why she used the original OR for the FF collection and its corresponding duplicate or triplicate copies for the JDF collections; (4) explain the double withdrawal of the bonds and their withdrawal without the necessary court orders; and (5) restitute her shortages. The Court also ordered her suspension pending resolution of the case and issued a hold departure order against her to prevent her from leaving the country.<br><br>In a letter,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> dated September 4, 2006, Martinez averred that the shortage only amounted to P540,273.33 and denied responsibility for the shortage in the JDF as it was the court’s Clerk II who did the transactions. Martinez asked for a reconsideration of her suspension citing her 28 years of service as basis and begged for the release of her withheld salary.<br><br>On August 22, 2006, the Bureau of Immigration issued an order directing the issuance of the hold departure order against Martinez.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>As of January 30, 2012, Martinez had failed to explain and restitute her shortages as required in the Court’s August 2, 2006 Resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Consequently, the Court issued a resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> requiring her to show cause why she should not be disciplinarily dealt with or held in contempt for such failure.<br><br>In a letter,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> dated May 8, 2012, Martinez explained that her failure to restitute the shortages was due to her lack of means to do so because she had been suspended from the service since August 2004.

She likewise violated OCA Circular No. 50-95 which mandates all clerks of court to deposit, within 24 hours from receipt, all collections from bailbonds, rental deposits and other fiduciary collections.<br><br>These directives are mandatory and designed to promote full accountability for government funds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Clerks of Court, as custodians of the court funds and revenues, are obliged to immediately deposit with the Land Bank of the Philippines (<i>LBP</i>) or with any authorized government depository, their collections on various funds because they are not authorized to keep funds in their custody.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>In this case, Martinez failed to present a satisfactory explanation regarding her cash shortages, her improper use of official receipts and the withdrawal of cash bonds. Her contention that it was the cash clerk who was responsible for the JDF fund is untenable. As Clerk of Court, she was the court’s accountable officer. It was not the cash clerk. It was her duty to supervise and monitor her subordinate to ensure that the proper procedures were followed in the collection of the court’s funds. Being the custodian of the court’s funds, revenues, records, properties, and premises, she was liable for any loss, shortage, destruction or impairment of such funds and property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Time and again, the Court reminds that “those charged with the dispensation of justice, from the justices and judges to the lowliest clerks, should be circumscribed with the heavy burden of responsibility. A public servant is expected to exhibit, at all times, the highest degree of honesty and integrity, and should be made accountable to all those whom he serves. There is no place in the Judiciary for those who cannot meet the exacting standards of judicial conduct and integrity. The Court condemns and would never countenance any conduct, act or omission on the part of all those involved in the administration of justice which would violate the norm of public accountability and would diminish, or even just tend to diminish, the faith of the people in the Judiciary."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>In one case, <i>Re: Financial Audit on the Books of Account of Ms. Laura D.
