Cristo, Gapan, Nueva Ecija (<i>disputed lot</i>).&nbsp; The disputed lot was awarded to Lorenzo pursuant to Operation Land Transfer under Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 27, and covered by Certificate of Land Transfer No. 049645 (<i>CLT</i>)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> issued on July 28, 1973.&nbsp; Upon Lorenzo’s death, German allegedly immediately occupied the disputed lot and had been cultivating and residing within its premises since then.&nbsp; German claimed that, in 1989, Lovy Perez forcibly entered the disputed lot, thus, compelling him to file a petition for recovery of possession with the PARAD.<br><br>In her answer with counterclaim, Lovy argued that she is the real and lawful tenant of the disputed lot as evidenced by: (1) the duly acknowledged and registered contract of leasehold (<i>lease contract</i>) <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> dated October 5, 1988, between her and the landowner, Joaquin Garces, which Lorenzo signed as a witness; and (2) the certifications issued by the Municipal Agrarian Reform Officer (<i>MARO</i>) of the Department of Agrarian Reform (<i>DAR</i>),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Gapan, Nueva Ecija, and by the Barangay Agrarian Reform Council<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> stating that she is the disputed lot’s registered agricultural lessee.&nbsp; She also claimed that she has been paying the lease rentals to Garces, as shown by receipts,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> and the irrigation services<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> beginning 1984 as certified to by the National Irrigation Administration, and that she is a bona fide member of the <i>Samahang Nayon.</i><br><br>On July 31, 1997, the PARAD dismissed the petition, ruling that German failed to prove that he or his father, Lorenzo, was the farm helper or the regular tenant-lessee of the disputed lot.&nbsp; In contrast, Lovy successfully proved that she was the lawful tenant-lessee from all of her documentary evidence, particularly the lease contract, which established the tenancy relation between her and Garces.&nbsp; German appealed the dismissal to the DARAB.<br><br><b><i>The Ruling of the DARAB</i></b><br><br>On January 16, 2001, the DARAB affirmed <i>in toto</i> the PARAD’s decision.&nbsp; German sought reconsideration, which he obtained in due course.<br><br>In its resolution, the DARAB set aside its earlier decision and ordered Lovy to surrender possession of the disputed lot to German.&nbsp; This time, the DARAB considered the CLT as clear evidence of the Government’s recognition of Lorenzo as the tenant-beneficiary of the disputed lot entitled to avail of the statutory mechanisms under P.D. No. 27 for acquiring its ownership.&nbsp; It maintained the presumption of the CLT’s continued validity, as the record neither showed that it was cancelled nor that grounds exist for its cancellation.&nbsp; Also, the DARAB refused to recognize the personality of Garces to execute the lease contract and declared it void.&nbsp; It held that Lorenzo is deemed the owner of the disputed lot from the time the CLT was issued in 1973.&nbsp; When the DARAB denied her motion for reconsideration, Lovy filed a petition for review<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> with the CA.<br><br>While the case was pending before the CA, Lovy died and was substituted by her heirs - Erlinda Perez-Hernandez, Teodoro G. Perez and Candida Perez-Atacador (<i>respondents</i>).<br><br><b><i>The Ruling of the CA</i></b><br><br>The CA granted Lovy’s appeal and reversed the DARAB resolution.&nbsp; As the decisions of the PARAD and the DARAB earlier did, the CA ruled that Lorenzo had long abandoned the disputed lot, which he confirmed when he signed as a witness to the lease contract between Garces and Lovy; that, with the execution of the lease contract, Lovy became the qualified farmer-beneficiary, who then cultivated the disputed lot on her own account.<br><br>Additionally, the CA declared that Lorenzo’s CLT was not sufficient to constitute him as the owner of the disputed lot since Lorenzo failed to comply with the obligation to pay the lease rentals that Section 26 of Republic Act (<i>R.A.</i>) No. 3844 requires.&nbsp; The CA denied German’s motion for reconsideration in its August 4, 2006 resolution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> prompting the present recourse.<br><br><center><b><u>The Petition</u></b></center><br>German faults the CA for not upholding the validity and legality of Lorenzo’s CLT.&nbsp; He argues that, as holder of the CLT, he – as Lorenzo’s heir – was entitled not only to the possession of the disputed lot<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> but also to the full benefits of a farmer-tenant under P.D. No. 27.&nbsp; He also argues that nothing on the records showed that the CLT had been cancelled; that Lorenzo had failed to comply with his obligations as tenant-beneficiary; or that he or Lorenzo had abandoned the disputed lot.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>On October 16, 2006,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> during the pendency of the case before the Court, German died and was substituted by his wife, Iluminada, and his sons, Ryan and Philip (a minor), all surnamed Buensuceso.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br><center><b><u>The Case for the Respondents</u></b><br></center><br>In their defense, the respondents argue that: <i>first,</i> a petition for review under Rule 45 is restricted to questions of law.&nbsp; The question of who between Lorenzo and German, on the one hand, and Lovy, on the other, actually tilled and cultivated the disputed lot is a clear question of fact that is not proper for a Rule 45 petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br><i>Second</i>, no cogent reason exists to modify or reverse the CA’s decision as the duly notarized and registered lease contract, among others, indisputably shows that Lovy had been actually cultivating the disputed lot since 1984.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br><i>Third,</i> the factual findings of the PARAD, the DARAB (in its earlier January 16, 2001 decision) and the CA are binding and conclusive on this Court, especially when, as in this case, they are supported by substantial evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br><i>Lastly</i>, on the issue of ownership, the respondents maintain that Lorenzo’s CLT is not sufficient to constitute him as owner of the disputed lot since he must first comply with certain requisites and conditions before he can acquire absolute ownership over it.&nbsp; By abandoning the disputed lot, Lorenzo failed to comply with his obligations as a CLT holder, thus disqualifying him from its possession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br><center><b><u>The Court’s Ruling</u></b></center><br>We first address the procedural matters raised.<br><br>The rules invoked by the respondents are well settled: a Rule 45 petition is limited to questions of law, and the factual findings of the lower courts are, as a rule, conclusive on this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>&nbsp; The question of who, between German and the respondents, is entitled to the continued possession of the disputed lot involves factual issues and is not the proper subject of a Rule 45 petition.<br><br>Despite this Rule 45 requirement, however, our pronouncements have likewise recognized exceptions, such as the situation obtaining here – where the tribunals below conflict in their factual findings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>&nbsp; We note that the DARAB (in its resolution) in effect reversed its earlier decision and the PARAD’s ruling while the CA, in turn, set aside the DARAB’s September 4, 2003 resolution.&nbsp; In this light, we cannot support the procedural objection raised.<br><br>On the merits, German, as substituted by his heirs, asserts possession and ownership over the disputed lot, emphasizing the issuance of and the continued validity of Lorenzo’s CLT.&nbsp; They invoke <i>P.D. No. 27</i> to justify their position, arguing that as holder in due course of a CLT, Lorenzo remains a qualified beneficiary under the Act.<br><br>The respondents, on the other hand, claim entitlement to the continued possession of the disputed lot following the declarations of the PARAD, the DARAB (in its earlier decision) and the CA that Lovy is the disputed lot’s lawful tenant. Also, they insist that Lorenzo or his heirs cannot be the owners of the disputed lot because Lorenzo failed to comply with his obligations under the CLT. Neither can German possess the disputed lot because Lorenzo had long abandoned it.<br><br><i>On the issue of ownership of the disputed lot<br></i><br>We agree with the CA that the mere issuance of the CLT does not vest full ownership on the holder<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> and does not automatically operate to divest the landowner of all of his rights over the landholding.&nbsp; The holder must first comply with certain mandatory requirements to effect a transfer of ownership.&nbsp; Under R.A. No. 6657<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> in relation with P.D. No. 27<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> and E.O. No. 228,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> the title to the landholding shall be issued to the tenant-farmer only upon the satisfaction of the following requirements: <i>(1) payment in full of the just compensation for the landholding, duly determined by final judgment of the proper court; (2) possession of the qualifications of a farmer-beneficiary under the law; (3) full-pledged membership of the farmer-beneficiary in a duly recognized farmers’ cooperative; and (4) actual cultivation of the landholding. </i> We explained in several cases that while a tenant with a CLT is <b>deemed the owner </b>of a landholding,<b> the CLT does not vest full ownership on him</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> The tenant-holder of a CLT merely possesses an inchoate right that is subject to compliance with certain legal preconditions for perfecting title and acquiring full ownership.&nbsp; For these reasons, we hold that Lorenzo’s right and claim to ownership&nbsp; over the disputed lot were, at most, inchoate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>In the same vein, we hold that German – as Lorenzo’s heir – is not automatically rendered the owner of the disputed lot.&nbsp; German must also still first comply with certain procedural and mandatory requirements in order to acquire Lorenzo’s rights under the CLT, including the right to acquire ownership of the disputed lot.&nbsp; Under <i>Section 27 </i>of <i>R.A. No. 6657</i>, lands not yet fully paid by the beneficiary may be transferred, with prior approval of the DAR, to any heir of the beneficiary who, as a condition for such transfer, shall cultivate the land for himself.<br><br><i>On the validity of the lease contract between Garces and Lovy&nbsp; </i><br><br>We agree with the DARAB, in its resolution, that Garces had no authority to execute the lease contract.&nbsp; While Garces, as landowner, retained an interest over the disputed lot, any perceived failure on Lorenzo’s part to comply with his obligations under the CLT did not cause the automatic cancellation of the CLT nor of the disputed lot’s reversion to Garces.&nbsp; “[L]and[s] acquired under P.D. No. 27 [do] not revert to the landowner,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> and this is true even if the CLT is cancelled.&nbsp; The land must be transferred back to the government and Garces could not, by himself, institute Lovy as the new tenant-beneficiary.<br><br>Pursuant to <i>R.A. No. 6657 </i>in relation with <i>P.D. No. 27</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> any sale or disposition of agricultural lands made after the effectivity of R.A. No. 6657 which has been found contrary to its provisions shall be null and void. <b>The proper procedure for the reallocation of the disputed lot must be followed</b> to ensure that there indeed exist grounds for the cancellation of the CLT or for forfeiture of rights under it, and that the lot is subsequently awarded to a qualified farmer-tenant pursuant to the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Under Ministry Memorandum Circular No. 04-83 in relation with Ministry Memorandum Circular No. 08-80 and Ministry Memorandum Circular No. 07-79, the following procedures must be observed for the reallocation of farmholdings covered by P.D. No. 27 by reason of abandonment or the refusal to become a beneficiary, among others:<br><br><ol type="I"><li>Investigation Procedure<br><br>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; The conduct of <b>verification</b> by the concerned Agrarian Reform Team Leader (<i>ARTL</i>) to ascertain the reasons for the refusal.&nbsp; All efforts shall be exerted to convince the tenant-farmer to become a beneficiary and to comply with his obligations as such beneficiary.<br><br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the tenant-farmer still refuses, the ARTL shall <b>determine the substitute.</b>&nbsp; The ARTL shall first consider the immediate member of the tenant-farmer’s family who assisted in the cultivation of the land, and who is willing to be substituted to all the rights and obligations of the tenant-farmer.&nbsp; In the absence or refusal of such member, the ARTL shall choose one from a list of at least three qualified tenants recommended by the President of the Samahang Nayon or, in default, any organized farmer association, subject to the award limits under P.D. No. 27.<br><br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Formal notice</b> of the report shall be given to the concerned farmer-beneficiary together with all the pertinent documents and evidences.<br><br>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; The ARTL shall <b>submit the records of the case</b> with his report and recommendation <b>to the District Officer</b> within 5 days from the ARTL’s determination of the substitute.&nbsp; The District Officer shall likewise submit his report and recommendation to the Regional Director and the latter to the Bureau of Agrarian Legal Assistance, for review, evaluation, and preparation of the final draft decision for final approval.<br><br>5.&nbsp;&nbsp; The <b>decision</b> shall declare the <b>cancellation of the CLT</b> if issued.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></li></ol><br>In the event of the farmer-beneficiary’s death, the transfer or reallocation of his landholding to his heirs shall be governed by <i>Ministry Memorandum Circular No. 19-78</i>.<br><br>In the present case, as Associate Justice Estela M. Perlas-Bernabe observed in her Reflections, Lorenzo’s CLT was not shown to have been properly cancelled in light of the failure to observe the required procedures or processes.&nbsp; Thus, we declare the lease contract between Garces and Lovy as void.&nbsp; Consequently, we cannot recognize Lovy’s claim that she is the present and actual agricultural lessee of the disputed lot.<br><br><i>As to whether Lorenzo abandoned the disputed lot</i><br><br>We find merit in the respondents’ argument that Lorenzo had long abandoned the disputed lot, thus, depriving him and his heirs of possession over it.&nbsp; Abandonment is a ground for the termination of tenancy relations under <i>Section 8 of R.A. No. 3844,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> and, under <i>Section 22</i> of<i> R.A. No. 6657</i> as well as under <i>DAR Administrative Order No. 02-94</i> in relation to<i> Section 22, R.A. 6657, </i>disqualifies the beneficiary of lots awarded under P.D. No. 27 from its coverage.&nbsp; To additionally reiterate what we have discussed above, actual cultivation of the farmholding is a mandatory condition for the transfer of rights under the CLT to qualify the transferee as a beneficiary under <i>Section 22</i> of <i>R.A. No. 6657</i>.<br><br>For abandonment to exist, the following requisites must concur: (1) a clear intent to abandon; and (2) an external act showing such intent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>&nbsp; The term is defined as the “willful failure of the ARB, together with his farm household, to cultivate, till, or develop his land to produce any crop, or to use the land for any specific economic purpose continuously for a period of two calendar years.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>&nbsp; It entails, among others, the relinquishment of possession of the lot for at least two (2) calendar years and the failure to pay the amortization for the same period.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>&nbsp; “What is critical in abandonment is intent which must be shown to be deliberate and clear.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>&nbsp; The intent must be established by the factual failure to work on the landholding absent any valid reason<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> as well as a clear intent, which is shown as a separate element.<br><br>In the present case, Lorenzo, in allowing and acquiescing to the execution of the lease contract through his signature, with presumed full awareness of its implications,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> effectively surrendered his rights over the disputed lot.&nbsp; His signing of the lease contract constitutes the external act of abandonment.&nbsp; Notably, neither Lorenzo nor German impugned the existence or the execution of the lease contract or the validity of Lorenzo’s signature on it during the proceedings before the PARAD and the DARAB.&nbsp; Additionally, German did not present any evidence to support his position that Lovy forcibly entered the disputed property, thus depriving them of its possession and actual cultivation.<br><br>We observe that, in contrast with the respondents’ unwavering position that Lovy had been in actual possession and cultivation of the disputed lot since 1988, German’s assertion of continuous possession and cultivation is significantly weakened by the inconsistencies in his pleadings.&nbsp; German claimed that Lorenzo had been continuously tilling the disputed lot until 1989 when Lovy forcibly entered and took over its possession.&nbsp; At the same time, he maintained that he immediately took possession and actual cultivation of the disputed lot upon Lorenzo’s death and had been in its possession since then.&nbsp; Interestingly, Lorenzo died in 1992.&nbsp; What is clear, however, from German’s various averments is that Lorenzo had not been cultivating the disputed lot since 1988.&nbsp; Even if we were to believe German’s claim of continued possession and actual cultivation of the disputed lot even after Lovy forcibly entered in 1989, this claim only supports the finding of abandonment.&nbsp; Lorenzo would not have stood idly and allowed Lovy to cultivate the disputed lot if he did not have the intention to abandon its possession in favor of the latter.<br><br>We reiterate that abandonment is a ground for the cancellation of a CLT and the forfeiture of the farmer-beneficiary’s right to the landholding.&nbsp; Nevertheless, for a cancellation or forfeiture to take place, the proper procedures must be observed and a final judgment rendered declaring a cancellation or forfeiture.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of these considerations, we hereby <b>REMAND </b>this case to the Department of Agrarian Reform for the conduct of investigation and of the necessary proceedings to determine the qualified beneficiary of the disputed lot.&nbsp; No costs.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Carpio, (Chairperson), Del Castillo, Perez, </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">Perlas-Bernabe, JJ</span>., concur.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Dated and filed on September 20, 2006 under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court; <i>rollo</i>, pp. 8-13.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Penned by Associate Justice Lucas P.
