It ruled that <i>estoppel</i> does not lie against BATCO considering that the pertinent law and regulations did not provide for a prescriptive period for the filing of exemption from CARP coverage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> Moreover, in the light of <i>Luz Farms</i>, a petition for exemption is not even necessary so long as the landholdings are devoted to livestock, poultry, and swine raising, thus, rendering DAR AO 09-93 ineffective and inconsequential.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>The CA gave credence to BATCO's documentary evidence to support its claim of the existence and presence of livestock in the lands in question starting the year 1987 consisting of: (<i>a</i>) the Certification<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> dated March 26, 1998 of the Municipal Agriculturist of Lamitan, Basilan (Municipal Agriculturist Certification) as to the number of cattle found in the area; (<i>b</i>) the photographs<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> of the livestock therein allegedly taken on May 31, 2001 and July 5, 2005; and (<i>c</i>) the affidavits<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> of former municipal mayors<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> of Lamitan, Basilan – namely, Wilfrido C. Furigay and Ramon Garcia, Jr. – attesting to the existence and presence of livestock in the subject lands starting the year 1987. The CA likewise condemned the cancellation of BATCO's certificates of title prior to full payment of the compensation and prior to the decision on the petition for exemption as violative of BATCO's right to procedural and substantive due process.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> Corollarily, the CA cancelled TCT Nos. T-1012, T-1013 and T-1014 in the name of MCFARMCO and directed the Basilan RD to issue a new set of titles in BATCO's favor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br><center><b>The Issue Before the Court</b><br></center><br>The essential issue in this case is whether or not the CA gravely abused its discretion in excluding/exempting the subject lands from CARP coverage despite BATCO's admission that only a portion thereof was devoted to livestock raising and considering its previous voluntary offer of the lands to the government under the VOS scheme.<br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b><br></center><br>The petition is meritorious.<br><br>Under RA 6657, the CARP shall cover all public and private agricultural lands, including other lands of the public domain suitable for agriculture, regardless of tenurial arrangement and commodity produced.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> Section 3(c) thereof defines “agricultural land” as land devoted to agricultural activity and not classified as mineral, forest, residential, commercial or industrial land. Lands devoted to livestock, poultry, and swine raising are classified as industrial, not agricultural lands and, thus, exempt from agrarian reform. As such, the DAR has no power to regulate livestock farms.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br>Nevertheless, the determination of the land’s classification as either an agricultural or industrial land – and, in turn, whether or not the land falls under agrarian reform exemption – must be preliminarily threshed out before the DAR, particularly, before the DAR Secretary. Verily, issues of exclusion or exemption partake the nature of Agrarian Law Implementation (ALI) cases which are well within the competence and jurisdiction of the DAR Secretary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> Towards this end, the latter is ordained to exercise his legal mandate of excluding or exempting a property from CARP coverage based on the factual circumstances of each case and in accordance with the law and applicable jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> Thus, considering too his technical expertise on the matter, courts cannot simply brush aside his pronouncements regarding the status of the land in dispute, <i>i.e.</i>, as to whether or not it falls under CARP coverage. As held in <i>DAR v. Oroville Development Corp.</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><blockquote><b>We cannot simply brush aside the DAR’s pronouncements regarding the status of the subject property as not exempt from CARP coverage considering that the DAR has unquestionable technical expertise on these matters.</b> Factual findings of administrative agencies are generally accorded respect and even finality by this Court, if such findings are supported by substantial evidence, a situation that obtains in this case. <b>The factual findings of the Secretary of Agrarian Reform who, by reason of his official position, has acquired expertise in specific matters within his jurisdiction, deserve full respect and, without justifiable reason, ought not to be altered, modified or reversed.</b> (Emphases supplied)<br></blockquote>It is settled that in order to be entitled to exclusion/exemption, it must be shown that the land is exclusively devoted to livestock, swine or poultry raising.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> The land must be shown to have been used for such purposes as of the effectivity of RA 6657, or on June 15, 1988,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> in order to prevent any fraudulent declaration of areas supposedly used for these purposes as well as to protect the rights of agrarian beneficiaries therein. This is in consonance with Section 73(c) of RA 6657 which prohibits the conversion by any landowner of his agricultural land into any non-agricultural use with intent to avoid the application of RA 6657 to his landholdings and to dispossess his tenant farmers of the land tilled by them.<br><br>A thorough review of the records reveals no substantial evidence to show that the entirety of the subject lands were exclusively devoted to livestock production since June 15, 1988 so as to warrant their exclusion/exemption from CARP coverage and the consequent cancellation of MCFARMCO's certificates of title. In fact, contrary to its original submission that almost all of the entire 206.5694 has. landholding has been devoted to cattle and livestock production since their acquisition in 1987,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> BATCO subsequently admitted in its Supplemental Motion for Reconsideration of the Order dated 25 February 1999<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> (supplemental motion for reconsideration) that only a portion of the subject lands was actually devoted to livestock raising, for which the exemption of not less than 100 has. was sought.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> On this score alone, the CA gravely abused its discretion in declaring the subject lands as exempt from CARP coverage and ordering the cancellation of MCFARMCO's certificates of title and the issuance of new titles in BATCO's favor.<br><br>It must be further pointed out that the subject lands were offered by BATCO to the government under the VOS scheme on September 20, 1989,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> which offer was reiterated on January 6, 1993<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> without any claim of exemption, notwithstanding the existence of the <i>Luz Farms</i> ruling (which was promulgated on December 4, 1990). In fact, the subject portion was acquired by the government in 1992 and still BATCO never sought exemption under <i>Luz Farms</i>. While it protested the valuation of the DAR<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> during its VOS, it did not, at that time, seek any exemption from CARP coverage. BATCO only raised the claimed exemption when it filed the petition for exemption before the DAR Regional Director on May 6, 1998. However, the petition was filed on the basis of DAR AO 09-93,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> and accordingly denied by the DAR Regional Director<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> and the DAR Secretary<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> for failing to meet the requirements set forth therein. While the Court struck down DAR AO 09-93 as unconstitutional in the case of <i>DAR v. Sutton</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> (<i>Sutton</i>) on October 19, 2005, the DAR Decisions and even the CA Decision dated September 6, 2005 in CA-G.R. SP No. 55377 were all rendered at the time that the said AO was still subsisting and in full force and effect. Consequently, in view of the prospectivity principle of judicial decisions<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> and the operative fact doctrine,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> the petition for exemption must be resolved under the provisions of the said AO.<br><br>Under DAR AO 09-93, in order to be entitled to exemption, the applicant must prove that: (<i>a</i>) the land sought to be excluded from CARP coverage is exclusively, directly and actually used for livestock, poultry and swine raising as of June 15, 1988; (<i>b</i>) there should be one head of cattle per hectare of land and seven heads of goat per hectare of land; and (<i>c</i>) there should be 21 heads of cattle for every 1.7815 has. of infrastructure, 147 heads of goat or sheep for every 0.7205 hectare of infrastructure, and 21 heads of swine for every 0.5126 hectare of infrastructure. Consistent with the prohibition under Section 73(c) of RA 6657, DAR AO 09-93 likewise provided that “[a]ny act of a landowner to change or convert his agricultural land to livestock, poultry and swine raising after [June 15, 1988], with the intent to avoid the application of [RA 6657] to his landholdings, shall be considered invalid and illegal and shall not affect the coverage of his landholding under CARP.”<br><br>It bears noting that the denial of the petition for exemption by the DAR Regional Director was based on an ocular inspection/investigation conducted by the DAR provincial personnel in Basilan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> The rationale for the denial of the petition was also clearly outlined in the February 25, 1999 Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> of the DAR Secretary who observed that: (<i>a</i>) none of the 156 certificates of livestock ownership submitted by BATCO predates the effectivity of RA 6657;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> (<i>b</i>) more than half (80 out of 156)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> of the cattle was brought into the property only a few months before the petition was filed; (<i>c</i>) the municipal agriculturist certified the presence of only 120 heads of cattle,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> which is short of the minimum requirement under DAR AO 09-93;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> and (<i>d</i>) no evidence was presented to prove the presence of hogs and goats as well as of BATCO having met the infrastructure requirements under DAR AO 09-93.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> There being no cogent reason to deviate from the foregoing, the Court is impelled to sustain the DAR Secretary’s findings.<br><br>To note, in denying BATCO's motion for reconsideration, the DAR Secretary also observed that, contrary to BATCO's claim that the additional certificates of livestock ownership it undertook to produce further were in the name of the Mendoza Plantation from which it purchased the subject lands in 1987, the certificates eventually submitted with its supplemental motion for reconsideration were actually under its name. Accordingly, the DAR Secretary cannot be faulted for not giving credence to the same.<br><br>In fact, even if the Court were to apply <i>Sutton</i> retroactively and disregard DAR AO 09-93, the pieces of evidence relied upon by the CA actually failed to establish the theory that the entirety of the subject lands or specific portions thereof are exclusively devoted to the raising of cattle, swine and goat as of June 15, 1988. The Court notes that the Municipal Agriculturist Certification<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> dated March 26, 1998, which the CA appreciated in favor of BATCO, merely stated that the subject lands are “suitable for cattle production since before it was acquired and transferred to BATCO PLANTATION.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> On the other hand, the Affidavits<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup> of former municipal mayors confirming their issuance of several certificates of livestock ownership during their respective terms were only presented before the CA and were not backed up by copies of the certificates themselves. Moreover, while the former municipal mayors attested to the existence and presence of livestock in the subject lands starting the year 1987, they commonly described the subject lands as a vast tract of land principally devoted to coconut production, which was extensively inter-cropped with coffee, rubber, black pepper, and cacao trees after BATCO's acquisition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup> These descriptions are insufficient to establish BATCO’s claimed exemption as what is required is exclusive devotion of the lands to the raising of cattle, swine and goat as of June 15, 1988.<br><br>More pertinently, the Court further notes that contrary to BATCO's representations in its petition for exemption, the primary land use of the subject lands<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup> as declared by BATCO itself in its landowner's reply to notice of land valuation and acquisition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup> (landowners reply) dated May 6, 1997, negates its own claim that the said lands were exclusively devoted for the raising of cattle, swine and goat, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td width="5%"><div align="center">Lot</div></td> <td width="20%"><div align="center">Land Use</div></td> <td width="10%"><div align="center">Area Acq'd</div></td> <td width="65%">&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>3</td> <td>Cocoland </td> <td><div align="right">8.9917</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>Cocoland/Coffee</td> <td> <div align="right"><u>10.0000</u></div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>Sub-total </td> <td><div align="right"><u>18.9917</u></div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="right"></div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>4 </td> <td>Cocoland </td> <td><div align="right">44.4733</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>Coco/Coffee</td> <td> <div align="right">8.0000</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>Coco/Rubber</td> <td> <div align="right">1.5000</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>Coco/Black Pepper </td> <td><div align="right">1.5000</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>Coco/Black Pepper/Rubber </td> <td><div align="right"><u>1.5000</u></div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>Sub-total </td> <td><div align="right"><u>56.9733</u></div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="right"></div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>5 </td> <td>Cocoland </td> <td><div align="right">10.0000</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>Cocoland/Coffee </td> <td><div align="right">67.9151</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>Sub-total </td> <td><div align="right"><u>77.9151</u></div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><p>GRAND TOTAL</p></td> <td> <div align="right"><u>153.8801</u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup></div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>In this accord, the Court finds that BATCO's claim of a different land use in its petition for exemption was only a mere afterthought which, therefore, cannot be countenanced.<br><br>Finally, the Court cannot give credence to BATCO's claim of denial of due process when its certificates of title were cancelled and new ones were issued in favor of the Republic prior to the issuance of the DAR Regional Director's August 12, 1998 Order. While the final resolution of petitions for exemption, as a rule, should precede the placing of the property under the CARP and the issuance of the CLOA to the beneficiaries,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup> it bears stressing that the subject lands had already been placed under the CARP coverage in 1992, or long before the petition for exemption was filed by BATCO on May 6, 1998. In the meantime, the actions undertaken by BATCO such as the VOS on January 6, 1993,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup> the counter-offer of valuation for the subject lands according to their declared land uses as contained in the afore-mentioned landowner’s reply<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup> dated May 6, 1997, the letter-protest dated May 23, 1997 (which challenged the survey of the lands), and the identification of the beneficiaries grounded on its alleged failure to choose the retention area,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup> all affirmed the coverage of the subject lands under the CARP. Considering further that the claim of denial of due process was never raised in the proceedings before the DAR but belatedly brought up only in its Memorandum<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup> dated July 28, 2005 filed before the CA<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup> and in the absence of showing that the same prevented it from presenting its case before the DAR officials, it cannot be said that BATCO was denied due process. Neither was it deprived of its properties without just compensation given that after it rejected the DAR's valuation on May 6, 1997, the DAR immediately caused the deposit of the compensation in cash and in agrarian reform bonds on June 11, 1997.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> All told, the denial of BATCO’s petition for exemption was proper.
