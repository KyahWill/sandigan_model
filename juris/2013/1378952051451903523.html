Odeña (respondent) who was a teacher previously employed by petitioner. She was illegally dismissed and is now seeking full payment of her backwages and other benefits as she interprets them to be.<br><br><center><b>Facts of the Case</b><br></center><br>Some of the incidents of this case have been previously resolved by this Court in <i>Elenita S. Binay, in her capacity as Mayor of the City of Makati, Mario Rodriguez and Priscilla Ferrolino v. Emerita Odeña</i>, docketed as G.R. No. 163683, in a Decision dated 08 June 2007 (hereinafter, the 2007 Decision).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> This Court ruled therein that respondent had been illegally dismissed and was thus ordered to be reinstated and paid her backwages, computed from date of dismissal up to date of reinstatement, but in no case to exceed five (5) years.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br><b><i>2007 Decision</i></b><br><br>The factual findings in the 2007 Decision of this Court are summarized as follows:<br><br>Respondent had been employed by petitioner as a teacher since 1980. She was a contractual employee up to 30 July 1992 and a casual employee from July 1992 until November 1996. Sometime in 1996, she held the position of Clerk I and was detailed at the Library Department of the Makati High School.<br><br>It was the practice of respondent to sign an Attendance Sheet bearing her name and signature to signify attendance, instead of using a Daily Time Record.<br><br>In 2000, she was asked to explain why she supposedly failed to report for work starting in November 1999. She explained that she did not incur those alleged absences and presented the employees’ log book as proof of her attendance. Her explanation was disregarded by then education consultant Priscilla Ferrolino.<br><br>Thereafter, on 8 June 2000, Mayor Elenita S. Binay issued a Memorandum dropping respondent from the roll of employees, effective at the close of office hours of 15 May 2000, in view of the latter’s absences without official leave (AWOL) starting on 10 November 1999. Respondent moved for reconsideration, but her motion was denied. Aggrieved, she appealed to the Civil Service Commission (CSC).<br><br>The CSC ruled that the dropping of respondent from the roll of employees was not supported by evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> It found that she had actually reported for work from November 1999 to May 2000; and that, while she had incurred absences during that period, those were not equivalent to a continuous absence of at least thirty (30) working days.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> The Attendance Sheet duly complied with regulations,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> as it indicated her name and signature, as well as times of arrival and departure, and was verified by her immediate supervisor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Furthermore, she could not have received her corresponding salary for the said period if she were indeed absent.<br><br>The CSC, by virtue of respondent’s illegal dismissal, directed petitioner to: (1) reinstate her; and (2) to pay her back salaries from the time of her separation up to her actual reinstatement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Consequently, petitioner moved for reconsideration, but the motion was denied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Aggrieved, it filed a Rule 43 Petition appealing the findings of the CSC to the CA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>The CA denied the Petition and affirmed that respondent was illegally dismissed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> The CA affirmed the CSC Resolutions which ordered the reinstatement of respondent and payment of back salaries, but subject to the modification that an illegally terminated civil service employee, like respondent, is entitled to back salaries <b>limited to a maximum period of five (5) years</b>, and not to full salaries from her illegal dismissal up to her reinstatement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>The dispositive portion of the CA Decision provides as follows:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the petition is DISMISSED for lack of merit. <b>CSC Resolution No. 010962 dated May 29, 2001 and CSC Resolution No. 021491 dated November 18, 2002 are affirmed</b>, without prejudice to the filing of whatever appropriate disciplinary case against Emerita Odeña, and <b>subject to the modification that payment of her back salaries shall be computed from date of dismissal up to date of reinstatement, but in no case to exceed five (5) years</b>.<br><br>SO ORDERED.

She argued that the 2007 Decision of this Court has become final and executor, and that, under the same, payment of respondent’s back salaries shall be limited to five years only. Moreover, respondent had not been forced to sign a Release, Quitclaim and Waiver, as she executed the same voluntarily. While respondent claimed that the amount of P550,000 representing five (5)-year back salaries is insufficient, respondent has not submitted the supposed correct amount that she should receive. Furthermore, as to her leave credits, respondent had failed to submit the necessary documents so the city government could start processing the release. Finally, as regards the GSIS and PAG-IBIG benefits, petitioner contended that respondent has to personally apply for their release from the said government agencies.<br></blockquote><b><i>The Ruling of the CSC</i></b><br><br>The CSC ruled in favor of respondent, and directed petitioner to pay her backwages and other benefits from the period of her illegal dismissal <b>until her early retirement</b>, or for a period of seven (7) years, eight (8) months and twenty-eight (28) days.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>The CSC, in its Resolution No. 082264,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> stated that the 5-year limit was inequitable, to wit:<br><blockquote><b>Although it would appear that the Supreme Court in the aforementioned case affirmed the ruling of the Court of Appeals, it is worth noting, however, that there is nothing in the High Court’s decision, either in the body or the dispositive portion, that categorically states that Odena is entitled to back salaries and other benefits only for a period not exceeding five (5) years. As such, it is apposite to conclude that Odena is entitled to the payment of her entire back salaries and other benefits from the date of her illegal dismissal up to the date of her retirement, as will be explained later.</b> This is precisely why the Commission, in all its Resolutions promulgated in relation with this case, was consistent in holding that Odena must be paid her back salaries and other benefits from the days of her illegal dismissal up to her reinstatement.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Admittedly, there are rulings of the Supreme Court where the claims of an illegally dismissed employee were limited only to five (5) years without conditions and qualifications. Such rulings, however, were expressly and explicitly abandoned in subsequent decisions of the High Court.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>But even if the Supreme Court had implicitly intended, in the case of Binay vs. Odena, 524 SCRA 248 (2007), that Odena is entitled only to five (5) years of back salaries and other benefits, such will not bar her from claiming payment of the same in full for the entire period she was out from the service as a result of her illegal dismissal. <b>To limit the entitlement of Odena to only five (5) years of back salaries and other benefits will indubitably cause serious injustice to her inasmuch as the prevailing jurisprudence at the time of promulgation of the <i>Binay</i> case, supra, is that an illegally dismissed employee who is ordered reinstated by competent authority is entitled to the payment of his/her illegal dismissal up to his/her reinstatement. Thus, even if the Supreme Court indeed intended to limit to only five (5) years the back salaries and other benefits of Odeña, and that said decision had already become final and executory, the same had to yield to the higher interest of justice.</b> x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> (Emphases supplied)<br></blockquote>The dispositive portion of CSC Resolution No. 082264<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> provides as follows:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, <b>the incumbent City Mayor of Makati is hereby directed to recompute the full back salaries and other benefits of Emerita B.

Said benefits shall include the allowances, 13<sup>th</sup> month pay, bonuses, cash gifts, all other monetary benefits which other employees of the City Government of Makati received within the same period, yearly fifteen (15) days sick and fifteen (15) days vacation leave benefits for the same period including commutation of her entire accrued leave credits that she earned prior to her illegal dismissal. <b>Should there appear, upon re-computation of Odeña’s back salaries and other benefit, an excess of the amount of P558,944.19 which she already received, said excess must be immediately paid her.</b><br><br>The City Mayor of Makati is directed to report to the Commission the action he will take to implement the Resolution, within 15 days from receipt hereof.

The CA regarded the CSC Resolutions, issued in relation to respondent’s Letter-Complaint, as orders of execution of the final and executory 2007 Decision of this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Thus, petitioner’s recourse to a Rule 43 Petition was unavailing, because orders of execution cannot be the subject of appeal, the proper remedy being a Rule 65 petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> The CA ruled that:<br><blockquote>This notwithstanding, even if such procedural infirmity is to be disregarded, the instant Petition for Review must still be dismissed for being a wrong mode of remedy.<br><br><i>Section 1(f), Rule 41 of the Revised Rules of Civil Procedure</i> provides that:&nbsp; <br><blockquote><b>Section 1.

Instead, such order may be challenged by the aggrieved party by way of a special civil action for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court.<br><br>Here, the instant Petition for review assails the CSC’s Resolution No. 082264 dated December 8, 2008 and Resolution No. 090622 dated April 28, 2009 ordering herein petitioner City of Government Makati to re-compute the full back salaries and benefits of private respondent from the time of her illegal dismissal up to her retirement. A cursory reading of the petition, however, reveals that the merits of the illegal dismissal case has already been adjudged with finality by the Supreme Court in a Decision dated June 8, 2007. <b>The assailed Resolutions of the CSC arose merely as an incident of the execution when the CSC modified the judgment award on account of private respondent’s complaint wherein she sought to be paid more than what has been awarded to her by the Supreme Court.</b><br><br>Such being the case, petitioner’s recourse to a Petition for Review is unavailing. The filing of a special civil action for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court was the proper remedy questioning an order of execution on the ground of grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Petitioner moved for reconsideration, but the CA denied the motion and affirmed its previous ruling.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br><b><i>The Present Petition</i></b><br><br>On 8 April 2010, petitioner filed before this Court a Motion for Extension of Time to File Petition for Review on Certiorari (Motion for Extension), praying for an additional period of thirty (30) days or until 9 May 2010 within which to file a petition for review on certiorari.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> On 27 April 2010, We denied the Motion for Extension for failing to state material dates.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Petitioner received notice of the denial only on 9 June 2010, or one and a half months after its promulgation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>In the meantime, on 7 May 2010, petitioner filed the instant Petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Thereafter, this Court required respondent to file a comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> notwithstanding the previous denial of petitioner’s Motion for Extension.<br><br>In her Comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> respondent argued: (1) the CA did not err in considering the CSC Resolutions as execution orders; (2) petitioner failed to properly serve its pleadings upon respondent; (3) respondent is entitled to the moneys awarded her by the CSC; and (4) the Petition was filed out of time, since petitioner’s Motion for Extension had been denied by this Court.<br><br>In response, petitioner countered as follows:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> (1) no motion for execution was ever filed before the CSC, since petitioner had already complied with this Court’s 2007 Decision by paying respondent; (2) petitioner had been serving its pleadings at respondent’s last address on record; (3) the issue of respondent’s benefits had already been settled with finality; and (4) petitioner was notified of this Court’s denial of its Motion for Extension only on 9 June 2010, many days after the present Petition had been filed and after this Court had constructively admitted the present Petition by requiring respondent to file her Comment.<br><br><center><b>Issues</b><br></center><br>Based on the submissions of both parties, the following main issues are presented for resolution by this Court:<br><blockquote>1.&nbsp;Whether petitioner undertook an improper remedy when it filed a Rule 43 Petition with the CA to question the Resolutions issued by the CSC; and<br><br>2.&nbsp;Whether respondent, after receiving payment from petitioner, is still entitled to the additional amount awarded by the CSC.<br></blockquote>Respondent raises the following preliminary procedural matters:<br><br>First, she argues that the present Petition was filed out of time, since petitioner’s Motion for Extension had been denied, thereby causing the lapse of the original period for filing the Petition.<br><br>We dispose of this argument forthwith.

The CA, however erred in dismissing petitioner’s Rule 43 Petition for being improper.<br><br>To recall, the CA ruled that an order of execution is not appealable under Section 1(f), Rule 41of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> It reasoned that the correct remedy should have been a special civil action for certiorari under Rule 65.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>Section 1(f), Rule 41provides, in pertinent part:<br><blockquote>SECTION 1.

This Court in <i>Banaga v. Majaducon</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> enumerated the exceptions as follows:<br><blockquote>Even prior to the promulgation of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, <b>the rule that no appeal lies from an order or writ directing the execution of a final judgment, for otherwise a case will not attain finality, is not absolute since a party aggrieved by an improper or irregular execution of a judgment is not without a remedy</b>. Thus, in <i>Limpin v. Intermediate Appellate Court</i>, the Court enumerated the exceptional circumstances where a party may elevate the matter of an improper execution for appeal, to wit:<br><blockquote><b>There may, to be sure, be instances when an error may be committed in the course of execution proceedings prejudicial to the rights of a party. These instances, rare though they may be, do call for correction by a superior court, as where —</b><br><br>1)&nbsp;<b>the writ of execution varies the judgment;</b><br><br>2)&nbsp;<b>there has been a change in the situation of the parties making execution inequitable or unjust;</b><br><br>x x x x<br><br>6)&nbsp;it appears that the writ of execution has been improvidently issued, or that it is defective in substance, or is issued against the wrong party, <b>or that the judgment debt has been paid or otherwise satisfied</b>, or the writ was issued without authority;<br></blockquote>In these exceptional circumstances, considerations of justice and equity dictate that there be some mode available to the party aggrieved of elevating the question to a higher court. <b>That mode of elevation may be either by appeal (writ of error or certiorari), or by a special civil action of certiorari, prohibition, or mandamus.</b><br><br>The aforementioned pronouncement has been reiterated in cases subsequent to t&nbsp;he adoption of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure. The Court finds no sound justification to abandon the aforequoted pronouncement insofar as it recognizes the filing of an ordinary appeal as a proper remedy to assail a writ or order issued in connection with the execution of a final judgment, where a factual review in the manner of execution is called for to determine whether the challenged writ or order has indeed varied the tenor of the final judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> (Emphases supplied)<br></blockquote>To rule that a special civil action for certiorari constitutes the sole and exclusive remedy to assail a writ or order of execution would unduly restrict the remedy available to a party prejudiced by an improper or illegal execution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> It must be borne in mind that the issue in a special civil action for certiorari is whether the lower court acted without or in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br>In the instant case, the appeal of the CSC Resolutions under Rule 43 is proper on two (2) points: (1) they varied the 2007 Decision and (2) the judgment debt has been paid or otherwise satisfied.<br><br>First, the CSC Resolutions have varied the 2007 Decision, considering that instead of directing the payment of backwages for a period not exceeding five (5) years, the CSC ordered petitioner to pay an amount equivalent to almost eight (8) years.<br><br>Second, the judgment debt arising from the 2007 Decision has been satisfied as respondent has already received payment from petitioner the amount of P558,944.19, representing her back salaries not exceeding five (5) years, as computed by petitioner.<br><br>All these circumstances require a factual review of the manner of the execution of the 2007 Decision, which should have prompted the CA to take cognizance of the appeal. Clearly, these circumstances fall under the above-quoted enumeration of the exceptions to the general rule that an order of execution is not subject to appeal. Thus, the CA committed grave error when it denied petitioner’s appeal for being the wrong remedy.<br><br>At this juncture, however, a remand of the case to the CA would serve no useful purpose, since the core issue herein—more specifically, whether respondent is entitled to the money awarded to her by the CSC—may already be resolved using the records of the proceedings. A remand would unnecessarily burden the parties with the concomitant difficulties and expenses of another proceeding, in which they would have to present similar arguments and pieces of evidence.<br><br>Thus, we deem it proper to resolve the issue of whether respondent is entitled to the amount awarded to her by the CSC. We rule in the negative.<br><br><b><i>II.&nbsp;Respondent is not entitled to the amount awarded to her by the CSC.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </i></b><br><br>We reverse the ruling of the CSC granting respondent additional amounts pertaining to her back wages equivalent to seven (7) years, eight (8) months and twenty-eight (28) days, or for the entire period that she was not reinstated; more specifically, from the time of her illegal dismissal on 15 May 2000 until her early retirement on 13 February 2008, contrary to our 2007 Decision, which limited the said award only to five (5) years. We reverse based on the following reasons:<br><blockquote>1.&nbsp;The Letter-Complaint is a belated attempt to seek the reversal of the 2007 Decision, which should not have been considered by the CSC in the first place.

The amounts awarded by the CSC exceeding this payment is not justified under this Court’s 2007 Decision.<br></blockquote>To recall, the 2007 Decision, in relation to the CA Decision dated 14 May 2004, directed petitioner to do two things: (1) to reinstate respondent to her former position;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> and (2) to pay her back wages to be computed from the time of her illegal dismissal until her reinstatement to her former position, but not to exceed five (5) years.<br><br>The reinstatement portion was rendered moot by respondent’s early retirement effective on 13 February 2008.<br><br>To comply with the second directive, the amount of P558,944.19 representing the amount of back wages for a period not exceeding five (5) years, as computed by petitioner, was paid to respondent.<br><br>We rule, however, that the Quitclaim executed by respondent is void and of no effect and cannot validly foreclose her right to receive amounts pertaining to her early retirement.<br><br><b><i>A.&nbsp;The Letter-Complaint is a belated attempt to seek the reversal of this Court’s 2007 Decision, which should not have been considered by the CSC.&nbsp; </i></b><br><br>The CSC grievously erred in taking cognizance of respondent’s Letter-Complaint which was actually a prohibited appeal of the 2007 Decision that by then had long become final and executory.<br><br>It is axiomatic that final and executory judgments can no longer be attacked by any of the parties or be modified, directly or indirectly, even by the highest court of the land.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br>In the instant case, respondent’s Letter-Complaint, which is clearly geared towards the reversal of this Court’s 2007 Decision, states as follows:<br><blockquote><b>Ipinaglaban ko itong karapatang ito at ito ay aking nakamtan sa papel nga lamang dahil hindi ito lubos na kapanalunan.

In the said Letter-Complaint, respondent expresses her dismay at the seemingly insufficient award of back wages, which were limited to five (5) years vis-à-vis the period of almost eight (8) years that she was out of work. The CSC should have realized that it did not have any authority to entertain any attempt to seek the reversal of the 2007 Decision.<br><br>Indeed, while being well-aware that the 2007 Decision had long become final and executory, and that any such appeal by respondent would be futile and useless, it still erringly took cognizance of the appeal and worse, modified the 2007 Decision, instead of dismissing the Letter-Complaint outright.<br><br>As the final arbiter of all legal questions properly brought before it, our decision in any given case constitutes the law of that particular case, from which there is no appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> The 2007 Decision bars a further repeated consideration of the very same issues that have already been settled with finality; more particularly, the illegal dismissal of respondent, as well as the amount of back wages that she was entitled to receive by reason thereof.<br><br>To once again reopen that issue through a different avenue would defeat the existence of our courts as final arbiters of legal controversies.

The appellate court ruled in this wise:<br><blockquote>However, as regards the CSC’s order to pay Emerita Odeña’s “<i>salaries from the time of her separation up to her actual reinstatement</i>,” the Court deems it appropriate to modify the same. <b>It is settled that an illegally terminated civil service employee is entitled to back salaries limited only to a maximum period of five years, not full back salaries from her illegal dismissal up to her reinstatement</b> (<i>Marohombsar vs. Court of Appeals, 326 SCRA 62 [2000]</i>). Hence, considering that Emerita Odeña was dropped from the rolls effective at the close of office hours of May 15, 2000, her back salaries shall be computed from May 16, 2000 up to date of reinstatement, but not to exceed five (5) years.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> (Emphases supplied)<br></blockquote>The five-year limit was also reflected in the dispositive portion of the CA Decision as follows:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the petition is DISMISSED for lack of merit. <b>CSC Resolution No. 010962 dated May 29, 2001</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> <b>and CSC Resolution No. 021491 dated November 18, 2002</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> <b>are affirmed</b>, without prejudice to the filing of whatever appropriate disciplinary case against Emerita Odeña, and subject to the modification that payment of her back salaries shall be computed from date of dismissal <b>up to date of reinstatement, but in no case to exceed five (5) years</b>.<br><br>SO ORDERED.

Sadang</i> we nullified an order requiring an indemnity bond since the requirement was not contained in the dispositive part of the final judgment. Similarly in <i>Supercars, Inc. v. Minister of Labor</i> we set aside the award of backwages for the period that the writ of execution was unserved since the final and executory decision of the Minister of Labor merely directed the reinstatement of the laborers to their former positions. Finally, <i>David v. Court of Appeals</i> affirmed the ruling of the Court of Appeals mandating the payment of simple legal interest only with nothing said about compounded interest since the judgment sought to be executed therein ordered the payment of simple legal interest only and held nothing about payment of compounded interest. This Court can do no less than follow these precedents in the instant petition.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Verily, since the Orders in question are a wide departure from and a material amplification of the final and at least executory HLURB Decision, they are pro tanto void and absolutely unenforceable for any purpose.

Timario</i> we nullified and set aside the imposition of interest in a subsequent order of the lower court on the ground that the dispositive part of the judgment “absolutely made no mention of any interest on the amount of the judgment, hence there is no ambiguity to be clarified from the statements made in the body of the decision x x x” We shall do the same in the instant case.

We emphasize that this Decision, as well as our 2007 Decision, pertain mainly to her entitlement to back wages due to her illegal dismissal. We were made aware, however, of a quitclaim that she executed in favor of petitioner, signed after receiving payment of her back wages, and which seemingly included a waiver of her rights to her retirement benefits. We deem it necessary, therefore, to discuss the implications of that quitclaim, with regard not only to the payment of back wages, but also as to her retirement benefits.<br><br>Petitioner argues that the waiver executed by respondent forecloses any right to receive additional amounts pertaining to her benefits.<br><br>We cannot sustain petitioner’s argument.

Courts have stepped in to invalidate questionable transactions, especially where there is clear proof that a waiver, for instance, was obtained from an unsuspecting or a gullible person, or where the agreement or settlement was unconscionable on its face. A quitclaim is ineffective in barring recovery of the full measure of a worker's rights, and the acceptance of benefits therefrom does not amount to estoppel. Moreover, a quitclaim in which the consideration is scandalously low and inequitable cannot be an obstacle to the pursuit of a worker's legitimate claim.<br></blockquote>A reading of the wording of the Release, Waiver and Quitclaim<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> executed by respondent reveals that the waiver <b>also included her retirement benefits</b> as follows:<br><blockquote>1.

Those obligations in relation to her previous employment erroneously include within its scope her retirement benefits. This waiver, therefore, cannot be countenanced, insofar as it included her retirement benefits.<br><br>We rule that the said waiver is void in two respects, more particularly the following: (1) there was fraud or deceit on the part of petitioner; and (2) the consideration for the quitclaim was unreasonable.<br><br>Obviously, the waiver was merely inveigled from respondent, who had been anxiously waiting to receive payment of her back wages as decreed by this Court. Petitioner basically cornered respondent into signing the same by making its execution a pre-condition before she could receive her back wages.<br><br>Similarly, the consideration for the quitclaim is unreasonably low, if we consider that she was supposed to receive her retirement benefits as well, computed from the time she started serving petitioner since way back in 1980. The quitclaim basically meant that the P558,944.19 she received from petitioner as payment of back wages was likewise in fulfillment of her retirement benefits as well. Needless to state, the quitclaim, in effect, unduly limited the amount of retirement pay that she was supposed to receive from petitioner. The waiver is, therefore, without effect insofar as it foreclosed her entitlement to her retirement benefits. It should not prevent her from receiving her retirement benefits for her employment.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the instant Petition for Review filed by City of Makati is hereby <b>GRANTED</b>.
