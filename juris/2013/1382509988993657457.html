Consequently, its denial of the subject motion to dismiss was altogether improper.<br><br>To elucidate, it is clear that the Court, in <i>Southern Hemisphere</i>, did not make any definitive ruling on the constitutionality of RA 9372. The <i>certiorari</i> petitions in those consolidated cases were dismissed based solely on procedural grounds, namely: (<i>a</i>) the remedy of <i>certiorari</i> was improper;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> (<i>b</i>) petitioners therein lack <i>locus standi</i>;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> and (c) petitioners therein failed to present an actual case or controversy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Therefore, there was no grave abuse of discretion.<br><br>The same conclusion cannot, however, be reached with regard to the RTC’s ruling on the sufficiency of private respondents’ petition for declaratory relief.<br><br>Case law states that the following are the requisites for an action for declaratory relief: <b><i><u>first</u></i></b>, the subject matter of the controversy must be a deed, will, contract or other written instrument, statute, executive order or regulation, or ordinance; <b><i><u>second</u></i></b>, the terms of said documents and the validity thereof are doubtful and require judicial construction; <b><i><u>third</u></i></b>, there must have been no breach of the documents in question; <b><i><u>fourth</u></i></b>, there must be an actual justiciable controversy or the “ripening seeds” of one between persons whose interests are adverse; <b><i><u>fifth</u></i></b>, the issue must be ripe for judicial determination; and <b><i><u>sixth</u></i></b>, adequate relief is not available through other means or other forms of action or proceeding.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Based on a judicious review of the records, the Court observes that while the first,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> second,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> and third<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> requirements appear to exist in this case, the fourth, fifth, and sixth requirements, however, remain wanting.<br><br>As to the fourth requisite, there is serious doubt that an actual justiciable controversy or the “ripening seeds” of one exists in this case.<br><br>Pertinently, a justiciable controversy refers to an existing case or controversy that is appropriate or ripe for judicial determination, not one that is conjectural or merely anticipatory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Corollary thereto, by “ripening seeds” it is meant, not that sufficient accrued facts may be dispensed with, but that a dispute may be tried at its inception before it has accumulated the asperity, distemper, animosity, passion, and violence of a full blown battle that looms ahead. The concept describes a state of facts indicating imminent and inevitable litigation provided that the issue is not settled and stabilized by tranquilizing declaration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>A perusal of private respondents’ petition for declaratory relief would show that they have failed to demonstrate how they are left to sustain or are in immediate danger to sustain some direct injury as a result of the enforcement of the assailed provisions of RA 9372. Not far removed from the factual milieu in the <i>Southern Hemisphere</i> cases, private respondents only assert general interests as citizens, and taxpayers and infractions which the government could prospectively commit if the enforcement of the said law would remain untrammelled. As their petition would disclose, private respondents’ fear of prosecution was solely based on remarks of certain government officials which were addressed to the general public.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> They, however, failed to show how these remarks tended towards any prosecutorial or governmental action geared towards the implementation of RA 9372 against them. In other words, there was no particular, real or imminent threat to any of them. As held in <i>Southern Hemisphere</i>:<br><blockquote>Without any justiciable controversy, the petitions have become pleas for declaratory relief, over which the Court has no original jurisdiction. <b>Then again, declaratory actions characterized by “double contingency,” <u>where both the activity the petitioners intend to undertake and the anticipated reaction to it of a public official are merely theorized, lie beyond judicial review for lack of ripeness</u>.</b><br><br><b>The possibility of abuse in the implementation of RA 9372 does not avail to take the present petitions out of the realm of the surreal and merely imagined.</b> Such possibility is not peculiar to RA 9372 since the exercise of any power granted by law may be abused. Allegations of abuse <b><u>must be anchored on real events before courts may step in to settle actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable</u></b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> (Emphasis supplied; citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Thus, in the same light that the Court dismissed the SC petitions in the <i>Southern Hemisphere</i> cases on the basis of, among others, lack of actual justiciable controversy (or the ripening seeds of one), the RTC should have dismissed private respondents’ petition for declaratory relief all the same.<br><br>It is well to note that private respondents also lack the required <i>locus standi</i> to mount their constitutional challenge against the implementation of the above-stated provisions of RA 9372 since they have not shown any direct and personal interest in the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> While it has been previously held that transcendental public importance dispenses with the requirement that the petitioner has experienced or is in actual danger of suffering direct and personal injury,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> it must be stressed that cases involving the constitutionality of penal legislation belong to an altogether different genus of constitutional litigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Towards this end, compelling State and societal interests in the proscription of harmful conduct necessitate a closer judicial scrutiny of <i>locus standi</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> as in this case. To rule otherwise, would be to corrupt the settled doctrine of <i>locus standi</i>, as every worthy cause is an interest shared by the general public.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>As to the fifth requisite for an action for declaratory relief, neither can it be inferred that the controversy at hand is ripe for adjudication since the possibility of abuse, based on the above-discussed allegations in private respondents’ petition, remain highly-speculative and merely theorized. It is well-settled that a question is ripe for adjudication when the act being challenged has had a direct adverse effect on the individual challenging it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> This private respondents failed to demonstrate in the case at bar.<br><br>Finally, as regards the sixth requisite, the Court finds it irrelevant to proceed with a discussion on the availability of adequate reliefs since no impending threat or injury to the private respondents exists in the first place.<br><br>All told, in view of the absence of the fourth and fifth requisites for an action for declaratory relief, as well as the irrelevance of the sixth requisite, private respondents’ petition for declaratory relief should have been dismissed. Thus, by giving due course to the same, it cannot be gainsaid that the RTC gravely abused its discretion.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.
