				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">We resolve the petition for review on <i>certiorari</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> filed by petitioner Joseph Goyanko, Jr., administrator of the Estate of Joseph Goyanko, Sr., to nullify the decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated February 20, 2007 and the resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated July 31, 2007 of the Court of Appeals (<i>CA</i>) in CA-G.R. CV. No. 00257 affirming the decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court of Cebu City, Branch 16 (<i>RTC</i>) in Civil Case No. CEB-22277.&nbsp; The RTC dismissed the petitioner’s complaint for recovery of sum of money against United Coconut Planters Bank, Mango Avenue Branch (<i>UCPB</i>).<br><br><center><b><u>The Factual Antecedents</u></b><br></center><br>In 1995, the late Joseph Goyanko, Sr. (<i>Goyanko</i>) invested Two Million Pesos (P2,000,000.00) with Philippine Asia Lending Investors, Inc. (<i>PALII</i>); he died before the investment matured.&nbsp; Goyanko’s legitimate family, represented by the petitioner, and his illegitimate family presented conflicting claims to PALII for the release of the investment.&nbsp; Pending the investigation of the conflicting claims, PALII deposited the proceeds of the investment with UCPB on October 29, 1996<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> under the name “Phil Asia: ITF (In Trust For) The Heirs of Joseph Goyanko, Sr.” (<i>ACCOUNT</i>).&nbsp; On September 27, 1997, the deposit under the ACCOUNT was P1,509,318.76.<br><br>On December 11, 1997, UCPB allowed PALII to withdraw One Million Five Hundred Thousand Pesos (P1,500,000.00) from the Account, leaving a balance of only P9,318.76. When UCPB refused the demand to restore the amount withdrawn plus legal interest from December 11, 1997, the petitioner filed a complaint before the RTC. In its answer to the complaint, UCPB admitted, among others, the opening of the ACCOUNT under the name “ITF (In Trust For) The Heirs of Joseph Goyanko, Sr.,” (<i>ITF HEIRS</i>) and the withdrawal on December 11, 1997.<br><br><b><i>The RTC Ruling</i></b><br><br>In its August 27, 2003 decision, the RTC dismissed the petitioner’s complaint and awarded UCPB attorney’s fees, litigation expenses and the costs of the suit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>&nbsp; The RTC did not consider the words “ITF HEIRS” sufficient to charge UCPB with knowledge of any trust relation between PALII and Goyanko’s heirs (<i>HEIRS</i>).&nbsp; It concluded that UCPB merely performed its duty as a depository bank in allowing PALII to withdraw from the ACCOUNT, as the contract of deposit was officially only between PALII, in its own capacity, and UCPB.&nbsp; The petitioner appealed his case to the CA.<br><br><b><i>The CA’s Ruling</i></b><br><br>Before the CA, the petitioner maintained that <b>by opening the ACCOUNT, PALII established a trust by which it was the “trustee” and the HEIRS are the “trustors-beneficiaries;</b>” thus, UCPB should be liable for allowing the withdrawal.<br><br>The CA partially granted the petitioner’s appeal.&nbsp; It affirmed the August 27, 2003 decision of the RTC, but deleted the award of attorney’s fees and litigation expenses.&nbsp; The CA held that no express trust was created between the HEIRS and PALII.&nbsp; For a trust to be established, the law requires, among others, a competent trustor and trustee and a clear intention to create a trust, which were absent in this case.&nbsp; Quoting the RTC with approval, the CA noted that the contract of deposit was only between PALII in its own capacity and UCPB, and the words “ITF HEIRS” were insufficient to establish the existence of a trust.&nbsp; The CA concluded that as no trust existed, expressly or impliedly, UCPB is not liable for the amount withdrawn.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>In its July 31, 2007 resolution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> the CA denied the petitioner’s motion for reconsideration.&nbsp; Hence, the petitioner’s present recourse.<br><br><center><b><u>The Petition</u></b></center><br>The petitioner argues in his petition that: <i>first,</i> an express trust was created, as clearly shown by PALII’s March 28, 1996 and November 15, 1996 letters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>&nbsp; Citing jurisprudence, the petitioner emphasizes that from the established definition of a trust,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> PALII is clearly the trustor as it created the trust; UCPB is the trustee as it is the party in whom confidence is reposed as regards the property for the benefit of another; and the HEIRS are the beneficiaries as they are the persons for whose benefit the trust is created.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>&nbsp; Also, quoting <i>Development Bank of the Philippines v. Commission on Audit</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> the petitioner argues that the naming of the <i>cestui que trust</i> is not necessary as it suffices that they are adequately certain or identifiable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br><i>Second</i>, UCPB was negligent and in bad faith in allowing the withdrawal and in failing to inquire into the nature of the ACCOUNT.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> The petitioner maintains that the surrounding facts, the testimony of UCPB’s witness, and UCPB’s own records showed that: (1) UCPB was aware of the trust relation between PALII and the HEIRS; and (2) PALII held the ACCOUNT in a trust capacity.&nbsp; <i>Finally</i>, the CA erred in affirming the RTC’s dismissal of his case for lack of cause of action.&nbsp; The petitioner insists that since an express trust clearly exists, UCPB, the trustee, should not have allowed the withdrawal.<br><br><center><b><u>The Case for UCPB</u></b></center><br>UCPB posits, in defense, that the ACCOUNT involves an ordinary deposit contract between PALII and UCPB only, which created a debtor-creditor relationship obligating UCPB to return the proceeds to the account holder-PALII.&nbsp; Thus, it was not negligent in handling the ACCOUNT when it allowed the withdrawal.&nbsp; The mere designation of the ACCOUNT as “ITF” is insufficient to establish the existence of an express trust or charge it with knowledge of the relation between PALII and the HEIRS.<br><br>UCPB also argues that the petitioner changed the theory of his case.&nbsp; Before the CA, the petitioner argued that the HEIRS are the trustors-beneficiaries, and PALII is the trustee.&nbsp; Here, the petitioner maintains that PALII is the trustor, UCPB is the trustee, and the HEIRS are the beneficiaries.&nbsp; Contrary to the petitioner’s assertion, the records failed to show that PALII and UCPB executed a trust agreement, and PALII’s letters made it clear that PALII, on its own, intended to turn-over the proceeds of the ACCOUNT to its rightful owners.<br><br><center><b><u>The Court’s Ruling</u></b></center><br>The issue before us is whether UCPB should be held liable for the amount withdrawn because a trust agreement existed between PALII and UCPB, in favor of the HEIRS, when PALII opened the ACCOUNT with UCPB.<br><br><b>We rule in the negative.<br></b><br>We first address the procedural issues.&nbsp; We stress the settled rule that&nbsp; a petition for review on <i>certiorari </i>under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court resolves only questions of law, not questions of fact.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> A question, to be one of law, must not examine the probative value of the evidence presented by the parties;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> otherwise, the question is one of fact.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Whether an express trust exists in this case is a question of fact whose resolution is not proper in a petition under <i>Rule 45</i>.&nbsp; Reinforcing this is the equally settled rule that factual findings of the lower tribunals are conclusive on the parties and are not generally reviewable by this Court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> especially when, as here, the CA affirmed these findings.&nbsp; The plain reason is that this Court is not a trier of facts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> While this Court has, at times, permitted exceptions from the restriction,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> we find that none of these exceptions obtain in the present case.<br><br>Second, we find that the petitioner changed the theory of his case.&nbsp; The petitioner argued before the lower courts that an express trust exists between PALII as the trustee and the HEIRS as the trustor-beneficiary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>&nbsp; The petitioner now asserts that the express trust exists between PALII as the trustor and UCPB as the trustee, with the HEIRS as the beneficiaries.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>&nbsp; At this stage of the case, such change of theory is simply not allowed as it violates basic rules of fair play, justice and due process.&nbsp; Our rulings are clear - “a party who deliberately&nbsp; adopts&nbsp; a&nbsp; certain&nbsp; theory&nbsp; upon&nbsp; which&nbsp; the&nbsp; case&nbsp; was decided by the lower court will not be permitted to change [it] on appeal”;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>otherwise, the lower courts will effectively be deprived of the opportunity to decide the merits of the case fairly.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>&nbsp; Besides, courts of justice are devoid of jurisdiction to resolve a question not in issue.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>&nbsp; For these reasons, the petition must fail.&nbsp; Independently of these, the petition must still be denied.<br><br><b><i>No express trust exists; UCPB exercised the required diligence in handling the ACCOUNT; petitioner has no cause of action against UCPB</i></b><br><br>A trust, either express or implied,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> is the fiduciary relationship “x x x between one person having an equitable ownership of property and another person owning the legal title to such property, the equitable ownership of the former entitling him to the performance of certain duties and the exercise of certain powers by the latter.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>&nbsp; Express or direct trusts are created by the direct and positive acts of the trustor or of the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>&nbsp; No written words are required to create an express trust.&nbsp; This is clear from Article 1444 of the Civil Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> but, the creation of an express trust must be firmly shown; it cannot be assumed from loose and vague declarations or circumstances capable of other interpretations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>In <i>Rizal Surety &amp; Insurance Co. v. CA,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> we laid down the requirements before an express trust will be recognized:<br><br><blockquote>Basically, <b>these elements include a competent trustor and trustee, an ascertainable trust res, and sufficiently certain beneficiaries. xxx each of the above elements is required to be established, and, if any one of them is missing, it is fatal to the trusts (sic).&nbsp; Furthermore, there must be a present and complete disposition of the trust property, notwithstanding that the enjoyment in the beneficiary will take place in the future</b>.&nbsp; It is essential, too, that the purpose be an active one to prevent trust from being executed into a legal estate or interest, and one that is not in contravention of some prohibition of statute or rule of public policy.&nbsp; <b>There must also be some power of administration other than a mere duty to perform a contract although the contract is for a third-party beneficiary.&nbsp; A declaration of terms is essential, and these must be stated with reasonable certainty in order that the trustee may administer,</b> and that the court, if called upon so to do, may enforce, the trust. [emphasis ours]</blockquote><br>Under these standards, we hold that no express trust was created.&nbsp; <b>First, </b>while an ascertainable trust res and sufficiently certain beneficiaries may exist, a competent trustor and trustee do not.&nbsp; <b>Second,</b> UCPB, as trustee of the ACCOUNT, was never under any equitable duty to deal with or given any power of administration over it.&nbsp; On the contrary, it was PALII that undertook the duty to hold the title to the ACCOUNT for the benefit of the HEIRS.&nbsp; <b>Third</b>, PALII, as the trustor, did not have the right to the beneficial enjoyment of the ACCOUNT.&nbsp; <b>Finally</b>, the terms by which UCPB is to administer the ACCOUNT was not shown with reasonable certainty.&nbsp; While we agree with the petitioner that a trust’s beneficiaries need not be particularly identified for a trust to exist, <b>the intention to create an express trust must first be firmly established</b>, along with the other elements laid above; absent these, no express trust exists.<br><br>Contrary to the petitioner’s contention, PALII’s letters and UCPB’s records established UCPB’s participation as a mere depositary of the proceeds of the investment.&nbsp; In the March 28, 1996 letter, PALII manifested its intention to pursue an active role in and up to the turnover of those proceeds to their rightful owners,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> while in the November 15, 1996 letter, PALII begged the petitioner to trust it with the safekeeping of the investment proceeds and documents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Had it been PALII’s intention to create a trust in favor of the HEIRS, it would have relinquished any right or claim over the proceeds in UCPB’s favor as the trustee.&nbsp; As matters stand, PALII never did.<br><br>UCPB’s records and the testimony of UCPB’s witness<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> likewise lead us to the same conclusion.&nbsp; While the words “ITF HEIRS” may have created the impression that a trust account was created, a closer scrutiny reveals that it is an ordinary savings account.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>&nbsp; We give credence to UCPB’s explanation that the word “ITF” was merely used to distinguish the ACCOUNT from PALII’s other accounts with UCPB.&nbsp; A trust can be created without using the word “trust” or “trustee,” but the mere use of these words does not automatically reveal an intention to create a trust.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>&nbsp; If at all, these words showed a trustee-beneficiary relationship between PALII and the HEIRS.<br><br>Contrary to the petitioner’s position, UCPB did not become a trustee by the mere opening of the ACCOUNT.&nbsp; While this may seem to be the case, by reason of the fiduciary nature of the bank’s relationship with its depositors,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> this fiduciary relationship does not “convert the contract between the bank and its depositors from a simple loan to a trust agreement, whether express or implied.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>&nbsp; It simply means that the bank is obliged to observe “high standards of integrity and performance” in complying with its obligations under the contract of simple loan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>&nbsp; Per Article 1980 of the Civil Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> a creditor-debtor relationship exists between the bank and its depositor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> The savings deposit agreement is between the bank and the depositor;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> by receiving the deposit, the bank impliedly agrees to pay upon demand and only upon the depositor’s order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>Since the records and the petitioner’s own admission showed that the ACCOUNT was opened by PALII, UCPB’s receipt of the deposit signified that it agreed to pay PALII upon its demand and only upon its order.&nbsp; Thus, when UCPB allowed PALII to withdraw from the ACCOUNT, it was merely performing its contractual obligation under their savings deposit agreement.&nbsp; No negligence or bad faith<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> can be imputed to UCPB for this action.&nbsp; As far as UCPB was concerned, PALII is the account holder and not the HEIRS.&nbsp; As we held in <i>Fulton Iron Works Co. v. China Banking Corporation,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> the bank’s duty is to its creditor-depositor and not to third persons.&nbsp; Third persons, like the HEIRS here, who may have a right to the money deposited, cannot hold the bank responsible unless there is a court order or garnishment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup>&nbsp; The petitioner’s recourse is to go before a court of competent jurisdiction to prove his valid right over the money deposited.<br><br>In these lights, we find the third assignment of error mooted.&nbsp; A cause of action requires that there be a right existing in favor of the plaintiff, the defendant’s obligation to respect that right, and an act or omission of the defendant in breach of that right.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>&nbsp; We reiterate that UCPB’s obligation was towards PALII as its creditor-depositor.&nbsp; While the HEIRS may have a valid claim over the proceeds of the investment, the obligation to turn-over those proceeds lies with PALII.&nbsp; Since no trust exists, the petitioner’s complaint was correctly dismissed and the CA did not commit any reversible error in affirming the RTC decision. One final note, the burden to prove the existence of an express trust lies with the petitioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> For his failure to discharge this burden, the petition must fail.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of these considerations, we hereby <b>DENY</b> the petition and <b>AFFIRM</b> the decision dated February 20, 2007 and the resolution dated July 31, 2007 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
