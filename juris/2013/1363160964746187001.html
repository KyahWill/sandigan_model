Badana, Cashier I of the Cebu City Government to obtain cash advances despite the fact that she has previous unliquidated cash advances, thus allowing Rosalina G. Badana to accumulate Cash Advances amounting to P18,522,361.96, Philippine Currency, which remains unliquidated, thus accused in the performance of their official functions, had given unwarranted benefits to Rosalina G. Badana and themselves, to the damage and prejudice of the government, particularly the Cebu City Government.</blockquote><br>On July 2, 1998, the COA Regional Office No. VII (COA Regional Office) submitted a Narrative Report on the Results of the Examination of the Cash Accounts (<i>COA Report</i>) of Badana.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Pertinent portions of the COA Report read:<br><br><blockquote>“A.1. During the period [between] September 20, 1995 to March 5, 1998, records show that additional cash advances were granted, even if the previous cash advances were not yet liquidated. For example in the Trust Fund, a cash advance of Php800,000 was granted on December 8, 1997 even if Ms. Badana has an unliquidated cash advance balance of Php4,940,065.50 as of November 20, 1997 (Annex 19). The situation was true in granting all other cash advances from September 20, 1995 to March 5, 1998.<br><br>Another example in the General fund, cash advance of Php1,000,000.00 was granted on December 1, 1997 even if the unliquidated balance of Ms. Badana as of November 28, 1997 was Php8,469,054.19 (Annex 20). The situation is likewise true in granting all other cash advances during the same period mentioned in the preceding paragraph. This practice resulted in excessive granting of cash advances which created the opportunity to misappropriate public funds since idle funds were placed in the hands of the paymasters under their control and custody.<br><br>The practice is in violation of Section 89, PD 1445; Section 339, RA 7160 and paragraph 4.1.2 of COA Circular No. 97-002 resulting [in the] accumulation of excess cash in the custody of the accountable officer.<br><br>A.2 The following practices also facilitated the incurrence of the shortage:<br><ol type="a"><li>The amount of cash advance for salary payments was not equal to the net amount of the payroll for a pay period in violation of par. 4.2.1, COA Cir. No. 90-331, Section 48(g), COA Cir. No. 92-382 and par. 4.2.2, COA Cir. No. 97-002.<br><br>All disbursement vouchers covering the cash advances were not supported by payrolls or list of payees to determine the amount of the cash advance to be granted in violation of par. 4.2.2, COA Cir. No. 90-331. Ms. Rosalina G. Badana, who was assigned as paymaster to eight different offices/departments with a total monthly payroll of P5,747,569.96 (Annex 21) was granted an average monthly cash advance of P7,600,000.00 (Annex 22) or an excess of P1,900,000.00 monthly. As a result, idle funds were again placed in the hands and the total control of the Paymaster.<br><br></li><li>The face of the disbursement voucher (sample voucher marked as annex 23) did not indicate the specific legal purpose for which the cash advance was granted in violation of par. 4.1.5 COA Cir. No. 90-331, Section 48(e) COA Cir. 92-382 and par. 4.1.7 COA Cir. No. 97-002. It is so because all disbursement vouchers covering the granting of cash advances to the paymaster did not show the office/department, the number of payees and the payroll period covered by the cash advance. The city officials signed, certified and approved these vouchers despite the aforementioned deficiencies. It makes difficult to identify which liquidating report pertains to what particular cash advance, thus contributing to the opportunity to misappropriate the funds.<br><br></li><li> The provisions of par. 5.1.1 COA Cir. 90-331 and 97-002 and Section 48.k of COA Cir. No. 92-382 on the liquidation of cash advances within 5 days after the end of the month pay period was not followed due to the existing practice/procedure in the granting of cash advances… Likewise, unliquidated cash advance balance (audited) at the end of December 31, 1997 amounted to P15,553,475.61 consisting of P11,690,639.44 and P3,862,836.17 for General and Trust Fund respectively, in violation of par. 5.8 COA Cir. Nos. 90-331 and 97-002 and Section 48 (o) COA Cir. No. 92-382, resulting in the accumulation of unliquidated cash advances.<br><br>In January 1998, the paymaster was granted cash advances before the foregoing unliquidated balance (audited) was settled.

This is contrary to the generally accepted principles of Time period which requires that accounting should be time bounded[;] meaning cut-off date should be properly and strictly observed.<br><br></li><li>Submission of financial reports and its supporting schedules and vouchers/payrolls by the Accounting Division was very much delayed (Annex 25) in violation of Section 122, PD 1445 despite of several communications from the Auditor, latest of [(]which is attached as Annex 26[)] thus verification and reconciliation on the paymaster’s accountability cannot be determined immediately.<br><br><center>x x x x</center></li></ol>C. The following practices led to the concealment of the shortage of P18,527,137.19 from the September 20, 1995 to March 5, 1998:<br><br><ol><li>Accounting practices which resulted in inaccurate and misleading information in the financial statements in violation of Section 111, PD 1445 are enumerated below:<br><br><ol type="a"><li>Cash returns in January, 1998 were recorded as credits to accountability in December, 1997 amounting to P4,018,846.00 as follows:<br><br><center>x x x x</center><br>In effect, the balance of unliquidated cash advances as of December 31, 1997 was understated.<br><br></li><li>Some liquidations/disbursements in January, 1998 were included as credits to accountability in December, 1997 amounting to P1,974,386,45 Details are as follows:<br><br><center>x x x x<br></center><br>x x x As a result, the unliquidated cash advances as of December 31, 1997 is understated by P1,974,386.45.<br><br></li><li>Verification of accounting records maintained in the Accounting Division revealed that the index cards as a control device in the processing of cash advance voucher recorded only cash advances granted to paymasters (Annex 24). It failed to show the liquidation/disposition of public funds. Hence, unliquidated balance of cash advances cannot be determined instantly when a cash advance voucher is being processed by the accounting personnel.</li></ol><br>Summarizing par. a and b, the total understatement to Ms. Badana’s unliquidated cash advances per accounting records as of December 31, 1997 amounted to P5,993,232.45 for the General Fund. This practice is in violation of Section 111 of PD 1445. The financial statements appeared inaccurate and misleading because of “window dressing.”<br><br></li><li>Presentation of paid payrolls and vouchers already recorded in the cash book/subsidiary ledgers as cash items thus misleading the auditors into believing them as valid cash items. There is untruthful presentation of facts constituting deceit or fraud.<br><br>The scheme is explained below.<br><br>Paid payrolls and vouchers already recorded in the cashbook and in the subsidiary ledgers were presented as cash items during the count on May 13, 1996, November 27, 1996, June 9, 1997 and November 19, 1997. These cash items were treated as credits to her accountability, thereby reducing her accountability and consequently concealing her shortage. This scheme was made possible as the paymaster can readily have access to paid payrolls and vouchers x x x. The following facilitated the use of fraudulent scheme:<br><br>1.1 The paid payrolls and vouchers were placed in an unlocked box (carton) under the table of the bookkeeper.<br><br>1.2 The paymaster was allowed to get/retrieve paid payrolls and vouchers from the said box kept by the bookkeeper.<br><br>1.3 Failure of the Disbursing officer to stamp “PAID” all paid payrolls and vouchers. This is a control measure to avoid re- use or recycling of documents.<br><br>The accountable officer resorted to the scheme abovementioned with the intention of claiming double credit when in truth and in fact, she had been credited already of said transactions: These are the following:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="50%"><div align="CENTER">Date </div></td> <td width="50%"><div align="CENTER">Amount</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">May 13, 1996 </div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">P3,016,239.07</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">Nov. 27, 1996 </div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">P5,983,102.94</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">June 9, 1997 </div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">P7,959,677.07</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">Nov. 19, 1997 </div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">P12,438,954.88</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>In effect, as early as May 13, 1996 and subsequently thereafter, she had already incurred shortages but was able to conceal them through deceit and fraudulent means as explained above….<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></li></ol></blockquote><br>The petitioners moved for reinvestigation; the prosecution interposed no objection, provided that the petitioners’ motions would be treated as a motion for reconsideration of the Ombudsman’s resolution directing the filing of information.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> The prosecution manifested that, upon its recommendation, the Ombudsman resolved to maintain the information.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>On arraignment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> the accused pleaded not guilty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> During the pre- trial of December 7, 1999, the prosecution and the petitioners entered into a stipulation of facts:<br><br><blockquote><ol><li>That at all times material to this case, all of the accused are public officials of the City of Cebu.<br></li></ol><div style="text-align: center;">x x x x<br></div><br><ol start="5"><li> That the cash advance voucher has three boxes: Box A, Box B, and Box C.<br><br></li><li>That Box A is to be signed by the head of the office requesting the cash advance;<br><br></li><li>That Box B is to be signed by the head of the office which would conduct pre-audit of the cash advances;<br><br></li><li>That Box C is to be signed by the person of authority who will finally approve the cash advances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote><br>The prosecution presented Ariesga and Chan as its witnesses. Relying on the audit team’s findings, the prosecution claimed that the shortage was incurred due to the failure of Badana and of the petitioners to comply with the laws, rules and regulations governing the granting, utilization and liquidation of cash advances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> For one, the vouchers for cash advances lacked an indication of the specific purpose for which an amount was being requested; the office or department to be paid, the number of payees, and the payroll period to be paid were not specified.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> For another, the amounts requested were not equal to the amount of payroll for the pertinent pay period; the vouchers covering the cash advances for the payment of government employees were not supported by payrolls for a proper determination of the amount needed for the purpose. Thus, although the monthly payroll of the eight departments within Badana’s responsibility required more than P5 million, the cash advance granted for each month averaged more than P7 million. Also, the petitioners repeatedly affixed their signatures and allowed the disbursement of public funds through cash advances, regardless of previous unliquidated cash advances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Cash advances were not liquidated within the period prescribed by law, enabling the use of subsequent cash advances to liquidate previous cash advances.<br><br>Meanwhile, the Ombudsman rendered a decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> in the administrative aspect of the case, finding Jaca and Cesa guilty of<i> simple neglect </i>of duty and imposed on them the penalty of suspension for six (6) months. The case against petitioner Gaviola was dismissed for being moot and academic. On Cesa’s appeal, the Court of Appeals and, eventually, this Court sustained the Ombudsman’s ruling.<br><br><center><b><u>SANDIGANBAYAN’S RULING</u></b><br></center><br>On December 16, 2004, the Sandiganbayan promulgated its decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> finding the petitioners and Bacasmas guilty as charged. The Sandiganbayan held the petitioners solidarily liable to the Cebu City government for the amount of P18,527,137.19.<br><br>The Sandiganbayan ruled that all the elements under Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 were established by the prosecution: <i>first</i>, the petitioners are all public officials; <i>second</i>, the public officials committed the prohibited acts during the performance of their official duties;<i> third</i>, based on the audit team’s examinations, the undue injury suffered by the government amounted to P18,527,137.19 – the amount of Badana’s accumulated shortage; <i>fourth</i>, the petitioners gave unwarranted benefits to Badana, which resulted in undue injury to the government, by illegally allowing her to obtain cash advances; and <i>fifth</i>, the petitioners acted with gross inexcusable negligence in the performance of their duties. The Sandiganbayan relied largely on the COA Report to support a finding that the Cebu City government lost the amount of P18,527,137.19 under the petitioners’ collective watch.<br><br>The Sandiganbayan explained that while the information charged and recited all the modes of violating Section 3(e) of RA No. 3019, the prosecution is only required to prove any of these modes to warrant conviction. The Sandiganbayan held:<br><br><blockquote><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, accused ALAN C. GAVIOLA, EUSTAQUIO B. CESA, BENILDA N. BACASMAS and EDNA J. JACA are found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of having violated Sec. 3(e) of RA 3019; and each accused is sentenced to suffer the indeterminate penalty of twelve (12) years and one day as minimum and fifteen (15) years as maximum, with the accessory penalty of perpetual disqualification from public office. These Accused are directed to indemnify jointly and severally the City Government of Cebu the amount of Eighteen Million Five Hundred Twenty-Seven Thousand One Hundred Thirty-Seven and 19/100 Pesos (Php18,527,137.19).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></blockquote><br>The petitioners separately moved for reconsideration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> but the Sandiganbayan denied their motions on February 1, 2005.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Hence, these present petitions.<br><br><center><b><u>THE PETITIONERS’ ARGUMENTS</u></b></center><br>Due to the (i) commonality of the factual circumstance that led to the petitioners’ prosecution and conviction, as well as (ii) the different positions occupied by each of the petitioners, various and varied arguments were submitted.

For him, the approval of vouchers was a ministerial act done not only after the City Accountant had pre-audited the vouchers (by affixing her signature in Box B), but after the Internal Control Office<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> and a member of his staff, Virginia Peña, had determined the regularity of the vouchers and their attachments.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Gaviola avers that the prosecution failed to present evidence to show the absence of supporting documents when he affixed his signature on the vouchers. He adds that his duties do not impose upon him accountability for the funds entrusted to Badana or the City Treasurer; neither is he tasked with pre-audit activities nor with the record keeping of a paymaster’s accountabilities.<br><br>The following are the defenses common to the petitioners:<br><br><b><i>b. Good faith in affixing their signatures <br>to the disbursement vouchers&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </i></b><br><br>The petitioners invoked good faith in affixing their signatures to the disbursement vouchers. They deny any knowledge of Badana’s shortages until after the surprise audit was conducted on March 5, 1998.<br><br>They argue that since the COA did not send them any notice of disallowance of Badana’s cash advances,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> despite the COA’s semestral cash examination, they had the right to presume regularity in Badana’s performance of her job as paymaster.<br><br><b><i>c. Fatally defective information</i></b><br><br>The petitioners argue that the information is fatally defective for violating their right to be informed of the nature and cause of accusation against them. The prosecution could not have validly alleged that the petitioners committed the offense “with deliberate intent, with manifest partiality, evident bad faith <b><u>and</u></b> with gross inexcusable negligence”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> since these several modes of committing the crime are inconsistent with each other; the violation is more so when one considers the prosecution’s allegation of conspiracy, which presupposes intent and the absence of negligence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Because of this serious flaw in the information, the information effectively charged no offense for which they can be convicted.<br><br>Cesa particularly assails the validity of the information because the preliminary investigation which preceded its filing was allegedly fatally defective. Cesa argued that the Ombudsman cannot <i>motu proprio</i> require him to submit his counter-affidavit in the preliminary investigation without any prior complaint against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br><b><i>d. Evidence</i></b><br><br>The petitioners argue that the prosecution witnesses were incompetent to testify. On the one hand, Ariesga did not actually prepare the COA Report, but merely received it from the persons who did the actual audit and thereafter submitted it to the COA Regional Office. On the other hand, while Chan is the head of the audit team, she did not actually conduct the cash examination and audit of Badana’s accountabilities. In view of the incompetence of the prosecution witnesses, the Sandiganbayan should not have admitted, much less relied on, the COA Report as its contents are all hearsay.<br><br><b><i>e. Proof beyond reasonable doubt and the elements of <br>Section 3(e) of RA No. 3019 were not established.</i></b><br><br>Since the petitioners received no prior notice of disallowance from the auditors of the COA at the time material to the controversy, then the petitioners could not have been charged with knowledge of Badana’s previous unliquidated cash advances. This lack of knowledge negates the element of “giving unwarranted benefits or causing undue injury.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Particularly, Cesa argues that the existence of unliquidated cash advances was not established because there has been no complete cash examination, audit and post audit of Badana’s accountability, citing <i>Madarang v. Sandiganbayan</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Neither was “undue injury” established since, as previously argued, the COA Report is hearsay. Also, the fact that no government employee complained of not being paid his salary/receivables only shows that no party was ever unduly injured.<br><br><center><b><u>OSP’s COMMENT</u></b></center><br>The Office of the Special Prosecutor (<i>OSP</i>) prays for the denial of the petitions on the ground that the issues raised in the petitions are factual in nature and, hence, not covered by Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. The OSP defends the validity of the information, arguing that there is nothing inconsistent in the allegations because gross inexcusable negligence also connotes conscious indifference to duty, and not mere inadvertence. While conspiracy necessitates intent, conspiracy does not negate gross inexcusable negligence, as recognized in <i>Sistoza v. Desierto</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>On the merits, the OSP asserts that no amount of good faith can be appreciated for adhering to a practice if this practice is illegal. As a certified public accountant and a former state auditor himself, Cesa’s familiarity with the pertinent laws and regulations should have cautioned him against making a certification in Box A.<br><br>Delay in the payment of salaries cannot be used as an excuse to violate the law and pertinent COA regulations. Jaca’s repeated certification in Box B of the vouchers despite the lack of liquidation of prior cash advances establishes her gross inexcusable negligence in the performance of her duties.<br><br>Unlike in <i>Sistoza</i>, the vouchers Gaviola signed: (i) were on their face palpably irregular for lack of entries required by law - <i>i.e</i>., the net amount of payroll to be paid, the intended payees and the period covered by the payroll; and, (ii) lacked supporting documents. Gaviola failed to substantiate his claim that he signed the vouchers with supporting documents. None of the documents alleged to have supported the vouchers were presented. In contrast, Chan’s finding and unbiased testimony (that the vouchers were signed without supporting documents) enjoy the presumption of regularity.<br><br>The petitioners’ claim of good faith has no basis, considering that the procedure they adopted in approving the disbursement vouchers was made in violation of existing laws and COA circulars. Also, Ariesga and Chan are competent to testify on the COA Report as they were part of, and directly participated in, the audit process.<br><br><center><b><u>OUR RULING</u></b></center><br>We <b>deny</b> the petitions.<br><br>At the outset, we emphasize that, as a rule, the Court does not review factual questions under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. In appeals from the Sandiganbayan, only questions of law and not issues of fact may be raised. Issues raised before the Court on whether the prosecution’s evidence proved the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt, whether the presumption of innocence was properly accorded the accused, whether there was sufficient evidence to support a charge of conspiracy, or whether the defense of good faith was correctly appreciated are all, in varying degrees, questions of fact. As a rule, the factual findings of the Sandiganbayan are conclusive on this Court, subject to limited exceptions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> We find none of these exceptions in the present case.<br><br><b><i>The information is valid</i></b><br><br>Pursuant to the constitutional right of the accused to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> the Revised Rules of Court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> require, <i>inter alia</i>, that the information state the designation of the offense given by the statute and the acts or omissions imputed which constitute the offense charged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Additionally, it requires that these acts or omissions and their attendant circumstances “be stated in ordinary and concise language” and “in such form as is sufficient to enable a person of common understanding to know what offense is intended to be charged and enable the court to pronounce proper judgment.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> As long as the crime is described in intelligible terms and with such particularity and reasonable certainty that the accused is duly informed of the offense charged, then the information is considered sufficient. In particular, whether an information validly charges an offense depends on whether the material facts alleged in the complaint or information shall establish the essential elements of the offense charged as defined in the law. The <i>raison d’etre </i>of the requirement in the Rules is to enable the accused to suitably prepare his defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>Admittedly, the prosecution could have alleged in the information the mode of committing a violation of Section 3(e) of RA No. 3019 with technical precision by using the disjunctive term “or” instead of the conjunctive term “and.” Nonetheless, in the early case of <i>Gallego, et al. v. Sandiganbayan,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> the Court already clarified that the phrases “manifest partiality,” “evident bad faith” and “gross inexcusable negligence” are merely descriptive of the different modes by which the offense penalized in Section 3(e) of RA No. 3019 may be committed, and that the use of all these phrases in the same information does not mean that the indictment charges three distinct offenses.<br><br>Notably, a violation of Section 3(e) of R.A.

Thus, in construing these phrases, the Court observed that bad faith or partiality, on the one hand, and negligence, on the other hand, <i>per se</i> are not enough for one to be held criminally liable under the law; that the bad faith or partiality is evident or manifest, or, that the negligent act or omission is gross <i>and</i> inexcusable must be shown.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>Gross inexcusable negligence is negligence characterized by the want of even slight care; acting or omitting to act in a situation where there is a duty to act, not inadvertently but <b><i>willfully and intentionally</i></b>, with a conscious indifference to consequences in so far as other persons may be affected.

In requiring the negligence to be both gross <b><i>and</i></b> inexcusable, the law demands the neglect or disregard of duty to be willful and intentional in order for a violation to exist, although it may fall short of the required degree of bad faith, which must be evident, or of partiality, which must be manifest.<br><br>Contrary to the petitioners’ claims, gross inexcusable negligence, on one hand, and evident bad faith or manifest partiality, on the other hand, are not two highly opposite concepts that can result in a fatally defective information should the terms be conjoined in the information. The fact that the prosecution can properly allege these different modes alternatively in the information only means that the conviction may lie based simply on the evidence that is supportive of a particular mode.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> Significantly, aside from the petitioners’ polemics, they have not shown how their right to be<br><br>informed of the nature and cause of accusation against them has actually been violated; in fact, they advanced no claim that the wordings in the information prevented them from preparing their defense.<br><br>We likewise cannot support Cesa’s argument challenging the validity of the information for being a product of an invalid preliminary investigation. Suffice it to state that he had already advanced this argument in opposing the prosecution’s motion for the suspension of the petitioners<i> pendente lite.</i> The Sandiganbayan granted the prosecution’s motion and ordered the preventive suspension of the petitioners who questioned the Sandiganbayan’s action on <i>certiorari</i>.<br><br>In a February 28, 2001 Resolution, the Court dismissed the petition for <i>certiorari </i>for the petitioners’ failure to establish grave abuse of discretion on the part of the Sandiganbayan.

If at all, the case for the prosecution may rise or fall based on the credibility of her testimony in establishing the petitioners’ acts or omissions amounting to a violation of RA No. 3019. The Sandiganbayan found her testimony credible and we find no reason to disagree with its finding.<br><br>Most importantly, the COA’s findings are accorded great weight and respect, unless they are clearly shown to be tainted with grave abuse of discretion; the COA is the agency specifically given the power, authority and duty to examine, audit and settle all accounts pertaining to the revenue and receipts of, and expenditures or uses of fund and property owned by or pertaining to, the government. It has the exclusive authority to define the scope of its audit and examination, and to establish the required techniques and methods. An audit is conducted to determine whether the amounts allotted for certain expenditures were spent wisely, in keeping with official guidelines and regulations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> Under the Rules on Evidence and considering the COA’s expertise on the matter, the presumption is that official duty has been regularly performed unless there is evidence to the contrary. The petitioners failed in this regard.<br><br><b><i>Elements of RA No. 3019 and the <br>prosecution’s evidence</i></b><br><br>Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 has “three elements: (1) the accused is a public officer discharging administrative, judicial, or official functions; (2) [he or she] must have acted with manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or [gross and] inexcusable negligence; and (3) [his or her] action caused any undue injury to any party, including the government, or [gave] any private party unwarranted benefits, advantage, or preference in the discharge of his or her functions.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>The first element is not disputed.

Sandiganbayan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> Cesa argues that the prosecution has not established the fact of Badana’s unliquidated cash advances because Ariesga himself testified that the cash examination and audit of Badana’s accountability has not been completed even at the time of the prosecution of the case in the Sandiganbayan. Similarly, Gaviola adds that no government employee has in fact complained of not being paid his or her salary. In effect, the petitioners argue that the third element of violation of Section 3(e) of RA No. 3019 is wanting.<br><br>The petitioners cannot rely on <i>Madarang</i>, which merely cited the case of <i>Dumagat v. Sandiganbayan,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> to escape liability. <i>Dumagat </i>is a case for malversation of funds where the evidence of shortage, appropriation, conversion or loss of public funds was necessary, among other elements, for conviction. In acquitting the accused, the Court pointed out that “the audit examination left much to be desired in terms of thoroughness and completeness as there were <i>accounts which were not considered</i>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> The audit examination was done not in the official station of the accused. The accused’s other vaults that were located in other places and the “records, receipts, and cash contained therein were <i>not made part of the audit report.</i>”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> Lastly, the prosecution itself admitted where the accused deposited her collections from particular areas.<br><br>In <i>Tinga v. People,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> again a case involving malversation of public funds, the Court ruled that the prosecution failed to establish beyond reasonable doubt that there were actually missing funds chargeable to the accused . The <i>Sandiganbayan itself found the many errors committed by the COA in its audit</i>, by including sums which were supposed to be excluded. The Court expressly observed the “incomplete and haphazard” manner by which the audit was conducted.<br><br>Unlike <i>Dumagat</i> and <i>Tinga,</i> however, the various irregularities found by the COA itself, and affirmed by the Sandiganbayan, were the very ones which actually contributed to the audit team’s difficulty in completing the audit. Significantly, nowhere does it appear that the incompleteness of the audit pertains to its scope or that the audit team conducted the audit in a haphazard manner. The fact that the person (Badana), who could actually shed light on the shortage the COA found, is nowhere to be found cannot be taken against the prosecution. The undisputed accumulation of funds in Badana’s hands, considering the amount given; the fact that the disbursement vouchers do not exactly represent the amount of payroll to be paid; and the COA’s findings that there was a shortage merely reflect the <i>consequences</i> of the petitioners’ acts or omissions and facilitated the commission of possible malversation by Badana.

It is from the viewpoint of Cesa’s duties as a City Treasurer that Cesa’s good faith should be measured, not simply from the fact that he acted because a subordinate from his office is the one asking for a cash advance. By certifying that the cash advances were “necessary and <b><u>lawful</u></b> and incurred under his direct supervision,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> Cesa cannot escape the obligation to determine whether Badana complied with Section 89 of PD No. 1445, although the same requirement would have to be ultimately determined by the City Accountant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> Section 89 of PD No. 1445 reads:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 89.

He cannot rely on good faith based on the act of a subordinate where the documents that would support the subordinate’s action (Bacasmas countersignature) were not even in his (Cesa’s) possession for examination.<br><br>Similarly, even ordinary diligence in the performance of his duties as City Treasurer should have prompted Cesa to determine if the cash advance requested is “necessary” not only as to its purpose but also as to its amount to ensure that local funds are properly spent up to the last centavo.<br><br><b>a2. <span style="font-style: italic;">The decision in the administrative case against </span><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Cesa is not controlling in the criminal case</span></b><br><br>Cesa argues that since the Ombudsman found him administratively liable for <i>simple</i> neglect of duty only, then the Sandiganbayan gravely erred in convicting him under Section 3(e) of RA No. 3019 for gross inexcusable negligence.<br><br>We disagree with this argument.<br><br>That an administrative case is independent from the criminal action, although both arose from the same act or omission, is elementary. Given the differences in the quantum of evidence required, the procedure observed, the sanctions imposed, as well as in the objective of the two proceedings, the findings and conclusions in one should not necessarily be binding on the other. Thus, as a rule, exoneration in the administrative case is not a bar to a criminal prosecution for the same or similar acts which were the subject of the administrative complaint or <i>vice versa</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br><br>In the present case, we stress that the Ombudsman made an express finding that Cesa failed to exercise the diligence of a good father of a family in safeguarding the funds of the city government. Thus, Cesa (together with Bacasmas and Jaca) was found administratively liable by the Ombudsman for neglect of duty. If the exoneration from an administrative charge does not in itself bar criminal prosecution, then with more reason should the principle apply where the respondent was found to have committed an administrative infraction.<br><br>The Court is not unaware of the rule that if there was a categorical finding in the administrative case that expressly rules out one (or more) of the essential elements of the crime for which the respondent is likewise sought to be held liable, then his exoneration in the administrative case can be pleaded for his acquittal in the criminal case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> This rule, however, obviously finds no application in the present case. The CA and, subsequently, this Court merely affirmed the <i>administrative </i>finding of the Ombudsman that Cesa and his co-petitioners are guilty of neglect of duty.&nbsp; Nowhere did the uniform rulings in the administrative case even hint that the administrative finding bars or forecloses a further determination of the gravity of the petitioners’ negligence as was the prosecution’s theory for purposes of criminal prosecution.<br><br><b>b1. <i>Jaca’s defense of good faith</i>&nbsp; </b><br><br>According to Jaca, he affixed his signature on Box B of the disbursement vouchers, as a ministerial duty, in order to avoid delay in the payment of the Cebu City government employees’ salaries. Jaca practically admitted having done so even if she knew that Badana’s previous cash advances had not yet been liquidated, and, that she did not bother to inform the COA that the accounting tools (index card and subsidiary ledger) did not accurately monitor cash advances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> The Sandiganbayan tried to elicit a plausible form of the defense of good faith from Jaca but her answer could not be more categorical.<br><br><blockquote>CHAIRMAN<br><br>No, no.

JACA<br><br>There is a pro-forma voucher, your Honor, and we find it did not occur to us at that time that we may… we will add anything in that box.<br><br>CHAIRMAN<br><br>So, in other words, you agree to the question of the prosecutor that you have no choice even though you are aware that what you are doing is wrong, you have to blindly sign the box provided for in that document?<br><br>E.

The Sandiganbayan correctly observed that as the City Accountant, foremost of her duties is to ensure that the local funds out of which the salaries of local government employees would be paid are properly accounted for.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> As Cesa implicitly argued, the creation of the Office of the City Accountant<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> serves an important function of pre-audit in the chain of processing cash advances of individual paymasters.<br><br>A pre-audit is an examination of financial transactions <b>before</b> their consumption or payment; a pre-audit seeks to determine, among others, that the claim is duly supported by authentic underlying pieces of evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> If the setup then prevailing in the Cebu City government directly conflicts with the COA regulations, Jaca should have, at the very least, informed the City Mayor of the risk in the process of disbursement of local funds or at least she should have set up an internal audit system - as was her duty – to check against possible malversation of funds by the paymaster.<br><br>That no one claimed that his/her salaries has not been paid is beside the point. In the present case, aside from Jaca’s admission that she knowingly affixed her signature in Box B of the disbursement voucher contrary to what it certifies,<i> i.e.</i>, all previous cash advances had been liquidated and accounted for, the amount requested was consistently way above the total amount covered by the supporting payrolls, thereby allowing Badana to have accumulated excess funds in her hands.<br><br><b><i>c1. Gaviola’s defense of good faith</i></b><br><br>In his defense, Gaviola invokes our ruling in <i>Arias v.

It is doubtful if any auditor for a fairly sized office could <i>personally</i> do all these things in all vouchers presented for his signature. The Court would be asking for the impossible. All heads of offices have to rely to a reasonable extent on their subordinates and on the good faith of those who prepare bids, purchase supplies, or enter into negotiations. xxx <b>There has to be some added reason why he should examine each voucher in such detail.</b> Any executive head of even <i>small</i> government agencies or commissions can attest to the volume of papers that must be signed. There are hundreds of documents, letters, memoranda, vouchers, and supporting papers that routinely pass through his hands. The number in bigger offices or departments is even more appalling.<br><br>There should be <b>other grounds than the mere signature or approval </b>appearing on a voucher to sustain a conspiracy charge and conviction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> (italics supplied; emphases ours)</blockquote><br>The Court has since applied the <i>Arias</i> ruling to determine not only criminal,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> civil<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> and administrative<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> liability, but even the existence of probable cause to file an information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> in the context of an allegation of conspiracy.<br><br>In <i>Siztoza v. Desierto</i>, involving the Ombudsman’s determination of probable cause for violation of RA No. 3019, the Court expounded on the reach of <i>Arias</i>, thus:<br><br><blockquote>The fact that [Sistoza] had knowledge of the status of [the contractor] as being only the second lowest bidder does not <i>ipso facto</i> characterize [his] act of reliance as recklessly imprudent xxx. Albeit misplaced, reliance in good faith by a head of office on a subordinate upon whom the primary responsibility rests negates an imputation of conspiracy by gross inexcusable negligence to commit graft and corruption. As things stand, [Sistoza] is presumed to have acted honestly and sincerely when he depended upon responsible assurances that everything was aboveboard since it is not always the case that second best bidders in terms of price are automatically disqualified from the award considering that the PBAC reserves the authority to select the best bid not only in terms of the price offered but other factors as well. x x x<br><br>Verily, <b>even if petitioner erred in his assessment of the extrinsic and intrinsic validity of the documents presented to him for endorsement, his act is all the same imbued with good faith because the otherwise faulty reliance upon his subordinates</b>, who were primarily in charge of the task, falls <b>within parameters of tolerable judgment and permissible margins of error</b>.

Sandiganbayan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> where the Court sustained the petitioner’s conviction for violation of Section 3(e) of RA No. 3019, it observed that the fact that “the checks issued as payment for construction materials purchased by the municipality were not made payable to the supplier x x x but to petitioner himself even as the disbursement vouchers attached thereto were in the name of [the supplier]” constitute an “added reason” for the petitioner to further examine the documents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup><br><br><b><i>c2.2 The Arias ruling and the present case</i></b><br><br>The <i>Arias</i> ruling squarely applies where, in the performance of his official duties, the head of an office is being held to answer for his act of relying on the acts of his subordinate. In its Memorandum,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> the prosecution submitted that the petitioners were the heads of the three “independent” offices at the time material to the controversy, <i>i.e.</i>, the Office of the City Treasurer, the Office of the City Accountant and the Office of the City Administrator. On this point alone, Gaviola’s reliance on <i>Arias </i>already stands on shaky grounds.<br><br>However, the Court observes that the key functions of the City Administrator do not relate either to the management of or accounting of funds of the local government or to internal audit. His concern is the overall administration and management of the affairs of the local government as a whole. Given the prior certifications of the two other offices; the internal check employed by Gaviola before affixing his signature; and the intervening process before the voucher actually reaches the City Administrator, the Court cannot consider the deficiency in the “particulars of payment” <i>alone</i> to charge Gaviola with knowledge that something was amiss and that his failure to do so would amount to gross and inexcusable negligence. Unlike the signatures on the disbursement vouchers of the City Treasurer and of the City Accountant, the City Administrator signs Box C ultimately as an “approving officer” without any direct involvement in the management and audit of local government funds before and after the disbursement. It would seem, therefore, that Gaviola’s own reliance on the signatures of the heads of the two other offices is not entirely misplaced.<br><br>The signatures of the other petitioners, however, are only part of the picture. Gaviola’s reliance on these alone does not establish good faith if the bare signatures on the voucher and the written request from the paymaster are all that he has with him when he affixed his signature on Box C.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup>&nbsp; Amidst conflicting assertions, the Sandiganbayan gave credence to the prosecution’s evidence that the disbursement vouchers did not have the required supporting documents when Gaviola affixed his signature. While the vouchers themselves indicate that it had gone through the Internal Control Office, allegedly for a determination of the completeness of the supporting documents before Peña finally turned it over to Gaviola, the Sandiganbayan gave emphasis on Gaviola’s failure to present evidence that he indeed requested the submission of the supposed attachments from the COA and put a premium on Chan’s testimony.<br><br>We find no reason to reverse the Sandiganbayan. Additionally, we observe that while payment of salaries of employees of the Cebu City government is either on a <i>quincena</i> or weekly basis, still there are only two payrolls prepared, corresponding to the first and second halves of the month. The payroll for the first <i>quincena</i> is prepared on the first week of the month, in time for the weekly-paid employees to receive their first week salary. For purpose of payment for the next pay periods - the payment of the 2<sup>nd</sup> week salary and the 1<sup>st</sup> quincena - the payroll (together with its supporting documents) stays with the paymaster/disbursing officer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> This arrangement only means that if Badana would make a cash advance for the 1<sup>st</sup> week or 3<sup>rd</sup> week, the disbursement vouchers could not actually be supported by complete documents since the same stay with the paymaster herself.<br><br>As described by the prosecution, the offices involved in the processing of cash advances are technically independent of each other; one office does not form part of, or is strictly under, another. Thus, each has independent functions to perform to ensure that the funds of the local government are disbursed properly and are well accounted for. While the Court views Gaviola’s failure to inquire further before affixing his signature despite the absence of the “particulars of payment” in the disbursement vouchers as negligence on his part,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup> to additionally affix his signature despite the lack of supporting documents only shows a gross and inexcusable disregard of the consequences of his act as approving authority. If Gaviola bothered to glance at the supporting documents, he could have signaled to his co-accused that their acts or omissions opened an opportunity for Badana to commit malversation that would result in a loss to the local government’s coffers.<br><br><b><i>Conspiracy and conviction</i></b><br><br>In <i>Sistoza</i>, the Court already intimated on the possibility of committing a violation of Section 3(e) of RA No. 3019 through gross and inexcusable negligence, and of incurring collective criminal responsibility through a conspiracy.<br><br><blockquote>x x x As we have consistently held, evidence of guilt must be premised upon a more knowing, personal and deliberate participation of each individual who is charged with others as part of a conspiracy.<br><br>Furthermore, even if the conspiracy were one of silence and inaction arising from gross inexcusable negligence, it is nonetheless essential to prove that the breach of duty borders on malice and is characterized by flagrant, palpable and willful indifference to consequences insofar as other persons may be affected.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup></blockquote><br>As earlier discussed, considering that the gravity of negligence required by law for a violation of Section 3(e) of RA No. 3019 to exist falls short of the degree of bad faith or partiality to violate the same provision, a conspiracy of silence and inaction arising from gross inexcusable negligence would almost always be inferred only from the surrounding circumstances and the parties' acts or omissions that, taken together, indicate a common understanding and concurrence of sentiments respecting the commission of the offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup>&nbsp; The duties and responsibilities that the occupancy of a public office carry and the degree of relationship of interdependence of the different offices involved here determine the existence of conspiracy where gross inexcusable negligence was the mode or commission of the offense.<br><br>For emphasis, the petitioners are all heads or their respective offices that perform interdependent functions in the processing of cash advances.&nbsp; The petitioners' attitude of buck-passing in the face of the irregularities in the voucher (and the absence of supporting documents), as established by the prosecution, and their indifference to their individual and collective duties to ensure that laws and regulations are observed in the disbursement of the funds of the local government of Cebu can only lead to a finding of conspiracy of silence and inaction, contemplated in <i>Sistoza</i>.&nbsp; The Sandiganbayan correctly observed that—<br><br>Finally, it bears stressing that the separate acts or omissions of all the accused in the present case contributed in the end result of defrauding the government.
