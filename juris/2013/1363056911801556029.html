Alvarez, requested<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> that a laboratory examination on the three (3) plastic sachets be conducted, which were accordingly marked as follows:<br><br><blockquote>(a) EXH-AMTVECCNSP 18/06/05 and signatures-98.81 grams<br>(b) EXH-B MTV ECC NSP 18/06/05 and signatures - 96.65 grams<br>(c) EXH-C MTV ECC NSP 18/06/05 and signatures - 1.17 grams<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></blockquote><br>The following day, or on June 19, 2005, upon qualitative examination by forensic chemist Police Senior Inspector Stella Garciano Ebuen (Police Senior Inspector Ebuen) on the confiscated sachets, which contained a total of 196.63<b><u></u></b> grams of white crystalline substance, the same tested positive for methylamphetamine hydrochloride, a dangerous drug.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Consequently, appellant was charged with violation of Sec. 5, Art. II of RA 9165 in an Information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> which reads:<br><br><blockquote>That on or about the 18<sup>th</sup> day of June 2005, in Pasay City, Metro-Manila, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this I Ionorable Court, the above-named accused, being a departing passenger via Cebu Pacific Airlines flight no. 5J-965 239 bound for Davao, without authority of law, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously transport 196.63 grams of Methylamphetamine hydrochloride (<i>SHABU</i>), a dangerous drugs, by concealing it inside his worn colored white rubber shoes with marking "SPICER."<br><br>Contrary to law.<br></blockquote><br>When arraigned on June 27, 2005 with the assistance of counsel, appellant entered a plea of <i>not guilty</i> to the offense charged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>In defense, appellant claimed that on the date and time in question, he was at the Manila Domestic Airport<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> for his flight to Davao City. After passing through the metal detector and while walking towards the ticketing counter to check-in, a police officer, whom he later identified as SPO2 Peji,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> called his attention and asked him to stay for a while<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> because something was allegedly recovered from him. At the same time, appellant noticed that someone had been arrested, and he heard SPO2 Peji tell that person to settle the case so that they could just "pass" the "thing" to appellant, which turned out to be <i>shabu</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Thereafter, SPO2 Peji and Villocillo brought appellant to an office<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> where SPO2 Peji forced him to admit ownership of the <i>shabu</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> When appellant refused, SPO2 Peji suggested the settlement of the case for P100,000.00, an amount which appellant could not afford. Later, he was brought to a PDEA office where PDEA agents took his statement and once again asked him to admit ownership of the confiscated <i>shabu</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Appellant averred that SPO2 Peji confiscated his wallet which contained P1,600.00 in cash, as well as P2,000.00 found in the pocket of his pants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>&nbsp; Finally, appellant denied wearing the white rubber shoes with the label "Spicer" at the time he was arrested.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br><center><b>Ruling of the RTC</b></center><br>On August 29, 2006, after trial on the merits, the RTC convicted<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> appellant as charged upon a finding that all the elements for transportation of drugs, <i>i.e</i>., actual physical possession and control of the prohibited drugs, coupled with the presentation of the <i>corpus delicti</i> in court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> have been established by the prosecution. It found the testimonies of prosecution witnesses Villocillo and SPO2 Peji to be candid, forthright and reliable. Moreover, as law enforcers, they were presumed to have regularly performed their official duties.<br><br>On the other hand, the RTC refused to give credence to appellant's bare and unsubstantiated denials, as well as his claim that he was merely framed-up, and his insistence that the police officers were extorting money from him. The <i>fallo</i> of the judgment of conviction reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, on the evidence adduced and the facts and conclusions drawn therefrom, the accused CAMALODING LABA <span style="font-style: italic;">y</span> SAMANODING is hereby found Guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the offense charged in the Information and is sentenced to suffer the penalty of LIFE IMPRISONMENT and PAY A FINE OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PESOS (Php500,000.00) WITHOUT SUBSIDIARY IMPRISONMENT IN CASE OF INSOLVENCY, AND COSTS.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></blockquote><br><center><b>Ruling of the CA</b><br></center><br>On appeal, the CA affirmed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> the RTC Decision <i>in toto</i>, holding that the identity of the seized substance had been adequately proved and that the chain of custody was properly established, from the time that it was recovered from the person of the appellant, tested at the laboratory for a qualitative examination, and its actual presentation in court. While the CA conceded that the arresting officers were unable to strictly comply with the requirements set forth under Sec. 21, Par. (1) of RA 9165 by failing to photograph the seized items, it nonetheless found that the evidentiary value of the confiscated substance had been preserved. It also did not find the non-presentation' of the forensic chemist as fatal to the cause of the prosecution.<br><br><center><b><u>Issue Before The Court</u></b><br></center><br>The core issue to be resolved by the Court is whether the CA and the RTC committed any reversible error in convicting appellant as charged.<br><br><center><b><u>The Court's Ruling</u></b></center><br>Appellant was convicted of violation of Sec. 5, Art. II of RA 9165, which reads:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 5. Sale, <i>Trading, Administration, Dispensation, Delivery, Distribution and <b>Transportation</b> of Dangerous Drugs and/or Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals</i>. — The penalty of life imprisonment to death and a fine ranging from Five hundred thousand pesos (P500,000.00) to Ten million pesos (P10,000,000.00) shall be imposed upon any person, who, unless authorized by law, shall sell, trade, administer, dispense, deliver, give away to another, distribute, dispatch in transit or <b>transport</b> any dangerous drug, including any and all species of opium poppy regardless of the quantity and purity involved, or shall act as a broker in any such transactions. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>In adjudging appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the said offense, the RTC, as affirmed by the CA, considered the fact that he was caught in <i>flagrante delicto </i>in possession of an extremely large amount of prohibited drugs inside the airport, before boarding his flight bound for Davao City. The RTC explained<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> that Sec. 5, Art. II of RA 9165 penalizes the act of <i><b>transporting</b> shabu</i>, under which provision appellant must clearly be convicted.<br><br>The Court sustains appellant's conviction.<br><br>"Transport" as used under the Dangerous Drugs Act is defined to mean "to carry or convey from one place to another." The essential element of the charge is the movement of the dangerous drug from one place to another.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>In this case, appellant was apprehended inside the airport, as he was intending to board his flight bound for Davao City with a substantial amount or <b>196.63</b> grams of methylamphetamine hydrochloride or <i>shabu</i> in his possession, concealed in separate plastic bags inside his oversized Spicer rubber shoes. While it may be argued that appellant was yet to board the aircraft or travel some distance with the illegal drugs in his possession, it cannot be denied that his presence at the airport at that particular instance was for the purpose of <i>transporting </i>or <i>moving</i> the dangerous drugs from one place to another.<br><br>Moreover, it may be reasonably inferred from the deliberations of the Congress that if a person is found to have more than five (5) grams of <i>shabu</i> in his possession, then his purpose in carrying them is to dispose, traffic, or sell it, as follows:<br><br><blockquote>REPRESENTATIVE AQUINO (B.). We agree with the premises, Mr. Speaker. But just for the sake of our education, in terms of volume, somebody informed this Representation that one gram of shabu would probably be the same size as a single kernel of corn. Would that be correct?<br><br>REPRESENTATIVE CUENCO.- The technical committee that has been assisting us in carpentering this bill tells us that a habitual user of, let's say, shabu, one of the dangerous substances provided for here, a habitual user of shabu, even if we say daily taker of shabu consumes only 1/5 of a gram, .02 grams a day. So that means, if he has with him one gram of shabu, that is good for five days; if he has five grams, that is good for 25 days. Now if he is a user, he won't need more than five grams to carry with him or her. <u>So the presumption of the law is that, if he carries with him or her more than five grams, that is not for his personal consumption. He is out to traffic the rest of it</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>&nbsp; (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>With respect to the chain of custody of the confiscated drugs, the Court likewise finds no reason to disturb the findings of the CA that the same had been faithfully observed by the arresting officers: from the time that the illegal substance was seized from appellant and properly marked by the arresting officers, to its laboratory examination until its presentation in open court for identification purposes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>&nbsp; Considering that the integrity of the seized substance, has been duly preserved, failure to strictly comply with Sec. 21, Par.&nbsp; (a)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> of RA 9165 requiring the apprehending officers to physically inventory and photograph the confiscated items shall not render the evidence inadmissible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Neither will the non-presentation in court of Police Senior Inspector Ebuen, the forensic chemist who conducted the laboratory examination on the confiscated substance, operate to acquit appellant. The matter of presentation of witnesses by the prosecution is not for the court to decide. It has the discretion as to how to present its case and it has the right to choose whom it wishes to present as witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Besides, <i>corpus delicti</i> has nothing to do with the testimony of the chemical analyst, and the report of an official forensic chemist regarding a recovered prohibited drug enjoys the presumption of regularity in its preparation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>&nbsp; Corollarily, under Sec. 44 of Rule 130, Revised Rules of Court, entries in official records made in the performance of official duty are <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the facts they state.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court <b>AFFIRMS</b> the April 7, 2011 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
