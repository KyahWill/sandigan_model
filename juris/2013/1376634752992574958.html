SP No. 01154) and granting respondent’s petition for certiorari (CA-G.R.

Yrastorza, Sr. issued an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> dated March 31, 2004 granting support <span style="font-style: italic;">pendente lite</span>, as follows:<br><blockquote>From the evidence already adduced by the parties, the amount of Two Hundred Fifty (P250,000.00) Thousand Pesos would be sufficient to take care of the needs of the plaintiff.&nbsp; This amount <span style="font-style: italic;">excludes the One hundred thirty-five (P135,000.00) Thousand Pesos for medical attendance expenses</span> needed by plaintiff for the operation of both her eye[s] which is demandable upon the conduct of such operation.&nbsp; The amounts already extended to the two (2) children, being a commendable act of defendant, should be continued by him considering the vast financial resources at his disposal.<br><br>According to Art. 203 of the Family Code, support is demandable from the time plaintiff needed the said support but is payable only from the date of judicial demand.&nbsp; Since the instant complaint was filed on 03 September 2003, the amount of Two Hundred Fifty (P250,000.00) Thousand should be paid by defendant to plaintiff retroactively to such date until the hearing of the support <span style="font-style: italic;">pendente lite</span>.&nbsp; P250,000.00&nbsp; x 7 corresponding to the seven (7) months that lapsed from September, 2003 to March 2004 would tantamount to a total of One Million Seven Hundred Fifty (P1,750,000.00) Thousand Pesos.&nbsp; Thereafter, starting the month of April 2004, until otherwise ordered by this Court, defendant is ordered to pay a monthly support of T<span style="font-style: italic;">wo Hundred Fifty Thousand (P250,000.00) Pesos payable within the first five (5) days of each corresponding month</span> pursuant to the third paragraph of Art. 203 of the Family Code of the Philippines.&nbsp; The monthly support of P250,000.00 is without prejudice to any increase or decrease thereof that this Court may grant plaintiff as the circumstances may warrant i.e. depending on the proof submitted by the parties during the proceedings for the main action for support. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></blockquote>Respondent filed a motion for reconsideration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> asserting that petitioner is not entitled to spousal support considering that she does not maintain for herself a separate dwelling from their children and respondent has continued to support the family for their sustenance and well-being in accordance with family’s social and financial standing. As to the P250,000.00 granted by the trial court as monthly support <span style="font-style: italic;">pendente lite</span>, as well as the P1,750,000.00 retroactive support, respondent found it unconscionable and beyond the intendment of the law for not having considered the needs of the respondent.<br><br>In its May 13, 2004 Order, the trial court stated that the March 31, 2004 Order had become final and executory since respondent’s motion for reconsideration is treated as a mere scrap of paper for violation of the three-day notice period under Section 4, Rule 15 of the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">1997 Rules of Civil Procedure</span>, as amended, and therefore did not interrupt the running of the period to appeal. Respondent was given ten (10) days to show cause why he should not be held in contempt of the court for disregarding the March 31, 2004 order granting support <span style="font-style: italic;">pendente lite</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>His second motion for reconsideration having been denied, respondent filed a petition for certiorari in the CA.<br><br>On April 12, 2005, the CA rendered its Decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> finding merit in respondent’s contention that the trial court gravely abused its discretion in granting P250,000.00 monthly support to petitioner without evidence to prove his actual income.&nbsp; The said court thus decreed:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, foregoing premises considered, this petition is given due course.&nbsp; The assailed Orders dated March 31, 2004, May 13, 2004, June 4, 2004 and June 18, 2004 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 14, Cebu City issued in Civil Case No. CEB No. 29346 entitled “Susan Lim Lua versus Danilo Y.

SP No. 84740 was not contumacious as it was anchored on valid and justifiable reasons. Respondent said he just wanted the issue of whether to deduct his advances be settled first in view of the different interpretation by the trial court of the appellate court’s decision in CA- G.R. SP No. 84740.&nbsp; It also noted the lack of contribution from the petitioner in the joint obligation of spouses to support their children.<br><br>Petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration but it was denied by the CA.<br><br>Hence, this petition raising the following errors allegedly committed by the CA:<br><blockquote><center>I</center>.<br>THE HONORABLE COURT ERRED IN NOT FINDING RESPONDENT GUILTY OF INDIRECT CONTEMPT.<br><br><center>II</center>.<br>THE HONORABLE COURT ERRED IN ORDERING THE DEDUCTION OF THE AMOUNT OF PHP2,482,348.16 PLUS 946,465.64, OR A TOTAL OF PHP3,428,813.80 FROM THE CURRENT TOTAL SUPPORT IN ARREARS OF THE RESPONDENT TO THE PETITIONER AND THEIR CHILDREN.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></blockquote>The main issue is whether certain expenses already incurred by the respondent may be deducted from the total support in arrears owing to petitioner and her children pursuant to the Decision dated April 12, 2005 in CA-G.R. SP No. 84740.<br><br>The pertinent provision of the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Family Code of the Philippines</span> provides:<br><blockquote>Article 194. Support comprises everything <span style="font-weight: bold;">indispensable</span> for sustenance, dwelling, clothing, medical attendance, education and transportation, in keeping with the financial capacity of the family.<br><br>The education of the person entitled to be supported referred to in the preceding paragraph shall include his schooling or training for some profession, trade or vocation, even beyond the age of majority. Transportation shall include expenses in going to and from school, or to and from place of work. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>Petitioner argues that it was patently erroneous for the CA to have allowed the deduction of the value of the two cars and their maintenance costs from the support in arrears, as these items are not indispensable to the sustenance of the family or in keeping them alive.&nbsp; She points out that in the Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 84740, the CA already considered the said items which it deemed chargeable to respondent, while the monthly support <span style="font-style: italic;">pendente lite</span>&nbsp; (P115,000.00) was fixed on the basis of the documentary evidence of respondent’s alleged income from various businesses and petitioner’s testimony that she needed P113,000.00 for the maintenance of the household and other miscellaneous expenses <span style="font-style: italic;">excluding</span> the P135,000.00 medical attendance expenses of petitioner.<br><br>Respondent, on the other hand, contends that disallowing the subject deductions would result in unjust enrichment, thus making him pay for the same obligation twice.&nbsp; Since petitioner and the children resided in one residence, the groceries and dry goods purchased by the children using respondent’s credit card, totalling P594,151.58 for the period September 2003 to June 2005 were not consumed by the children alone but shared with their mother. As to the Volkswagen Beetle and BMW 316i respondent bought for his daughter Angelli Suzanne Lua and Daniel Ryan Lua, respectively, these, too, are to be considered advances for support, in keeping with the financial capacity of the family.&nbsp; Respondent stressed that being children of parents belonging to the upper-class society, Angelli and Daniel Ryan had never in their entire life commuted from one place to another, nor do they eat their meals at “carinderias”.&nbsp; Hence, the cars and their maintenance are indispensable to the children’s day-to-day living, the value of which were properly deducted from the arrearages in support <span style="font-style: italic;">pendente lite</span> ordered by the trial and appellate courts.<br><br>As a matter of law, the amount of support which those related by marriage and family relationship is generally obliged to give each other shall be in proportion to the resources or means of the giver and to the needs of the recipient.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>&nbsp; Such support comprises everything indispensable for sustenance, dwelling, clothing, medical attendance, education and transportation, in keeping with the financial capacity of the family.<br><br>Upon receipt of a verified petition for declaration of absolute nullity of void marriage or for annulment of voidable marriage, or for legal separation, and at any time during the proceeding, the court, <span style="font-style: italic;">motu proprio </span>or upon verified application of any of the parties, guardian or designated custodian, may temporarily grant support <span style="font-style: italic;">pendente lite</span> prior to the rendition of judgment or final order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>&nbsp; Because of its provisional nature, a court does not need to delve fully into the merits of the case before it can settle an application for this relief. All that a court is tasked to do is determine the kind and amount of evidence which may suffice to enable it to justly resolve the application. It is enough that the facts be established by affidavits or other documentary evidence appearing in the record.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>In this case, the amount of monthly support <span style="font-style: italic;">pendente lite</span> for petitioner and her two children was determined after due hearing and submission of documentary evidence by the parties.&nbsp; Although the amount fixed by the trial court was reduced on appeal, it is clear that the monthly support <span style="font-style: italic;">pendente lite</span> of P115,000.00 ordered by the CA was intended primarily for the sustenance of petitioner and her children, e.g., food, clothing,&nbsp; salaries of drivers and house helpers, and other household expenses.&nbsp; Petitioner’s testimony also mentioned the cost of regular therapy for her scoliosis and vitamins/medicines.<br><blockquote><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr> <td width="42"></td> <td width="930"></td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">ATTY.

(2) the time necessary to acquire sufficient education and training to enable the spouse seeking support to find appropriate employment, and that spouse’s future earning capacity; (3) the duration of the marriage; (4) the comparative financial resources of the spouses, including their comparative earning abilities in the labor market; (5) the needs and obligations of each spouse; (6) the contribution of each spouse to the marriage, including services rendered in home-making, child care, education, and career building of the other spouse;

Futrell</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> appellant sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court which found him in arrears with his child support payments and entered a decree in favor of appellee wife.&nbsp; He complained that in determining the arrearage figure, he should have been allowed full credit for all money and items of personal property given by him to the children themselves, even though he referred to them as gifts.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals of Maryland ruled that in the suit to determine amount of arrears due the divorced wife under decree for support of minor children, the husband (appellant) was not entitled to credit for checks which he had clearly designated as gifts, nor was he entitled to credit for an automobile given to the oldest son or a television set given to the children. Thus, if the children remain in the custody of the mother, the father is not entitled to credit for money paid directly to the children if such was paid without any relation to the decree.<br><blockquote>In the absence of some finding of consent by the mother, most courts refuse to allow a husband to dictate how he will meet the requirements for support payments when the mode of payment is fixed by a decree of court.&nbsp; Thus he will not be credited for payments made when he unnecessarily interposed himself as a volunteer and made payments direct to the children of his own accord. <span style="font-style: italic;">Wills v. Baker, 214 S. W. 2d 748 (Mo. 1948); Openshaw v. Openshaw, 42 P. 2d 191 (Utah 1935). </span>In the latter case the court said in part: “The payments to the children themselves do not appear to have been made as payments upon alimony, but were rather the result of his fatherly interest in the welfare of those children.&nbsp; We do not believe he should be permitted to charge them to plaintiff.&nbsp; By so doing he would be determining for Mrs. Openshaw the manner in which she should expend her allowances. It is a very easy thing for children to say their mother will not give them money, especially as they may realize that such a plea is effective in attaining their ends. If she is not treating them right the courts are open to the father for redress.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></blockquote>In <span style="font-style: italic;">Martin, Jr. v. Martin</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> the Supreme Court of Washington held that a father, who is required by a divorce decree to make child support payments directly to the mother, cannot claim credit for payments voluntarily made directly to the children.&nbsp; However, special considerations of an equitable nature may justify a court in crediting such payments on his indebtedness to the mother, when such can be done without injustice to her.<br><blockquote>The general rule is to the effect that when a father is required by a divorce decree to pay to the mother money for the support of their dependent children and the unpaid and accrued installments become judgments in her favor, he cannot, as a matter of law, claim credit on account of payments voluntarily made directly to the children.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Koon v.

The courts are justifiably reluctant to lay down any general rules as to when such credits may be allowed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>Here, the CA should not have allowed <span style="font-style: italic;">all </span>the expenses incurred by respondent to be credited against the accrued support <span style="font-style: italic;">pendente lite</span>.&nbsp; As earlier mentioned, the monthly support <span style="font-style: italic;">pendente lite</span> granted by the trial court was intended primarily for food, household expenses such as salaries of drivers and house helpers, and also petitioner’s scoliosis therapy sessions.&nbsp; Hence, the value of two expensive cars bought by respondent for his children plus their maintenance cost, travel expenses of petitioner and Angelli, purchases through credit card of items other than groceries and dry goods (clothing) should have been disallowed, as these bear no relation to the judgment awarding support <span style="font-style: italic;">pendente lite</span>.&nbsp; While it is true that the dispositive portion of the executory decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 84740 ordered herein respondent to pay the support in arrears “less than the amount supposedly given by petitioner to the private respondent as her and their two (2) children monthly support,” the deductions should be limited to those basic needs and expenses considered by the trial and appellate courts. The assailed ruling of the CA allowing huge deductions from the accrued monthly support of petitioner and her children, while correct insofar as it commends the generosity of the respondent to his children, is clearly inconsistent with the executory decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 84740.&nbsp; More important, it completely ignores the unfair consequences to petitioner whose sustenance and well-being, was given due regard by the trial and appellate courts.&nbsp; This is evident from the March 31, 2004 Order granting support <span style="font-style: italic;">pendente lite</span> to petitioner and her children, when the trial court observed:<br><blockquote>While there is evidence to the effect that defendant is giving some forms of financial assistance to his two (2) children via their credit cards and paying for their school expenses, the same is, however, devoid of any form of spousal support to the plaintiff, for, at this point in time, while the action for nullity of marriage is still to be heard, it is incumbent upon the defendant, considering the physical and financial condition of the plaintiff and the overwhelming capacity of defendant, to extend support unto the latter. x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></blockquote>On appeal, while the Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 84740 reduced the amount of monthly support fixed by the trial court, it nevertheless held that considering respondent’s financial resources, it is but fair and just that he give a monthly support for the sustenance and basic necessities of petitioner and his children.&nbsp; This would imply that any amount respondent seeks to be credited as monthly support should only cover those incurred for sustenance and household expenses.<br><blockquote>In the case at bar, records clearly show and in fact has been admitted by petitioner that aside from paying&nbsp; the expenses of their two (2) children’s schooling, he gave his two (2) children two (2) cars and credit cards of which the expenses for various items namely: clothes, grocery items and repairs of their cars were <span style="font-weight: bold;">chargeable to him </span>which totaled an amount of more than One Hundred Thousand (P100,000.00) for each of them and considering that as testified by the private respondent that she needs the total amount of P113,000.00 for the maintenance of the household and other miscellaneous expenses and considering further that petitioner can afford to buy cars for his two (2) children, and to pay the expenses incurred by them which are chargeable to him through the credit cards he provided them in the amount of P100,000.00 each, it is but fair and just that the monthly support <span style="font-style: italic;">pendente lite</span> for his wife, herein private respondent, be fixed as of the present in the amount <span style="font-weight: bold;">of P115,000.00 which would be sufficient enough to take care of the household and other needs.&nbsp;</span> This monthly support <span style="font-style: italic;">pendente lite</span> to private respondent in the amount of P115,000.00 <span style="font-weight: bold;">excludes the amount of One Hundred Thirty-Five (P135,000.00) Thousand Pesos for medical attendance expenses needed by private respondent for the operation of both her eye[s] </span>which is demandable upon the conduct of such operation.&nbsp; Likewise, this monthly support of P115,000.00 is without prejudice to any increase or decrease thereof that the trial court may grant private respondent as the circumstances may warrant i.e. depending on the proof submitted by the parties during the proceedings for the main action for support.<br><br>The amounts already extended to the two (2) children, being a commendable act of petitioner, should be continued by him considering the vast financial resources at his disposal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>Accordingly, only the following expenses of respondent may be allowed as deductions from the accrued support <span style="font-style: italic;">pendente lite</span> for petitioner and her children:&nbsp; <br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="38%"> Medical expenses of Susan Lim-Lua </td><td valign="top" width="4%"><div align="right">Php </div></td><td valign="top" width="58%"><div align="left">&nbsp; 42,450.71 </div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> Dental Expenses of Daniel Ryan</td><td valign="top"><div align="right">&nbsp; </div></td><td valign="top"><div align="left"> 11,500.00 </div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> Credit card purchases of Angelli <br>(Groceries and Dry Goods) <br>Credit Card purchases of Daniel Ryan <br></td><td valign="top"><div align="right">&nbsp; </div></td><td valign="top"><p align="left"> 365,282.20 </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td valign="top"><div align="right">&nbsp; </div></td><td valign="top"><u>228,869.38 </u></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> TOTAL </td><td valign="top"><div align="right"><strong>Php</strong> </div></td><td valign="top"><strong>648,102.29</strong></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>As to the contempt charge, we sustain the CA in holding that respondent is not guilty of indirect contempt.<br><br>Contempt of court is defined as a disobedience to the court by acting in opposition to its authority, justice, and dignity.
