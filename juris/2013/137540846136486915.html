It includes “any act of intrusion into, peeping or peering inquisitively into the residence of another without the consent of the latter.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>&nbsp; The phrase “prying into the privacy of another’s residence,” however, does not mean that only the residence is entitled to privacy.&nbsp; As elucidated by Civil law expert Arturo M. Tolentino:<br><br><blockquote>Our Code specifically mentions “prying into the privacy of another’s residence.”&nbsp; This does not mean, however, that only the residence is entitled to privacy, because the law covers also “similar acts.”&nbsp; <b>A business office is entitled to the same privacy when the public is excluded therefrom and only such individuals as are allowed to enter may come in</b>.&nbsp; x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup>&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>Thus, an individual’s right to privacy under Article 26(1) of the Civil Code should not be confined to his house or residence as it may extend to places where he has the right to exclude the public or deny them access.&nbsp; The phrase “prying into the privacy of another’s residence,” therefore, covers places, locations, or even situations which an individual considers as private.&nbsp; And as long as his right is recognized by society, other individuals may not infringe on his right to privacy.&nbsp; The CA, therefore, erred in limiting the application of Article 26(1) of the Civil Code only to residences.<br><br><b><i>The “reasonable expectation of privacy”<br> test is used to determine whether there<br> is a violation of the right to privacy.</i></b><br><br>In ascertaining whether there is a violation of the right to privacy, courts use the “reasonable expectation of privacy” test.&nbsp; This test determines whether a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy and whether the expectation has been violated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup>&nbsp; In <i>Ople v. Torres</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> we enunciated that “the reasonableness of a person’s expectation of privacy depends on a two-part test: (1) whether, by his conduct, the individual has exhibited an expectation of privacy; and (2) this expectation is one that society recognizes as reasonable.”&nbsp; Customs, community norms, and practices may, therefore, limit or extend an individual’s “reasonable expectation of privacy.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup>&nbsp; Hence, the reasonableness of a person’s expectation of privacy must be determined on a case-to-case basis since it depends on the factual circumstances surrounding the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>In this day and age, video surveillance cameras are installed practically everywhere for the protection and safety of everyone.&nbsp; The installation of these cameras, however, should not cover places where there is reasonable expectation of privacy, unless the consent of the individual, whose right to privacy would be affected, was obtained.&nbsp; Nor should these cameras be used to pry into the privacy of another’s residence or business office as it would be no different from eavesdropping, which is a crime under Republic Act No. 4200 or the Anti-Wiretapping Law.<br><br>In this case, the RTC, in granting the application for Preliminary Injunction, ruled that:<br><br><blockquote>After careful consideration, there is basis to grant the application for a temporary restraining order. The operation by [respondents] of a revolving camera, even if it were mounted on their building, violated the right of privacy of [petitioners], who are the owners of the adjacent lot.&nbsp; The camera does not only focus on [respondents’] property or the roof of the factory at the back (Aldo Development and Resources, Inc.) but it actually spans through a good portion of [the] land of [petitioners].<br><br>Based on the ocular inspection, the Court understands why [petitioner] Hing was so unyielding in asserting that the revolving camera was set up deliberately to monitor the on[-]going construction in his property.&nbsp; The monitor showed only a portion of the roof of the factory of [Aldo].&nbsp; If the purpose of [respondents] in setting up a camera at the back is to secure the building and factory premises, then the camera should revolve only towards their properties at the back. [Respondents’] camera cannot be made to extend the view to [petitioners’] lot.&nbsp; To allow the [respondents] to do that over the objection of the [petitioners] would violate the right of [petitioners] as property owners.&nbsp; “The owner of a thing cannot make use thereof in such a manner as to injure the rights of a third person.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup></blockquote><br>The RTC, thus, considered that petitioners have a “reasonable expectation of privacy” in their property, whether they use it as a business office or as a residence and that the installation of video surveillance cameras directly facing petitioners’ property or covering a significant portion thereof, without their consent, is a clear violation of their right to privacy.&nbsp; As we see then, the issuance of a preliminary injunction was justified.&nbsp; We need not belabor that the issuance of a preliminary injunction is discretionary on the part of the court taking cognizance of the case and should not be interfered with, unless there is grave abuse of discretion committed by the court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup>&nbsp; Here, there is no indication of any grave abuse of discretion.&nbsp; Hence, the CA erred in finding that petitioners are not entitled to an injunctive writ.<br><br>This brings us to the next question: whether respondents are the proper parties to this suit.<br><br><b><i>A real party defendant is one who has a <br>correlative legal obligation to redress <br>a wrong done to the plaintiff by reason<br> of the defendant's act or omission which<br> had violated the legal right of the former.</i></b><br><br>Section 2, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court provides:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 2. <i>Parties-in-interest. </i>— A real party-in-interest is the party who stands to be benefited or injured by the judgment in the suit, or the party entitled to the avails of the suit. Unless otherwise authorized by law or these Rules, every action must be prosecuted or defended in the name of the real party-in-interest.</blockquote><br>A real party defendant is “one who has a correlative legal obligation to redress a wrong done to the plaintiff by reason of the defendant’s act or omission which had violated the legal right of the former.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>In ruling that respondents are not the proper parties, the CA reasoned that since they do not own the building, they could not have installed the video surveillance cameras.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup>&nbsp; Such reasoning, however, is erroneous.&nbsp; The fact that respondents are not the registered owners of the building does not automatically mean that they did not cause the installation of the video surveillance cameras.<br><br>In their Complaint, petitioners claimed that respondents installed the video surveillance cameras in order to fish for evidence, which could be used against petitioners in another case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup>&nbsp; During the hearing of the application for Preliminary Injunction, petitioner Bill testified that when respondents installed the video surveillance cameras, he immediately broached his concerns but they did not seem to care,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> and thus, he reported the matter to the barangay for mediation, and eventually, filed a Complaint against respondents before the RTC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup>&nbsp; He also admitted that as early as 1998 there has already been a dispute between his family and the Choachuy family concerning the boundaries of their respective properties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup>&nbsp; With these factual circumstances in mind, we believe that respondents are the proper parties to be impleaded.<br><br>Moreover, although Aldo has a juridical personality separate and distinct from its stockholders, records show that it is a family-owned corporation managed by the Choachuy family.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>Also quite telling is the fact that respondents, notwithstanding their claim that they are not owners of the building, allowed the court to enter the compound of Aldo and conduct an ocular inspection. The counsel for respondents even toured Judge Marilyn Lagura-Yap inside the building and answered all her questions regarding the set-up and installation of the video surveillance cameras.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> And when respondents moved for reconsideration of the Order dated October 18, 2005 of the RTC, one of the arguments they raised is that Aldo would suffer damages if the video surveillance cameras are removed and transferred.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup>&nbsp; Noticeably, in these instances, the personalities of respondents and Aldo seem to merge.<br><br>All these taken together lead us to the inevitable conclusion that respondents are merely using the corporate fiction of Aldo as a shield to protect themselves from this suit.&nbsp; In view of the foregoing, we find that respondents are the proper parties to this suit.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition is hereby <b>GRANTED</b>.&nbsp; The Decision dated July 10, 2007 and the Resolution dated September 11, 2007 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
