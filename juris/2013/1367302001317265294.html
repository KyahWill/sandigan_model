				<BR><STRONG>BRION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Before this Court is the petition for<i> certiorari</i>, with prayer for the issuance of a writ of Preliminary Injunction and/or Status Quo Ante Order,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> filed by petitioner Mamerto T. Sevilla, Jr., to nullify the May 14, 2012 Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Commission on Elections (<i>Comelec</i>) Second Division and the October 6, 2012 Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Comelec <i>en banc</i> in SPR (BRGY-SK) No. 70-2011. These assailed Resolutions reversed and set aside the May 4, 2011 Order of the Muntinlupa City Metropolitan Trial Court, Branch 80 (<i>MeTC</i>), dismissing respondent Renato R. So’s election protest against Sevilla.<br><br><center><b>The Facts</b></center><br>Sevilla and So were candidates for the position of Punong Barangay of Barangay Sucat, Muntinlupa City during the October 25, 2010 Barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan Elections. On October 26, 2010, the Board of Election Tellers proclaimed Sevilla as the winner with a total of 7,354 votes or a winning margin of 628 votes over So’s 6,726 total votes. On November 4, 2010, So filed an election protest with the MeTC on the ground that Sevilla committed electoral fraud, anomalies and irregularities in all the protested precincts. So pinpointed twenty percent (20%) of the total number of the protested precincts. He also prayed for a manual revision of the ballots.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Following the recount of the ballots in the pilot protested precincts, the MeTC issued an Order dated May 4, 2011 dismissing the election protest. On May 9, 2011, So filed a motion for reconsideration from the dismissal order instead of a notice of appeal; he also failed to pay the appeal fee within the reglementary period. On May 17, 2011, the MeTC denied the motion for reconsideration on the ground that it was a prohibited pleading pursuant to Section 1, Rule 6 of A.M. No. 07-04-15-SC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>In response, So filed a petition for <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari </span>on May 31, 2011 with the Comelec, alleging grave abuse of discretion on the part of the MeTC Judge. So faults the MeTC for its non-observance of the rule that in the appreciation of ballots, there should be a clear and distinct presentation of the specific details of how and why a certain group of ballots should be considered as having been written by one or two persons.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br><b><i>The Comelec Second Division Ruling</i></b><br><br>In its May 14, 2012 Resolution, the Comelec Second Division granted So’s petition. The Comelec Second Division held that <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari</span> can be granted despite the availability of appeals when the questioned order amounts to an oppressive exercise of judicial authority, as in the case before it. It also ruled that the assailed Order was fraught with infirmities and irregularities in the appreciation of the ballots, and was couched in general terms: “these are not written by one person observing the different strokes, slant, spacing, size and indentation of handwriting and the variance in writing[.]”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br><b><i>The Comelec En Banc Ruling</i></b><br><br>The Comelec <i>en banc</i>, by a vote of 3-3,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> affirmed the Comelec Second Division’s ruling in its October 6, 2012 Resolution whose dispositive portion reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Motion for Reconsideration is hereby DENIED for lack of merit. Respondent judge is directed to conduct another revision of the contested ballots in Election Protest Case No. SP-6719 with dispatch.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></blockquote><br>It ruled that where the dismissal was capricious, <i>certiorari</i> lies as the petition challenges not the correctness but the validity of the order of dismissal. The Comelec <i>en banc</i> emphasized that procedural technicalities should be disregarded for the immediate and final resolution of election cases inasmuch as ballots should be read and appreciated with utmost liberality so that the will of the electorate in the choice of public officials may not be defeated by technical infirmities.<br><br>It found that the MeTC Judge committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction when she did not comply with the mandatory requirements of Section 2(d), Rule 14 of A.M. No. 07-4-15-SC on the form of the decision in election protests involving pairs or groups of ballots written by two persons. It noted that based on the general and repetitive phraseology of the Order, the MeTC Judge’s findings were “copy-pasted” into the decision and ran counter to the mandate of the aforementioned rule. Also, the MeTC Judge failed to mention in her appreciation of the ballots that she examined the Minutes of Voting and Counting to ascertain whether there were illiterate voters or assisted voters in the protested precincts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br><b><i>Commissioner Lim’s Dissent</i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>The dissent posited that So’s petition should be dismissed outright as it was mired in procedural errors. <i>First,</i> So should have filed an appeal within five (5) days from receipt of the MeTC’s Order; a motion for reconsideration was improper as the Order amounted to the final disposition of the protest. <i>Second,</i> So should not have filed the motion for reconsideration even if he believed that the Order was interlocutory since a motion for reconsideration is a prohibited pleading. Also, he could have simply filed the petition for <i>certiorari</i> without the necessity of filing the motion for reconsideration. <i>Third</i>, the petition for <i>certiorari </i>cannot be a substitute for the lost appeal. The Comelec could not even treat the <i>certiorari</i> as an appeal since the petition was filed 25 days after So received the assailed Order; thus, the Order already attained finality. <i>Finally</i>, procedural rules should not be lightly shunned in favor of liberality when, as in this case, So did not give a valid excuse for his errors.<br><br><center><b>The Petition</b></center><br><b><i>The Comelec gravely abused its<br>discretion when it gave due course<br>to the petition for certiorari</i></b><br><br>Sevilla argues that the Comelec gravely abused its discretion when it entertained So’s petition despite its loss of jurisdiction to entertain the petition after the court a <i>quo’s </i>dismissal order became final and executory due to So’s wrong choice of remedy. Instead of filing an appeal within five (5) days from receipt of the Order and paying the required appeal fee, So filed a motion for reconsideration – a prohibited pleading that did not stop the running of the prescriptive period to file an appeal. Sevilla also emphasizes that So’s petition for <i>certiorari</i> should not have been given due course since it is not a substitute for an appeal and may only be allowed if there is no appeal, nor any plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br><b><i>The dismissal of the election protest was proper</i></b><br><br>Sevilla also contends that the dismissal was not tainted with grave abuse of discretion since the MeTC Judge complied with the rules; she made clear, specific and detailed explanations pertaining to the specific strokes, figures or letters showing that the ballots had been written by one person. Granting that the decision was tainted with errors, <i>certiorari</i> would still not lie because a mere error of judgment is not synonymous with grave abuse of discretion. Lastly, a liberal application of the rules cannot be made to a petition which offers no explanation for the non-observance of the rules.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>On November 13, 2012,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> the Court resolved to require the Comelec and the respondent to comment on the petition and to observe the <i>status quo</i> prevailing before the issuance of the assailed Comelec Second Division’s Resolution of May 14, 2012 and the Comelec <i>en banc’s</i> Resolution of October 6, 2012.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>In his Comment, the respondent contends that the petition was filed prematurely. He emphasizes that the October 6, 2012 Resolution of the Comelec <i>en banc</i> was not a majority decision considering that three Commissioners voted for the denial of the motion for reconsideration and the three others voted to grant the same. So notes that the assailed October 6, 2012 Resolution was deliberated upon only by six (6) Commissioners because the 7<sup>th</sup> Commissioner had not yet been appointed by the President at that time. Considering that the October 6, 2012 Resolution was not a majority decision by the Comelec <i>en banc</i>, So prays for the dismissal of the petition so that it can be remanded to the Comelec for a rehearing by a full and complete Commission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br><center><b>The Court’s Ruling</b><br></center><br><b>We resolve to DISMISS the petition for having been prematurely filed with this Court, and remand the case to the COMELEC for its appropriate action.</b><br><br><b><i>The October 6, 2012 Comelec<br>en banc’s Resolution lacks legal <br>effect as it is not a majority decision<br>required by the Constitution and by<br>the Comelec Rules of Procedure</i></b><br><br>Section 7, Article IX-A of the Constitution requires that “[e]ach Commission shall <b>decide by a majority vote of all its members</b>, any case or matter brought before it within sixty days from the date of its submission for decision or resolution.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Pursuant to this Constitutional mandate, the Comelec provided in Section 5(a), Rule 3 of the Comelec Rules of Procedure the votes required for the pronouncement of a decision, resolution, order or ruling when the Comelec sits <i>en banc</i>, <i>viz</i>.:<br><br><blockquote>Section 5. <i>Quorum; Votes Required.</i> - (a) When sitting <span style="font-style: italic;">en banc,</span> four (4) Members of the Commission shall constitute a quorum for the purpose of transacting business. The<b> concurrence of a majority of the Members of the Commission</b> shall be necessary for the pronouncement of a decision, resolution, order or ruling. [italics supplied; emphasis ours]<br></blockquote><br>We have previously ruled that a <b>majority vote requires a vote of four members</b> of the Comelec<span style="font-style: italic;"> en banc</span>. In <i>Marcoleta v. Commission on Elections</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> we declared “that Section 5(a) of Rule 3 of the Comelec Rules of Procedure and Section 7 of Article IX-A of the Constitution require that a <b>majority vote of all the members</b> of the Comelec [<i>en banc</i>], and not only those who participated and took part in the deliberations, is necessary for the pronouncement of a decision, resolution, order or ruling.”<br><br>In the present case, while the October 6, 2012 Resolution of the Comelec <i>en banc </i>appears to have affirmed the Comelec Second Division’s Resolution and, in effect, denied Sevilla’s motion for reconsideration, the equally divided voting between three Commissioners concurring and three Commissioners dissenting is not the majority vote that the Constitution and the Comelec Rules of Procedure require for a valid pronouncement of the assailed October 6, 2012 Resolution of the Comelec <i>en banc</i>.<br><br>In essence, based on the 3-3 voting, the Comelec<i> en banc</i> did not sustain the Comelec Second Division’s findings on the basis of the three concurring votes by Commissioners Tagle, Velasco and Yusoph; conversely, it also did not overturn the Comelec Second Division on the basis of the three dissenting votes by Chairman Brillantes, Commissioner Sarmiento and Commissioner Lim, as either side was short of one (1) vote to obtain a majority decision. Recall that under Section 7, Article IX-A of the Constitution, a majority vote of <u>all</u> the members of the Commission <span style="font-style: italic;">en banc </span>is necessary to arrive at a ruling. In other words, the vote of four (4) members must <u>always</u> be attained in order to decide, irrespective of the number of Commissioners in attendance. Thus, for all intents and purposes, the assailed October 6, 2012 Resolution of the Comelec <i>en banc</i> had no legal effect whatsoever except to convey that the Comelec failed to reach a decision and that further action is required.<br><br><b><i>The October 6, 2012 Comelec en banc’s <br>Resolution must be reheard pursuant to<br> the Comelec Rules of Procedure</i></b><br><br>To break the legal stalemate in case the opinion is equally divided among the members of the Comelec <i>en banc</i>, Section 6, Rule 18 of the Comelec Rules of Procedure mandates a rehearing where parties are given the opportunity anew to strengthen their respective positions or arguments and convince the members of the Comelec <i>en banc</i> of the merit of their case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Section 6, Rule 18 of the Comelec Rules of Procedure reads:<br><br><blockquote>Section 6. <i>Procedure if Opinion is Equally Divided</i>. - <b>When the Commission en banc is equally divided in opinion, or the necessary majority cannot be had, the case shall be reheard, and if on rehearing no decision is reached</b>, the action or proceeding shall be dismissed if originally commenced in the Commission; in appealed cases, the judgment or order appealed from shall stand affirmed; and in all incidental matters, the petition or motion shall be denied. [emphasis ours; italics supplied]</blockquote><br>In <i>Juliano v. Commission on Elections</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> only three members of the Comelec <i>en banc</i> voted in favor of granting Estrelita Juliano’s motion for reconsideration (from the Decision of the Comelec Second Division dismissing her petition for annulment of proclamation of Muslimin Sema as the duly elected Mayor of Cotabato City), three members dissented, and one member took no part. In ruling that the Comelec acted with grave abuse of discretion when it failed to order a rehearing required by the Comelec Rules of Procedure, the Court ruled:<br><br><blockquote>Section 6, Rule 18 of the Comelec Rules of Procedure specifically states that if the opinion of the Comelec <i>En Banc</i> is equally divided, the case shall be <b>reheard</b>. The Court notes, however, that the Order of the Comelec <i>En Banc </i>dated February 10, 2005 clearly stated that what was conducted was a mere “re-consultation.”<br><br>A “re-consultation” is definitely not the same as a “rehearing.”<br><br>A consultation is a “deliberation of persons on some subject;” hence, a re-consultation means a second deliberation of persons on some subject.<br><br>Rehearing is defined as a “second consideration of cause for purpose of calling to court’s or administrative board’s attention any error, omission, or oversight in first consideration. <b><i>A retrial of issues presumes notice to parties entitled thereto and opportunity for them to be heard[.]” </i></b>(italics supplied). But as held in <i>Samalio v. Court of Appeals</i>,<br><br><blockquote>A formal or trial-type hearing is not at all times and in all instances essential. The requirements are satisfied where the parties are afforded fair and reasonable opportunity to explain their side of the controversy at hand.</blockquote><br>Thus, a rehearing clearly presupposes the participation of the opposing parties for the purpose of presenting additional evidence, if any, and further clarifying and amplifying their arguments; whereas, a re-consultation involves a re- evaluation of the issues and arguments already on hand only by the members of the tribunal, without the participation of the parties.<br><br>In <i>Belac v. Comelec,</i> when the voting of the Comelec <i>En Banc</i> on therein petitioner’s motion for reconsideration was equally divided, the Comelec <i>En Banc</i> first issued an order setting the case for hearing and allowed the parties to submit their respective memoranda before voting anew on therein petitioner’s motion for reconsideration. This should have been the proper way for the Comelec<i> En Banc</i> to act on herein petitioner’s motion for reconsideration when the first voting was equally divided. Its own Rules of Procedure calls for a rehearing where the parties would have the opportunity to strengthen their respective positions or arguments and convince the members of the Comelec <i>En Banc </i>of the merit of their case. Thus, when the Comelec <i>En Banc</i> failed to give petitioner the rehearing required by the Comelec Rules of Procedure, said body acted with grave abuse of discretion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> (italics supplied; emphases ours)</blockquote><br>To the same effect, in <i>Marcoleta v. Commission on Elections</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> the Court ruled that the Comelec <i>en banc</i> did not gravely abuse its discretion when it ordered a rehearing of its November 6, 2007 Resolution for failing to muster the required majority voting. The court held:<br><br><blockquote>The Comelec, despite the obvious inclination of three commissioners to affirm the Resolution of the <i>First</i> Division, cannot do away with a rehearing since its Rules clearly provide for such a proceeding for the body to have a solicitous review of the controversy before it. A rehearing clearly presupposes the participation of the opposing parties for the purpose of presenting additional evidence, if any, and further clarifying and amplifying their arguments.<br><br>To reiterate, neither the assenters nor dissenters can claim a majority .in the <i>En Banc</i> Resolution of November 6, 2007. The Resolution served no more than a record of votes, lacking in legal effect despite its pronouncement of reversal of the <i>First</i> Division Resolution. Accordingly the Comelec did not commit any grave abuse of discretion in ordering a rehearing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> (italics supplied; citation omitted)</blockquote><br>In the present case, it appears from the records that the Comelec <i>en banc</i> did not issue an Order for a rehearing of the case in view of filing in the interim of the present petition for <i>certiorari </i>by Sevilla.&nbsp; In both the cases of <i>Juliano</i> and <i>Marcoleta</i>, cited above, we remanded the cases to the Comelec <i>en banc</i> for the conduct of the required rehearing pursuant to the Comelec Rules of Procedure. Based on these considerations, we thus find that a remind of this case is necessary for the Comelec <i>en banc</i> to comply with the rehearing requirement of Section 6, Rule 18 of the Comelec Rules of Procedure.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, we hereby <b>DISMISS</b> the petition and <b>REMAND</b> SPR (BRGY-SK) No. 70-2011 to the Comelec <i>en banc </i>for the conduct of the required rehearing under the Comelec Rules of Procedure. The Comelec <i>en banc</i> is hereby <b>ORDERED</b> to proceed with the rehearing with utmost dispatch.<br><br>No costs.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Sereno, C.J., Carpio, Velasco, Jr., Leonardo-De Castro, Peralta, Bersamin, Del Castillo, Abad, Villarama, Jr., Perez, Mendoza, Reyes, Perlas-Bernabe, </span>and<span style="font-style: italic;"> Leonen, JJ.</span>, concur.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>, pp. 3-43.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Penned by Presiding Commissioner Lucenito N.
