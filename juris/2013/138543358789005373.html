				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an appeal from a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated March 18, 2011 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR.-H.C. No. 04019, entitled <i>People of the Philippines v. Ricardo M. Vidaña</i>, which affirmed the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated June 26, 2009 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Guimba, Nueva Ecija, Branch 33 in Criminal Case No. 2163-G.&nbsp; The trial court convicted appellant Ricardo M. Vidaña of one (1) count of rape in relation to Republic Act No. 7610, otherwise known as the “Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act.”<br><br>The accusatory portion of the Information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated February 6, 2004 for rape in relation to Republic Act No. 7610 reads as follows:<br><br><blockquote>That on or about the 16<sup>th</sup> day of September 2003, at x x x, Province of Nueva Ecija, Republic of the Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused with lewd designs and intent to have carnal knowledge of [AAA<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>], his own daughter, a minor, 15 years old, and while using his influence as a father, over said minor, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge of and sexual intercourse with said minor against her will and consent, to her damage and prejudice.</blockquote><br>After more than a year of being at large since the issuance on September 1, 2004 of the warrant for his arrest,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> appellant was finally arrested and subsequently arraigned on January 30, 2006 wherein he pleaded “NOT GUILTY” to the charge of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>The prosecution’s version of the events that transpired in this case was narrated in the Plaintiff-Appellee’s Brief in this manner:<br><br><blockquote>[Appellant] and wife [BBB] were separated in 1998. They have four (4) children namely: [AAA], [CCC], [DDD] and [EEE]. In 1999, [appellant] began living in with a certain Irene Valoria, his common-law wife, who became the aforementioned children’s stepmother. They were staying in a one-bedroom house owned by a certain Edgar Magsakay at Sta. Maria, Licab, Nueva Ecija. At night, [appellant] and his common-law wife sleep in the <i>sala</i> while the children occupy the bedroom. [AAA] is the eldest of the brood and was 15 years old in the year 2003, having been born on 13 June 1988.<br><br>Around midnight of 16 September 2003, [appellant] was alone at the <i>sala</i> and the children were asleep inside the bedroom. [AAA] suddenly was jolted from her sleep when somebody pulled her out of the bed and brought her to the <i>sala</i>. She later recognized the person as her father, herein [appellant], who covered her mouth and told her not to make any noise. At the <i>sala</i>, [appellant] forcibly removed [AAA]’s short pants, t-shirt, bra and panty. As she lay naked, [appellant] inserted his penis into [AAA]’s vagina. [AAA]’s ordeal lasted for about five (5) minutes and all the while she felt an immense pain. [Appellant] tried to touch [AAA]’s other private parts but she resisted. During the consummation of [appellant]’s lust upon his daughter, he warned her not to tell anybody or else he will kill her and her siblings.<br><br>The next day, [AAA] went to the house of Francisco and Zenny Joaquin. Spouses Joaquin are friends of [appellant], whose house is about 500 meters away. Zenny Joaquin noticed something was bothering [AAA] so she confronted the latter. [AAA] broke down and revealed to Zenny what happened to her at the hands of [appellant]. Taken aback by the trauma suffered by the young lass, Zenny promptly accompanied [AAA] to the police to report the incident.<br><br>The examination of the medico-legal officer on [AAA] revealed “<i>positive healed laceration at 7 o’clock position positive hymenal tag.</i>”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> (Citations omitted.)</blockquote><br>On the other hand, the defense presented a contrasting narrative which was condensed in the Accused-Appellant’s Brief, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>[Appellant] together with his family were living in the house of Edgar Magsakay in Sta. Maria, Licab, Nueva Ecija. He has four children but only three, namely: [EEE], [CCC] and [DDD] were staying with him. His daughter [AAA] was staying with his <i>kumpare</i> Francisco Joaquin at Purok 2, Sta. Maria, Licab, Nueva Ecija, since August 15, 2003. He did not have the opportunity to visit her nor was there an occasion that the latter visited them. On September 16, 2003 at 4:00 to 5:00 in the morning, he was at the fields harvesting together with Irene Valoria (his wife and stepmother of his children). They finished at around 5:00 to 6:00 in the evening, then they proceeded home (TSN November 14, 2008, pp. 2-4).<br><br>[EEE] corroborated in material points the testimony of his father [appellant]. (TSN, February 13, 2009, pp. 2-5)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></blockquote><br>Trial on the merits ensued and at the conclusion of which the trial court rendered judgment against appellant by finding him guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 5 in relation to Section 31 of Republic Act No. 7610.&nbsp; The dispositive portion of the assailed June 26, 2009 RTC Decision is reproduced here:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, finding the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime charged, this court sentences him to <b><b>reclusion perpetua </b></b>and to pay [AAA] P50,000 in moral damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></blockquote><br>Insisting on his innocence, appellant appealed the guilty verdict to the Court of Appeals but was foiled when the appellate court affirmed the lower court ruling in the now assailed March 18, 2011 Decision, the dispositive portion of which states:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the Decision dated 26 June 2009 of the Regional Trial Court, Guimba, Nueva Ecija, Branch 33, in Criminal Case No. 2163-G, finding the accused-appellant <b>RICARDO M. VIDAÑA GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt</b> is hereby <b>AFFIRMED <i>in toto</i></b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></blockquote><br>Hence, appellant takes the present appeal and puts forward a single assignment of error:<br><br><blockquote>THE COURT <u>A QUO</u> GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT OF VIOLATION OF SECTION 5 IN RELATION TO SECTION 31 OF REPUBLIC ACT NO. 7610.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></blockquote><br>Appellant vehemently denies his eldest child’s (AAA’s) allegation of rape by asseverating that he could not have raped AAA because, on the date when the alleged rape took place, she was living in Francisco and Zenny Joaquin’s house and not in his residence where the alleged rape was consummated.&nbsp; This assertion was corroborated on material points by appellant’s son, EEE.&nbsp; Furthermore, appellant insists that the credibility of AAA is suspect since her narration of the alleged rape incident does not indicate that she resisted appellant’s carnal desires.<br><br>We find no merit in appellant’s contention.<br><br>Not unlike most rape cases, appellant hinges his hopes for freedom on undermining the credibility of AAA’s testimony.&nbsp; Since AAA is the only witness that can connect appellant to the crime, appellant beseeches this Court to take a closer look at AAA’s testimony and, at the end of which, render a judgment of acquittal.<br><br>It is jurisprudentially settled that in a prosecution for rape, the accused may be convicted solely on the basis of the testimony of the victim that is credible, convincing and consistent with human nature and the normal course of things.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>&nbsp; Furthermore, it is likewise settled that the factual findings of the trial court, especially when affirmed by the Court of Appeals, are entitled to great weight and respect, if not conclusiveness, since the trial court was in the best position as the original trier of the facts in whose direct presence and under whose keen observation the witnesses rendered their respective versions of the events that made up the occurrences constituting the ingredients of the offense charged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>A careful review of the evidence and testimony brought to light in this case does not lead to a conclusion that the trial court and the Court of Appeals were mistaken in their assessment of the credibility of AAA’s testimony.&nbsp; Absent any demonstration by appellant that both tribunals overlooked a material fact that otherwise would change the outcome of the case or misunderstood a circumstance of consequence in their evaluation of the credibility of the witnesses, we are thus inclined to affirm the facts as established by the trial court and affirmed by the Court of Appeals.<br><br>We are of the opinion that the testimony of AAA regarding her ordeal was delivered in a straightforward and convincing manner that is worthy of belief.&nbsp; The pertinent portions of her testimony are reproduced below:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY">[PROS.] FLORENDO</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">We are referring to this particular case.

Jurisprudence tells us that both denial and alibi are inherently weak defenses which cannot prevail over the positive and credible testimony of the prosecution witness that the accused committed the crime, thus, as between a categorical testimony which has a ring of truth on one hand, and a mere denial and alibi on the other, the former is generally held to prevail.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Moreover, we have held that for alibi to prosper, it is necessary that the corroboration is credible, the same having been offered preferably by disinterested witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>&nbsp; Based on this doctrine, the corroborating testimony of appellant’s son, EEE, who, undoubtedly, is a person intimately related to him cannot serve to reinforce his alibi.<br><br>In view of the foregoing, we therefore affirm the conviction of appellant.&nbsp; However, the trial court erred in impliedly characterizing the offense charged as sexual abuse under Sections 5 and 31 of Republic Act No. 7610.<br><br>Under Rule 110, Section 8 of the Rules of Court, it is required that “[t]he complaint or information shall state the designation of the offense given by the statute, aver the acts or omissions constituting the offense, and specify its qualifying and aggravating circumstances.&nbsp; If there is no designation of the offense, reference shall be made to the section or subsection of the statute punishing it.”&nbsp; The information clearly charged appellant with rape, a crime punishable under Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code, the relevant portions of which provide:<br><br><blockquote>Article 266-A. <i>Rape; When And How Committed</i>. – Rape is committed –<br><br>1) By a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">a) Through force, threat or intimidation;<br><br>b) When the offended party is deprived of reason or is otherwise unconscious;<br><br>c) By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority;<br><br>d) When the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age or is demented, even though none of the circumstances mentioned above be present.</div></blockquote><br>The same statute likewise states:<br><br><blockquote>Article 266-B. <i>Penalties. </i>– Rape under paragraph 1 of the next preceding article shall be punished by <i>reclusion perpetua.</i><br><br>x x x x<br><br>The death penalty shall also be imposed if the crime of rape is committed with any of the following aggravating/qualifying circumstances:<br><br>1) When the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is a parent, ascendant, stepparent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim.</blockquote><br>In the case at bar, appellant was accused in the information with feloniously having carnal knowledge of his own minor daughter against her will by using his influence as a father.&nbsp; Considering further that the minority of AAA and her relationship to appellant were both alleged in the information and proven in court, the proper designation of appellant’s felony should have been qualified rape.&nbsp; As such, the penalty of reclusion perpetua without eligibility of parole, in lieu of the death penalty, pursuant to Republic Act No. 9346<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> must be imposed. Furthermore, in line with jurisprudence, the award of moral damages should be increased to P75,000.00 in addition to the award of civil indemnity and exemplary damages in the amounts of P75,000.00 and P30,000.00, respectively.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Likewise, interest at the rate of 6% per annum shall be imposed on all damages awarded from the date of the finality of this judgment until fully paid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the Decision dated March 18, 2011 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
