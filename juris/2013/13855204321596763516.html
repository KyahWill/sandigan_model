Calabocal received the sachets of <i>shabu</i> for chemical analysis. P/Insp. Calabocal’s examination revealed that the contents of the sachets marked “MMY” and “PBS” weighed 4.50 grams and 4.45 grams, respectively, and both tested positive for methamphetamine hydrochloride.<br><br>When the defense’s turn to present evidence came, the accused-appellants took the witness stand.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>&nbsp; Accused-appellants asserted that they did not know each other prior to their arrests and they were illegally arrested, extorted for money, physically beaten, and framed-up by the police.<br><br>On June 11, 2008, the RTC promulgated its Decision finding accused-appellants guilty beyond reasonable doubt of illegally selling <i>shabu,</i> penalized under Article II, Section 5 of Republic Act No. 9165, to wit:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered finding accused <b>MICHAEL MAONGCO y YUMONDA</b>, accused in Ciminal Case No. Q-04-127731 and <b>PHANS BANDALI y SIMPAL</b>, accused in Ciminal Case No. Q-04-127732, both <b>guilty</b> beyond reasonable doubt of violations of Section 5, Article II of R.A.

When PO1 Arugay appeared for his purportedly indisposed cousin, Carpio, and asked for his order of <i>shabu</i>, accused-appellant Maongco immediately understood what PO1 Arugay meant.&nbsp; Accused-appellant Maongco took out a sachet of <i>shabu</i> from his pocket and handed over possession of said sachet to PO1 Arugay.<br><br>Based on the charges against accused-appellant Maongco and the evidence presented by the prosecution, accused-appellant Maongco is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of <b>illegal delivery of <i>shabu</i></b> under Article II, Section 5 of Republic Act No. 9165.<br><br>For the same reasons cited in the preceding paragraphs, the RTC and the Court of Appeals also erred in convicting accused-appellant Bandali for the crime of <b>illegal sale of <i>shabu</i></b> in <b>Criminal Case No. Q-04-127732</b>.<br><br>The Information against accused-appellant Bandali, same as that against accused-appellant Maongco, charged him with “willfully and unlawfully dispens[ing], deliver[ing], transport[ing], distribut[ing] or act[ing] as broker” in the transaction involving 4.45 grams of <i>shabu</i>.&nbsp; However, unlike accused-appellant Maongco, accused-appellant Bandali cannot be convicted for illegal delivery of <i>shabu</i> under Article II, Section 5 of Republic Act No. 9165, given that the circumstances surrounding the arrest of the latter were radically different from those of the former.<br><br>PO2 Ong testified:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Q. </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">How did this Arugay arrest this Michael?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A. </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">I was only a back-up of Arugay, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q. </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">What did you see, if any?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A.</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">I saw that he recovered one (1) heat-sealed transparent plastic sachet, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q. </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">He recovered it from whom?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A.</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">From Michael Maongco, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">x x x x</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q. </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">What happened when this man was arrested by Arugay?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A. </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">We looked for the other “bulto” because according to Michael there were two and it was in the possession of Phans, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY">THE COURT:</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q.</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Where did you look for him?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A. </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">At Jollibee, Pantranco, your Honor.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">x x x x</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q. </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Did you find him in Jollibee?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A. </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Yes, your Honor, because according to Michael Maongco he was wearing blue T-shirt.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q. </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">What did you do when you found him at Jollibee?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A.</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">I went near him and asked him to put out the other shabu in his possession, your Honor.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q. </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">You yourself?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A. </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">My companions were just there, your Honor.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q.</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">You yourself approached him?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A. </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Yes, your Honor.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q. </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">When you demanded the production of what?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A. </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">One (1) bulto of shabu, your Honor.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY">PROS.

PO2 Ong approached accused-appellant Bandali as a police officer, absent any pretense, and demanded that the latter bring out the other sachet of shabu.&nbsp; Accused-appellant Bandali’s voluntary production of the sachet of <i>shabu</i> in his possession was in subservience to PO2 Ong’s authority.&nbsp; PO2 Ong then acquired the sachet of <i>shabu</i> from accused-appellant Bandali by seizure, not by delivery.&nbsp; Even if there may be doubt as to whether or not accused-appellant Bandali was actually aware at that moment that PO2 Ong was a police officer, the ambiguity would still be resolved in accused-appellant Bandali’s favor.<br><br>This does not mean though that accused-appellant Bandali goes scot-free.&nbsp; The evidence for the prosecution did establish that accused-appellant Bandali committed <b>illegal possession of dangerous drugs</b>, penalized under Article II, Section 11 of Republic Act No. 9165.<br><br>For the prosecution of illegal possession of dangerous drugs to prosper, the following essential elements must be proven, namely: (1) the accused is in possession of an item or object that is identified to be a prohibited drug; (2) such possession is not authorized by law; and (3) the accused freely and consciously possess the said drug.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>&nbsp; Accused-appellant Maongco informed the police officers that the other sachet of <i>shabu</i> was in the possession of accused-appellant Bandali.&nbsp; Accused-appellant Bandali herein was in possession of the sachet of shabu as he was sitting at Jollibee Pantranco branch and was approached by PO2 Ong.&nbsp; Hence, accused-appellant Bandali was able to immediately produce and surrender the said sachet upon demand by PO2 Ong.&nbsp; Accused-appellant Bandali, admittedly jobless at the time of his arrest,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> did not have any authority to possess <i>shabu</i>.&nbsp; And as to the last element, the rule is settled that possession of dangerous drugs constitutes <i>prima facie</i> evidence of knowledge or <i>animus possidendi</i>, which is sufficient to convict an accused in the absence of a satisfactory explanation of such possession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>But can accused-appellant Bandali be convicted for illegal possession of dangerous drugs under Article II, Section 11 of Republic Act No. 9165 when he was charged with illegal dispensation, delivery, transportation, distribution or acting as broker of dangerous drugs under Article II, Section 5 of the same statute?&nbsp; The Court answers in the affirmative.<br><br>Rule 120, Section 4 of the Rules of Court governs situations where there is a variance between the crime charged and the crime proved, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 4. <i>Judgment in case of variance between allegation and proof</i>. – When there is variance between the offense charged in the complaint or information and that proved, and the offense as charged is included in or necessarily includes the offense proved, the accused shall be convicted of the offense proved which is included in the offense charged, or of the offense charged which is included in the offense proved.</blockquote><br>Well-settled in jurisprudence that the crime of illegal sale of dangerous drugs necessarily includes the crime of illegal possession of dangerous drugs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>&nbsp; The same ruling may also be applied to the other acts penalized under Article II, Section 5 of Republic Act No. 9165 because for the accused to be able to trade, administer, dispense, deliver, give away to another, distribute, dispatch in transit, or transport any dangerous drug, he must necessarily be in possession of said drugs.<br><br>At the outset of the trial, both parties had admitted the laboratory results showing that the contents of the two sachets tested positive for<i> shabu, </i>although accused-appellants contest the identity and integrity of the sachets and contents actually tested since the chain of custody of the same was not satisfactorily established in accordance with Republic Act No. 9165 and its implementing rules.<br><br>The Court disagrees with accused-appellants as the police officers had substantially complied with the chain of custody rule under Section 21(a) of the Implementing Rules of Republic Act No. 9165.&nbsp; The Court had previously held that in dangerous drugs cases, the failure of the police officers to make a physical inventory, to photograph, and to mark the seized drugs at the place of arrest do not render said drugs inadmissible in evidence or automatically impair the integrity of the chain of custody of the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>&nbsp; The Court had further clarified, in relation to the requirement of marking the drugs “immediately after seizure and confiscation,” that the marking may be undertaken at the police station rather than at the place of arrest for as long as it is done in the presence of the accused and that what is of utmost importance is the preservation of its integrity and evidentiary value.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>The Court finds no fault on the part of both the RTC and the Court of Appeals in giving more weight and credence to the testimonies of the police officers vis-à-vis those of the accused-appellants.&nbsp; Questions as to the credibility of witnesses are matters best left to the appreciation of the trial court because of its unique opportunity of having observed that elusive and incommunicable evidence of the witnesses’ deportment on the stand while testifying, which opportunity is denied to the reviewing tribunal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Moreover, accused-appellants’ uncorroborated defenses of denial and claims of frame-up cannot prevail over the positive testimonies of the prosecution witnesses, coupled with the presentation in court of the <i>corpus delicti</i>.&nbsp; The testimonies of police officers who caught the accused-appellants <i>in flagrante delicto</i> are usually credited with more weight and credence, in the absence of evidence that they have been inspired by an improper or ill motive, than the defenses of denial and frame-up of an accused which have been invariably viewed with disfavor for it can easily be concocted.&nbsp; In order to prosper, the defenses of denial and frame-up must be proved with strong and convincing evidence,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> which accused-appellants failed to present in this case.<br><br>Lastly, the Court determines the proper penalties to be imposed upon accused-appellants.<br><br>Under Article II, Section 5 of Republic Act No. 9165, the penalties for the illegal delivery of dangerous drugs, regardless of the quantity thereof, shall be life imprisonment to death and a fine ranging from Five Hundred Thousand Pesos (P500,000.00) to Ten Million Pesos (P10,000,000.00).&nbsp; Hence, accused-appellant Maongco, for his illegal delivery of <i>shabu</i> in Criminal Case No. Q-04-127731, is sentenced to life imprisonment and ordered to pay a fine of Five Hundred Thousand Pesos (P500,000.00).<br><br>Article II, Section 11 of Republic Act No. 9165 prescribes the penalty, for possession of less than five grams of dangerous drugs, of imprisonment of twelve (12) years and one (1) day to twenty (20) years, plus a fine ranging from Three Hundred Thousand Pesos (P300,000.00) to Four Hundred Thousand Pesos (P400,000.00).&nbsp; Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the maximum term shall not exceed the maximum fixed by law and the minimum shall not be less than the minimum term as prescribed by the same law.&nbsp; Resultantly, accused-appellant Bandali, for his illegal possession of 4.45 grams of <i>shabu</i> in Criminal Case No. Q-04-127732, is sentenced to imprisonment of twelve (12) years and one (1) day, as the minimum term, to twenty (20) years, as the maximum term, and ordered to pay a fine of Four Hundred Thousand Pesos (P400,000.00).<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed Decision is <b>AFFIRMED</b> with <b>MODIFICATIONS</b>, to read as follows:<br><br>1.&nbsp; In Criminal Case No. Q-04-127731, accused-appellant <b>MICHAEL YUMONDA MAONGCO</b> is found <b>GUILTY </b>beyond reasonable doubt of illegal delivery of <i>shabu</i> penalized under Article II, Section 5 of Republic Act No. 9165, and is sentenced to <b>LIFE IMPRISONMENT</b> and ordered to pay a <b>FINE </b>of Five Hundred Thousand Pesos (P500,000.00);
