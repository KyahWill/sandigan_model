SP No. 82022 upholding the 15 August 2003 and 1 December 2003 Orders of the Valenzuela Regional Trial Court (RTC) ruling that the subject machineries and equipments of Paper City Corporation (Paper City) are movable properties by agreement of the parties and cannot be considered as included in the extrajudicial foreclosure sale of the mortgaged land and building of Paper City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>The facts as we gathered from the records are:<br><br>Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation (RCBC), Metropolitan Bank and Trust Co.

Annex “B” of the said MTI covered the machineries and equipments of Paper City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>The MTI was later amended on <b>20 November 1992</b> to increase the contributions of the RCBC and Union Bank to P80,000,000.00 and P70,000,000.00, respectively.&nbsp; As a consequence, they executed a <b>Deed of Amendment to MTI</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>&nbsp; but still included as part of the mortgaged properties by way of a first mortgage the various machineries and equipments located in and bolted to and/or forming part of buildings generally described as:<br><br><blockquote>Annex “A”<br><ol type="A"><li>Office Building<br><br>Building 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5<br>Boiler House<br>Workers’ Quarter/Restroom<br>Canteen<br>Guardhouse, Parking Shed, Elevated Guard<br>Post and other amenities<br><br></li><li>Pollution Tank Nos. 1 and 2.<br><br>Reserve Water Tank and Swimming Pool<br>Waste Water Treatment Tank<br>Elevated Concrete Water Tank<br>And other Improvements listed in Annex “A”<br><br></li><li> Power Plants Nos. 1 and 2<br><br>Fabrication Building<br>Various Fuel, Water Tanks and Pumps<br>Transformers<br>Annex “B”<br><br></li><li> Material Handling Equipment<br><br>Paper Plant No. 3</li></ol></blockquote><br>A <b>Second Supplemental Indenture to the 26 August 1992 MTI </b>was executed on 7 June 1994 to increase the amount of the loan from P280,000,000.00 to P408,900,000.00 secured against the existing properties composed of land, building, machineries and equipments and inventories described in Annexes “A” and “B.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Finally, a <b>Third Supplemental Indenture to the 26 August 1992 MTI </b>was executed on 24 January 1995 to increase the existing loan obligation of P408,900,000.00 to P555,000,000.00 with an additional security composed of a newly constructed two-storey building and other improvements, machineries and equipments located in the existing plant site.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Paper City was able to comply with its loan obligations until July 1997.&nbsp; But economic crisis ensued which made it difficult for Paper City to meet the terms of its obligations leading to payment defaults.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Consequently, RCBC filed a <b>Petition for Extrajudicial Foreclosure Under Act No. 3135 Against the Real Estate Mortgage executed by Paper City on 21 October 1998</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>&nbsp;

Paper City then had an outstanding obligation with the creditor banks adding up to Nine Hundred One Million Eight Hundred One Thousand Four Hundred Eighty-Four and 10/100 Pesos (P901,801,484.10), inclusive of interest and penalty charges.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>A <b>Certificate of Sale</b> was executed on <b>8 February 1999 </b>certifying that the eight (8) parcels of land with improvements thereon were sold on 27 November 1998 in the amount of Seven Hundred Two Million Three Hundred Fifty-One Thousand Seven Hundred Ninety-Six Pesos and 28/100 (P702,351,796.28) in favor of the creditor banks RCBC, Union Bank and Metrobank as the highest bidders.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>This foreclosure sale prompted Paper City to file a Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> docketed as Civil Case No. 164-V-99 on 15 June 1999 against the creditor banks alleging that the extra-judicial sale of the properties and plants was null and void due to lack of prior notice and attendance of gross and evident bad faith on the part of the creditor banks.&nbsp; In the alternative, it prayed that in case the sale is declared valid, to render the whole obligation of Paper City as fully paid and extinguished.&nbsp; Also prayed for was the return of P5,000,000.00 as excessive penalty and the payment of damages and attorney’s fees.<br><br>In the meantime, Paper City and Union Bank entered into a Compromise Agreement which was later approved by the trial court on 19 November 2001.&nbsp; It was agreed that the share of Union Bank in the proceeds of the foreclosure shall be up to 34.23% of the price and the remaining possible liabilities of Paper City shall be condoned by the bank.&nbsp; Paper City likewise waived all its claim and counter charges against Union Bank and agreed to turn-over its proportionate share over the property within 120 days from the date of agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, the negotiations between the other creditor banks and Paper City remained pending.&nbsp; During the interim, Paper City filed with the trial court a Manifestation with Motion to Remove and/or Dispose Machinery on 18 December 2002 reasoning that the [machineries] located inside the foreclosed land and building were deteriorating.&nbsp; It posited that since the machineries were not included in the foreclosure of the real estate mortgage, it is appropriate that it be removed from the building and sold to a third party.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Acting on the said motion, the trial court, on 28 February 2003 issued an Order denying the prayer and ruled that the machineries and equipments were included in the annexes and form part of the MTI dated 26 August 1992 as well as its subsequent amendments.&nbsp; Further, the machineries and equipments are covered by the Certificate of Sale issued as a consequence of foreclosure, the certificate stating that the <b>properties described therein with improvements thereon were sold to creditor banks [to the defendants]&nbsp; at public auction</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Paper City filed its Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> on 4 April 2003 which was <b>favorably granted</b> by the trial court in its <b>Order dated 15 August 2003</b>.&nbsp; The court justified the reversal of its order on the finding that the disputed machineries and equipments are chattels by agreement of the parties through their inclusion in the four (4) Deeds of Chattel Mortgage dated 28 January 1990, 19 July 1990, 28 June 1991 and 28 November 1991.&nbsp; It further ruled that the deed of cancellation executed by RCBC on 25 August 1992 was not valid because it was done unilaterally and without the consent of Paper City and the cancellation only refers to the merchandise/stocks-in-trade and not to machineries and equipments.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>RCBC in turn filed its Motion for Reconsideration to persuade the court to reverse its 15 August 2003 Order.&nbsp; However, the same was denied by the trial court through its 1 December 2003 Order reiterating the finding and conclusion of the previous Order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Aggrieved, RCBC filed with the CA a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 to annul the Orders dated 15 August 2003 and 1 December 2003 of the trial court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> for the reasons that:<br><br><blockquote><ol type="I"><li>[Paper City] gave its conformity to consider the subject machineries and equipment as real properties when the president and Executive Vice President of Paper City signed the Mortgage Trust Indenture as well as its subsequent amendments and all pages of the annexes thereto which itemized all properties that were mortgaged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br></li><li>Under Section 8 of Act No. 1508, otherwise known as “The Chattel Mortgage Law” the consent of the mortgagor (Paper City) is not required in order to cancel a chattel mortgage.&nbsp; Thus the “Cancellation of Deed of Continuing Chattel Mortgage on Inventory of Merchandise/Stocks-in-Trade” dated August 25, 1992 is valid and binding on the [Paper City] even assuming that it was executed unilaterally by petitioner RCBC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br></li><li>The four (4) Deeds of Chattel Mortgage that were attached as Annexes “A” to “D” to the December 18, 2003 “Manifestation with Motion to Remove and/or Dispose of Machinery” were executed from January 8, 1990 until November 28, 1991.&nbsp; On the other hand, the “Cancellation of Deed of Continuing Chattel Mortgage” was executed on August 25, 1992 while the MTI and the subsequent supplemental amendments thereto were executed from August 26, 1992 until January 24, 1995.&nbsp; It is of the contention of RCBC that [Paper City’s] unreasonable delay of ten (10) years in assailing that the disputed machineries and equipments were personal amounted to estoppel and ratification of the characterization that the same were real properties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br></li><li>The removal of the subject machineries or equipment is not among the reliefs prayed for by the [Paper City] in its June 11, 1999 Complaint.&nbsp; The [Paper City] sought the removal of the subject machineries and equipment only when it filed its December 18, 2002 Manifestation with Motion to Remove and/or Dispose of Machinery.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br></li><li>[Paper City] did not specify in its various motions filed with the respondent judge the subject machineries and equipment that are allegedly excluded from the extrajudicial foreclosure sale.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br></li><li>The machineries and equipments mentioned in the four (4) Deeds of Chattel Mortgage that were attached on the Manifestation with Motion to Remove and/or Dispose of Machinery are the same machineries and equipments included in the MTI and supplemental amendments, hence, are treated by agreement of the parties as real properties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></li></ol></blockquote><br>In its Comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Paper City refuted the claim of RCBC that it gave its consent to consider the machineries and equipments as real properties.&nbsp; It alleged that the disputed properties remained within the purview of the existing chattel mortgages which in fact were acknowledged by RCBC in the MTI particularly in Section 11.07 which reads:<br><br><blockquote>Section 11.07.&nbsp; This INDENTURE in respect of the MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS in the additional amount not exceeding TWO HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION SIX HUNDRED FIFTEEN THOUSAND PESOS (P220,615,000.00) shall be registered with the Register of Deeds of Valenzuela, Metro Manila, apportioned based on the corresponding loanable value of the MORTGAGED PROPERTIES, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">a.

Chattel Mortgage – P13,800,000.00<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></div></blockquote><br>Paper City argued further that the subject machineries and equipments were not included in the foreclosure of the mortgage on real properties particularly the eight (8) parcels of land.&nbsp; Further, the Certificate of Sale of the Foreclosed Property referred only to “lands and improvements” without any specification and made no mention of the inclusion of the subject properties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>In its Reply,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> RCBC admitted that there was indeed a provision in the MTI mentioning a chattel mortgage in the amount of P13,800,000.00.&nbsp; However, it justified that its inclusion in the MTI was merely for the purpose of ascertaining the amount of the loan to be extended to Paper City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> It reiterated its position that the machineries and equipments were no longer treated as chattels but already as real properties following the MTI.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>On 8 March 2005, the CA affirmed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> the challenged orders of the trial court.

Where the written terms of the contract are not ambiguous and can only be read one way, the court will interpret the contract as a matter of law. x x x</blockquote><br>Then till now the pronouncement has been that if the language used is as clear as day and readily understandable by any ordinary reader, there is no need for construction. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>The case at bar is covered by the rule.<br><br>The plain language and literal interpretation of the MTIs must be applied.&nbsp; The petitioner, other creditor banks and Paper City intended from the very first execution of the indentures that the machineries and equipments enumerated in Annexes “A” and “B” are included.&nbsp; Obviously, with the continued increase in the amount of the loan, totaling hundreds of millions of pesos, Paper City had to offer all valuable properties acceptable to the creditor banks.<br><br>The plain and obvious inclusion in the mortgage of the machineries and equipments of Paper City escaped the attention of the CA which, instead, turned to another “plain language of the MTI” that “described the same as personal properties.”&nbsp; It was error for the CA to deduce from the “description” exclusion from the mortgage.<br><br>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; The MTIs did <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> describe the equipments and machineries as personal property.&nbsp; Had the CA looked into Annexes “A” and “B” which were referred to by the phrase “real and personal properties,” it could have easily noted that the captions describing the listed properties were “Buildings,” “Machineries and Equipments,” “Yard and Outside,” and “Additional Machinery and Equipment.”&nbsp; No mention in any manner was made in the annexes about “personal property.”&nbsp; Notably, while “personal” appeared in the granting clause of the original MTI, the subsequent Deed of Amendment specifically stated that:<br><br><blockquote>x x x The machineries and equipment listed in Annexes “A” and “B” form part of the improvements listed above and located on the parcels of land&nbsp;&nbsp; subject of the Mortgage Trust Indenture and the Real Estate Mortgage.</blockquote><br>The word “personal” was deleted in the corresponding granting clauses in the Deed of Amendment and in the First, Second and Third Supplemental Indentures.<br><br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Law and jurisprudence provide and guide that even if not expressly so stated, the mortgage extends to the improvements.<br><br>Article 2127 of the Civil Code provides:<br><br><blockquote>Art. 2127. The mortgage <u>extends</u> to the natural accessions, to the <u>improvements</u>, growing fruits, and the rents or income not yet received when the obligation becomes due, and to the amount of the indemnity granted or owing to the proprietor from the insurers of the property mortgaged, or in virtue of expropriation for public use, with the declarations, amplifications and limitations established by law, whether the estate remains in the possession of the mortgagor, or it passes into the hands of a third person. (Underlining ours)</blockquote><br>In the early case of <i>Bischoff v. Pomar and Cia. General de Tabacos</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> the Court ruled that even if the machinery in question was not included in the mortgage expressly, Article 111 of the [old] Mortgage Law provides that chattels permanently located in a building, either useful or ornamental, or for the service of some industry even though they were placed there after the creation of the mortgage shall be considered as mortgaged with the estate, provided they belong to the owner of said estate. The provision of the old Civil Code was cited.&nbsp; Thus:<br><br><blockquote>Article 1877 provides that a mortgage includes the natural accessions, improvements, growing fruits, and rents not collected when the obligation is due, and the amount of the indemnities granted or due the owner by the underwriters of the property mortgaged or by virtue of the exercise of eminent domain by reason of public utility, with the declarations, amplifications, and limitations established by law, in case the estate continues in the possession of the person who mortgaged it, as well as when it passes into the hands of a third person.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup></blockquote><br>The case of <i>Cu Unjieng e Hijos v. Mabalacat Sugar Co</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> relied on this provision. The issue was whether the machineries and accessories were included in the mortgage and the subsequent sale during public auction. This was answered in the affirmative by the Court when it ruled that the machineries were integral parts of said sugar central hence included following the principle of law that the accessory follows the principal.<br><br>Further, in the case of <i>Manahan v. Hon. Cruz</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup>&nbsp; this Court denied the prayer of Manahan to nullify the order of the trial court including the building in question in the writ of possession following the public auction of the parcels of land mortgaged to the bank.&nbsp; It upheld the inclusion by relying on the principles laid upon in <i>Bischoff v. Pomar and Cia. General de Tabacos</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> and <i>Cu Unjieng e Hijos v. Mabalacat Sugar Co.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>In <i>Spouses Paderes v.

Contrary to the finding of the CA, the Extra-Judicial Foreclosure of Mortgage includes the machineries and equipments of respondent.&nbsp; While captioned as a “Petition for Extra-Judicial Foreclosure of Real Estate Mortgage Under Act No. 3135 As Amended,” the averments state that the petition is based on “x x x the Mortgage Trust Indenture, the Deed of Amendment to the Mortgage Trust Indenture, the Second Supplemental Indenture to the Mortgage Trust Indenture, and the Third Supplemental Indenture to the Mortgage Trust Indenture (hereinafter collectively referred to as the Indenture) duly notarized and entered as x x x.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup>&nbsp; Noting that herein respondent has an outstanding obligation in the total amount of Nine Hundred One Million Eight Hundred One Thousand Four Hundred Eighty Four and 10/100 Pesos (P901,801,484.10), the petition for foreclosure prayed that a foreclosure proceedings “x x x on the aforesaid real properties, <u>including all improvements thereon covered by the real estate mortgage</u> be undertaken and the appropriate auction sale be conducted x x x.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>Considering that the Indenture which is the instrument of the mortgage that was foreclosed exactly states through the Deed of Amendment <u>that the machineries and equipments listed in Annexes “A” and “B” form part of the improvements listed and located on the parcels of land subject of the mortgage</u>, such machineries and equipments are surely part of the foreclosure of the “real estate properties, including all improvements thereon” as prayed for in the petition.<br><br>Indeed, the lower courts ought to have noticed the fact that the chattel mortgages adverted to were dated 8 January 1990, 19 July 1990, 28 June 1991 and 28 November 1991.&nbsp; The real estate mortgages which specifically included the machineries and equipments were <u>subsequent to</u> the chattel mortgages dated 26 August 1992, 20 November 1992, 7 June 1994 and 24 January 1995.&nbsp; Without doubt, the real estate mortgages superseded the earlier chattel mortgages.<br><br>The real estate mortgage over the machineries and equipments is even in full accord with the classification of such properties by the Civil Code of the Philippines as immovable property.&nbsp; Thus:<br><br><blockquote>Article 415.
