Hence, the instant petition.<br><br><center><b>The Issue Before the Court</b><br></center><br>The essential issue in this case is whether or not the CoA committed grave abuse of discretion in holding petitioners solidarily liable for the disallowed amount of P3,386,697.10.<br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b><br></center><br>At the outset, it must be emphasized that the CoA is endowed with enough latitude to determine, prevent, and disallow irregular, unnecessary, excessive, extravagant or unconscionable expenditures of government funds. It is tasked to be vigilant and conscientious in safeguarding the proper use of the government's, and ultimately the people's, property. The exercise of its general audit power is among the constitutional mechanisms that gives life to the check and balance system inherent in our form of government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>Corollary thereto, it is the general policy of the Court to sustain the decisions of administrative authorities, especially one which is constitutionally-created, such as the CoA, not only on the basis of the doctrine of separation of powers but also for their presumed expertise in the laws they are entrusted to enforce. Findings of administrative agencies are accorded not only respect but also finality when the decision and order are not tainted with unfairness or arbitrariness that would amount to grave abuse of discretion. It is only when the CoA has acted without or in excess of jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, that this Court entertains a petition questioning its rulings. There is grave abuse of discretion when there is an evasion of a positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law or to act in contemplation of law as when the judgment rendered is not based on law and evidence but on caprice, whim, and despotism.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> In this case, the Court finds no grave abuse of discretion on the part of the CoA in issuing the assailed Decisions as will be discussed below.<br><br>The CoA correctly pointed out that VSMMC, through its officials, should have been deeply involved in the implementation of the TNT Program as the hospital is a party to the MOA and, as such, has acted as custodian and disbursing agency of Cuenco’s PDAF.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Further, under the MOA executed between VSMMC and Cuenco, the hospital represented itself as “willing to cooperate/coordinate and monitor the implementation of a Medical Indigent Support Program.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> More importantly, it undertook to ascertain that “[a]ll payments and releases under [the] program x x x shall be made in accordance with existing government accounting and auditing rules and regulations.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> It is a standing rule that public officers who are custodians of government funds shall be liable for their failure to ensure that such funds are safely guarded against loss or damage, and that they are expended, utilized, disposed of or transferred in accordance with the law and existing regulations, and on the basis of prescribed documents and necessary records.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> However, as pointed out by the SAT, provisions of the National Budget Circular No. (NBC) 476<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> dated September 20, 2001 prescribing the guidelines on the release of funds for a congressman’s PDAF authorized under Republic Act No. 8760<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> were not followed in the implementation of the TNT Program, as well as other existing auditing laws, rules and regulations governing the procurement of medicines.<br><br>In particular, the TNT Program was not implemented by the appropriate implementing agency, <i>i.e.</i>, the Department of Health, but by the office set up by Cuenco. Further, the medicines purchased from Dell Pharmacy did not go through the required public bidding in violation of the applicable procurement laws and rules.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Similarly, specific provisions of the MOA itself setting standards for the implementation of the same program were not observed. For instance, only seven of the 133 prescriptions served and paid were within the maximum limit of P5,000.00 that an indigent patient can avail of from Cuenco’s PDAF. Also, several indigent patients availed of the benefits more than once, again in violation of the provisions of the MOA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Clearly, by allowing the TNT Office and the staff of Cuenco to take over the entire process of availing of the benefits of the TNT Program without proper monitoring and observance of internal control safeguards, the hospital and its accountable officers reneged on their undertaking under the MOA to “cooperate/coordinate and monitor” the implementation of the said health program. They likewise violated paragraph 5<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> of NBC 476 which requires a “regular monitoring activity” of all programs and projects funded by the PDAF, as well as Sections 123<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> and 124<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> of Presidential Decree No. 1445,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> otherwise known as the “Government Auditing Code of the Philippines” (Auditing Code), which mandates the installation, implementation, and monitoring of a “sound system of internal control” to safeguard assets and check the accuracy and reliability of the accounting data.<br><br>By way of defense, petitioners nonetheless argue that VSMMC was merely a passive entity in the disbursement of funds under the TNT Program and, thus, invoke good faith in the performance of their respective duties, capitalizing on the failure of the assailed Decisions of the CoA to show that their lapses in the implementation of the TNT Program were attended by malice or bad faith.<br><br>The Court is not persuaded.<br><br>Jurisprudence holds that, absent any showing of bad faith and malice, there is a presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties. However, this presumption must fail in the presence of an explicit rule that was violated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> For instance, in <i>Reyna v. CoA</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> (<i>Reyna</i>), the Court affirmed the liability of the public officers therein, notwithstanding their proffered claims of good faith, since their actions violated an explicit rule in the Landbank of the Philippines’ Manual on Lending Operations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> In similar regard, the Court, in <i><i>Casal</i> v. CoA</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> (<i>Casal</i>), sustained the liability of certain officers of the National Museum who again, notwithstanding their good faith participated in approving and authorizing the incentive award granted to its officials and employees in violation of Administrative Order Nos. 268 and 29 which prohibit the grant of productivity incentive benefits or other allowances of similar nature unless authorized by the Office of the President.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> In <i>Casal</i>, it was held that, even if the grant of the incentive award was not for a dishonest purpose, the patent disregard of the issuances of the President and the directives of the CoA amounts to gross negligence, making the [“approving officers”] liable for the refund [of the disallowed incentive award].<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>Just as the foregoing public officers in <i>Reyna</i> and <i>Casal</i> were not able to dispute their respective violations of the applicable rules in those cases, the Court finds that the petitioners herein have equally failed to make a case justifying their non-observance of existing auditing rules and regulations, and of their duties under the MOA. Evidently, petitioners’ neglect to properly monitor the disbursement of Cuenco's PDAF facilitated the validation and eventual payment of 133 falsified prescriptions and fictitious claims for anti-rabies vaccines supplied by both the VSMMC and Dell Pharmacy, despite the patent irregularities borne out by the referral slips and prescriptions related thereto.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> Had there been an internal control system installed by petitioners, the irregularities would have been exposed, and the hospital would have been prevented from processing falsified claims and unlawfully disbursing funds from the said PDAF. Verily, petitioners cannot escape liability for failing to monitor the procedures implemented by the TNT Office on the ground that Cuenco always reminded them that it was his money.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> Neither may deviations, from the usual procedure at the hospital, such as the admitted bypassing of the VSMMC social worker in the qualification of the indigent-beneficiaries,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> be justified as “a welcome relief to the already overworked and undermanned section of the hospital.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>In this relation, it bears stating that Delos Santos’ argument that the practices of the TNT Office were already pre-existing when she assumed her post and that she found no reason to change the same<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> remains highly untenable. Records clearly reveal that she, in fact, admitted that when she was installed as the new Medical Center Chief of VSMMC sometime “in the late 2003,” Antoni disclosed to her the irregularities occurring in the hospital specifically on pre-signed and forged prescriptions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> Hence, having known this significant information, she and Antoni should have probed into the matter further, and, likewise, have taken more stringent measures to correct the situation. Instead, Delos Santos contented herself with giving oral instructions to resident doctors, training officers, and Chiefs of Clinics not to leave pre-signed prescriptions pads, which Antoni allegedly followed during the orientations for new doctors.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> But, just the same, the falsification and forgeries continued, and it was only a year after, or in December 2004, that Delos Santos ordered a formal investigation of the attendant irregularities. By then, too much damage had already been done.<br><br>All told, petitioners’ acts and/or omissions as detailed in the assailed CoA issuances<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> and as aforedescribed reasonably figure into the finding that they failed to faithfully discharge their respective duties and to exercise the required diligence which resulted to the irregular disbursements from Cuenco’s PDAF. In this light, their liability pursuant to Sections 104<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> and 105<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> of the Auditing Code, as well as Section 16 of the 2009 Rules and Regulations on Settlement of Accounts,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> as prescribed in CoA Circular No. 2009-006, must perforce be upheld. Truly, the degree of their neglect in handling Cuenco’s PDAF and the resulting detriment to the public cannot pass unsanctioned, else the standard of public accountability be loosely protected and even rendered illusory.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is hereby <b>DISMISSED</b>.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Sereno, C.J., Carpio, Velasco, Jr., Leonardo-De Castro, Brion, Peralta, Bersamin, Del Castillo, Abad, Villarama, Jr., Perez, Mendoza, Reyes,</i> and <i>Leonen, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>, pp. 2-48.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Id. at 50-67.
