Section 8<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> of the said law provides that the capital of the BCDA will be provided from sales proceeds or transfers of lots in nine (9) military camps in Metro Manila, including 723 has. of Fort Bonifacio.

They claim that they have been occupying the area for thirty (30) years “in the concept of owners continuously, exclusively and notoriously for several years,” and have built their houses of sturdy materials thereon and introduced paved roads, drainage and recreational and religious facilities. Dream Village, thus, asserts that the lot is not among those transferred to the BCDA under R.A. No. 7227, and therefore patent applications by the occupants should be processed by the Land Management Bureau (LMB).<br><br>On August 15, 2000, Dream Village formalized its complaint by filing an Amended Petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> in the COSLAP.

No. 7227. It argued that under Executive Order (E.O.) No. 561 which created the COSLAP, its task is merely to coordinate the various government offices and agencies involved in the settlement of land problems or disputes, adding that BCDA does not fall in the enumeration in Section 3 of E.O. No. 561, it being neither a pastureland-lease holder, a timber concessionaire, or a government reservation grantee, but the holder of patrimonial government property which cannot be the subject of a petition for classification, release or subdivision by the occupants of Dream Village.<br><br>In its Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> dated April 28, 2004, the COSLAP narrated that it called a mediation conference on March 22, 2001, during which the parties agreed to have a relocation/verification survey conducted of the subject lot. On April 4, 2001, the COSLAP wrote to the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR)-Community Environment and Natural Resources Office-NCR requesting the survey, which would also include Swo-00-0001302, covering the adjacent AFP-RSBS Industrial Park established by Proclamation No. 1218 on May 8, 1998 as well as the abandoned Circumferential Road 5 (C-5 Road).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>On April 1, 2004, the COSLAP received the final report of the verification survey and a blueprint copy of the survey plan from Atty. Rizaldy Barcelo, Regional Technical Director for Lands of DENR. Specifically, Item No. 3 of the DENR report states:<br><br><blockquote><b>3. Lot-1, Swo-000298 is inside Proclamation 172. Dream Village Neighborhood Association, Inc. is outside Lot-1, Swo-13-000298 and inside Lot-10, 11 &amp; Portion of Lot 13, Swo-00-0001302 with an actual area of 78,466 square meters. Likewise, the <u>area actually is outside Swo-00-0001302 of BCDA</u>.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><b> (Emphasis ours and underscoring supplied)</b></blockquote><br><center><b>COSLAP Ruling</b></center><br>On the basis of the DENR’s verification survey report, the COSLAP resolved that Dream Village lies outside of BCDA, and particularly, outside of Swo-00-0001302, and thus directed the LMB of the DENR to process the applications of Dream Village’s members for sales patent, noting that in view of the length of time that they “have been openly, continuously and notoriously occupying the subject property in the concept of an owner, x x x they are qualified to apply for sales patent on their respective occupied lots pursuant to R.A. Nos. 274 and 730 in relation to the provisions of the Public Land Act.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>On the question of its jurisdiction over the complaint, the COSLAP cited the likelihood that the summary eviction by the BCDA of more than 2,000 families in Dream Village could stir up serious social unrest, and maintained that Section 3(2) of E.O. No. 561 authorizes it to<i> “assume jurisdiction and resolve land problems or disputes which are critical and explosive in nature considering, for instance, the large number of parties involved, the presence or emergence of social tension or unrest, or other similar critical situations requiring immediate action,” </i>even as Section 3(2)(d) of E.O. No. 561 also allows it to take cognizance of <i>“petitions for classification, release and/or subdivision of lands of the public domain,”</i> exactly the ultimate relief sought by Dream Village. Rationalizing that it was created precisely to provide a more effective mechanism for the expeditious settlement of land problems “in general,” the COSLAP invoked as its authority the 1990 case of <i>Bañaga v. COSLAP</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> where this Court said:<br><br><blockquote>It is true that Executive Order No. 561 provides that the COSLAP may take cognizance of cases which are “critical and explosive in nature considering, for instance, the large number of parties involved, the presence or emergence of social tension or unrest, or other similar critical situations requiring immediate action.” However, the use of the word “may” does not mean that the COSLAP’s jurisdiction is merely confined to the above mentioned cases. The provisions of the said Executive Order are clear that the COSLAP was created as a means of providing a more effective mechanism for the expeditious settlement of land problems in general, which are frequently the source of conflicts among settlers, landowners and cultural minorities. Besides, the COSLAP merely took over from the abolished PACLAP whose functions, including its jurisdiction, power and authority to act on, decide and resolve land disputes (Sec. 2, P.D. No. 832) were all assumed by it. The said Executive Order No. 561 containing said provision, being enacted only on September 21, 1979, cannot affect the exercise of jurisdiction of the PACLAP Provincial Committee of Koronadal on September 20, 1978. Neither can it affect the decision of the COSLAP which merely affirmed said exercise of jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></blockquote><br>In its Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> filed on May 20, 2004, the BCDA questioned the validity of the survey results since it was conducted without its representatives present, at the same time denying that it received a notification of the DENR verification survey.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> It maintained that there is no basis for the COSLAP’s finding that the members of Dream Village were in open, continuous, and adverse possession in the concept of owner, because not only is the property not among those declared alienable and disposable, but it is a titled patrimonial property of the State.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>In the Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> dated June 17, 2004, the COSLAP denied BCDA’s Motion for Reconsideration, insisting that it had due notice of the verification survey, while also noting that although the BCDA wanted to postpone the verification survey due to its tight schedule, it actually stalled the survey when it failed to suggest an alternative survey date to ensure its presence.<br><br><center><b>CA Ruling</b></center><br>On Petition for Review<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> to the CA, the BCDA argued that the dispute is outside the jurisdiction of the COSLAP because of the land’s history of private ownership and because it is registered under an indefeasible Torrens title<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>; that Proclamation No. 172 covers only Lots 1 and 2 of Swo-13-000298 in Western Bicutan, whereas Dream Village occupies Lots 10, 11 and part of 13 of Swo-00-0001302, which also belongs to the BCDA<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>; that the COSLAP resolution is based on an erroneous DENR report stating that Dream Village is outside of BCDA, because Lots 10, 11, and portion of Lot 13 of Swo-00-0001302 are within the BCDA<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>; that the COSLAP was not justified in ignoring BCDA’s request to postpone the survey to the succeeding year because the presence of its representatives in such an important verification survey was indispensable for the impartiality of the survey aimed at resolving a highly volatile situation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>; that the COSLAP is a mere coordinating administrative agency with limited jurisdiction<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>; and, that the present case is not among those enumerated in Section 3 of E.O. No. 561<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>.<br><br>The COSLAP, on the other hand, maintained that Section 3(2)(e) of E.O. No. 561 provides that it may assume jurisdiction and resolve land problems or disputes in “other similar land problems of grave urgency and magnitude,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> and the present case is one such problem.<br><br>The CA in its Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> dated September 10, 2009 ruled that the COSLAP has no jurisdiction over the complaint because the question of whether Dream Village is within the areas declared as available for disposition in Proclamation No. 172 is beyond its competence to determine, even as the land in dispute has been under a private title since 1906, and presently its title is held by a government agency, the BCDA, in contrast to the case of Bañaga relied upon by Dream Village, where the disputed land was part of the public domain and the disputants were applicants for sales patent thereto.<br><br>Dream Village’s motion for reconsideration was denied in the appellate court’s Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> of July 13, 2010.<br><br><center><b>Petition for Review in the Supreme Court</b></center><br>On petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> to this Court, Dream Village interposes the following issues:<br><br><blockquote><center>A</center><br>IN ANNULLING THE RESOLUTION OF COSLAP IN COSLAP CASE NO. 99-500, THE HONORABLE [CA] DECIDED THE CASE IN A MANNER NOT CONSISTENT WITH LAW AND APPLICABLE DECISIONS OF THIS HONORABLE COURT;<br><br><center>B</center><br>THE HONORABLE [CA] ERRED IN RULING THAT COSLAP HAD NO JURISDICTION OVER THE CONTROVERSY BETWEEN THE PARTIES HEREIN[.]<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br></blockquote><br><center><b>The Court’s Ruling</b></center><br>We find no merit in the petition.<br><br><b>The BCDA holds title to Fort Bonifacio.</b><br><br>That the BCDA has title to Fort Bonifacio has long been decided with finality. In <i>Samahan ng Masang Pilipino sa Makati, Inc. v. BCDA</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> it was categorically ruled as follows:<br><br><blockquote>First, it is unequivocal that the Philippine Government, and now the BCDA, has title and ownership over Fort Bonifacio. The case of <i>Acting Registrars of Land Titles and Deeds of Pasay City, Pasig and Makati</i> is final and conclusive on the ownership of the then <i>Hacienda de</i> Maricaban estate by the Republic of the Philippines. Clearly, the issue on the ownership of the subject lands in Fort Bonifacio is laid to rest. Other than their view that the USA is still the owner of the subject lots, petitioner has not put forward any claim of ownership or interest in them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br></blockquote><br>The facts in <i>Samahan ng Masang Pilipino sa Makati</i> are essentially not much different from the controversy below. There, 20,000 families were long-time residents occupying 98 has. of Fort Bonifacio in Makati City, who vainly sought to avert their eviction and the demolition of their houses by the BCDA upon a claim that the land was owned by the USA under TCT No. 2288. The Supreme Court found that TCT No. 2288 had in fact been cancelled by TCT No. 61524 in the name of the Republic, which title was in turn cancelled on January 3, 1995 by TCT Nos. 23888, 23887, 23886, 22460, 23889, 23890, and 23891, all in the name of the BCDA. The Court ruled that the BCDA’s aforesaid titles over Fort Bonifacio are valid, indefeasible and beyond question, since TCT No. 61524 was cancelled in favor of BCDA pursuant to an explicit authority under R.A. No. 7227, the legal basis for BCDA’s takeover and management of the subject lots.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br><b>Dream Village sits on the abandoned C-5 Road, which lies outside the area declared in Proclamation Nos. 2476 and 172 as alienable and disposable.</b><br><br>Pursuant to Proclamation No. 2476, the following surveys were conducted by the Bureau of Lands to delimit the boundaries of the areas excluded from the coverage of Proclamation No. 423:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="35%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Barangay Survey</div></td> <td width="30%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Plan</div></td> <td width="35%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Date Approved</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">1.

For this reason, it was necessary to amend Proclamation No. 2476. Thus, in Proclamation No. 172 only Lots 1 and 2 of Swo-13-000298 are declared alienable and disposable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>The DENR verification survey report states that Dream Village is not situated in Lot 1 of Swo-13-000298 but actually occupies Lots 10, 11 and part of 13 of Swo-00-0001302: <i>“x x x [Dream Village] is outside Lot1, SWO-<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>-000298 and inside Lot 10, 11 &amp; portion of Lot 13, SWO-<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[00]</sup>-0001302 with an actual area of 78466 square meters. The area is actually is [sic] outside SWO-00-0001302 of BCDA.”</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Inexplicably and gratuitously, the DENR also states that the area is outside of BCDA, completely oblivious that the BCDA holds title over the entire Fort Bonifacio, even as the BCDA asserts that Lots 10, 11 and 13 of SWO-00-0001302 are part of the abandoned right-of-way of C-5 Road. This area is described as lying north of Lot 1 of Swo-13-000298 and of Lots 3, 4, 5 and 6 of Swo-13-000298 (Western Bicutan) inside the <i>Libingan ng mga Bayani</i>, and the boundary line of Lot 1 mentioned as C-5 Road is really the proposed alignment of C-5 Road, which was abandoned when, as constructed, it was made to traverse northward into the <i>Libingan ng mga Bayani.</i> Dream Village has not disputed this assertion.<br><br>The mere fact that the original plan for C-5 Road to cross Swo-00-0001302 was abandoned by deviating it northward to traverse the southern part of <i>Libingan ng mga Bayani </i>does not signify abandonment by the government of the bypassed lots, nor that these lots would then become alienable and disposable. They remain under the title of the BCDA, even as it is significant that under Section 8(d) of R.A. No. 7227, a relocation site of 30.5 has. was to be reserved for families affected by the construction of C-5 Road. It is nowhere claimed that Lots 10, 11 and 13 of Swo-00-0001302 are part of the said relocation site. These lots border C-5 Road in the south,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> making them commercially valuable to BCDA, a farther argument against a claim that the government has abandoned them to Dream Village.<br><br><b><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="TOP" width="40%"><div align="JUSTIFY"><b>While property of the State or any of its subdivisions patrimonial in character may be the object of prescription, those “intended for some public service or for the development of the national wealth” are considered property of public dominion and therefore not susceptible to acquisition by prescription.</b></div></td> <td width="60%">&nbsp;</td> </tr> </tbody></table></b><br>Article 1113 of the Civil Code provides that “property of the State or any of its subdivisions not patrimonial in character shall not be the object of prescription.” Articles 420 and 421 identify what is property of public dominion and what is patrimonial property:<br><br><blockquote>Art. 420.

However, it was also clarified that the said lands did not thereby become patrimonial, since the BCDA law makes the express reservation that they are to be sold in order to raise funds for the conversion of the former American bases in Clark and Subic. The Court noted that the purpose of the law can be tied to either “public service” or “the development of national wealth” under Article 420(2) of the Civil Code, such that the lands remain property of the public dominion, albeit their status is now alienable and disposable. The Court then explained that it is only upon their sale to a private person or entity as authorized by the BCDA law that they become private property and cease to be property of the public dominion:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br><blockquote>For as long as the property belongs to the State, although already classified as alienable or disposable, it remains property of the public dominion if when it is “intended for some public service or for the development of the national wealth.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup></blockquote><br>Thus, under Article 422 of the Civil Code, public domain lands become patrimonial property only if there is a declaration that these are alienable or disposable, together with an express government manifestation that the property is already patrimonial or no longer retained for public service or the development of national wealth. Only when the property has become patrimonial can the prescriptive period for the acquisition of property of the public dominion begin to run. Also under Section 14(2) of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1529, it is provided that before acquisitive prescription can commence, the property sought to be registered must not only be classified as alienable and disposable, it must also be expressly declared by the State that it is no longer intended for public service or the development of the national wealth, or that the property has been converted into patrimonial. Absent such an express declaration by the State, the land remains to be property of public dominion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>Since the issuance of Proclamation No. 423 in 1957, vast portions of the former <i>Maricaban </i>have been legally disposed to settlers, besides those segregated for public or government use.

Put any way, it is a delay in the assertion of a right which works disadvantage to another because of the inequity founded on some change in the condition or relations of the property or parties.

It would have been more prudent if the COSLAP has [sic] just referred the controversy to the proper forum in order to fully thresh out the ramifications of the dispute at bar. As it is, the impugned Resolution is a patent nullity since the tribunal which rendered it lacks jurisdiction. Thus, the pronouncements contained therein are void.<i> “We have consistently ruled that a judgment for want of jurisdiction is no judgment at all.

But in Longino v. Atty. General,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> it was held that as an administrative agency, COSLAP’s jurisdiction is limited to cases specifically mentioned in its enabling statute, E.O. No. 561. The Supreme Court said:<br><br><blockquote>Administrative agencies, like the COSLAP, are tribunals of limited jurisdiction and, as such, could wield only such as are specifically granted to them by the enabling statutes. x x x.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Under the law, [E.O.

In resolving whether to assume jurisdiction over a case or to refer the same to the particular agency concerned, the COSLAP has to consider the nature or classification of the land involved, the parties to the case, the nature of the questions raised, and the need for immediate and urgent action thereon to prevent injuries to persons and damage or destruction to property. The law does not vest jurisdiction on the COSLAP over any land dispute or problem.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> (Citation omitted)</blockquote><br>The <i>Longino</i> ruling has been consistently cited in subsequent COSLAP cases, among them <i>Davao New Town Development Corp. v.

No. 561 to assume jurisdiction over “other similar land problems of grave urgency,” since the statutory construction principle of <i>ejusdem generis</i> prescribes that where general words follow an enumeration of persons or things, by words of a particular and specific meaning, such general words are not to be construed in their widest extent but are to be held as applying only to persons or things of the same kind as those specifically mentioned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> Following this rule, COSLAP’s jurisdiction is limited to disputes involving lands in which the government has a proprietary or regulatory interest,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> or public lands covered with a specific license from the government such as a pasture lease agreements, a timber concessions, or a reservation grants,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> and where moreover, the dispute is between occupants/squatters and pasture lease agreement holders or timber concessionaires; between occupants/squatters and government reservation grantees; and between occupants/squatters and public land claimants or applicants.<br><br>In<i> Longino</i>, the parties competed to lease a property of the Philippine National Railways. The high court rejected COSLAP’s jurisdiction, noting that the disputed lot is not public land, and neither party was a squatter, patent lease agreement holder, government reservation grantee, public land claimant or occupant, or a member of any cultural minority, nor was the dispute critical and explosive in nature so as to generate social tension or unrest, or a critical situation which required immediate action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br><br>In <i>Davao New Town Development Corp.,</i> it was held that the COSLAP has no concurrent jurisdiction with the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) in respect of disputes concerning the implementation of agrarian reform laws, since “[t]he grant of exclusive and primary jurisdiction over agrarian reform matters on the DAR implies that no other court, tribunal, or agency is authorized to resolve disputes properly cognizable by the DAR.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> Thus, instead of hearing and resolving the case, COSLAP should have simply referred private respondents’ complaint to the DAR or DARAB. According to the Court:<br><br><blockquote>The abovementioned proviso [Section (3)(2) of E.O. No. 561], which vests COSLAP the power to resolve land disputes, does not confer upon COSLAP blanket authority to assume every matter referred to it. Its jurisdiction is confined only to disputes over lands in which the government has proprietary or regulatory interest. Moreover, the land dispute in <i>Bañaga</i> involved parties with conflicting free patent applications which was within the authority of PACLAP to resolve, unlike that of the instant case which is exclusively cognizable by the DAR.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup></blockquote><br>In <i>Barranco</i>, COSLAP issued a writ to demolish structures encroaching into private property. The Supreme court ruled that COSLAP may resolve only land disputes “involving public lands or lands of the public domain or those covered with a specific license from the government such as a pasture lease agreement, a timber concession, or a reservation grant.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br><br>In <i>NHA</i>, it was held that COSLAP has no jurisdiction over a boundary dispute between two local government units, that its decision is an utter nullity correctible by <i>certiorari</i>, that it can never become final and any writ of execution based on it is void, and all acts performed pursuant to it and all claims emanating from it have no legal effect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup><br><br>In <i>Cayabyab</i>, it was held that “the jurisdiction of COSLAP does not extend to disputes involving the ownership of private lands, or those already covered by a certificate of title, as these fall exactly within the jurisdiction of the courts and other administrative agencies.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup><br><br>In <i>Ga, Jr.</i>, it was reiterated that the COSLAP has no jurisdiction over controversies relating to ownership and possession of private lands, and thus, the failure of respondents to properly appeal from the COSLAP decision before the appropriate court was held not fatal to the petition for certiorari that they eventually filed with the CA. The latter remedy remained available despite the lapse of the period to appeal from the void COSLAP decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup><br><br>In <i>Machado,</i> the high court ruled that COSLAP has no jurisdiction in disputes over private lands between private parties, reiterating the essential rules contained in Section 3 of E.O. No. 561 governing the exercise by COSLAP of its jurisdiction, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Under these terms, the COSLAP has two different rules in acting on a land dispute or problem lodged before it, <i>e.g</i>., COSLAP can assume jurisdiction only if the matter is one of those enumerated in paragraph 2(a) to (e) of the law. Otherwise, it should refer the case to the agency having appropriate jurisdiction for settlement or resolution. In resolving whether to assume jurisdiction over a case or to refer it to the particular agency concerned, the COSLAP considers: (a) the nature or classification of the land involved; (b) the parties to the case; (c) the nature of the questions raised; and (d) the need for immediate and urgent action thereon to prevent injury to persons and damage or destruction to property. The terms of the law clearly do not vest on the COSLAP the general power to assume jurisdiction over <i>any</i> land dispute or problem. Thus, under EO 561, the instances when the COSLAP may resolve land disputes are limited only to those involving public lands or those covered by a specific license from the government, such as pasture lease agreements, timber concessions, or reservation grants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote><br>In <i>Vda. de Herrera</i>, the COSLAP assumed jurisdiction over a complaint for “interference, disturbance, unlawful claim, harassment and trespassing” over a private parcel of land. The CA ruled that the parties were estopped to question COSLAP’s jurisdiction since they participated actively in the proceedings. The Supreme Court, noting from the complaint that the case actually involved a claim of title and possession of private land, ruled that the RTC or the MTC has jurisdiction since the dispute did not fall under Section 3, paragraph 2 (a) to (e) of E.O. No. 561, was not critical and explosive in nature, did not involve a large number of parties, nor was there social tension or unrest present or emergent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, COSLAP has invoked <i>Bañaga</i> to assert its jurisdiction. There, Guillermo Bañaga had filed a free patent application with the Bureau of Lands over a public land with an area of 30 has. Gregorio Daproza (Daproza) also filed a patent application for the same property. The opposing claims and protests of the claimants remained unresolved by the Bureau of Lands, and neither did it conduct an investigation. Daproza wrote to the COSLAP, which then opted to exercise jurisdiction over the controversy. The high court sustained COSLAP, declaring that its jurisdiction is not confined to the cases mentioned in paragraph 2(a) to (e) of E.O. No. 561, but includes land problems in general, which are frequently the source of conflicts among settlers, landowners and cultural minorities.<br><br>But as the Court has since clarified in <i>Longino</i> and in the other cases aforecited, the land dispute in <i>Bañaga</i> was between private individuals who were free patent applicants over unregistered public lands. In contrast, the present petition involves land titled to and managed by a government agency which has been expressly reserved by law for a specific public purpose other than for settlement. Thus, as we have advised in <i>Longino</i>, the law does not vest jurisdiction on the COSLAP over any land dispute or problem, but it has to consider the nature or classification of the land involved, the parties to the case, the nature of the questions raised, and the need for immediate and urgent action thereon to prevent injuries to persons and damage or destruction to property.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the petition is DENIED.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED</b>.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Sereno, C.J., (Chairperson), Leonardo-De Castro, Bersamin, </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">Villarama, Jr., JJ</span>., concur.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo,</i> pp. 24-46.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Penned by Associate Justice Priscilla J.
