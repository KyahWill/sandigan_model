				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Subject of this petition for review is the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals in CA-GR. CR-H.C. No. 03433, dated 29 October 2009, affirming the Judgment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court of Naga City ( RTC), in Criminal Case No. 2004-0308. The trial court found petitioner Nelson Valleno <i>y</i> Lucito<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> guilty of violation of Section II of Article II, Republic Act No. 9165 and sentenced him to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and to pay a fine of Four Hundred Thousand Pesos (P400,000.00) <br><br>The Information charged petitioner of illegal possession of <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span>. It reads:<br><br><blockquote>That on or about the 12<sup>th</sup> day of March, 2004, in Barangay San Antonio, Milaor, Camarines Sur, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused, without any authority of law, did then and there, wilfully, unlawfully, and feloniously possess, control and have in custody nine (9) transparent plastic sachets, containing Methamphetamine Hydrochloride, locally known as “SHABU”, a prohibited drug, weighing no less than 34.7011 grams, with an estimated cost or market value of P69,402.20, to the great damage and prejudice of the Republic of the Philippines.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Upon arraignment, petitioner pleaded not guilty. Trial ensued.<br><br>Five police officers, two <i>barangay</i> officials and one forensic chemist testified for the prosecution.<br><br>P/Insp. Perfecto De Lima (P/Insp. De Lima) was the group director of the 504<sup>th</sup> Provincial Mobile Group located at Camarines Sur Police Provincial Office in Naga City. He ordered PO3 Jaime Villano (PO3 Villano) to conduct a surveillance in connection with the illegal drug trade of petitioner. PO3 Villano was tasked to conduct a test-buy operation. The specimen he obtained from petitioner was submitted to the Philippine National Police (PNP) Crime Laboratory, which, in turn, was tested positive for the presence of <i>shabu</i>. Subsequently, P/Insp. De Lima ordered SPO4 Romulo Fabiano (SPO4 Fabiano) to apply for a search warrant. Branch 24 of the RTC of Naga City issued Search Warrant No. 2004-006.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>In the early morning of 12 March 2004, P/Insp. De Lima organized two (2) teams to enforce the search warrant. SPO4 Feliciano was in charge of the security team, which was tasked to secure the area to be searched, while the search team composed of PO3 Villano, PO3 Emilio Edrano (PO3 Edrano) and PO2 Sergio Valenzuela (PO2 Valenzuela), were designated to search the target house in LRV Village, <i>Barangay</i> San Antonio, Milaor, Camarines Sur.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>At around 4:30 a.m., the group left the police station and proceeded to petitioner’s house. They arrived at 5:00 a.m. P/Insp. De Lima instructed PO3 Villano to coordinate with the <i>barangay</i> officials.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> At 6:00 a.m. and upon arrival of the two (2) <i>barangay</i> officials, SPO4 Fabiano knocked on the door of petitioner’s house. Petitioner opened the door located at the back of the house. PO3 Villano, who was armed with the search warrant, informed petitioner that his group would conduct a search inside the house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Before entering petitioner’s house, P/Insp. De Lima instructed the search team to raise their hands and shirts to show that they have nothing in their possession. P/Insp. De Lima explained that his purpose was to prevent any speculation that they intend to plant evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>The search team, together with the <i>barangay</i> officials, went inside the house, while P/Insp. De Lima, petitioner and his wife were waiting just outside the house. PO3 Edrano and PO2 Valenzuela started searching a cabinet located in the kitchen. PO3 Edrano stood up on a chair to look at the top portion of the cabinet while PO2 Valenzuela was searching the bottom part. PO3 Edrano saw a black Natel bag with a red stripe on it on top of the cabinet. He passed it to PO2 Valenzuela, who handed the bag over to PO3 Villano. PO3 Villano unzipped the bag and uncovered 3 different sizes of white plastic bags containing white granules. The bag also contained a weighing scale and a bamboo stick. Thereafter, he closed the bag and brought it outside to P/Insp. De Lima.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>PO3 Villano put his markings “JV” on the plastic sachets, the weighing scale and bamboo stick in the presence of the barangay officials. He likewise prepared the Inventory Receipt, which was signed by the <i>barangay </i>officials. Petitioner, however, refused to sign the Inventory Receipt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>After the search, petitioner was handcuffed and brought to the police station. PO3 Villano turned over the seized items to a certain PO3 Molina.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> While in the police station, PO3 Villano prepared the return of the search warrant. He then brought the Return of the Search Warrant, accompanied by the seized items, to the RTC of Naga City. The court ordered him to bring them to the PNP Crime Laboratory for examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Reynaldo Brito, a <i>barangay tanod</i>, testified that the police officers found one plastic sachet containing shabu underneath the bed of petitioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>&nbsp; Wilfredo Brito, another <i>barangay tanod</i>, corroborated the statements of the police officers that a black bag was taken from the top of the cabinet and that the black bag contained the seized items.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Josephine Macura Clemen (Clemen), a forensic chemist, was presented as an expert witness. She related that after taking a representative sample from the nine (9) plastic sachets seized from petitioner, they were tested positive for the presence of <i>Methamphetamine Hydrochloride</i> or <i>shabu</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Her findings were reflected in Chemistry Report No. D-052-04.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Petitioner interposed denial. He countered that around 6:00 a.m. of 12 March 2004, he heard a knock at the bedroom door.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> He opened the door and the policemen introduced themselves, showed him the search warrant and asked him to come out of the house while they searched it. After a while, the police officers emerged from the house and told him that they have found a <i>tawas</i>-like substance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> He refused to sign the inventory receipt because he did not understand the contents of the document. He was then brought to the police station.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>On 13 June 2008, the trial court rendered judgment finding petitioner guilty beyond reasonable doubt for illegal possession of <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span>. The dispositive portion reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered finding the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt for illegal possession of methamphetamine Hydrochloride or <i>shabu</i>, a dangerous drug, defined and penalized under Sec. 11(1)(1), Art. II of R.A. 9165, otherwise known as The Comprehensive Drugs Act of 2002, and hereby sentences him to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of Four Hundred Thousand pesos (P400,000.00).<br><br>The bail bond posted for the provisional liberty of the accused is hereby CANCELLED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br></blockquote><br>In convicting petitioner, the trial court lent credence to the straightforward testimonies of the police officers over the mere denial of the accused. The trial court ruled that the chain of custody over the illegal drugs seized was properly established.<br><br>On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed petitioner’s conviction on 29 October 2009 and denied petitioner’s motion for reconsideration on 13 April 2010. Petitioner now seeks relief before this Court via a petition for review. On 11 August 2010, this Court treated the petition as a notice of appeal and required the parties to file their respective supplemental briefs, if they so desire, within thirty days from notice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> The Office of the Solicitor General manifested that it would no longer file a supplemental brief.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Petitioner filed his supplemental brief and harped on the inconsistencies of the testimonies of prosecution witnesses.<br><br>In his petition for review, petitioner ascribes upon the Court of<br><br>Appeals the following errors:<br><br><blockquote><center>(A)</center><br>THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN NOT FINDING THAT THE PROSECUTION WAS NOT ABLE TO DISCHARGE ITS BURDEN OF PROVING BY PROOF BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT THAT PETITIONER HAS COMMITTED THE CRIME OF VIOLATION OF SECTION 11, ARTICLE II OF REPUBLIC ACT NO. 9165.<br><br><center>(B)</center><br>THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN INTERPRETING THAT THE REQUIREMENTS PROVIDED FOR UNDER SECTION 21 OF REPUBLIC ACT NO. 9165 ARE NOT MANDATORY AND THAT NON-COMPLIANCE THEREOF IS NOT FATAL TO THE CAUSE OF THE PROSECUTION.<br><br><center>(C)</center><br>THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN NOT FINDING THAT THE ALLEGED PROHIBITED DRUGS SUBJECT OF THE CASE WERE A PRODUCT OF AN IRREGULAR SEARCH AND SEIZURE.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br></blockquote><br>The primordial issue here, as in any criminal case, is whether the guilt of the accused has been established beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>It is hornbook doctrine that the factual findings of the appellate court affirming those of the trial court are binding on this Court unless there is a clear showing that such findings are tainted with arbitrariness, capriciousness or palpable error.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> After an exhaustive review of the records of this case, we see no sufficient reason for resort to the exception to the rule.<br><br>In order for prosecution for illegal possession of a dangerous drug to prosper, there must be proof that (1) the accused was in possession of an item or an object identified to be a prohibited or regulated drug, (2) such possession is not authorized by law, and (3) the accused was freely and consciously aware of being in possession of the drug.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>All these elements were duly established by the prosecution. During the search, PO3 Edrano found a bag on top of a cabinet inside the house of petitioner. He handed the same to PO3 Villano, who in turn opened it, and found nine (9) plastic sachets of <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span>, thus:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Q </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Where did you start searching the house? </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">We started at the cabinet.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Where is that cabinet located?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Inside his house in front of the dining table.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q </div></td> <td><p align="JUSTIFY">While you were starting to search the cabinet, do you know where your companions were at that time?</p></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Yes sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Where were they?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">The house of the accused was just a small house, so we were just back to back with each other.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">While you were searching the cabinet, at what particular part of the cabinet did you start?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">I started at the lower portion of the cabinet.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">What did you find at the lower portion of the cabinet?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"> <div align="JUSTIFY">ATTY.

It can also be inferred that petitioner was privy to the existence of the <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span>. Mere possession of a regulated drug <i>per se</i> constitutes <i>prima facie</i> evidence of knowledge or <i>animus possidendi </i>sufficient to convict an accused absent a satisfactory explanation of such possession – the <i>onus probandi </i>is shifted to the accused, to explain the absence of knowledge or <i>animus possidendi</i>. With the burden of evidence shifted to the petitioner, it was his duty to explain his innocence about the regulated drug seized from his possession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> This, petitioner failed to do.<br><br>The petitioner’s proposition that the prosecution failed to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt is anchored on his claim that the prosecution failed to prove and establish the chain of custody of the subject prohibited drugs allegedly seized from his house.<br><br>The dangerous drug itself constitutes the very <i>corpus delicti</i> of the offense and in sustaining a conviction under Republic Act No. 9165, the identity and integrity of the <i>corpus delicti </i>must definitely be shown to have been preserved. In other words, the evidence must definitely show that the illegal drug presented in court is the same illegal drug actually recovered from the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Section 21 of Republic Act No. 9165 provides the procedure to be followed in the seizure and custody of prohibited drugs, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Section 21. <i>Custody and Disposition of Confiscated, Seized, and/or Surrendered Dangerous Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous Drugs, Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, Instruments/Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment</i>. —&nbsp; The PDEA shall take charge and have custody of all dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, as well as instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment so confiscated, seized and/or surrendered, for proper disposition in the following manner:<br><br>(1) The apprehending team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof;<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The provisions of Article II, Section 21(a) of the Implementing<br><br>Rules and Regulations (IRR) of Republic Act No. 9165 provide:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(a) The apprehending officer/team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof: Provided, that the physical inventory and photograph shall be conducted at the place where the search warrant is served; or at the nearest police station or at the nearest office of the apprehending officer/team, whichever is practicable, in case of warrantless seizures; Provided, further, that non-compliance with these requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and invalid such seizures of and custody over said items[.]</blockquote><br>Petitioner highlights the following acts of non-compliance with the aforementioned rule: 1) there was failure to present the alleged photographs of the seized substance in court; 2) there were no representatives from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ) during the conduct of the inventory of the seized items; 3) there was a major contradiction from among prosecution witnesses on who actually brought the seized items to the PNP Crime Laboratory; and 4) the manner of conducting the physical inventory of the alleged drugs taken from petitioner’s house appeared to be irregular as the seized items were allowed to be handled by persons not authorized to do so.<br><br>The Implementing Rules of Republic Act No. 9165 offer some flexibility when a proviso added that “non-compliance with these requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and invalid such seizures of and custody over said items.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>In <i>People v. Concepcion</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> this Court ruled that the failure to submit in evidence the required physical inventory of the seized drugs and the photograph, as well as the absence of a member of media or the DOJ, pursuant to Section 21, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165 is not fatal and will not render an accused’s arrest illegal or the items seized/confiscated from him inadmissible.<br><br>What is of utmost importance is the preservation of the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items, as the same would be utilized in the determination of the guilt or innocence of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>In the instant case, the chain of custody of the seized illegal drugs was not broken. The prosecution established that PO3 Edrano recovered the white plastic sachets, later on confirmed positive for traces of <i>shabu</i>. PO3 Edrano handed them over to PO3 Villano, who made markings on the seized items and prepared an inventory of the same while inside petitioner’s house. It was also shown that PO3 Villano brought the seized illegal drugs to the police station where he himself prepared the inventory. While he presented the same to a certain PO3 Molina, it was still PO3 Villano and SPO4 Fabiano who first brought the seized illegal drugs to the court, who in turn ordered him to bring it to the PNP Crime Laboratory. In the letter request addressed to the forensic chemist, it was PO3 Villano who signed as the requesting party. Clearly therefore, the recovery and handling of the seized illegal drugs were more than satisfactorily established in this case.<br><br>This Court notes the inconsistencies in the testimonies of prosecution witnesses, particularly that of <i>barangay tanod</i> Reynaldo Brito and PO3 Molina, relating to the place where one of the plastic sachets was found and to the person who brought the illegal drugs to the crime laboratory, respectively. We however brush aside these inconsistencies as inconsequential. Indeed, one can hardly expect their testimonies to be in perfect agreement. As held in the past, it is perhaps too much to hope that different eyewitnesses shall give, at all times, testimonies that are in all fours with the realities on the ground. Minor discrepancies in their testimonies are, in fact, to be expected; they neither vitiate the essential integrity of the evidence in its material entirety nor reflect adversely on the credibility of witnesses. For a successful appeal, the inconsistencies brought up should pertain to that crucial moment when the accused was caught selling <i>shabu</i>, not to peripheral matters. Testimonies of witnesses need only corroborate each other on important and relevant details concerning the principal occurrence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>The inconsistent testimony of Reynaldo Brito deserves little weight in light of the consonant testimonies of all the police officers who testified in court. It is well-settled that the testimonies of the police officers in dangerous drugs cases carry with it the presumption of regularity in the performance of official functions. Absent any clear showing that the arresting officers had ill-motive to falsely testify against the petitioner, their testimonies must be respected and the presumption of regularity in the performance of their duties must be upheld. Petitioner himself testified that he never had any personal encounter with the police prior to his arrest, thus negating any ill-motive on the part of the police officers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Finally, there was nothing irregular in the conduct of search of petitioner’s house. There were variations in the witnesses’ testimonies as to whether petitioner was inside the house during the search. One witness testified that petitioner was coming in and out of the house during the search while the other witnesses claimed that petitioner was waiting just outside the house. Assuming that petitioner was indeed outside the house, it does not taint the regularity of the search. Section 8, Rule 126 of the Rules of Court allows the absence of the lawful occupant provided that two witnesses are present.<br><br><blockquote><b>Section 8</b>. <i>Search of house, room, or premises to be made in presence of two witnesses. </i>— No search of a house, room, or any other premises shall be made except in the presence of the lawful occupant thereof or any member of his family or in the absence of the latter, two witnesses of sufficient age and discretion residing in the same locality.<br></blockquote><br>The presence of the two <i>barangay </i>officials was not disputed by petitioner. As elucidated by the appellate court:<br><br><blockquote>As correctly found by the trial court, accused-appellant and his wife were not prevented from entering their house to observe the search conducted therein. This is bolstered by the testimonies of police officers. Thus, PO3 Villano testified on cross-examination that the wife of the accused was inside, watching x x x.&nbsp; Likewise. P/C Insp. Perfetco de Lima, Jr. Testified that the accused-appellant and his wife went in and out of their house while the team was conducting a search inside said house; that Valleno and his wife stood outside and sometimes, came in while the search was being conducted; and that before the search the Valleno spouses were requested not to go inside the house but during the search they kept going in and out of said house.&nbsp; In addition, the search was conducted in the presence of two witnesses of sufficient age and discretion residing in the same locality, in the persons or Brgy. Kgd. Reynaldo Brito and Chief Tanod Wilfredo Brito. Resultantly, the seized items cannot, therefore be considered as "fruits of the poisonous tree." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br></blockquote><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>.&nbsp; The assailed 29 October 2009 Decision and the 13 April 2010 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-GR.
