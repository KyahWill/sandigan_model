Tony Lao / Tony Ling (<i>Lao</i>), a Chinese inmate charged with violation of Republic Act No. 6425 (the Dangerous Drugs Act) was discovered to have escaped from his cell at the Makati City Jail.&nbsp; The following officers of the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (<i>BJMP</i>) – National Capital Region Office (<i>NCRO</i>) were on third shift custodial duty when Lao escaped: J/C INSP Pepe Quinones (<i>J/C INSP Quinones</i>); SJO2 Arvie Aquino JMP (<i>SJO2 Aquino</i>), officer of the day; SJO2 Arlic Almojuela JMP (<i>SJO2 Almojuela</i>), desk officer / supervisor; SJO1 Jose Rodney Lagahit JMP (<i>SJO1 Lagahit</i>), desk reliever; JO1 Eric Manuel Palileo (<i>JO1 Palileo</i>), duty nurse; JO1 Rommel Robles JMP (<i>JO1 Robles</i>), gater; JO1 Manuel Loyola, Jr. (JO1 Loyola), gater; JO1 Reynaldo Pascual JMP (<i>JO1 Pascual</i>), cell guard and JO1 Jaime Ibarra (<i>JO1 Ibarra</i>), roving guard.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>Based on testimonies cited in Civil Service Resolution No. 080701<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> and the Court of Appeals’ decision, the facts outlined below led to Lao’s escape.<br><br>At about 11:00 p.m., SJO2 Aquino made a headcount of the inmates in the Makati City Jail, ensured every cell was padlocked, and instructed SJO2 Almojuela (the desk officer on duty) to dispatch the personnel to their respective areas of responsibilities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Thirty minutes later, inmate Florencio Jacinto (<i>Jacinto</i>) saw Cabidoy, an inmate charged with opening and closing the cell gates, open Cell Number 8.&nbsp; Lao came out and Jacinto never saw him return to his cell.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Soon after Jacinto saw Lao walk out of Cell Number 8, JO1 Loyola (the gater at the Main Gate) saw Lao at the front desk talking to SJO2 Almojuela and JO1 Pascual.&nbsp; According to JO1 Loyola, SJO2 Almojuela ordered him and JO1 Pascual to buy food outside the jail premises.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>&nbsp; SJO1 Robles, another gater at the main gate, saw the two leave the compound at around 11:45PM.&nbsp; SJO1 Robles then saw Lao, Cabidoy and another inmate conversing at the Desk Area.&nbsp; SJO1 Robles were about to approach the three inmates to caution them, but upon seeing SJO1 Lagahit at the desk area, he went back to his post.&nbsp; JO1 Pascual and JO1 Loyola returned to the compound at around 12:30 a.m.; upon arrival, JO1 Loyola asked JO1 Robles “<i>nandyan na si Warden </i>(<i>Chief Inspector Quinones</i>)?”, to which the latter replied <i>“tulog na si sir.”</i>&nbsp; JO1 Robles observed that JO1 Pascual was hiding something bulky in his uniform.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>In his defense, SJO2 Almojuela asserted that JO1 Loyola and JO1 Pascual went out of the jail compound without his permission.&nbsp; He also testified seeing JO1 Pascual and Lao together at around 12 midnight, while Lao was using JO1 Pascual’s celfone.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>&nbsp; Lao’s use of JO1 Pascual’s celfone was corroborated by SJO1 Robles’s testimony, who also said that JO1 Loyola’s phone kept on ringing or alerting for text messages.&nbsp; It was not clear from SJO1 Robles’s testimony if JO1 Loyola was with JO1 Pascual and Lao at that time.<br><br>Roughly twenty minutes after Lao was seen using JO1 Pascual’s celfone, JO1 Loyola ordered inmate Cabidoy to go to sleep, while JO1 Pascual took the keys to the jail cells from Cabidoy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>At around 1:15 a.m., inmate Juan Mogado, Lao’s former cellmate, saw Lao for the last time, when the latter bought P20.00 worth of Marlborro cigarettes from the store he was tending.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Fifteen minutes later, at about 1:30 a.m., SJO1 Robles testified that JO1 Loyola took the gate keys for the vehicular and visitor entrance and told him “<i>Sige pahinga ka muna, mamaya ko na ibigay sa iyo mga 3:00</i>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Between 1 to 1:30 a.m., Joan Panayaman, Almojuela’s househelp, saw JO1 Loyola and JO1 Pascual together while she was heading for the comfort room.&nbsp; As she approached them, Panayaman overheard JO1 Pascual talking over the cellphone saying “<i>Bago namin ilabas ito, magdagdag muna kayo ng isang milyon</i>.”&nbsp; JO1 Pascual then toned down his voice and entered his room, while JO1 Loyola walked towards the jail area. She went up to SJO2 Almojuela’s room, but found it locked.&nbsp; While going downstairs, she saw JO1 Loyola walking towards the gate with a man; a few minutes later, JO1 Loyola returned without the man.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>According to SJO2 Almojuela, he went to his barracks at around 1:20 a.m. and returned at around 1:30 a.m.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>&nbsp; This is contradicted by SJO1 Lagahit’s testimony, which asserts that SJO2 Almojuela left the front desk at around 1 a.m. and returned only at 3 a.m.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>&nbsp; At around the same time, inmate Jerwin Mingoy (<i>Mingoy</i>) testified that SJO2 Almojuela ordered him to get food at cell number 8 and set the table for the 3rd shift personnel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp; It must be noted, however, that SJO1 Loyola saw the members of the 3rd shift personnel take their meal some time between 12 a.m. to 1 a.m.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> while inmate Cabidoy cooked their meal at around 11:45 a.m. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Between 2:00 to 3:00 a.m., JO1 Loyola said he saw that the desk area was unmanned and the control gate of the detention cells open; he then gave the keys in his possession to JO1 Robles and went to the infirmary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>&nbsp; JO1 Loyola did not explain his whereabouts between 1:00 to 2:00 a.m.<br><br>SJO1 Lagahit testified that he conducted a roving inspection at around 2:30 a.m., and saw JO1 Loyola going to the infirmary where JO1 Palileo was assigned.&nbsp; He also saw SJO1 Pascual sitting in front of the gate of Cell Number 8, where Lao was billeted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>&nbsp; By 2:45 a.m., JO1 Robles said he woke up to find that the keys earlier taken by JO1 Loyola were already on his belly.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>At around 3 a.m., inmate Mingoy saw Lao talking to JO1 Palileo at the Desk Area.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> By 3:30 a.m., SJO2 Aquino left the female brigade area; while on her way to the Desk Officer’s lounge, she saw the following: (1) SJO2 Almojuela sleeping on a folding chair; (2) JO1 Palileo sleeping in the infirmary; (3) SJO1 Lagahit watching TV;&nbsp; 4) both control gates 1 and 2 were open; and&nbsp; (5) JO1 Pascual was standing inside control gate number 2.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>By 5:30 a.m., several BJMP officers saw Chief Inspector Quinones leave the jail compound aboard his car.&nbsp; News broke out in the jail facility that Lao was missing at around the same time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>&nbsp; Lao surreptitiously left the Makati City Jail and brought along with him his possessions, including a trophy he won at a pingpong match inside the prison.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Two days after Lao’s escape, Supt. Edgar C. Bolcio, who replaced Chief Inspector Quinones, conducted a search and inspection of the barracks of the jail personnel suspected to be involved in Lao’s escape. This resulted in the recovery of 10 keys from SJO2 Almojuela’s barracks, one of which matched the padlock of the main gate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>The National Bureau of Investigation (<i>NBI</i>) subsequently conducted polygraph tests on JO1 Pascual and SJO2 Almojuela.&nbsp; According to the NBI, JO1 Pascual and SJO2 Almojuela’s responses were “indicative of deceptions occurred at relevant questions”. When confronted and interrogated by the NBI, the two could not satisfactorily explain the polygraph tests’ results.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br><b><i>The BJMP’s Investigation Report</i></b><br><br>A BJMP Investigation Report conducted on the incident concluded that SJO2 Almojuela and the rest of the jail officers on third shift custodial duty all colluded to facilitate Lao’s getaway.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Based on the report’s recommendation, the Intelligence and Investigation Division of the BJMP filed an administrative complaint against the abovementioned BJMP/NCRO members.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>&nbsp; In Administrative Case No. 04-11, CESO IV Director Arturo Walit, the BJMP hearing officer, rendered his decision dated December 13, 2005,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> finding the following liable:<br><br><b><i>First</i></b>, SJO2 Almojuela and JO1 Loyola were found guilty of Grave Misconduct and were meted the penalty of dismissal from the service.<br><br><b><i>Second,</i></b> SJO2 Aquino, SJO1 Lagahit and JO1 Robles were found guilty of Less Serious Neglect of Duty and were meted the penalty of Suspension with forfeiture of salaries and allowances for six months.<br><br><b><i>Third</i></b>, CINSP Quinones was found guilty of Neglect of Duty and was meted the penalty of Fine equivalent to four months salary; he had since retired from the service.<br><br><b><i>Fourth</i></b>, JO1 Pascual, while not absolved of administrative liability, could no longer be penalized as the administrative proceedings began long after his separation from the service.<br><br><b><i>Fifth</i></b>, JO1 Palileo and JO1 Ibarra were exonerated.<br><br>SJO2 Almojuela and JO1 Loyola moved for the reconsideration of Director Walit’s decision, which the latter denied for lack of merit&nbsp; in a Joint Resolution dated June 21, 2006.&nbsp; SJO2 Almojuela then appealed his conviction before the Civil Service Commission (CSC), which affirmed Director Walit’s decision in its Resolution No. 080701. The CSC subsequently denied SJO2 Almojuela’s motion for reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br><b><i>The Appellate Court’s ruling</i></b><br><br>SJO2 Almojuela’s next recourse was a petition for review before the Court of Appeals. He assailed the CSC’s decision for the following reasons: <b><i>First</i></b>, SJO2 Almojuela claimed to have been denied due process because he was not accorded the benefit of a full-blown trial.&nbsp; <b><i>Second</i></b>, SJO2 Almojuela asserted that he was denied equal protection of the laws because lesser penalties were imposed on his co-workers.&nbsp; <b><i>Third</i></b>, SJO2 Almojuela argued that the evidence on record was insufficient to support his dismissal from the service.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>The CA denied SJO2 Almojuela’s petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>&nbsp; According to the CA, SJO2 Almojuela was provided the due process required in administrative proceedings when he was given the opportunity to answer the accusations against him.&nbsp; He was fully informed of the charges against him, and did file a counter-affidavit, motions for reconsideration, a notice of appeal, and a memorandum of appeal, where he narrated his side of the story.<br><br>Further, SJO2 Almojuela’s claim that he was denied equal protection of the laws because his co-workers were sentenced to lesser penalties has no legal basis.&nbsp; Citing <i>Abakada Guro Partylist v. Purisima,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> the CA pointed out that the equality guaranteed under the equal protection clause is equality under the same conditions and among persons similarly situated; when persons are under different factual circumstance, they may be treated differently.<br><br>In this case, the CA held that SJO2 Almojuela was handed the proper penalty, because next only to the warden, he was the highest-ranking officer in the Makati City Jail at the time Lao escaped.&nbsp; It was incumbent upon him to oversee the whole jail compound’s security, and ensure that all jail personnel performed their respective tasks.&nbsp; His failure to do so deserved a greater penalty than those who were under his command.<br><br>Lastly, the CA gave no credit to SJO2 Almojuela’s claim that the lack of a hearing and the BJMP’s bias against him rendered his dismissal illegal.&nbsp; It held that the presumption of regularity in the performance of Director Alit’s duty as disciplining authority should prevail over SJO2 Almojuela’s bare and unsupported allegations.&nbsp; Further, Director Alit’s decision was based on substantial evidence –&nbsp; testimonies of SJO2 Almojuela’s colleagues on duty that night showed the following laxities in the implementation of jail rules:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"><div align="JUSTIFY">(1)</div></td> <td width="95%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">SJO2 Almojuela was seen sleeping in a folding chair;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">(2) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Control gates 1 and 2 were open;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">(3) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">SJO2 Almojuela and JO1 Pascual were seen conversing with Lao at the desk area;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">(4) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">SJO2 Almojuela ordered JO1 Loyola and JO1 Pascual to go out of the compound and to buy food;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">(5) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Lao and the other inmates were seen loitering around the jail premises when all of them should have been inside their respective cells;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">(6) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">The recovered keys from SJO2 Almojuela’s makeshift cubicle fit the padlock in the main gate for vehicles;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">(7) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Persons other than gatekeepers JO1 Robles and JO1 Loyola had access to the keys of the respective gates assigned to them.</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br><b><i>The Appellate Court’s Amended Decision</i></b><br><br>The appellate court partially granted<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> SJO2 Almojuela’s motion for reconsideration, and lowered his liability from grave to simple misconduct.&nbsp; Applying Section 54(b), Rule IV of the Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in Civil Service,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> SJO2 Almojuela was meted the penalty of three months suspension as there was neither any attendant mitigating nor aggravating circumstance.<br><br>Citing <i>Civil Service Commission v. Lucas</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> the CA held on reconsideration that misconduct, to be considered grave, must involve the additional elements of corruption or willful intent to violate the law or disregard of established rules; otherwise, the misconduct is only simple.<br><br>The CA found no corrupt motive or willful intent on SJO2 Almojuela’s part to violate the BJMP Rules and Regulations.&nbsp; No clear evidence was presented to show that SJO2 Almojuela was directly involved in the prison break, nor was it proven that he benefited from it.&nbsp; SJO2 Almojuela likewise did not willfully trifle with the BJMP Rules and Regulations.&nbsp; While Lao was allowed to leave his cell, he was accompanied by the roving guard, JO1 Pascual, at all times.&nbsp; Considering the presumption that JO1 Pascual was regularly performing his duty, SJO2 Almojuela had no reason to believe that Lao would escape because he was under the jail guard’s watch.&nbsp; Further, SJO2 Almojuela was seen sleeping on duty only once; since SJO2 Aquino and SJO1 Lagahit (who were with him) were awake at that time, his lapse could not be considered to be sufficiently grave or serious to warrant his dismissal from the service.<br><br><b><i>The Present Petition</i></b><br><br>The CSC asserts in its present petition that the CA should not have had disturbed the CSC’s findings, as conclusions of administrative bodies charged with their specific field of expertise are generally afforded great weight by the courts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> SJO2 Almojuela’s conviction is supported by evidence on record, and sufficiently satisfied the substantial evidence standard.&nbsp; Taken together, the testimonies submitted during the BJMP investigation establish that SJO2 Almojuela connived with JO1 Pascual, JO1 Loyola and Lao to facilitate the latter’s escape.&nbsp; Even assuming that SJO2 Almojuela had no knowledge of the plan, he could have easily discovered and prevented the escape had he been awake and alert.<br><br>According to the CSC, a jail guard’s act of sleeping while at his post on night-shift duty constitutes grave misconduct because it is a flagrant disregard of BJMP’s policy that a jail officer should stay vigilant during his shift.&nbsp; In SJO2 Almojuela’s case, this was aggravated by his rank – next only to the warden, he was the highest-ranking jail officer on duty.&nbsp; As shift supervisor, it was incumbent upon him to be awake at all times to fully oversee the jail compound’s security and to ensure that all the other jail officers were performing their tasks.<br><br>Lastly, the CSC pointed out that Grave Misconduct could not be mitigated by the accused’s first time offender status or by his length of service. Section 52, Rule IV the of Civil Service Commission Memorandum Circular No. 19-99<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> provides that the first offense constituting grave misconduct already warrants the penalty of dismissal.<br><br>In his Comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> SJO2 Almojuela reiterated the line the Court of Appeals took in its amended decision, and additionally raised the following arguments: <i><b>first, </b></i>the certificate of non-forum shopping, instead of having been signed by the CSC, was signed by the assistant solicitor general, in violation of the rule on certification against forum shopping; <b><i>second</i></b>, the CSC is not the proper party to appeal the CA’s decision; and <b><i>third</i></b>, SJO2 Almojuela had been deprived of due process during the BJMP investigation, as he was not given the opportunity to submit his evidence and to present his witnesses while the prosecution was allowed to adduce its evidence under&nbsp; a trial-type arrangement.<br><br><center><b><u>Issues</u></b></center><br>The parties’ arguments, properly joined, present to us the following issues:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"><div align="JUSTIFY">1) </div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Whether the CSC’s petition for review on <i>certiorari </i>should be dismissed for failure to comply with Section 4, Rule 45 of the Rules of Court;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">2) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Whether the CSC’s petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> should be dismissed as the CSC is not the proper party to appeal the CA’s amended decision;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">3)</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Whether SJO2 Almojuela had been deprived of due process when he was not allowed to present his evidence and witnesses during the BJMP investigation;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">4) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Whether SJO2 Almojuela connived with JO1 Loyola and JO1 Pascual to facilitate Lao’s escape from the Makati City Jail; and</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">5) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Whether SJO2 Almojuela’s actions constitute gross misconduct.</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br><center><b><u>The Court’s Ruling</u></b><br></center><br>We first rule on the procedural issues SJO2 Almojuela posed.<br><br><b><i>The CSC’s petition failed to comply with <br>Section 4, Rule 45 of the Rules of Court</i></b><br><br>As SJO2 Almojuela correctly pointed out, the CSC’s petition failed to comply with Section 4, Rule 45 of the Rules of Court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> when its certificate against forum shopping was signed by Associate Solicitor General Sharon E. Millan-Decano; it was not signed by the CSC nor by the BJMP’s authorized representatives.<br><br>The consequences of this mistep are prejudicial to the party filing the pleading.&nbsp; Section 5, Rule 45 of the Rules of Court provides that a petition for review that does not comply with the required certification against forum shopping is a ground for its dismissal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>&nbsp; This certification must be executed by the petitioner, not by counsel.&nbsp; It is the petitioner, and not always the counsel whose professional services have been retained only for a particular case, who is in the best position to know whether he or it actually filed or caused the filing of a petition in that case.&nbsp; Hence, a certification against forum shopping by counsel is a defective certification.&nbsp; It is equivalent to non-compliance with the requirement under Section 4, Rule 45 and constitutes a valid cause for dismissal of the petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>In <i>Pascual v. Beltran,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> we affirmed the CA’s dismissal of the&nbsp; petition for <i>certiorari </i>before the appellate court because it was the Solicitor General, not the petitioner, who signed the certification against forum shopping.<br><br>However, there have been instances when the demands of substantial justice convinced us to apply the Rules liberally by way of compliance with the certification against forum shopping requirement;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> the rule on certification against forum shopping, while obligatory, is not jurisdictional.&nbsp; Justifiable cirsumtances may intervene and be recognized, leading the Court to relax the application of this rule.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>In <i>People of the Philippines v. de Grano et. al.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> for instance, we permitted the private prosecutor to sign the certification in behalf of his client who went into hiding after being taken out of the witness protection program.&nbsp; This is the case that the OSG invoked in the certification against forum shopping signed by Associate Solicitor Millan-Decano who stated in her footnote that “Pursuant to People v. de Grano (G.R. No. 167710, June 5, 2009), the handling lawyers of the OSG may sign verification and certificate of non-forum shopping.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>A reading of <i>People of the Philippines v. de Grano et. al</i>., a decision from the Third Division of the Supreme Court, shows that it cannot be used to support the OSG’s conclusion.<br><br><i>De Grano</i> affirms a long line of Supreme Court decisions where the Court allowed the liberal application of the rules on certification against forum shopping in the interest of substantial justice.&nbsp; But to merit the Court’s consideration, the petitioner(s) must show reasonable basis for its/their failure to personally sign the certification.&nbsp; They must convince the Court that the petition’s outright dismissal would defeat the administration of justice.&nbsp; One of the cases cited in <i>Grano</i> was <i>City Warden of the Manila City Jail v. Estrella</i>, a case decided by the Second Division of this Court, which allowed the Solicitor General to sign the verification and certification of non-forum shopping in a petition before the CA or with this Court.&nbsp; The decision held that certification by the OSG constitutes substantial compliance with the Rules, considering that the OSG is the legal representative of the Government of the Republic of the Philippines and its agencies and instrumentalities.<br><br>In <i>Hon. Constantino-David et. al. v. Pangandaman-Gania</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> an En Banc decision, we clarified the application of <i>City Warden of the Manila City Jail v. Estrella</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> and held that this case does not give the OSG the license to sign the certification against forum shopping in behalf of government agencies at all times.&nbsp; We explained that the reason we authorized the Solicitor General to sign the certification against forum shopping is because it was then acting as a ‘People’s Tribune,’ an instance when the Solicitor takes a position adverse and contrary to the Government’s because it is incumbent upon him to present to the Court what he considers would legally uphold government’s best interest, although the position may run counter to a client's position; in this case, the Solicitor General appealed the trial court’s order despite the City Warden’s apparent acquiesance to it and in the process took a position contrary to the City Warden’s.<br><br>The rule is different when the OSG acts as a government agency’s counsel of record.&nbsp; It is necessary for the petitioning government agency or its authorized representatives to certify against forum shopping, because they, and not the OSG, are in the best position to know if another case is pending before another court.&nbsp; The reason for this requirement was succinctly explained in <i>Hon. Constantino-David et. al. v. Pangandaman-Gania:</i><br><br><blockquote>The fact that the OSG under the 1987 Administrative Code is the only lawyer for a government agency wanting to file a petition or complaint does not automatically vest the OSG with the authority to execute in its name the certificate of non-forum shopping for a client office. In some instances, these government agencies have legal departments which inadvertently take legal matters requiring court representation into their own hands without the OSG’s intervention.&nbsp; Consequently, the OSG would have no personal knowledge of the history of a particular case so as to adequately execute the certificate of non-forum shopping; and even if the OSG does have the relevant information, the courts on the other hand would have no way of ascertaining the accuracy of the OSG’s assertion without precise references in the record of the case. Thus, unless equitable circumstances which are manifest from the record of a case prevail, it becomes necessary for the concerned government agency or its authorized representatives to certify for non-forum shopping if only to be sure that no other similar case or incident is pending before any other court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></blockquote><br>To be sure, there may be situations when the OSG would have difficulty in securing the signatures of government officials for the verification and certificate of non-forum shopping. But these situations cannot serve as excuse for the OSG to wantonly undertake by itself the verification and certification of non-forum shopping.&nbsp; If the OSG is compelled by circumstances to verify and certify the pleading in behalf of a client agency, <i>the OSG should at least endeavor to inform the courts of its reasons for doing so, beyond simply citing cases where the Court allowed the OSG to sign the certification.</i> In <i>Hon. Constantino-David et. al. v. Pangandaman-Gania,</i> the Court dealt with this situation and&nbsp; enumerated the following requirements before the OSG can undertake a non-forum shopping certifications as counsel of record for a&nbsp; client agency:<br><br><blockquote>(a) allege under oath the circumstances that make signatures of the concerned officials impossible to obtain within the period for filing the initiatory pleading; (b) append to the petition or complaint such authentic document to prove that the party-petitioner or complainant authorized the filing of the petition or complaint and understood and adopted the allegations set forth therein, and an affirmation that no action or claim involving the same issues has been filed or commenced in any court, tribunal or quasi-judicial agency; and, (c) undertake to inform the court promptly and reasonably of any change in the stance of the client agency.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup></blockquote><br>Under these principles, the CSC’s petition for review on <i>certiorari </i>before this Court is defective for failure to attach a proper certification against forum shopping. In the certificate, the associate solicitor merely stated that she has prepared and filed the petition in her capacity as the petition’s handling lawyer, and citing <i>People v. Grano</i>, claimed that the OSG’s handling lawyers are allowed to verify and sign the certificate of non-forum shopping.&nbsp; No explanation was given why the signatures of the CSC’s authorized representatives could not be secured.<br><br>Despite this conclusion, we cannot turn a blind eye to the meritorious grounds that the CSC raised in its petition, and to the reality that the administration of justice could be derailed by an overly stringent application of the rules.&nbsp; Under the present situation and in the exercise of our discretion, we resolve to overlook the procedural defect in order to consider the case on the merits.&nbsp; We carefully note in doing this that our action does not substantially affect the due process rights of the respondent, nor does it involve a jurisdictional infirmity that leaves the Court with no discretion except to dismiss the case before us.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup>&nbsp; In other words, no mandatory duty on the part of the Court is involved; we are faced with a situation that calls for the exercise of our authority to act with discretion.&nbsp; In the exercise of this discretion, we have deemed it more prudent, as a matter of judicial policy in the present situation, to encourage the hearing of the appeal on the merits rather than to apply the rules of procedure in a very rigid, technical sense that&nbsp; impedes the cause of justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>Our approach is a reminder that the rules of procedure are mere tools designed to facilitate the attainment of justice. Their strict and rigid application tending to frustrate, rather than promote substantial justice, must always be avoided.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup>&nbsp; The emerging trend in the rulings of this Court is to afford every party litigant with a facially meritorious case the amplest opportunity for the proper determination of his or her cause, free from the constraints of technicalities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup>&nbsp; It is a far better and more prudent course of action for the court to excuse a technical lapse and afford the parties the review of a meritorious case on appeal rather than dispose of the case on technicalities and cause a grave injustice; the latter course of action may give the impression of speedy disposal of cases, but can only result in more delay and even miscarriage of justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>Our liberal application of the Rules of Court in this case does not however mean that the OSG can cite this Decision as authority to verify and sign the certification for non-forum shopping in behalf of its client agencies. The OSG should take note of our decision in the cited <i>Hon. Constantino-David et. al. v. Pangandaman-Gania</i> for the requisites to be satisfied before it can verify and sign the certificate of non-forum shopping for its client agencies.&nbsp; Rather than an authority in its favor, this Decision should serve as a case showing that the OSG had been warned about its observed laxity in following the rules on the certification for non-forum shopping.&nbsp; Only the substantive merits of the CSC’s case saved the day in this case for the OSG.<br><br><i><b>The CSC is the proper party to raise an <br>appeal against the CA’s amended petition</b></i><br><br>SJO2 Almojuela asserts that the CSC has no legal personality to challenge the CA’s amended decision because it must maintain its impartiality as a judge and disciplining authority in controversies involving public officers.&nbsp; He implores the Court to reconsider its ruling in <i>Civil Service Commission v.

To be sure, it would not be appealed by the public employee who has been absolved of the charge against him; neither would the complainant appeal the decision, as he acted merely as a witness for the government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup>&nbsp; We thus find no reason to disurb the settled <i>Dacoycoy</i> doctrine.<br><br>In the present case, the CSC appeals the CA’s amended decision, which modified the liability the former meted against SJO2 Almojuela from grave misconduct to simple misconduct, and lowered the corresponding penalty from dismissal to three months suspension. Applying the<i> Dacoycoy </i>principles, the CSC has legal personality to appeal the CA’s amended decision as the CA significantly lowered SJO2 Almojuela’s disciplinary sanction and thereby prevented the CSC from imposing the penalty it deemed appropriate to impose on SJO2 Almojuela.&nbsp;

SJO2 Almojuela adopted this stance, and added that Criminal Case No. 3320236, which was&nbsp; filed against him for facilitating Lao’s escape, has been dismissed.&nbsp; He also pointed out Captain Enriquez’s (one of the investigating officers) testimony in Criminal Case No. 3320236, where Captain Enriquez admitted that JO1 Pascual was the last person seen in possession of the maingate’s keys, and that the gatekeepers JO1 Loyola and JO1 Robles should have been safekeeping the keys.&nbsp; Lastly, SJO2 Almojuela sought to discredit the testimonies of SJO2 Aquino, JO1 Loyola, SJO1 Lagahit and JO1 Robles for being hearsay, and questioned the admissability of their affidavits as they were never offered as part of the BJMP prosecutors’ documentary evidence.<br><br>According to the BJMP report, Lao most likely exited the jail compound through the main gate, considering that he was discovered to have disappeared at about the same time the warden left the jail on board his car (the BJMP report pegged the discovery of Lao’s escape 30 minutes <i>after</i> the warden left, while the jail officers’ affidavits estimated it to have transpired&nbsp; 30 minutes <i>before</i>).&nbsp; A search and inspection of the barracks of suspected jail personnel resulted in the recovery of ten keys from SJO2 Almojuela’s barracks, one of which matched the main gate’s padlock.&nbsp;

The fact that these keys should be in the safekeeping of JO1 Pascual and JO1 Robles does not clear SJO2 Almojuela from liability; on the contrary, it should convince us of his involvement in Lao’s escape.&nbsp; It leads us to ask why the keys were found in SJO2 Almojuela’s room, when the last person seen to possess the keys, and the personnel who were supposed to safekeep them, was not SJO2 Almojuela.&nbsp; SJO2 Almojuela’s bare allegations that he was set up cannot stand up against the presumption of regularity in the performance of the investigating officers’ duty.&nbsp; This presumption, when considered with the following pieces of evidence, leads us to no other conclusion than SJO2 Almojuela’s implied consent to Lao’s escape. <b><i>First,</i></b> SJO2 Almojuela’s lax attitude regarding Lao, whom he admitted seeing<i> loittering around the jail’s premises at night and even using JO1 Pascual’s celfone</i>, both in contravention of BJMP rules and regulations.&nbsp; <b><i>Second</i></b>, <i> SJO2 Almojuela lied</i> when he stated in his affidavit that he only left the desk area at around 1:20 to 1:40 AM, when the testimonies of two other jail officers, SJO1 Lagahit and JO1 Loyola, show otherwise. <b><i> Third</i></b>, when Panayaman overheard the negotiations for Lao’s release between JO1 Pascual and the person he was talking to in his celfone, Panayaman went to SJO2 Almojuela’s room but found that the door was locked.<br><br>Finally, we do not agree with SJO2 Almojuela’s assertion that the statements of SJO2 Aquino, JO1 Loyola, SJO1 Lagahit and JO1 Robles in their affidavits should be disregarded for being hearsay as he failed to cross-examine them.&nbsp; It is well-settled that a formal or trial-type of hearing is not indespensible in administrative proceedings, and a fair and reasonable opportunity to explain one’s side suffices to meet the requirements of due process.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> Technical rules applicable to judicial proceedings need not always apply.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> In <i>Erece v.
