Barrido</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> where the RTC adopted a different formula, as in this case, by considering the average between the findings of the DAR using the formula laid down in Executive Order No. 228<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> and the market value of the property as stated in the tax declaration, we declared it to be an obvious departure from the mandate of the law and the DAR administrative order. We emphasized therein that, while the determination of just compensation is essentially a judicial function vested in the RTC acting as a special agrarian court, the judge cannot abuse his discretion by not taking into full consideration the factors specifically identified by law and implementing rules.<br><br>We agree with LBP in the instant case that the "double take up" of the market value per tax declaration as a valuation factor completely destroys the rationale of the formula laid down by the DAR.&nbsp; Thus, argues LBP:<br><br><blockquote>x x x Market value accounts for only 10% under the basic formula of LV = (CNI x 0.60) + (CS x .30) + (MV x .10).&nbsp; The 10% remains constant even under the variation formulae of LV = (CNI x .90) + (MV x .10) and LV = (CS x .90) + (MV x .10).&nbsp; It is only when the data constituting CS (Comparable sales) and CNI (capitalized net income) are absent that MV is given greater weight in determining just compensation.&nbsp; This is not obtaining in this case.<br><br>x x x Greater weight is accorded CNI, 60% in the basic formula and 90% in the other variation thereof, and this is not without a valid reason.&nbsp; The valuation formula is heavily production based (net income) because that is the true value of what landowners lose when their lands are expropriated and what the farmers-beneficiaries gain when the lands are distributed to them. A more fundamental reason for the valuation formula of DAR is the fidelity to the principle of affordability, i.e. what the farmers-beneficiaries can reasonably afford to pay based on what the land can produce.&nbsp; It must be emphasized that agricultural lands are not residential lands, and farmers-beneficiaries are not given those lands so they can live there but so that they can till them.&nbsp; And since they generally live on hand to mouth existence, their source of repaying the just compensation is sourced from their income derived from the cultivation of the land.&nbsp; Thus, the double take up of market value as a valuation factor goes against the grain of affordability as the basic principle in the government-supervised valuation formula for agrarian reform.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></blockquote><br>Considering, therefore, that the RTC based its valuation on a different formula and without taking into full consideration the factors set forth in Section 17 of RA 6657, we order the consolidation of the instant case (CA-G.R. CEB SP No. 01846) with CA-G.R. CEB SP No. 01845, where the appeal of the DAR from the March 27, 2006 Decision of the RTC was granted and said case was remanded to the trial court for determination of just compensation with the assistance of commissioners.&nbsp; We have held that consolidation of cases is proper when there is a real need to forestall, as in this case, the possibility of conflicting decisions being rendered in the cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.
