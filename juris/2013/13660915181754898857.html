Cesar Gonzalez Cruz (P/Insp. Cruz) forthwith formed a group to conduct surveillance on the pinpointed area and to arrest possible violators of the Dangerous Drugs Act.<br><br>The police operatives were composed of PO3 Rodrigo Antonio, SPO1 Wilson Gamit, PO3 Manuel de Guzman, PO1 Rolly Montefrio, SPO1 Moran and PO3 Galvez.&nbsp; The team assigned PO3 Galvez as the <i>poseur-buyer </i>and agreed on a pre-arranged signal of identifying accused, <i>i.e.,</i> the informant throws his cigarette in front of Diwa. Thereafter, P/Insp. Cruz handed over to PO3 Galvez a One Hundred Peso-bill dusted with ultra-violet powder, which PO3 Galvez then marked with his initials “RG.”<br><br>On the same date, at 8:30 in the evening, the police operatives proceeded to North Diversion Road, Service Road, <i>Bagong Barrio</i>, Caloocan City.&nbsp; The team of police operatives positioned themselves, with PO3 Galvez at a distance of about five (5) meters from the informant and the other policemen at ten (10) meters away from where PO3 Galvez was situated. Prompted by the informant’s execution of the pre-arranged signal, PO3 Galvez approached Diwa and asked him, “<i>Pre, may chongke</i> (street name for <i>Marijuana</i>) <i>ka pa ba?</i>” to which Diwa replied “<i>Meron, magkano ba ang kukunin mo</i>?”&nbsp; PO3 Galvez answered back “<i>Piso lang,</i>” which, in street lingo, meant One Hundred Pesos (P100.00) worth of <i>marijuana.</i><br><br>PO3 Galvez paid Diwa with the One Hundred Peso-bill dusted with ultra-violet powder.&nbsp; Diwa held the marked money in his right hand, reached for a yellow “SM Supermarket” plastic bag beside him, and got a portion of a bunch of <i>marijuana</i> wrapped in a newspaper, which portion he gave to PO3 Galvez.&nbsp; At once, as soon as the buy-bust deal was consummated, PO3 Galvez scratched his head, the pre-arranged signal for the other policemen to approach them, and instantaneously grabbed Diwa’s hands.&nbsp; Seeing PO3 Galvez’s signal, the waiting police operatives rushed towards him.&nbsp; PO3 Galvez introduced himself as a policeman to Diwa, recovered the buy-bust money and marked the <i>marijuana</i> he bought from the latter, “MDG,” Diwa’s initials.&nbsp; SPO1 Moran then confiscated the yellow “SM Supermarket” plastic bag which contained more <i>marijuana.</i>&nbsp; After informing Diwa of his constitutional rights, the team brought Diwa to the police station for investigation.<br><br>The items confiscated from Diwa were sent to the Crime Laboratory Office of Caloocan City for examination.&nbsp; P/Insp. Jesse Dela Rosa conducted a laboratory test on the specimen submitted by the police operatives, and subsequently issued Physical Sciences Report No. D-1097-03 containing the following entries:<br><br><blockquote>SPECIMEN SUBMITTED:<br><br>A-&nbsp; One (1) yellow plastic bag with markings SM Supermarket containing the following;<br><br>A-1 = One (1) folded newspaper print with markings ‘MDG-1 08-20-03 BUY BUST’ containing 72.90 grams of dried suspected Marijuana fruiting tops.<br><br>A-2 = One (1) folded newspaper print with markings ‘MDG-2 08-20-03’ containing 288.49 grams of dried suspected Marijuana fruiting tops.<br><br><center>x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp; </center><br>PURPOSE OF LABORATORY EXAMINATION:<br><br>To determine the presence of a dangerous drug. x x x<br><br>FINDINGS:<br><br>Qualitative examination conducted on the above-stated specimen A-1 and A-2 gave POSITIVE result to the test for Marijuana, a dangerous drug. x x x<br><br>CONCLUSION:<br><br>Specimen A-1 and A-2 contain Marijuana, a dangerous drug. x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></blockquote><br>PO2 Randulfo Hipolito (PO2 Hipolito), the investigator-in-case, was likewise presented by the prosecution, but his testimony was eventually dispensed with because the prosecution and defense entered into another stipulation, that PO2 Hipolito prepared the Referral Slip, Request for Laboratory Examination and the <i>Pinagsamang Salaysay.</i><br><br>Accused-appellant Diwa proffered an entirely different story.&nbsp; He claimed that on the inauspicious date of 20 August 2003, he was in front of his house, fetching water, when SPO1 Moran, whom Diwa did not know at the time, approached him and inquired about a certain Brenda.&nbsp; Not knowing who Brenda is, and having told SPO1 Moran so, Diwa was surprised to be whisked away by SPO1 Moran.&nbsp; SPO1 Moran first took Diwa to Balintawak, EDSA, where they transferred to another vehicle; thereafter, Diwa was brought to the Caloocan City police station.<br><br>At the precinct, Diwa was detained for two (2) days, and in the interim was supposedly brought to the hospital for medical examination. Further, the policemen allegedly demanded One Hundred Thousand Pesos (?100,000.00) from Diwa in exchange for his release.&nbsp; When Diwa told the police that he had no money, Diwa was detained for another day, and the next day was brought to the prosecutor’s office for inquest.&nbsp; He was then returned to the Caloocan City Jail.<br><br>On the whole, Diwa denied all the allegations against him; he denied ownership of the <i>marijuana</i>, claiming that he only saw these when he was brought before the prosecutor’s office.&nbsp; Diwa only admitted to the money, Forty Pesos (P40.00) that was taken from him, which was purportedly used for his fare in going to the hospital for check-up.&nbsp; He claimed to have never met PO3 Galvez, and his supposed arrest by the latter during a buy-bust operation never happened.<br><br>However, on cross-examination, Diwa admitted that PO3 Galvez was present during his arrest.&nbsp; On re-direct examination, Diwa failed to clarify his inconsistent statements.&nbsp; Lastly, Diwa claimed that he was brought to a dark room in the Drug Enforcement Unit where his hands were held, rubbed and examined.<br><br>On 11 February 2008, the RTC rendered a Decision finding Diwa guilty beyond reasonable doubt for violation of Sections 5 and 11 of Republic Act No. 9165:<br><br><blockquote>Premises considered, this court finds and so holds the accused Magsalin Diwa GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt for violation of Sections 5 and 11, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165, otherwise known as the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002 and imposes upon him the following:<br><br><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="CENTER">(a)</div></td> <td width="90%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">In Crim.

Corollary thereto, Diwa theorizes that it was possible that, not having had the money to pay the police for his release, the actual items seized from Diwa were replaced with the <i>marijuana</i> dried fruiting tops to justify his arrest.<br><br>As the lower courts were, we are not convinced.&nbsp; We find no cause to disturb their factual findings that a buy-bust transaction took place between PO3 Galvez and Diwa, resulting in the latter’s lawful arrest for illegal sale and illegal possession of <i>marijuana.</i><br><br>On more than one occasion, we have ruled that findings of fact of the trial court, particularly when affirmed by the Court of Appeals, are accorded great weight.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>&nbsp; This is because the trial judge has the distinct advantage of closely observing the demeanor of the witnesses, as well as the manner in which they testify, and is in a better position to determine whether or not they are telling the truth.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>&nbsp; On that score alone, Diwa’s appeal ought to have been dismissed outright.<br><br>As found by the lower courts, the prosecution proved beyond&nbsp; reasonable doubt the elements of illegal sale of dangerous drugs: (1) the accused sold and delivered a prohibited drug to another and (2) knew that what was sold and delivered was a prohibited drug;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> and illegal possession of dangerous drugs: (1)&nbsp; the accused is in possession of the object identified as a prohibited or regulatory drug; (2) such possession is not authorized by law; and (3) the accused freely and consciously possessed the said drug.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>For the reversal of his conviction, Diwa of course relies on the presumption of innocence in his favor, and on the corresponding argument that the details of the purported transaction between him and PO3 Galvez were not clearly and adequately shown.&nbsp; In this regard, we study the testimony of PO3 Galvez:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY">FISCAL GRAVINO:</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Do you recall where were you on August 20, 2003?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">I was in the office.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">And do you remember if you had an operation on that date?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Yes, Ma[’a]m.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Can you recall what is (<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>) that operation all about?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">We conducted buy bust operation[.]</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Who ordered you to conduct buy bust operation?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Our Chief.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">What is the name?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Police Insp.

This Court, thus, finds the integrity and the evidentiary value of the drugs coming from [Diwa] to have not been compromised. Having found the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items to be properly preserved, then there is no violation of Section 21 of Republic Act No. 9165. As held by the Supreme Court, non-compliance by the apprehending policemen with Section 21 is not fatal as long as there is justifiable ground therefor, and as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the confiscated items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team [citation omitted]. As provided in Section 21 (a) of the pertinent Implementing Rules of Republic Act No. 9165:<br><blockquote>“…Provided, further, that non-compliance with these requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and invalid such seizures of and custody over said items..”<br></blockquote>The integrity of the evidence is presumed to be preserved unless there is a showing of bad faith, ill will, or proof that the evidence has been tampered with. [Diwa], in the instant case, has the burden to show that the evidence was tampered, altered or meddled with to overcome the presumption of regularity in the handling of exhibits by public officers and<br><br>a presumption that public officer properly discharge their duties. Having failed to discharge this burden, his conviction must be sustained [citation omitted].<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></blockquote><br>Turning now to the imposable penalty on accused-appellant, we sustain the penalty imposed by the RTC, and affirmed by the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; Sections 5 and 11 of Republic Act No. 9165 provide for the penalty for the illegal sale and illegal possession, respectively, of dangerous drugs:<br><br><blockquote><b>Section 5</b>. <i>Sale, Trading, Administration, Dispensation, Delivery, Distribution and Transportation of Dangerous Drugs and/or Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals. -</i> The penalty of life imprisonment to death and a fine ranging from Five hundred thousand pesos (P500,000.00) to Ten million pesos (P10,000,000.00) shall be imposed upon any person, who, unless authorized by law, shall sell, trade, administer, dispense, deliver, give away to another, distribute, dispatch in transit or transport any dangerous drug, including any and all species of opium poppy regardless of the quantity and purity involved, or shall act as a broker in any of such transactions.<br><br>x x x x<br><br><b>Section 11</b>. <i>Possession of Dangerous Drugs.</i> - The penalty of life imprisonment to death and a fine ranging from Five hundred thousand pesos (P500,000.00) to Ten million pesos (P10,000,000.00) shall be imposed upon any person, who, unless authorized by law, shall possess any dangerous drug in the following quantities, regardless of the degree of purity thereof:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(7) 500 grams or more of <span style="font-style: italic;">marijuana</span>; and<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Otherwise, if the quantity involved is less than the foregoing quantities, the penalties shall be graduated as follows:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(3) Imprisonment of twelve (12) years and one (1) day to twenty (20) years and a fine ranging from Three hundred thousand pesos (P300,000.00) to Four hundred thousand pesos (P400,000.00), if the quantities of dangerous drugs are less than five (5) grams of opium, morphine, heroin, cocaine or cocaine hydrochloride, <span style="font-style: italic;">marijuana</span> resin or <span style="font-style: italic;">marijuana</span> resin oil, methamphetamine hydrochloride or “shabu,” or other dangerous drugs such as, but not limited to, MDMA or “ecstasy,” PMA, TMA, LSD, GHB, and those similarly designed or newly introduced drugs and their derivatives, without having any therapeutic value or if the quantity possessed is far beyond therapeutic requirements; or less than three hundred (300) grams of <span style="font-style: italic;">marijuana</span>.</blockquote><br>For the illegal sale of <i>marijuana</i>, violation of Section 5 of Republic Act No. 9165, the lower courts correctly imposed the penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of Five Hundred Thousand Pesos (P500,000.00).
