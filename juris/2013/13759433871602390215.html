The first seat was occupied by its first nominee, Rep. Arquiza, while the second was given to its second nominee, David L. Kho (Rep. Kho).<br><br>The split among the ranks of SENIOR CITIZENS came about not long after. According to the Datol Group's petition, the members of SENIOR CITIZENS held a national convention on November 27, 2010 in order to address "the unfulfilled commitment of [Rep. Arquiza] to his constituents."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Further, a new set of officers and members of the Board of Trustees of the organization were allegedly elected during the said convention. SENIOR CITIZENS' third nominee, Francisco G. Datol, Jr., was supposedly elected as the organization's Chairman. Thereafter, on November 30, 2010, in an opposite tum of events, Datol was expelled from SENIOR CITIZENS by the Board of Trustees that were allied with Rep. Arquiza.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Thenceforth, the two factions of SENIOR CITIZENS had been engaged in a bitter rivalry as both groups, with their own sets of officers, claimed leadership of the organization.<br><br><b><i><u>The Resignation of Rep. Kho</u></i></b><br><br>On December 14, 2011, Rep. Arquiza informed the office of COMELEC Chairman Sixto S. Brillantes, Jr. in a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> dated December 8, 2011 that the second nominee of SENIOR CITIZENS, Rep. Kho, had tendered his resignation, which was to take effect on December 31, 2011. The fourth nominee, Remedios D. Arquiza, was to assume the vacant position in view of the previous expulsion from the organization of the third nominee, Francisco G. Datol, Jr.<br><br>The letter of Rep. Arquiza was also accompanied by a petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> dated December 14, 2011 in the name of SENIOR CITIZENS. The petition prayed that the "confirmation and approval of the replacement of Congressman David L. Kho, in the person of the fourth nominee, Remedios D. Arquiza, due to the expulsion of the third nominee, Francisco G. Datol, Jr., be issued immediately in order to pave the way of her assumption into the office."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Before the COMELEC, the petition was docketed as <b>E.M. No. 12-040</b>.<br><br>Attached to the petition was the resignation letter 15 of Rep. Kho, which was addressed to the Speaker of the House of Representatives. The letter stated thus:<br><br><blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">THE HONORABLE SPEAKER</span><br>House of Representatives<br><b>Congress</b><br>Republic of the Philippines<br>Quezon City<br><br>Sir:<br><br>I am hereby tendering my irrevocable resignation as Representative of the Senior Citizens Party-list in the House of Representatives, effective <u>December 31, 2011</u> in the event that only two (2) seats are won by our party-list group; and will resign on <u>June 30, 2012</u> in case three seats are won.<br><br>As a consequence thereof, the Coalition of Associations of Senior Citizens in the Philippines, Inc. shall nominate my successor pursuant to law and Rules on the matter.<br><br>Please accept my esteem and respect.<br><br>Truly yours,<br><br>(Signed)<br><b>Rep.

Pertinently, Section 7 of Rule 4 thereof provided that:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 7. <i>Term sharing of nominees</i>. Filing of vacancy as a result of term sharing agreement among nominees of winning party-list groups/organizations shall not be allowed.<br></blockquote><br>On March 12, 2012, the Board of Trustees of SENIOR CITIZENS that were allied with Rep. Arquiza issued Board Resolution No. 003-2012, which pertinently stated thus:<br><br><blockquote><center>BOARD RESOLUTION NO. <u>003-2012</u><br>Series of 2012</center><br>A RESOLUTION RECALLING THE ACCEPTANCE OF THE BOARD IN RESOLUTION NO. 11-0012 OF THE RESIGNATION OF CONGRESSMAN DAVID L.

No. 12-040</b>.&nbsp; At the hearing, the counsel for SENIOR CITIZENS (Arquiza Group) admitted that Rep. Kho's tender of resignation was made pursuant to the agreement entered into by the organization's nominees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> However, said counsel also stated that the Board of Trustees of the organization reconsidered the acceptance of Rep. Kho's resignation and the latter was, instead, to complete his term.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Also, from the transcript of the hearing, it appears that the Arquiza Group previously manifested that it was withdrawing its petition, but the same was opposed by the Datol Group and was not acted upon by the COMELEC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>On June 27, 2012, the COMELEC <i>En Banc</i> issued a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> in <b>E.M. No. 12-040</b>, dismissing the petition of the SENIOR CITIZENS (Arquiza Group). The pertinent portions of the Resolution stated, thus:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td style="font-weight: bold;" width="30%"><div align="JUSTIFY">First, resignation of Kho, pursuant to the party nominees' term-sharing agreement, cannot be recognized and be given effect so as to create a vacancy in the list and change the order of the nominees.</div></td> <td width="70%"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br>Under Section 8 of Republic Act No. 7941, the withdrawal in writing of the nominee of his nomination is one of the three (3) exemptions to the rule that "<i>[n]o change of names or alteration of the order of nominees shall be allowed after the same shall have been submitted to the COMELEC.</i> " While we can consider the resignation of Rep. Kho as akin to the withdrawal of his own nomination, we are constrained however NOT to recognize such resignation <b>but only in so far as to change the order of petitioner's nominees as submitted to the Commission.</b><br><br>xxxx<br><br>Considering that it is an admitted fact that the resignation of Rep. Kho was made by virtue of a prior agreement of the parties, <b>we resolve and hereby rule that we cannot recognize such arrangement and accordingly we cannot approve the movement in the order of nominees for being contrary to public policy</b>. The term of office of public officials cannot be made subject to any agreement of private parties. Public office is not a commodity that can be shared, apportioned or be made subject of any private agreement. Public office is vested with public interest that should not be reined by individual interest<br><br>In fact, to formalize the policy of disallowing term sharing agreements among party list nominees, the Commission recently promulgated Resolution No. 9366, which provides:<br><br><blockquote>"SEC. 7. Term sharing of nominees. - <b>Filing of vacancy as a result of term sharing agreement among nominees of winning party-list groups/organizations shall not be allowed.</b>"</blockquote>Considering all these, we find the term sharing agreement by the nominees of the Senior Citizen's Party-List null and void. Any action committed by the parties in pursuit of such term-sharing arrangement­ including the resignation of Congressman David Kho--cannot be recognized and be given effect. Thus, in so far as this Commission is concerned, no vacancy was created by the resignation of Rep. Kho and there can be no change in the list and order of nominees of the petitioner party-list.<br><br><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td style="font-weight: bold;" width="30%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Second, the expulsion of Datol - even if proven true- has no effect in the list and in the order of nominees, thus Remedios Arquiza (the fourth nominee) cannot be elevated as the third nominee.</div></td> <td width="70%"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br>xxxx<br><br>It must be noted that the list and order of nominees, after submission to this Commission, is meant to be <b>permanent</b>.&nbsp; The legislature in crafting Republic Act No. 7941 clearly deprived the party-list organization of the right to change its nominees or to alter the order of nominees once the list is submitted to the COMELEC, except for three (3) enumerated instances such as when: (a) the nominee dies; (b) the nominee withdraws in writing his nomination; or (c) the nominee becomes incapacitated.<br><br>xxxx<br><br>Thus, even if the expulsion of Datol in the petitioner party-list were true, the list and order of nominees of the Senior Citizen's party-list remains the same in so far as we are concerned as it does not fall under one of the three grounds mentioned above.

By a vote of 4-3, the COMELEC <span style="font-style: italic;">En Banc </span>ordered the cancellation of the registration of SENIOR CITIZENS. The resolution explained that:<br><br><blockquote>It shall be recalled that on June 27, 2012, this Commission promulgated its resolution in a petition that involved SENIOR CITIZENS titled "In Re: Petition for Confirmation of Replacement of Resigned Party­ List Nominee" and docketed as EM No. 12-040.&nbsp; In the process of resolving the issues of said case, this Commission found that SENIOR CITIZENS nominees specifically nominees David L. K.ho and Francisco G. Datol, Jr. have entered into a term-:sharing agreement. x x x.<br><br>Nominee David K.ho's term as party-list congressman is three (3) years which starts on June 30, 2010 and to end on June 30, 2013 as directed no less than by the Constitution of the Philippines. Section 7, Article VI of the 1987 Constitution states:<br><br><blockquote><i>"Sec. 7.&nbsp; The Members of the House of Representatives shall be elected for a term of three years which shall begin, unless otherwise provided by law, at noon on the thirtieth day of June next following their election."</i></blockquote><br>But following the term-sharing agreement entered into by SENIOR CITIZENS, David Kho's term starts on June 30, 2010 and ends on December 31, 2011, the date of effectivity of Kho's resignation. By virtue of the term-sharing agreement, the term of Kho as member of the House of Representatives is cut short to one year and six months which is merely half of [the] three-year term. This is totally opposed to the prescription of the Constitution on the term of a Member of the House of Representatives. Hence, when confronted with this issue on term sharing done by SENIOR CITIZENS, this Commission made a categorical pronouncement that such term-sharing agreement must be rejected.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>From the foregoing, SENIOR CITIZENS failed to comply with Section 7, Article VI of the 1987 Constitution and Section 7, Rule 4 of Comelec Resolution No. 9366.

No. 204421, while the petition of the Arquiza Group was docketed as G.R. No. 204425. On December 11, 2012, the Court initially granted <i>status quo ante </i>orders on said petitions, directing the COMELEC to include the name of SENIOR CITIZENS in the printing of official ballots for the May 13, 2013 party-list elections.&nbsp; Eventually, both petitions were consolidated with the petition in <i>Atong Paglaum, Inc. v. Commission on Elections</i>, which was docketed as G.R. No. 203766.<br><br>On April 2, 2013, the Court promulgated its Decision in <i>Atong Paglaum</i>, which ordered the remand to the COMELEC of the petitions that have been granted mandatory injunctions to include the names of the petitioners in the printing of ballots.&nbsp; Following the parameters set forth in the Court's Decision, the COMELEC was to determine whether said petitioners, which included the two factions of SENIOR CITIZENS, were qualified to register under the party-list system and to participate in the May 13, 2013 elections. For this purpose, the Court stated that the COMELEC may conduct summary evidentiary hearings.<br><br>Thereafter, on May 10, 2013, the COMELEC <i>En Banc</i> rendered the assailed Omnibus Resolution in <b>SPP Nos. 12-157 (PLM) and 12-191 (PLM)</b>, ruling in this wise:<br><br><blockquote>Guided by these six new parameters [enunciated by the Court in <i>Atong Paglaum, Inc. v. Commission on Elections</i>], as well as the provisions of the Constitution, Republic Act No. 7941 ("R.A. No. 7941") or the Party-List System Act, and other pertinent election laws, and after a careful and exhaustive reevaluation of the documents submitted by the petitioners per their compliance with Resolution No. 9513 ("Res. No. 9513"), the Commission <i>En Banc</i> <b>RESOLVES</b> as follows:<br><br><b>I. SPP Nos. 12-157 (PLM) &amp; 12-191 (PLM)- SENIOR CITIZENS&nbsp; </b><br><br>To <b>DENY</b> the <i>Manifestations of Intent to Participate</i>, and to CANCEL the registration and accreditation, of petitioner Senior Citizens, for violating laws, rules, and regulations relating to elections pursuant to Section 6 (5) of R.A. No. 7941.<br><br>The Commission <span style="font-style: italic;">En Banc</span> finds no cogent reason to reverse its earlier finding in the <i>Resolution</i> for SPP Nos. 12-157 (PLM) &amp; 12-191 (PLM) promulgated on 04 December 2012, in relation to the <i>Resolution</i> for E.M. No. 12-040 promulgated on 27 June 2012. The sole ground for which the petitioner Senior Citizens was disqualified was because of the term-sharing agreement between its nominees, which the Commission <i>En Banc</i> found to be contrary to public policy. It will be noted that this ground is independent of the six parameters in <b><i>Atong Paglaum</i></b>, and there is nothing in the doctrine enunciated in that case which will absolve the petitioner Senior Citizen of what, to the Commission <span style="font-style: italic;">En Banc</span>, is a clear bastardization of the term of office fixed by Section 7, Article VI of the Constitution as implemented by Section 14 of R.A. No. 7941, which expressly provides that Members of the House of Representatives, including party-list representatives, <b><u>shall be elected for a term of three years</u>. A <i><b>term</b></i>, in the legal sense, is a fixed and definite period of time during which an officer may claim to hold office as a matter of right, <i>a fixed interval after which the several incumbents succeed one another</i>.</b> Thus, <b><u>service of the term is for the entire period; it cannot be broken down to accommodate those who are not entitled to hold the office</u></b>.<br><br>That the term-sharing agreement was made in 2010, while the expression of the policy prohibiting it was promulgated only in 2012 via Section 7, Rule 4 of Resolution No. 9366 ("Res. No. 9366"), is of no moment. As it was in 2010 as it is now, as it was in 1987 when the Constitution was ratified and as it was in 1995 when R.A. No. 7941 was enacted into law, the agreement was and is contrary to public policy because it subjects a <b><u>Constitutionally-ordained fixed term to hold public elective office</u></b> to contractual bargaining and negotiation, and treats the same as though it were nothing more than a contractual clause, an object in the ordinary course of the commerce of men. To accept this defense will not only open the floodgates to unscrupulous individuals, but more importantly it will render inutile Section 16 of R.A. No. 7941 which prescribes the procedure to be taken to fill a vacancy in the available seats for a party-list group or organization. For this mistake, the petitioner Senior Citizens cannot hide behind the veil of corporate fiction because the corporate veil can be pierced if necessary to achieve the ends of justice or equity, such as when it is used to defeat public convenience, justify wrong, or protect fraud. It further cannot invoke the prohibition in the enactment of <i>ex post facto</i> laws under Section 22, Article III of the Constitution because the guarantee only the retrospectivity of <b><u>penal laws</u></b> and definitely, Reso. No. 9366 is not penal in character.<br><br>From the foregoing, the cancellation of the registration and accreditation of the petitioner Senior Citizens is therefore in order, and consequently, the two <i>Manifestations of Intent to Participate</i> filed with the Commission should be denied.<br><br>xxxx<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Commission <i>En Banc</i> <b>RESOLVES</b>:<br><br>A.&nbsp; To <b>DENY</b> the <i>Manifestations of Intent to Participate,</i> and <b>CANCEL</b> the registration and accreditation, of the following parties, groups, or organizations:<br><br>(1)&nbsp; SPP No. 12-157 (PLM) &amp; SPP No. 12-191 (PLM) - <b>Coalition of Associations of Senior Citizens in the Philippines, Inc.;</b><br><br>xxxx<br><br>Accordingly, the foregoing shall be <b>REMOVED</b> from the registry of party-list groups and organizations of the Commission, and shall <b>NOT BE ALLOWED</b> to <b>PARTICIPATE</b> as a candidate for the Party-List System of Representation for the 13 May 2013 Elections and subsequent elections thereafter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> (Citations omitted.)</blockquote><br>On May 13, 2013, the elections proceeded.

The Arquiza Group maintains that SENIOR CITIZENS was summoned only to a single hearing date in the afternoon of August 24, 2012 and the COMELEC's review therein focused on the group's programs, accomplishments, and other related matters. The Arquiza Group asserts that SENIOR CITIZENS was not advised, before or during the hearing, that the issue of the term-sharing agreement would constitute a basis for the review of its registration and accreditation.<br><br>Likewise, the Datol Group faults the COMELEC for cancelling the registration and accreditation of SENIOR CITIZENS without giving the latter the opportunity to show that it complied with the parameters laid down in <i>Atong Paglaum</i>. The Arquiza Group confirms that after the promulgation of <i>Atong Paglaum</i>, the COMELEC conducted summary hearings in executive sessions, without informing SENIOR CITIZENS. The Arquiza Group says that it filed a "Very Urgent Motion To Set Case For Hearing Or To Be Included In The Hearing Set On Thursday, May 9, 2013," but its counsel found that SENIOR CITIZENS was not included in the hearings wherein other party-list groups were heard by the COMELEC. The Arquiza Group subsequently filed on May 10, 2013 a "2nd Very Urgent Motion To Set Case For Public Hearing," but the same was also not acted upon. The Arquiza Group alleges that it only found out after the elections that the assailed May 10, 2013 Omnibus Resolution was issued and the Arquiza Group was not actually served a copy thereof.<br><br>Section 6 of Republic Act No. 7941<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> provides for the procedure relative to the review of the registration of party-list organizations, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 6. <i>Refusal and/or Cancellation of Registration</i>. - The COMELEC may, <span style="font-style: italic;">motu proprio</span> or upon verified complaint of any interested party, refuse or cancel, <b>after due notice and hearing</b>, the registration of any national, regional or sectoral party, organization or coalition on any of the following grounds:<br><br>(1) It is a religious sect or denomination, organization or association organized for religious purposes;<br><br>(2) It advocates violence or unlawful means to seek its goal; (3) It is a foreign party or organization;<br><br>(4) It is receiving support from any foreign government, foreign political party, foundation, organization, whether directly or through any of its officers or members or indirectly through third parties for partisan election purposes;<br><br>(5) It violates or fails to comply with laws, rules or regulations relating to elections;<br><br>(6) It declares untruthful statements in its petition;<br><br>(7) It has ceased to exist for at least one (1) year; or<br><br>(8) It fails to participate in the last two (2) preceding elections or fails to obtain at least two <i>per centum</i> (2%) of the votes cast under the party-list system in the two (2) preceding elections for the constituency in which it has registered.</blockquote><br><br>Unquestionably, the twin requirements of due notice and hearing are indispensable before the COMELEC may properly order the cancellation of the registration and accreditation of a party-list organization. In connection with this, the Court lengthily discussed in <i>Mendoza v. Commission on Elections</i> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> the concept of due process as applied to the COMELEC. We emphasized therein that:<br><br><blockquote>The appropriate due process standards that apply to the COMELEC, as an administrative or quasi-judicial tribunal, are those outlined in the seminal case of <i>Ang Tibay v. Court of Industrial Relations</i>, quoted below:<br><br>(1) <b>The first of these rights is the right to a hearing, which includes the right of the party interested or affected to present his own case and submit evidence in support thereof</b>. x x x.<br><br>(2) Not only must the party be given an opportunity to present his case and to adduce evidence tending to establish the rights which he asserts but the tribunal must consider the evidence presented.<br><br>(3) While the duty to deliberate does not impose the obligation to decide right, it does imply a necessity which cannot be disregarded, namely, that of having something to support its decision. A decision with absolutely nothing to support it is a nullity, a place when directly attached.<br><br>(4) Not only must there be some evidence to support a finding or conclusion, but the evidence must be "substantial." "Substantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion."<br><br>(5) The decision must be rendered on the evidence presented at the hearing, or at least contained in the record and disclosed to the parties affected.<br><br>(6) The Court of Industrial Relations or any of its judges, therefore, must act on its or his own independent consideration of the law and facts of the controversy, and not simply accept the views of a subordinate in arriving at a decision.<br><br>(7) The Court of Industrial Relations should, in all controversial questions, render its decision in such a manner that the parties to the proceeding can know the various issues involved, and the reasons for the decisions rendered. The performance of this duty is inseparable from the authority conferred upon it.<br><br>These are now commonly referred to as <b>cardinal primary rights</b> tn administrative proceedings.<br><br><b>The first of the enumerated rights pertain to the substantive rights of a party at hearing stage of the proceedings. The essence of this aspect of due process, we have consistently held, is simply the opportunity to be heard, or as applied to administrative proceedings, an opportunity to explain one's side or an opportunity to seek a reconsideration of the action or ruling complained of. A formal or trial-type hearing is not at all times and in all instances essential</b>; in the case of COMELEC, Rule 17 of its Rules of Procedure defines the requirements for a hearing and these serve as the standards in the determination of the presence or denial of due process.<br><br>The second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth aspects of the <i>Ang Tibay</i> requirements are reinforcements of the right to a hearing and are the inviolable rights applicable at the <b>deliberative stage</b>, as the decision­ maker decides on the evidence presented during the hearing. These standards set forth the guiding considerations in deliberating on the case and are the material and substantial components of decision-making. <i>Briefly, the tribunal must consider the totality of the evidence presented which must all be found in the records of the case (i.e., those presented or submitted by the parties); the conclusion, reached by the decision-maker himself and not by a subordinate, must be based on substantial evidence</i>.<br><br>Finally, the last requirement, relating to the form and substance of the decision of a quasi-judicial body, further complements the hearing and decision-making due process rights and is similar in substance to the constitutional requirement that a decision of a court must state distinctly the facts and the law upon which it is based. As a component of the rule of fairness that underlies due process, this is the "duty to give reason" to enable the affected person to understand how the rule of fairness has been administered in his case, to expose the reason to public scrutiny and criticism, and to ensure that the decision will be thought through by the decision-maker.

Contrary to the claim of COMELEC, however, said hearing was conducted for purposes of discussing the petition of the Arquiza Group in <b>E.M. No. 12-040</b>. To recall, said petition asked for the confirmation of the replacement of Rep. Kho, who had tendered his resignation effective on December 31, 2011.&nbsp; More specifically, the transcript of the hearing reveals that the focus thereof was on the petition filed by the Arquiza group and its subsequent manifestation, praying that the group be allowed to withdraw its petition. Also, during the hearing, COMELEC Chairman Brillantes did admonish the rival factions of SENIOR CITIZENS about their conflicts and warned them about the complications brought about by their term-sharing agreement. However, E.M. No. 12-040 was not a proceeding regarding the qualifications of SENIOR CITIZENS as a party-list group and the issue of whether the term-sharing agreement may be a ground for disqualification was neither raised nor resolved in that case. Chairman Brillantes's remonstration was not sufficient as to constitute a fair warning that the term-sharing agreement would be considered as a ground for the cancellation of SENIOR CITIZENS' registration and accreditation.<br><br>Furthermore, after the promulgation of <i>Atong Paglaum</i>, which remanded, among other cases, the disqualification cases involving SENIOR CITIZENS, said organization should have still been afforded the opportunity to be heard on the matter of the term-sharing agreement, either through a hearing or through written memoranda. This was the proper recourse considering that the COMELEC was about to arrive at a final determination as to the qualification of SENIOR CITIZENS. Instead, the COMELEC issued the May 10,2013 Omnibus Resolution in SPP No. 12-157 (PLM) and SPP No. 12-191 (PLM) without conducting any further proceedings thereon after its receipt of our Decision in <i>Atong Paglaum</i>.<br><br><b><i><u>The Prohibition on Term-sharing</u></i></b><br><br>The second issue both raised by the petitioners herein constitute the threshold legal issue of the instant cases: whether the COMELEC committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction when it issued the assailed Omnibus Resolution, disqualifying and cancelling the registration and accreditation of SENIOR CITIZENS solely on account of its purported violation of the prohibition against term-sharing.<br><br>The Datol Group argues that the public policy prohibiting term­ sharing was provided for under Section 7, Rule 4 of COMELEC Resolution No. 9366, which was promulgated only on February 21, 2012. Hence, the resolution should not be made to apply retroactively to the case of SENIOR CITIZENS as nothing therein provides for its retroactive effect. When the term-sharing agreement was executed in 2010, the same was not yet expressly proscribed by any law or resolution.<br><br>Furthermore, the Datol Group points out that the mere execution of the Irrevocable Covenant between the nominees of SENIOR CITIZENS for the 2010 elections should not have been a ground for the cancellation of the organization's registration and accreditation because the nominees never actually implemented the agreement.<br><br>In like manner, the Arquiza Group vehemently stresses that no term­ sharing actually transpired between the nominees of SENIOR CITIZENS. It explained that whatever prior arrangements were made by the nominees on the term-sharing agreement, the same did not materialize given that the resignation of Rep. Kho was disapproved by the Board of Trustees and the members of SENIOR CITIZENS.<br><br>Still, granting for the sake of argument that the term-sharing agreement was actually implemented, the Arquiza Group points out that SENIOR CITIZENS still cannot be held to have violated Section 7 of Resolution No. 9366. The term-sharing agreement was entered into in 2010 or two years prior to the promulgation of said resolution on February 21, 2012. Likewise, assuming that the resolution can be applied retroactively, the Arquiza Group contends that the same cannot affect SENIOR CITIZENS at it already earned a vested right in 2010 as party-list organization.<br><br>Article 4 of the Civil Code states that "[l]aws shall have no retroactive effect, unless the contrary is provided." As held in <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Reyes</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> "[t]he general rule is that statutes are prospective. However, statutes that are remedial, or that do not create new or take away vested rights, do not fall under the general rule against the retroactive operation of statutes." We also reiterated in <i>Lintag and Arrastia v. National Power Corporation</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> that: &nbsp;<br><br><blockquote>It is a well-entrenched principle that statutes, including administrative rules and regulations, operate prospectively unless the legislative intent to the contrary is manifest by express terms or by necessary implication because the retroactive application of a law usually divests rights that have already become vested. This is based on the Latin maxim: <i>Lex prospicit non respicit </i>(the law looks forward, not backward). (Citations omitted.)</blockquote><br>True, COMELEC Resolution No. 9366 does not provide that it shall have retroactive effect. Nonetheless, the Court cannot subscribe to the argument of the Arquiza Group that SENIOR CITIZENS already earned a vested right to its registration as a party-list organization.<br><br><i>Montesclaros v. Commission on Eleetions</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> teaches that "[a] public office is not a property right. As the Constitution expressly states, a '[P]ublic office is a public trust.' No one has a vested right to any public office, much less a vested right to an expectancy of holding a public office." Under Section 2(5), Article IX-C of the Constitution, the COMELEC is entrusted with the function to "[r]egister, after sufficient publication, political parties, organizations, or coalitions which, in addition to other requirements, must present their platform or program of government." In fulfilling this function, the COMELEC is duty-bound to review the grant of registration to parties, organizations, or coalitions already registered in order to ensure the latter's continuous adherence to the requirements prescribed by law and the relevant rulings of this Court relative to their qualifications and eligibility to participate in party-list elections.<br><br>The Arquiza Group cannot, therefore, object to the retroactive application of COMELEC Resolution No. 9366 on the ground of the impairment of SENIOR CITIZENS' vested right.<br><br>Be that as it may, even if COMELEC Resolution No. 9366 expressly provided for its retroactive application, the Court finds that the COMELEC <i>En Banc</i> indeed erred in cancelling the registration and accreditation of SENIOR CITIZENS.<br><br>The reason for this is that the ground invoked by the COMELEC <i>En Banc, i.e</i>., the term-sharing agreement among the nominees of SENIOR CITIZENS, was not implemented. This fact was manifested by the Arquiza Group even during the April 18, 2012 hearing conducted by the COMELEC <i>En Banc</i> in E.M. No. 12-040 wherein the Arquiza Group manifested that it was withdrawing its petition for confirmation and approval of Rep. Kho's replacement. Thereafter, in its Resolution dated June 27, 2012 in E.M. No. 12-040, the COMELEC <i>En Banc</i> itself refused to recognize the term-sharing agreement and the tender of resignation of Rep. Kho. The COMELEC even declared that no vacancy was created despite the execution of the said agreement. Subsequently, there was also no indication that the nominees of SENIOR CITIZENS still tried to implement, much less succeeded in implementing, the term-sharing agreement. Before this Court, the Arquiza Group and the Datol Group insist on this fact of non-implementation of the agreement. Thus, for all intents and purposes, Rep. Kho continued to hold his seat and served his term as a member of the House of Representatives, in accordance with COMELEC Resolution No. 9366 and the COMELEC <i>En Banc</i> ruling in E.M. No. 12-040. Curiously, the COMELEC is silent on this point.<br><br>Indubitably, if the term-sharing agreement was not actually implemented by the parties thereto, it appears that SENIOR CITIZENS, as a party-list organization, had been unfairly and arbitrarily penalized by the COMELEC <i>En Banc</i>. Verily, how can there be disobedience on the part of SENIOR CITIZENS when its nominees, in fact, desisted from carrying out their agreement? Hence, there was no violation of an election law, rule, or regulation to speak of.&nbsp; Clearly then, the disqualification of SENIOR CITIZENS and the cancellation of its registration and accreditation have no legal leg to stand on.<br><br>In sum, the due process violations committed in this case and the lack of a legal ground to disqualify the SENIOR CITIZENS spell out a finding of grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction pn the part of the COMELEC En Banc. We are, thus, left with no choice but to strike down the assailed Omnibus Resolution dated May 10, 2013 in SPP No. 12-157 (PLM) and SPP No. 12-191 (PLM).<br><br>In light of the foregoing discussion, the Court finds no need to discuss the other issues raised by the petitioners. In particular, the dispute between the rival factions of SENIOR CITIZENS, not being an issue raised here, should be threshed out in separate proceedings before the proper tribunal having jurisdiction thereon.<br><br>Having established that the COMELEC <i>En Banc</i> erred in ordering the disqualification of SENIOR CITIZENS and the cancellation of its registration and accreditation, said organization is entitled to be proclaimed as one of the winning party-list organizations in the recently concluded May 13,2013 elections.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court hereby rules that:<br><br>(1)&nbsp; The Extremely Very Urgent Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> (With Prayer for the Forthwith Issuance of a Writ of Preliminary Injunction and Temporary Restraining Order [TRO] and/or Status Quo Ante Order [SQAO]) in G.R.
