It also argued that even assuming the documents were genuine, Dy and Mercado could still be held liable for the bank’s loss because they acted in excess of their authority since they approved the transaction without the approval by the Board of Directors and contrary to bank practice and procedure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Marina, Tanjutco, and Alindogan denied any liability. They alleged that, assuming they received said amount from the bank, it was by way of a loan, which was not yet due at the time of the filing of the case before the RTC, and secured by the corporate earnings of Marina. If at all, any liability should be borne by Marina alone, they averred.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>They further alleged that the bank was bound by its officers’ actions and could not belatedly repudiate such actions by claiming that these transactions were irregular, fraudulent, and prejudicial to it. They claimed to have transacted with Philbank’s officers in good faith, honestly believing that the latter were acting under the authority given to them by the bank.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, Dy denied that she conspired with Tanjutco and Alindogan to defraud Philbank.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> She alleged that, while she had general supervision of Area II – which includes the Balintawak branch – her participation in every transaction was not indispensable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> She stated that she was never aware of any false pretenses committed by Tanjutco and Alindogan and that she never authorized the purchase of the alleged fraudulent documents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Mercado, for his part, also denied any liability, alleging that all the transactions were “handled in accordance with standard operating procedures and were referred to and duly approved by his immediate superior, defendant Virginia Judy Dy.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> He averred that the subject transactions were “considered at the instance of and approved by defendant Virginia Judy Dy who is the Assistant Vice-President and Area Head of plaintiff bank, and under whose jurisdiction, direction and supervision defendant works as branch manager[.]”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Mercado also narrated that it was Dy who brought Marina in as Philbank’s client when she joined the bank on 15 January 1989 since it was one of her clients in the bank where she was previously employed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br><center><b><u>The Ruling of the RTC</u></b></center><br>In a Decision dated 14 July 1997, the RTC rendered judgment, the dispositive portion of which states:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, [the] foregoing premises considered, defendant Marina is held solely liable to the plaintiff and is hereby ordered to pay the plaintiff the following:<br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"><div align="JUSTIFY">a)</div></td> <td width="95%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">to pay the plaintiff the sum of US$1,538,049.49 or equivalent to P21.923 to US$ 1.00;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">b) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">to pay 10% of the total amount due, as and for attorney’s fees[;] and</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">c)</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">cost of suit.<br></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>The complaint against Tanjutco, Alindogan, Spouses Judy Dy and Gabriel Dy, Mercado and ICSI, together with their respective counterclaims and the crossclaim against Marina, Tanjutco, Alindogan, Spouses Judy Dy and Gabriel Dy, [and] Mercado, are hereby DISMISSED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></blockquote><br>The RTC held that since the bank could not obtain reimbursements due to Marina’s failure to surrender the negotiable shipping documents, “[a]n obligation on the part of Marina then clearly arose and [Philbank]’s right to sue to recover the said amount [was] undeniable.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> It further stated that the evident negligence of the bank’s officers “does not exculpate defendant Marina from the fact that it owes plaintiff bank the amount covered by the subject export document[s].”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Thus, the RTC ruled that the obligation to pay Philbank was Marina’s corporate liability, and consequently, dismissed the complaint against Tanjutco, Alindogan, the Dy spouses, and Mercado.<br><br><center><b><u>The Ruling of the CA</u></b></center><br>Philbank appealed the RTC decision to the CA.<br><br>In the assailed 22 July 2004 decision, the CA affirmed with modification the RTC decision, to wit:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, we hereby <b>AFFIRM</b> the lower court’s decision with the <b>MODIFICATION</b> that the defendants-appellees Caezar Tanjutco, Joel Alindogan[,] and Virginia Judy Dy are held jointly and solidarily liable with MARINA for the reliefs awarded by the lower court, with interest on the principal sum at 12% per annum from the time of the judicial demand.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)</blockquote><br>The CA held Marina, Tanjutco, and Alindogan liable for the amounts that Philbank paid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> The CA ruled that “[w]hen the officers of MARINA failed or refused to submit the original bills of lading, MARINA violated the condition under which payment by Philbank was made, and hence, is liable for the return of the amounts paid.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>The CA pointed out that Tanjutco and Alindogan represented Marina in all its banking transactions with Philbank. The documents Marina’s officers negotiated with the bank were marked “non-negotiable” but the same were accepted by the bank upon Tanjutco and Alindogan’s promise that the original copies of the bills of lading would be presented later on.<br><br>The CA also noted that Philbank sent various demand letters to the forwarders that issued the non-negotiable bills of lading because the bills contained a remark that the goods were already on board. That statement turned out to be an act of misrepresentation by Tanjutco and Alindogan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>As to the liability of the bank’s officers, the CA upheld the RTC’s judgment absolving Mercado of liability but reversed the finding on Dy’s guilt. The CA ruled that Dy was jointly and solidarily liable with Marina, Tanjutco, and Alindogan. The CA stated that “the transactions under question transpired because of Judy Dy’s approval.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>The CA also held that Dy’s testimony on her functions as bank manager was not believable because it “def[ied] logic, reason and common experience.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> The CA noted that Dy claimed to have no authority to approve Marina’s transactions since loan transactions were approved by the head office based on the recommendation of the branch manager (Mercado). She claimed that because of the volume of her work, there were some loans she did not know of but still recommended because Mercado recommended them. She further claimed that she did not read all the papers brought to her to sign because she did not have enough time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>If Dy were truthful, the Court stated, it would appear that, as Philbank’s Assistant Vice President, she had no substantial duties or authority; she could not approve anything; she had no control of bank operations (she claimed it was Mercado who oversaw daily operations); and she would sign important documents without reading them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> The CA concluded that, contrary to her claims, Dy approved the transactions subject of this case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Further, the CA noted that although there is no direct evidence of conspiracy between Marina and Dy, “circumstances, if read together, point to a concert of action directed towards the same end.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> The CA stated that Tanjutco and Alindogan made it appear that goods were on board the carrier, with all the necessary government clearances. Thereafter, the only missing component to secure Philbank’s payment was the acceptance of the non-negotiable bills of lading, which only Dy could provide. The CA held that Marina’s non-submission of the original bills of lading evinced not only a failure to comply with the bank’s requirements but a mode to divest Philbank of its funds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Thus, the CA concluded that there was collusion among Tanjutco, Alindogan, and Dy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br><center><b><u>The Issue</u></b><br></center><br>Petitioners raise this sole issue:<br><br><blockquote>WHETHER OR NOT THE RESPONDENT PHILBANK’S EVIDENCE HAVE SUFFICIENTLY PROVED THAT PETITIONER JUDY DY WAS IN CONSPIRACY/COLLUSION WITH DEFENDANTS MARINA, TANJUTCO AND ALINDOGAN TO DEFRAUD RESPONDENT OF THE VALUE OF THE SUBJECT EXPORTS SHIPPING DOCUMENTS.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></blockquote><br><center><b><u>The Court’s Ruling</u></b><br></center><br>The Court denies the petition and affirms the decision of the CA.<br><br>The evidence on record clearly bears out Dy’s liability. Based on the testimonies of the witnesses, Dy brought in Marina’s account to Philbank<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> and she directly transacted with Marina’s officers. Mercado testified:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Why do you know that there are non-negotiable Bills of Lading?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A:</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">The form itself states “non-negotiable copy”.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">And why were these accepted by your bank?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">This was approved on the promise that they will produce or present to us the original Bills of Lading, the negotiable Bills of Lading.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">And to whom was this promise or statement to produce the negotiable or original Bills of Lading made?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A:</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">This was promised to Mrs. Dy.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">And who made this promise?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A:</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Joel Alindogan and Cezar Tanjutco.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">And why do you know that there was such a promise made to Mrs. Dy?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Because when we made follow up on these lacking documents, they would tell us[, “I]t is being arranged with Mrs. Dy and we promised her that we will produce the original Bills of Lading[”].<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br></blockquote>More importantly, there would have been no completed transaction without Dy’s approval. <b>Her act of approving the transaction was the single most important factor that allowed Tanjutco and Alindogan’s scheme to succeed.</b><br><br>As the CA noted, only Dy could have supplied the key element that Tanjutco and Alindogan needed: the bank’s approval. Mercado, by himself, could not approve the subject transactions. He had no such authority. He only signed the export documents because Dy approved the same.

Abalos testified that Dy acted beyond her authority, considering that the transaction was not considered a “regular” bank transaction.<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="JUSTIFY">A: </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Well, immediately when we discovered these things, that there were numerous unpaid export bills, what we did is we asked them to submit all these supposedly export bills, that the (sic) supposedly purchased and paid.

So, normally, once the bank or any bank purchased an export bills. (sic) these are being sent to the corresponding bank for reimbursement. In this case, the branch was holding all these supposedly export bills because there was no original Bills of Lading. If there is (sic) not original Bills of Lading and the terms and conditions of the Letters of Credit expressly stated that it has to be supported by a negotiable Bills of Lading, then it cannot be sent for reimbursement abroad, so in this particular case, it was never been sent by the branch because there was an irregular practice in this particular transaction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">x x x x</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Now, you said that per your audit, these export bills, while accompanied only by a non-negotiable Bills of Lading were negotiated and defendant Marina International Marketing Corporation was able to get payment of these export bills.

Dy knew that Marina could not present the negotiable Bills of Lading; yet, she still approved the purchase of Marina’s export bills.<br><br>Tanjutco and Alindogan were holding non-negotiable export documents, which they knew they could not negotiate with any other bank in the regular course of business. Thus, the assurance of Dy’s approval was indispensable to their plans. They had to secure it beforehand, or they would not have implemented the scheme knowing that the outcome was uncertain and could have possibly exposed them to liability. They would not have engaged in the elaborate scheme – concocting fictitious export bills and making them appear to have gone through all the necessary government procedures – if they were not assured of success in the end.<br><br>Dy tried to convince the trial court that she should not be held liable for the subject transactions. In her desperation, she even made herself appear as an inconsequential bank officer without power or authority normally given to officers in her position, downplayed her knowledge of banking procedures, and allowed herself to be painted as a negligent officer who would simply sign anything her staff hands to her without reading them.<br><br>It is difficult for the Court to believe that someone in Dy’s position, and with her years of experience in the banking sector, could not have known the grave implication and consequent effect of her action. Nor is this Court inclined to accept Dy’s claim of incompetence and negligence. The more logical conclusion is that Dy was fully aware that Tanjutco and Alindogan were out to defraud Philbank and allowed herself to be part of the scheme. For that, she must be held accountable.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, we <b>DENY</b> the petition.
