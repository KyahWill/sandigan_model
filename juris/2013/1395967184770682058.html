Pork Barrel: General Concept.</b><br><br>"Pork Barrel” is political parlance of American-English origin.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Historically, its usage may be traced to the degrading ritual of rolling out a barrel stuffed with pork to a multitude of black slaves who would cast their famished bodies into the porcine feast to assuage their hunger with morsels coming from the generosity of their well-fed master.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> This practice was later compared to the actions of American legislators in trying to direct federal budgets in favor of their districts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> While the advent of refrigeration has made the actual pork barrel obsolete, it persists in reference to political bills that "bring home the bacon” to a legislator‘s district and constituents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> In a more technical sense, "Pork Barrel” refers to <b>an appropriation of government spending meant for localized projects</b> and <b>secured solely or primarily to bring money to a representative's district</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Some scholars on the subject further use it to refer to <b>legislative control of local appropriations</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>In the Philippines, "Pork Barrel” has been commonly referred to as lump-sum, discretionary funds of Members of the Legislature,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> although, as will be later discussed, its usage would evolve in reference to certain funds of the Executive.<br><br>II. History of Congressional Pork Barrel in the Philippines.<br><br>A. Pre-Martial Law Era (1922-1972).<br><br>Act 3044,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> or the Public Works Act of <b>1922</b>, is considered<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> as the earliest form of "Congressional Pork Barrel” in the Philippines since the utilization of the funds appropriated therein were subjected to post- enactment legislator approval. Particularly, in the area of fund release, Section 3<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> provides that the sums appropriated for certain public works projects<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> "shall be <b>distributed</b> x x x <b>subject to the approval of a joint committee elected by the Senate and the House of Representatives.</b>” "[T]he committee from each House may [also] authorize one of its members to approve the distribution made by the Secretary of Commerce and Communications.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Also, in the area of fund realignment, the same section provides that the said secretary, <b>"with the approval of said joint committee, or of the authorized members thereof</b>, may, for the purposes of said distribution, <b>transfer unexpended portions</b> of any item of appropriation under this Act to any other item hereunder.”<br><br>In <b>1950</b>, it has been documented<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> that post-enactment legislator participation broadened from the areas of fund release and realignment to the area of project identification. During that year, the mechanics of the public works act was modified to the extent that the discretion of choosing projects was transferred from the Secretary of Commerce and Communications to legislators. "For the first time, the law carried a list of projects selected by Members of Congress, they 'being the representatives of the people, either on their own account or by consultation with local officials or civil leaders.‘“<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> During this period, the pork barrel process commenced with local government councils, civil groups, and individuals appealing to Congressmen or Senators for projects. Petitions that were accommodated formed part of a legislator‘s allocation, and the amount each legislator would eventually get is determined in a caucus convened by the majority. The amount was then integrated into the administration bill prepared by the Department of Public Works and Communications. Thereafter, the Senate and the House of Representatives added their own provisions to the bill until it was signed into law by the President – the Public Works Act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> In the <b>1960</b>‘s, however, pork barrel legislation reportedly ceased in view of the stalemate between the House of Representatives and the Senate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br><b>B. Martial Law Era (1972-1986).</b><br><br>While the previous "Congressional Pork Barrel” was apparently discontinued in <b>1972</b> after Martial Law was declared, an era when "one man controlled the legislature,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> the reprieve was only temporary. By 1982, the Batasang Pambansa had already introduced a new item in the General Appropriations Act (GAA) called the "<b>Support for Local Development Projects</b>” (SLDP) under the article on "National Aid to Local Government Units”. Based on reports,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> it was under the SLDP that <b>the practice of giving lump-sum allocations to individual legislators began</b>, with each assemblyman receiving P500,000.00. Thereafter, assemblymen would <b>communicate their project preferences</b> to the Ministry of Budget and Management for approval. Then, the said ministry would release the allocation papers to the Ministry of Local Governments, which would, in turn, issue the checks to the city or municipal treasurers in the assemblyman‘s locality. It has been further reported that "Congressional Pork Barrel” projects under the SLDP also began to cover not only public works projects, or so-called "hard projects”, but also "soft projects”,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> or non-public works projects such as those which would fall under the categories of, among others, education, health and livelihood.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br><b>C. Post-Martial Law Era: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corazon Cojuangco Aquino Administration (1986-1992).&nbsp; </b><br><br>After the EDSA People Power Revolution in 1986 and the restoration of Philippine democracy, "Congressional Pork Barrel” was revived in the form of the <b>"Mindanao Development Fund”</b> and the <b>"Visayas Development Fund”</b> which were created with lump-sum appropriations of P480 Million and P240 Million, respectively, for the funding of development projects in the Mindanao and Visayas areas in <b>1989</b>. It has been documented<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> that the clamor raised by the Senators and the Luzon legislators for a similar funding, prompted the creation of the <b>"Countrywide Development Fund”</b> (CDF) which was integrated into the <b>1990</b> GAA<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> with an initial funding of P2.3 Billion to cover "small local infrastructure and other priority community projects.”<br><br>Under the GAAs for the years <b>1991</b> and <b>1992</b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> CDF funds were, with the approval of the President, to be released directly to the implementing agencies but "<b>subject to the submission of the required list of projects and activities.</b>” Although the GAAs from 1990 to 1992 were silent as to the amounts of allocations of the individual legislators, as well as their participation in the identification of projects, it has been reported<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> that by <b>1992</b>, Representatives were receiving P12.5 Million each in CDF funds, while Senators were receiving P18 Million each, without any limitation or qualification, and that <b>they could identify any kind of project</b>, from hard or infrastructure projects such as roads, bridges, and buildings to "soft projects” such as textbooks, medicines, and scholarships.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br><b>D. Fidel Valdez Ramos (Ramos) Administration (1992-1998).</b><br><br>The following year, or in <b>1993</b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> the GAA explicitly stated that the release of CDF funds was to be made <b>upon the submission of the list of projects and activities identified by, among others, individual legislators</b>. For the first time, the 1993 CDF Article <b>included an allocation for the Vice-President</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> As such, Representatives were allocated P12.5 Million each in CDF funds, Senators, P18 Million each, and the Vice- President, P20 Million.<br><br>In <b>1994</b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> <b>1995</b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> and <b>1996</b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> the GAAs contained the same provisions on project identification and fund release as found in the 1993 CDF Article. In addition, however, the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) was directed to <b>submit reports</b> to the Senate Committee on Finance and the <b>House Committee on Appropriations</b> on the <b>releases</b> made from the funds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Under the <b>1997</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> CDF Article, Members of Congress and the Vice- President, <b>in consultation with the implementing agency</b> concerned, were directed to submit to the DBM the list of 50% of projects to be funded from their respective CDF allocations which shall be duly endorsed by (<i>a</i>) the Senate President and the Chairman of the Committee on Finance, in the case of the Senate, and (<i>b</i>) the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Chairman of the Committee on Appropriations, in the case of the House of Representatives; while the list for the remaining 50% was to be submitted within six (6) months thereafter. The same article also stated that the project list, which would be published by the DBM,<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[35]</sup></font> "<b>shall be the basis for the release of funds</b>” and that "<b>[n]o funds appropriated herein shall be disbursed for projects not included in the list herein required.</b>”<br><br>The following year, or in <b>1998</b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> the foregoing provisions regarding the required lists and endorsements were reproduced, except that the publication of the project list was no longer required as the list itself sufficed for the release of CDF Funds.<br><br>The CDF was not, however, the lone form of "Congressional Pork Barrel” at that time. Other forms of "Congressional Pork Barrel” were reportedly fashioned and inserted into the GAA (called "<b>Congressional Insertions</b>” or "CIs”) in order to perpetuate the administration‘s political agenda.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> It has been articulated that since CIs "formed <b>part and parcel of the budgets of executive departments</b>, they were not <b>easily identifiable and were thus harder to monitor</b>.” Nonetheless, the lawmakers themselves as well as the finance and budget officials of the implementing agencies, as well as the DBM, purportedly knew about the insertions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Examples of these CIs are the Department of Education (DepEd) School Building Fund, the Congressional Initiative Allocations, the Public Works Fund, the El Niño Fund, and the Poverty Alleviation Fund.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> The allocations for the School Building Fund, particularly, "shall be made upon <b>prior consultation with the representative of the legislative district </b>concerned.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Similarly, <b>the legislators had the power to direct how, where and when</b> these appropriations were to be spent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br><b>E. Joseph Ejercito Estrada (Estrada) Administration (1998-2001).</b><br><br>In 1999,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> the CDF was removed in the GAA and replaced by three (3) separate forms of CIs, namely, the "Food Security Program Fund,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> the <i>"Lingap Para Sa Mahihirap Program Fund,</i>”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> and the "Rural/Urban Development Infrastructure Program Fund,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> all of which contained a special provision requiring “prior consultation” with the Members of Congress for the release of the funds.<br><br>It was in the year <b>2000</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> that the "<b>Priority Development Assistance Fund</b>” (PDAF) appeared in the GAA. The requirement of "prior consultation with the respective Representative of the District” before PDAF funds were directly released to the implementing agency concerned was explicitly stated in the 2000 PDAF Article. Moreover, <b>realignment of funds</b> to any expense category was expressly allowed, with the sole condition that no amount shall be used to fund personal services and other personnel benefits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> The succeeding PDAF provisions remained the same in view of the re-enactment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> of the 2000 GAA for the year <b>2001.</b><br><br><b>F. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (Arroyo) Administration (2001-2010).</b><br><br>The <b>2002</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> PDAF Article was brief and straightforward as it merely contained a single special provision ordering the release of the funds directly to the implementing agency or local government unit concerned, without further qualifications. The following year, <b>2003</b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> the same single provision was present, with simply an expansion of purpose and express authority to realign. Nevertheless, the provisions in the 2003 budgets of the Department of Public Works and Highways<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> (DPWH) and the DepEd<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> <b>required prior consultation with Members of Congress</b> on the aspects of implementation delegation and project list submission, respectively. In <b>2004</b>, the 2003 GAA was re-enacted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>In <b>2005</b>, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> the PDAF Article provided that the PDAF shall be used "to fund priority programs and projects under the ten point agenda of the national government and shall be released directly to the implementing agencies.” It also introduced the program menu concept,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> which is essentially a <b>list of general programs and implementing agencies from which a particular PDAF project may be subsequently chosen by the identifying authority</b>. The 2005 GAA was re-enacted<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> in 2006 and hence, operated on the same bases. In similar regard, the program menu concept was consistently integrated into the <b>2007</b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> <b>2008</b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> <b>2009</b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> and 2010<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> GAAs.<br><br><b>Textually</b>, the PDAF Articles from 2002 to 2010 were <b>silent</b> with respect to the specific amounts allocated for the individual legislators, as well as their participation in the proposal and identification of PDAF projects to be funded. In contrast to the PDAF Articles, however, the provisions under the DepEd School Building Program and the DPWH budget, similar to its predecessors, explicitly required <b>prior consultation with the concerned Member of Congress</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> anent certain aspects of project implementation.<br><br>Significantly, it was during this era that provisions which <b>allowed formal participation of non-governmental organizations (NGO) in the implementation of government projects</b> were introduced. In the Supplemental Budget for 2006, with respect to the appropriation for school buildings, NGOs were, by law, encouraged to participate. For such purpose, the law stated that "the amount of at least P250 Million of the P500 Million allotted for the construction and completion of school buildings <b>shall be made available to NGOs</b> including the Federation of Filipino-Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry, Inc. for its "Operation Barrio School” program[,] with capability and proven track records in the construction of public school buildings x x x.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> The same allocation was made available to NGOs in the 2007 and 2009 GAAs under the DepEd Budget.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> Also, it was in 2007 that the <b>Government Procurement Policy Board</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> (GPPB) issued <b>Resolution No. 12-2007 dated June 29, 2007</b> (GPPB Resolution 12-2007), amending the implementing rules and regulations<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> of RA 9184,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> the Government Procurement Reform Act, to include, as a form of negotiated procurement,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> the procedure whereby the Procuring Entity<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> (the implementing agency) may enter into a <b>memorandum of agreement </b>with an NGO, <b>provided</b> that "an appropriation law or ordinance earmarks an amount to be specifically contracted out to NGOs.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br><b>G.

The same provision also allowed the Secretaries of Education, Health, Social Welfare and Development, Interior and Local Government, Environment and Natural Resources, Energy, and Public Works and Highways to realign PDAF Funds, with the further conditions that: (<i>a</i>) realignment is within the same implementing unit and same project category as the original project, for infrastructure projects; (<i>b</i>) allotment released has not yet been obligated for the original scope of work, and (<i>c</i>) the request for realignment is with the concurrence of the legislator concerned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br>In the <b>2012</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> and <b>2013</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> PDAF Articles, it is stated that the "[i]dentification of projects and/or designation of beneficiaries shall conform to the priority list, standard or design prepared by each implementing agency [(priority list requirement)] x x x.” However, as practiced, it would still be the individual legislator who would choose and identify the project from the said priority list.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>Provisions on legislator allocations<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> as well as fund realignment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> were included in the 2012 and 2013 PDAF Articles; but the allocation for the Vice-President, which was pegged at P200 Million in the 2011 GAA, had been deleted. In addition, the 2013 PDAF Article now <b>allowed LGUs to be identified as implementing agencies</b> if they have the technical capability to implement the projects.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> Legislators were also allowed to identify programs/projects, except for assistance to indigent patients and scholarships, <b>outside of his legislative district</b> provided that he secures the written concurrence of the legislator of the intended outside-district, endorsed by the Speaker of the House.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> Finally, <b>any realignment of PDAF funds, modification and revision of project identification, as well as requests for release of funds, were all required to be favorably endorsed by the House Committee on Appropriations and the Senate Committee on Finance</b>, as the case may be.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br><b>III. History of Presidential Pork Barrel in the Philippines.</b><br><br>While the term "Pork Barrel” has been typically associated with lump- sum, discretionary funds of Members of Congress, the present cases and the recent controversies on the matter have, however, shown that the term‘s usage has expanded to include certain funds of the President such as the Malampaya Funds and the Presidential Social Fund.<br><br>On the one hand, the Malampaya Funds was created as a special fund under Section 8<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> of Presidential Decree No. (PD) 910,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> issued by then President Ferdinand E. Marcos (Marcos) on March 22, 1976. In enacting the said law, Marcos recognized the need to set up a special fund to help intensify, strengthen, and consolidate government efforts relating to the exploration, exploitation, and development of indigenous energy resources vital to economic growth.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> Due to the energy-related activities of the government in the Malampaya natural gas field in Palawan, or the "Malampaya Deep Water Gas-to-Power Project”,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> the special fund created under PD 910 has been currently labeled as Malampaya Funds.<br><br>On the other hand the Presidential Social Fund was created under Section 12, Title IV<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> of PD 1869,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> or the Charter of the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR). PD 1869 was similarly issued by Marcos on July 11, 1983. <b>More than two (2) years after, he amended PD 1869 and accordingly issued PD 1993 on October 31, 1985,</b><font color="#ff0000"><sup>[86]</sup></font><b> amending Section 1287 of the former law</b>. As it stands, the Presidential Social Fund has been described as a special funding facility managed and administered by the Presidential Management Staff through which the President provides direct assistance to priority programs and projects not funded under the regular budget. It is sourced from the share of the government in the aggregate gross earnings of PAGCOR.88<br><br><b>IV. Controversies in the Philippines</b>.<br><br>Over the decades, "pork” funds in the Philippines have increased tremendously,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> owing in no small part to previous Presidents who reportedly used the "Pork Barrel” in order to gain congressional support.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> It was in 1996 when the first controversy surrounding the "Pork Barrel” erupted. Former Marikina City Representative Romeo Candazo (Candazo), then an anonymous source, "blew the lid on the huge sums of government money that regularly went into the pockets of legislators in the form of kickbacks.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> He said that ?the kickbacks were 'SOP‘ (standard operating procedure) among legislators and ranged from a low 19 percent to a high 52 percent of the cost of each project, which could be anything from dredging, rip rapping, asphalting, concreting, and construction of school buildings.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> "Other sources of kickbacks that Candazo identified were public funds intended for medicines and textbooks. A few days later, the tale of the money trail became the banner story of the [Philippine Daily] Inquirer issue of [August] 13, 1996, accompanied by an illustration of a roasted pig.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> "The publication of the stories, including those about congressional initiative allocations of certain lawmakers, including P3.6 [B]illion for a [C]ongressman, sparked public outrage.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup><br><br>Thereafter, or in 2004, several concerned citizens sought the nullification of the PDAF as enacted in the 2004 GAA for being unconstitutional. Unfortunately, for lack of "any pertinent evidentiary support that illegal misuse of PDAF in the form of kickbacks has become a common exercise of unscrupulous Members of Congress,” the petition was dismissed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup><br><br>Recently, or in July of the present year, the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) began its probe into allegations that "the government has been defrauded of some P10 Billion over the past 10 years by a syndicate using funds from the pork barrel of lawmakers and various government agencies for scores of ghost projects.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> The investigation was spawned by sworn affidavits of six (6) whistle-blowers who declared that JLN Corporation – "JLN” standing for Janet Lim Napoles (Napoles) – had swindled billions of pesos from the public coffers for "ghost projects” using no fewer than 20 dummy NGOs for an entire decade.

In addition, the Court shall also tackle certain <b>ancillary issues</b> as prompted by the present cases.<br><br><center><b>The Court’s Ruling</b><br></center><br>The petitions are partly granted.<br><br><b>I. Procedural Issues.</b><br><br>The prevailing rule in constitutional litigation is that no question involving the constitutionality or validity of a law or governmental act may be heard and decided by the Court unless there is compliance with the legal requisites for judicial inquiry,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup> namely: (<i>a</i>) there must be an <b>actual case or controversy</b> calling for the exercise of judicial power; (<i>b</i>) the person challenging the act must have the <b>standing </b>to question the validity of the subject act or issuance; (<i>c</i>) the question of constitutionality must be raised at the earliest opportunity; and (<i>d</i>) the issue of constitutionality must be the very<i> lis mota</i> of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup> Of these requisites, case law states that the first two are the most important<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup> and, therefore, shall be discussed forthwith.<br><br><b>A. Existence of an Actual Case or Controversy.</b><br><br>By constitutional fiat, judicial power operates only when there is an actual case or controversy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup> This is embodied in Section 1, Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution which pertinently states that "[j]udicial power includes the duty of the courts of justice <b>to settle actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable</b> x x x.” Jurisprudence provides that an actual case or controversy is one which "involves a conflict of legal rights, an assertion of opposite legal claims, susceptible of judicial resolution as distinguished from a hypothetical or abstract difference or dispute.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[121]</sup> In other words, "[t]here must be a<b> contrariety of legal rights that can be interpreted and enforced on the basis of existing law and jurisprudence</b>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup> Related to the requirement of an actual case or controversy is the requirement of "ripeness,” meaning that the questions raised for constitutional scrutiny are already ripe for adjudication. "A question is ripe for adjudication when the act being challenged has had a direct adverse effect on the individual challenging it. It is a prerequisite that something had then been accomplished or performed by either branch before a court may come into the picture, and the petitioner must allege the<b> existence of an immediate or threatened injury to itself as a result of the challenged action</b>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup> "Withal, courts will decline to pass upon constitutional issues through advisory opinions, bereft as they are of authority to resolve hypothetical or moot questions.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[124]</sup><br><br>Based on these principles, the Court finds that there exists an actual and justiciable controversy in these cases.<br><br>The requirement of contrariety of legal rights is clearly satisfied by the antagonistic positions of the parties on the constitutionality of the "Pork Barrel System.” Also, the questions in these consolidated cases are ripe for adjudication since the challenged funds and the provisions allowing for their utilization – such as the 2013 GAA for the PDAF, PD 910 for the Malampaya Funds and PD 1869, as amended by PD 1993, for the Presidential Social Fund – are currently existing and operational; hence, there exists an immediate or threatened injury to petitioners as a result of the unconstitutional use of these public funds.<br><br>As for the PDAF, the Court must dispel the notion that the issues related thereto had been rendered moot and academic by the reforms undertaken by respondents. A case becomes moot when there is no more actual controversy between the parties or no useful purpose can be served in passing upon the merits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[125]</sup> Differing from this description, the Court observes that respondents‘ proposed line-item budgeting scheme would not terminate the controversy nor diminish the useful purpose for its resolution since said reform is geared towards the 2014 budget, and not the 2013 PDAF Article which, being<b> a distinct subject matter</b>, remains legally effective and existing. Neither will the President‘s declaration that he had already "abolished the PDAF” render the issues on PDAF moot precisely because the Executive branch of government has no constitutional authority to nullify or annul its legal existence. By constitutional design, the annulment or nullification of a law may be done either by Congress, through the passage of a repealing law, or by the Court, through a declaration of unconstitutionality. Instructive on this point is the following exchange between Associate Justice Antonio T. Carpio (Justice Carpio) and the Solicitor General during the Oral Arguments:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[126]</sup><br><br><blockquote>Justice Carpio: [T]<b>he President has taken an oath to faithfully execute the law,</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[127]</sup> correct?<br><br>Solicitor General Jardeleza: Yes, Your Honor.<br><br>Justice Carpio: And so the President cannot refuse to implement the General Appropriations Act, correct?<br><br>Solicitor General Jardeleza: Well, that is our answer, Your Honor. In the case, for example of the PDAF,<b> the President has a duty to execute the laws</b> but in the face of the outrage over PDAF, the President was saying, "I am not sure that I will continue the release of the soft projects,” and that started, Your Honor. Now, whether or not that … (interrupted)<br><br>Justice Carpio: Yeah. I will grant the President if there are anomalies in the project, he has the power to stop the releases in the meantime, to investigate, and that is Section [38] of Chapter 5 of Book 6 of the Revised Administrative Code<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[128]</sup> x x x. So at most the President can suspend, now if the President believes that the PDAF is unconstitutional, can he just refuse to implement it?<br><br>Solicitor General Jardeleza: No, Your Honor, as we were trying to say in the specific case of the PDAF because of the CoA Report, because of the reported irregularities and this Court can take judicial notice, even outside, outside of the COA Report, you have the report of the whistle-blowers, the President was just exercising precisely the duty ….<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Justice Carpio: Yes, and that is correct. You‘ve seen the CoA Report, there are anomalies, you stop and investigate, and prosecute, he has done that. <b>But, does that mean that PDAF has been repealed</b>?<br><br>Solicitor General Jardeleza: No, Your Honor x x x. <br><br>x x x x <br><br>Justice Carpio: <b>So that PDAF can be legally abolished only in two (2) cases. Congress passes a law to repeal it, or this Court declares it unconstitutional, correct?</b><br><br>Solictor General Jardeleza: Yes, Your Honor.<br><br>Justice Carpio: <b>The President has no power to legally abolish PDAF</b>. (Emphases supplied)</blockquote><br>Even on the assumption of mootness, jurisprudence, nevertheless, dictates that "the 'moot and academic‘ principle is not a magical formula that can automatically dissuade the Court in resolving a case.” The Court will decide cases, otherwise moot, if: <b>first</b>, there is a grave violation of the Constitution; <b>second</b>, the exceptional character of the situation and the paramount public interest is involved; <b>third</b>, when the constitutional issue raised requires formulation of controlling principles to guide the bench, the bar, and the public; and <b>fourth</b>, the case is capable of repetition yet evading review.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[129]</sup><br><br>The applicability of the <b>first exception</b> is clear from the fundamental posture of petitioners – they essentially allege grave violations of the Constitution with respect to, <i>inter alia,</i> the principles of separation of powers, non-delegability of legislative power, checks and balances, accountability and local autonomy.<br><br>The applicability of the <b>second exception</b> is also apparent from the nature of the interests involved – the constitutionality of the very system within which significant amounts of public funds have been and continue to be utilized and expended undoubtedly presents a situation of exceptional character as well as a matter of paramount public interest. The present petitions, in fact, have been lodged at a time when the system‘s flaws have never before been magnified. To the Court‘s mind, the coalescence of the CoA Report, the accounts of numerous whistle-blowers, and the government‘s own recognition that reforms are needed "to address the reported abuses of the PDAF”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[130]</sup> <b>demonstrates a <i>prima facie</i> pattern of abuse</b> which only underscores the importance of the matter. It is also by this finding that the Court finds petitioners‘ claims as not merely theorized, speculative or hypothetical. Of note is the weight accorded by the Court to the findings made by the CoA which is the constitutionally-mandated audit arm of the government. In <i>Delos Santos v. CoA</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[131]</sup> a recent case wherein the Court upheld the CoA‘s disallowance of irregularly disbursed PDAF funds, it was emphasized that:<br><br><blockquote><b>[T]he CoA is endowed with enough latitude to determine, prevent, and disallow irregular, unnecessary,</b> excessive, extravagant or unconscionable expenditures of government funds. It is tasked to be vigilant and conscientious in safeguarding the proper use of the government's, and ultimately the people's, property. <b>The exercise of its general audit power is among the constitutional mechanisms that gives life to the check and balance system inherent in our form of government.</b><br><br>[I]t is the general policy of the Court to sustain the decisions of administrative authorities, especially one which is constitutionally-created, such as the CoA, <b>not only on the basis of the doctrine of separation of powers but also for their presumed expertise in the laws they are entrusted to enforce</b>. Findings of administrative agencies are accorded not only respect but also finality when the decision and order are not tainted with unfairness or arbitrariness that would amount to grave abuse of discretion. It is only when the CoA has acted without or in excess of jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, that this Court entertains a petition questioning its rulings. x x x. (Emphases supplied)</blockquote><br>Thus,<b> if only for the purpose of validating the existence of an actual and justiciable controversy in these cases</b>, the Court deems the findings under the CoA Report to be sufficient.<br><br>The Court also finds the<b> third exception</b> to be applicable largely due to the practical need for a definitive ruling on the system‘s constitutionality. As disclosed during the Oral Arguments, the CoA Chairperson estimates that thousands of notices of disallowances will be issued by her office in connection with the findings made in the CoA Report. In this relation, Associate Justice Marvic Mario Victor F. Leonen (Justice Leonen) pointed out that all of these would eventually find their way to the courts.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[132]</sup></font> Accordingly, there is a compelling need to formulate controlling principles relative to the issues raised herein in order to guide the bench, the bar, and the public, not just for the expeditious resolution of the anticipated disallowance cases, but more importantly, so that the government may be guided on how public funds should be utilized in accordance with constitutional principles.<br><br>Finally, the application of the <b>fourth exception</b> is called for by the recognition that the preparation and passage of the national budget is, by constitutional imprimatur, an affair of annual occurrence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[133]</sup> The relevance of the issues before the Court does not cease with the passage of a "PDAF- free budget for 2014.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[134]</sup> The evolution of the "Pork Barrel System,” by its multifarious iterations throughout the course of history, lends a semblance of truth to petitioners‘ claim that "the same dog will just resurface wearing a different collar.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[135]</sup> In <i>Sanlakas v. Executive Secretary</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[136]</sup> the government had already backtracked on a previous course of action yet the Court used the "capable of repetition but evading review” exception in order "[t]o prevent similar questions from re-emerging.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[137]</sup> The situation similarly holds true to these cases. Indeed, the myriad of issues underlying the manner in which certain public funds are spent, if not resolved at this most opportune time, are capable of repetition and hence, must not evade judicial review.<br><br><b>B. Matters of Policy: the Political Question Doctrine.</b><br><br>The "limitation on the power of judicial review to actual cases and controversies” carries the assurance that "the courts will not intrude into areas committed to the other branches of government.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[138]</sup> Essentially, the foregoing limitation is a restatement of the political question doctrine which, under the classic formulation of <i>Baker v. Carr</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[139]</sup> applies when there is found, among others, "a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department,” "a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it” or "the impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for non-judicial discretion.” Cast against this light, respondents submit that the "[t]he political branches are in the best position not only to perform budget-related reforms but also to do them in response to the specific demands of their constituents” and, as such, "urge [the Court] not to impose a solution at this stage.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[140]</sup><br><br>The Court must deny respondents‘ submission.<br><br>Suffice it to state that the issues raised before the Court do not present political but legal questions which are within its province to resolve. A political question refers to "those questions which, under the Constitution, are to be decided by the people in their sovereign capacity, or in regard to which full discretionary authority has been delegated to the Legislature or executive branch of the Government. It is concerned with issues dependent upon the wisdom, not legality, of a particular measure.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[141]</sup> <b>The intrinsic constitutionality of the “Pork Barrel System” is not an issue dependent upon the wisdom of the political branches of government but rather a legal one which the Constitution itself has commanded the Court to act upon</b>. Scrutinizing the contours of the system along constitutional lines is a task that the political branches of government are incapable of rendering precisely because it is an exercise of judicial power. More importantly, the present Constitution has not only vested the Judiciary the right to exercise judicial power but essentially makes it a duty to proceed therewith. Section 1, Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution cannot be any clearer: "The judicial power shall be vested in one Supreme Court and in such lower courts as may be established by law. [It] includes <b>the duty</b> of the courts of justice to settle actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable, and to determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government.” In <i>Estrada v. Desierto</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[142]</sup> the expanded concept of judicial power under the 1987 Constitution and its effect on the political question doctrine was explained as follows:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[143]</sup><br><br><blockquote>To a great degree, the 1987 Constitution has <b>narrowed the reach of the political question doctrine</b> when it expanded the power of judicial review of this court not only to settle actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable <b>but also to determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of government.</b> Heretofore, the judiciary has focused on the "thou shalt not's" of the Constitution directed against the exercise of its jurisdiction. With the new provision, however, courts are given a greater prerogative to determine what it can do to prevent grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of government. <b>Clearly, the new provision did not just grant the Court power of doing nothing.</b> x x x (Emphases supplied)</blockquote><br>It must also be borne in mind that "when the judiciary mediates to allocate constitutional boundaries, it does not assert any superiority over the other departments; does not in reality nullify or invalidate an act of the legislature [or the executive], but only asserts the solemn and sacred obligation assigned to it by the Constitution.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[144]</sup> To a great extent, the Court is laudably cognizant of the reforms undertaken by its co-equal branches of government. But it is by constitutional force that the Court must faithfully perform its duty. Ultimately, it is the Court‘s avowed intention that a resolution of these cases would not arrest or in any manner impede the endeavors of the two other branches but, in fact, help ensure that the pillars of change are erected on firm constitutional grounds. After all, it is in the best interest of the people that each great branch of government, within its own sphere, contributes its share towards achieving a holistic and genuine solution to the problems of society. For all these reasons, the Court cannot heed respondents‘ plea for judicial restraint.<br><br><b><i>C. Locus Standi.</i></b><br><br>"The gist of the question of standing is whether a party alleges such personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court depends for illumination of difficult constitutional questions.

It is undeniable that petitioners, as taxpayers, are bound to suffer from the unconstitutional usage of public funds, if the Court so rules. Invariably, taxpayers have been allowed to sue where there is a claim that public funds are illegally disbursed or that public money is being deflected to any improper purpose, or that public funds are wasted through the enforcement of an invalid or unconstitutional law,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[147]</sup> as in these cases.<br><br>Moreover, as citizens, petitioners have equally fulfilled the standing requirement given that the issues they have raised may be classified as matters "of transcendental importance, of overreaching significance to society, or of paramount public interest.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[148]</sup> The CoA Chairperson‘s statement during the Oral Arguments that the present controversy involves "not [merely] a systems failure” but a "complete breakdown of controls”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[149]</sup> amplifies, in addition to the matters above-discussed, the seriousness of the issues involved herein. Indeed, of greater import than the damage caused by the illegal expenditure of public funds is the mortal wound inflicted upon the fundamental law by the enforcement of an invalid statute.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[150]</sup> All told, petitioners have sufficient<i> locus standi </i>to file the instant cases.<br><br><b>D.<i> Res Judicata and Stare Decisis</i>.</b><br><br><i>Res judicata</i> (which means a "matter adjudged”) and <i>stare decisisnon quieta et movere</i>&nbsp; ([or simply, stare decisis] which means "follow past precedents and do not disturb what has been settled”) are general procedural law principles which both deal with the effects of previous but factually similar dispositions to subsequent cases. For the cases at bar, the Court examines the applicability of these principles in relation to its prior rulings in <i>Philconsa</i> and <i>LAMP.</i><br><br><b>The focal point of <i>res judicata</i> is the judgment.</b> The principle states that a <b><u>judgment on the merits</u></b> in a previous case rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction would bind a subsequent case if, between the first and second actions, <b>there exists an<u> identity</u> of parties, of subject matter, and of causes of action</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[151]</sup> This required identity is not, however, attendant hereto since <i>Philconsa</i> and <i>LAMP</i>, respectively involved constitutional challenges against the <b>1994 CDF Article</b> and <b>2004 PDAF Article</b>, whereas the cases at bar call for a broader constitutional scrutiny of the <b>entire “Pork Barrel System.”</b> Also, the ruling in <i>LAMP</i> is essentially a dismissal based on a procedural technicality – and, thus, hardly a judgment on the merits – in that petitioners therein failed to present any "convincing proof x x x showing that, indeed, there were <b>direct releases of funds</b> to the Members of Congress, who actually spend them according to their sole discretion” or "pertinent evidentiary support [to demonstrate the] <b>illegal misuse of PDAF</b> in the form of kickbacks [and] has become a common exercise of unscrupulous Members of Congress.” As such, the Court upheld, in view of the presumption of constitutionality accorded to every law, the 2004 PDAF Article, and saw "no need to review or reverse the standing pronouncements in the said case.” Hence, for the foregoing reasons, the <i>res judicata</i> principle, insofar as the <i>Philconsa</i> and <i>LAMP</i> cases are concerned, cannot apply.<br><br>On the other hand, <b>the focal point of <i>stare decisis</i> is the doctrine created</b>. The principle, entrenched under Article 8<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[152]</sup> of the Civil Code, evokes the general rule that, for the sake of certainty, a conclusion reached in one case should be doctrinally applied to those that follow if the facts are substantially the same, even though the parties may be different. It proceeds from the first principle of justice that, <b><u>absent any powerful countervailing considerations</u>, like cases ought to be decided alike</b>. Thus, where the <b><u>same questions</u></b> relating to the same event have been put forward by the parties similarly situated as in a previous case litigated and decided by a competent court, the rule of <i>stare decisis</i> is a bar to any attempt to re-litigate the same issue.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[153]</sup><br><br><i>Philconsa</i> was the first case where a constitutional challenge against a Pork Barrel provision, i.e., the 1994 CDF Article, was resolved by the Court. To properly understand its context, petitioners‘ posturing was that "the power given to the [M]embers of Congress to propose and identify projects and activities to be funded by the [CDF] is an encroachment by the legislature on executive power, since said power in an appropriation act is in implementation of the law” and that "the proposal and identification of the projects do not involve the making of laws or the repeal and amendment thereof, the only function given to the Congress by the Constitution.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[154]</sup> In deference to the foregoing submissions, the Court reached the following main conclusions: <b><u>one</u></b>, under the Constitution, the power of appropriation, or the "power of the purse,” belongs to Congress; <b><u>two</u></b>, the power of appropriation carries with it the power to specify the project or activity to be funded under the appropriation law and it can be detailed and as broad as Congress wants it to be; and, <b><u>three</u></b>, the proposals and identifications made by Members of Congress are merely recommendatory. At once, it is apparent that the<i> Philconsa</i> resolution was <b>a limited response to a separation of powers problem</b>, specifically on the <b>propriety of conferring post-enactment identification authority to Members of Congress.</b> On the contrary, the present cases call for a more holistic examination of (a) the <b>inter-relation</b> between the CDF and PDAF Articles with each other, formative as they are of the entire "Pork Barrel System” as well as (b) the <b>intra-relation</b> of post-enactment measures contained within a particular CDF or PDAF Article, including not only those related to the area of project identification but also to the areas of fund release and realignment. The complexity of the issues and the broader legal analyses herein warranted may be, therefore, considered as a powerful countervailing reason against a wholesale application of the <i>stare decisis</i> principle.<br><br>In addition, the Court observes that the <i>Philconsa</i> ruling was actually riddled with inherent constitutional inconsistencies which similarly countervail against a full resort to stare decisis. As may be deduced from the main conclusions of the case, <i>Philconsa‘</i>s fundamental premise in allowing Members of Congress to propose and identify of projects would be that the said identification authority is but an aspect of the power of appropriation which has been constitutionally lodged in Congress. From this premise, the contradictions may be easily seen. If the authority to identify projects is <b>an aspect of appropriation</b> and the power of appropriation is <b>a form of legislative power</b> thereby lodged in <b>Congress</b>, then it follows that: <b><i>(a)</i></b> it is Congress which should exercise such authority, and not its individual Members; <b><i>(b)</i></b> such authority must be exercised within the prescribed procedure of law passage and, hence, should not be exercised after the GAA has already been passed; and <b><i>(c)</i></b> such authority, as embodied in the GAA, has the force of law and, hence, cannot be merely recommendatory. Justice Vitug‘s Concurring Opinion in the same case sums up the <i>Philconsa</i> quandary in this wise: ?Neither would it be objectionable for Congress, by law, to appropriate funds for such specific projects as it may be minded; to give that authority, however, to the individual members of Congress in whatever guise, I am afraid, would be constitutionally impermissible.” As the Court now largely benefits from hindsight and current findings on the matter, among others, the CoA Report, the Court must partially abandon its previous ruling in <i>Philconsa</i><b> insofar as it validated the post-enactment identification authority of Members of Congress on the guise that the same was merely recommendatory</b>. This postulate raises serious constitutional inconsistencies which cannot be simply excused on the ground that such mechanism is "imaginative as it is innovative.” Moreover, it must be pointed out that the recent case of <i>Abakada Guro Party List v. Purisima</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[155]</sup> (<i>Abakada</i>) has effectively overturned <i>Philconsa‘</i>s allowance of post-enactment legislator participation in view of the separation of powers principle. These constitutional inconsistencies and the <i>Abakada</i> rule will be discussed in greater detail in the ensuing section of this Decision.<br><br>As for <i>LAMP,</i> suffice it to restate that the said case was dismissed on a procedural technicality and, hence, has not set any controlling doctrine susceptible of current application to the substantive issues in these cases. In fine,<i> stare decisis</i> would not apply.<br><br><b>II. Substantive Issues.</b><br><blockquote><b>A. Definition of Terms.</b><br></blockquote>Before the Court proceeds to resolve the substantive issues of these cases, it must first define the terms "Pork Barrel System,” "Congressional Pork Barrel,” and "Presidential Pork Barrel” as they are essential to the ensuing discourse.<br><br>Petitioners define the term "Pork Barrel System” as the "collusion between the Legislative and Executive branches of government to accumulate lump-sum public funds in their offices with unchecked discretionary powers to determine its distribution as political largesse.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[156]</sup> They assert that the following elements make up the Pork Barrel System: (<i>a</i>) lump-sum funds are allocated through the appropriations process to an individual officer; (<i>b</i>) the officer is given sole and broad discretion in determining how the funds will be used or expended; (<i>c</i>) the guidelines on how to spend or use the funds in the appropriation are either vague, overbroad or inexistent; and (<i>d</i>) projects funded are intended to benefit a definite constituency in a particular part of the country and to help the political careers of the disbursing official by yielding rich patronage benefits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[157]</sup> They further state that the Pork Barrel System is comprised of two (2) kinds of discretionary public funds: first, the Congressional (or Legislative) Pork Barrel, currently known as the PDAF;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[158]</sup> and, second, the Presidential (or Executive) Pork Barrel, specifically, the Malampaya Funds under PD 910 and the Presidential Social Fund under PD 1869, as amended by PD 1993.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[159]</sup><br><br>Considering petitioners‘ submission and in reference to its local concept and legal history, the Court defines <b><u>the Pork Barrel System</u> as the collective body of rules and practices that govern the manner by which lump-sum, discretionary funds, primarily intended for local projects, are utilized through the respective participations of the Legislative and Executive branches of government, including its members.</b> The Pork Barrel System involves two (2) kinds of lump-sum discretionary funds:<br><br>First, there is <b><u>the Congressional Pork Barrel</u> which is herein defined as a kind of lump-sum, discretionary fund wherein legislators, either individually or collectively organized into committees, are able to effectively control certain aspects of the fund’s utilization through various post-enactment measures and/or practices.</b> In particular, petitioners consider the PDAF, as it appears under the 2013 GAA, as Congressional Pork Barrel since it is, <i>inter alia</i>, a post-enactment measure that allows individual legislators to wield a collective power;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[160]</sup> and<br><br>Second, there is <b><u>the Presidential Pork Barrel</u> which is herein defined as a kind of lump-sum, discretionary fund which allows the President to determine the manner of its utilization</b>. For reasons earlier stated,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[161]</sup> the Court shall delimit the use of such term to refer only to the Malampaya Funds and the Presidential Social Fund.<br><br>With these definitions in mind, the Court shall now proceed to discuss the substantive issues of these cases.<br><br><b>B. Substantive Issues on the Congressional Pork Barrel.<br></b><blockquote><b>1. Separation of Powers.</b><br><blockquote><b>a. Statement of Principle.</b><br></blockquote></blockquote>The principle of separation of powers refers to the constitutional demarcation of the three fundamental powers of government. In the celebrated words of Justice Laurel in <i>Angara v. Electoral Commission</i>, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[162]</sup> it means that the "Constitution has blocked out with deft strokes and in bold lines, allotment of power to the executive, the legislative and the judicial departments of the government.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[163]</sup> To the legislative branch of government, through Congress,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[164]</sup> belongs the power to make laws; to the executive branch of government, through the President,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[165]</sup> belongs the power to enforce laws; and to the judicial branch of government, through the Court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[166]</sup> belongs the power to interpret laws. Because the three great powers have been, by constitutional design, ordained in this respect, "[e]ach department of the government has exclusive cognizance of matters within its jurisdiction, and is supreme within its own sphere.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[167]</sup> Thus, "the legislature has no authority to execute or construe the law, the executive has no authority to make or construe the law, and the judiciary has no power to make or execute the law.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[168]</sup> The principle of separation of powers and its concepts of autonomy and independence stem from the notion that the powers of government must be divided to avoid concentration of these powers in any one branch; the division, it is hoped, would avoid any single branch from lording its power over the other branches or the citizenry.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[169]</sup> To achieve this purpose, the divided power must be wielded by co-equal branches of government that are equally capable of independent action in exercising their respective mandates. Lack of independence would result in the inability of one branch of government to check the arbitrary or self- interest assertions of another or others.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[170]</sup><br><br>Broadly speaking, there is a violation of the separation of powers principle when one branch of government unduly encroaches on the domain of another. US Supreme Court decisions instruct that the principle of separation of powers may be violated in two (2) ways: firstly, "<b>[o]ne branch may <u>interfere impermissibly</u> with the other’s performance of its constitutionally assigned function”</b>;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[171]</sup> and "[a]lternatively, the doctrine may be violated when one branch <u>assumes a function that more properly is entrusted to another</u>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[172]</sup> In other words, there is a violation of the principle when there is impermissible (<i>a</i>) <b><u>interference</u></b> with and/or (<i>b</i>) <b><u>assumption</u></b> of another department‘s functions.<br><br>The enforcement of the national budget, as primarily contained in the GAA, is indisputably a function both constitutionally assigned and properly entrusted to the Executive branch of government. In <i>Guingona, Jr. v. Hon. Carague</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[173]</sup> (<i>Guingona, Jr.</i>), the Court explained that the phase of budget execution "covers the <b>various <i>operational</i> aspects of budgeting</b>” and accordingly includes <b>"the evaluation of work and financial plans for individual activities,”</b> the <b>"regulation and release of funds”</b> as well as all <b>"other related activities”</b> that comprise the budget execution cycle.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[174]</sup> This is rooted in the principle that the allocation of power in the three principal branches of government is a grant of all powers inherent in them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[175]</sup> Thus, unless the Constitution provides otherwise, the Executive department should exclusively exercise all roles and prerogatives which go into the implementation of the national budget as provided under the GAA as well as any other appropriation law.<br><br>In view of the foregoing, the Legislative branch of government, much more any of its members, should not cross over the field of implementing the national budget since, as earlier stated, the same is properly the domain of the Executive. Again, in <i>Guingona, Jr</i>., the Court stated that "Congress enters the picture [when it] deliberates or acts on the budget proposals of the President. Thereafter, Congress, "in the exercise of its own judgment and wisdom, <i>formulates</i> an appropriation act precisely following the process established by the Constitution, which specifies that no money may be paid from the Treasury except in accordance with an appropriation made by law.” Upon approval and passage of the GAA, Congress‘ law-making role necessarily comes to an end and from there the Executive‘s role of implementing the national budget begins. So as not to blur the constitutional boundaries between them, Congress must "not concern itself with details for implementation by the Executive.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[176]</sup><br><br>The foregoing cardinal postulates were definitively enunciated in <i>Abakada</i> where the Court held that "<b>[f]rom the moment the law becomes effective, any provision of law that empowers Congress or any of its members to play <u>any role in the implementation or enforcement of the law</u> violates the principle of separation of powers and is thus unconstitutional.</b>”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[177]</sup> It must be clarified, however, that since the restriction only pertains to "any role in the implementation or enforcement of the law,” Congress may still exercise its oversight function which is a mechanism of checks and balances that the Constitution itself allows. But it must be made clear that Congress‘ role must be confined to mere oversight. Any post- enactment-measure allowing legislator participation beyond oversight is bereft of any constitutional basis and hence, tantamount to impermissible interference and/or assumption of executive functions. As the Court ruled in <i>Abakada</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[178]</sup><br><br><blockquote><b>[A]ny post-enactment congressional measure x x x should be limited to scrutiny and investigation</b>. In particular, congressional oversight must be confined to the following:<br><blockquote>(1) scrutiny based primarily on Congress‘ power of appropriation and the budget hearings conducted in connection with it, its power to ask heads of departments to appear before and be heard by either of its Houses on any matter pertaining to their departments and its power of confirmation; and<br><br>(2) investigation and monitoring of the implementation of laws pursuant to the power of Congress to conduct inquiries in aid of legislation.<br></blockquote><b>Any action or step beyond that will undermine the separation of powers guaranteed by the Constitution</b>. (Emphases supplied)<br><blockquote><b>b. Application</b>.<br></blockquote></blockquote>In these cases, petitioners submit that the Congressional Pork Barrel – among others, the 2013 PDAF Article – "wrecks the assignment of responsibilities between the political branches” as it is designed to allow individual legislators to interfere "way past the time it should have ceased” or, particularly, "after the GAA is passed.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[179]</sup> They state that the findings and recommendations in the CoA Report provide ?an illustration of how absolute and definitive the power of legislators wield over project implementation in complete violation of the constitutional [principle of separation of powers.]”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[180]</sup> Further, they point out that the Court in the <i>Philconsa</i> case only allowed the CDF to exist on the condition that individual legislators limited their role to recommending projects and not if they actually dictate their implementation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[181]</sup><br><br>For their part, respondents counter that the separations of powers principle has not been violated since the President maintains "ultimate authority to control the execution of the GAA” and that he "retains the final discretion to reject” the legislators‘ proposals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[182]</sup> They maintain that the Court, in <i>Philconsa</i>, "upheld the constitutionality of the power of members of Congress to propose and identify projects so long as such proposal and identification are recommendatory.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[183]</sup> As such, they claim that "[e]verything in the Special Provisions [of the 2013 PDAF Article] follows the <i>Philconsa</i> framework, and hence, remains constitutional.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[184]</sup><br><br>The Court rules in favor of petitioners.<br><br>As may be observed from its legal history, the defining feature of all forms of Congressional Pork Barrel would be the authority of legislators to participate in the post-enactment phases of project implementation.<br><br>At its core, legislators – may it be through project lists,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[185]</sup> prior consultations<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[186]</sup> or program menus<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[187]</sup> – have been consistently accorded post-enactment authority to <b><u>identify the projects</u></b> they desire to be funded through various Congressional Pork Barrel allocations. Under the 2013 PDAF Article, the statutory authority of legislators to identify projects post- GAA may be construed from the import of Special Provisions 1 to 3 as well as the second paragraph of Special Provision 4. To elucidate, Special Provision 1 embodies the program menu feature which, as evinced from past PDAF Articles, allows individual legislators to identify PDAF projects for as long as the identified project falls under a general program listed in the said menu. Relatedly, Special Provision 2 provides that the implementing agencies shall, within 90 days from the GAA is passed, submit to Congress a more detailed priority list, standard or design prepared and submitted by implementing agencies from which the legislator may make his choice. The same provision further authorizes legislators to identify PDAF projects outside his district for as long as the representative of the district concerned concurs in writing. Meanwhile, Special Provision 3 clarifies that PDAF projects refer to "projects to be identified by legislators”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[188]</sup> and thereunder provides the allocation limit for the total amount of projects identified by each legislator. Finally, paragraph 2 of Special Provision 4 requires that any modification and revision of the project identification "shall be submitted to the House Committee on Appropriations and the Senate Committee on Finance for favorable endorsement to the DBM or the implementing agency, as the case may be.” From the foregoing special provisions, it cannot be seriously doubted that legislators have been accorded post-enactment authority to identify PDAF projects.<br><br>Aside from the area of project identification, legislators have also been accorded post-enactment authority in the areas of fund release and realignment. Under the 2013 PDAF Article, the statutory authority of legislators to participate in the area of <b><u>fund release</u></b> through congressional committees is contained in Special Provision 5 which explicitly states that "[a]ll request for release of funds shall be supported by the documents prescribed under Special Provision No. 1 and favorably endorsed by House Committee on Appropriations and the Senate Committee on Finance, as the case may be”; while their statutory authority to participate in the area of <b><u>fund realignment</u></b> is contained in: <b>first</b>, paragraph 2, Special Provision 4<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[189]</sup> which explicitly states, among others, that "[a]ny realignment [of funds] shall be submitted to the House Committee on Appropriations and the Senate Committee on Finance for favorable endorsement to the DBM or the implementing agency, as the case may be”; and, <b>second</b>, paragraph 1, also of Special Provision 4 which authorizes the "Secretaries of Agriculture, Education, Energy, Interior and Local Government, Labor and Employment, Public Works and Highways, Social Welfare and Development and Trade and Industry<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[190]</sup> x x x to approve realignment from one project/scope to another within the allotment received from this Fund, subject to [among others] (iii) the request is with the concurrence of the legislator concerned.”<br><br>Clearly, these post-enactment measures which govern the areas of project identification, fund release and fund realignment are not related to functions of congressional oversight and, hence, allow legislators to intervene and/or assume duties that properly belong to the sphere of budget execution. Indeed, by virtue of the foregoing, legislators have been, in one form or another, authorized to participate in – as <i>Guingona, Jr.</i> puts it – "the <b>various <i>operational</i> aspects of budgeting,” including "the evaluation of work and financial plans for individual activities</b>” and the "<b>regulation and release of funds</b>” in violation of the separation of powers principle. The fundamental rule, as categorically articulated in <i>Abakada</i>, cannot be overstated – <b><u>from the moment the law becomes effective, any provision of law that empowers Congress or any of its members to play any role in the implementation or enforcement of the law violates the principle of separation of powers and is thus unconstitutional</u>.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[191]</sup> That the said authority is treated as merely recommendatory in nature does not alter its unconstitutional tenor since the prohibition, to repeat, covers <b><u>any role</u> in the implementation or enforcement of the law</b>. Towards this end, the Court must therefore abandon its ruling in <i>Philconsa</i> which sanctioned the conduct of legislator identification on the guise that the same is merely recommendatory and, as such, respondents‘ reliance on the same falters altogether.<br><br>Besides, it must be pointed out that respondents have nonetheless failed to substantiate their position that the identification authority of legislators is only of recommendatory import. Quite the contrary, respondents – through the statements of the Solicitor General during the Oral Arguments – have admitted that the identification of the legislator constitutes a mandatory requirement before his PDAF can be tapped as a funding source, thereby highlighting the indispensability of the said act to the entire budget execution process:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[192]</sup><br><br><blockquote>Justice Bernabe: <b>Now, without the individual legislator’s identification of the project, can the PDAF of the legislator be utilized?</b> <br><br>Solicitor General Jardeleza: No, Your Honor. <br><br>Justice Bernabe: It cannot?<br><br>Solicitor General Jardeleza: It cannot… (interrupted)<br><br>Justice Bernabe: <b>So meaning you should have the identification of the project by the individual legislator?</b><br><br>Solicitor General Jardeleza: <b>Yes, Your Honor. </b><br><br>x x x x<br><br>Justice Bernabe: In short, the act of identification is mandatory?<br><br>Solictor General Jardeleza: <b>Yes, Your Honor.

I would doubt very much, Your Honor, because to implement, there is a need [for] a SARO and the NCA. And <b>the SARO and the NCA are triggered by an identification from the legislator.<br></b><br>x x x x<br><br>Solictor General Jardeleza: What we mean by mandatory, Your Honor, is we were replying to a question, "How can a legislator make sure that he is able to get PDAF Funds?” It is mandatory in the sense that he must identify, in that sense, Your Honor. Otherwise, if he does not identify, he cannot avail of the PDAF Funds and his district would not be able to have PDAF Funds, only in that sense, Your Honor. (Emphases supplied)</blockquote><br>Thus, for all the foregoing reasons, the Court hereby declares the 2013 PDAF Article as well as all other provisions of law which similarly allow legislators to wield <b>any form of post-enactment authority in the implementation or enforcement of the budget</b>, unrelated to congressional oversight, as violative of the separation of powers principle and thus unconstitutional. Corollary thereto, informal practices, through which legislators have effectively intruded into the proper phases of budget execution, must be deemed as <b>acts of grave abuse of discretion</b> amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction and, hence, accorded the same unconstitutional treatment. That such informal practices do exist and have, in fact, been constantly observed throughout the years has not been substantially disputed here. As pointed out by Chief Justice Maria Lourdes P.A. Sereno (Chief Justice Sereno) during the Oral Arguments of these cases:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[193]</sup><br><br><blockquote>Chief Justice Sereno:<br><br>Now, from the responses of the representative of both, the DBM and two (2) Houses of Congress, if we enforces the initial thought that I have, after I had seen the extent of this research made by my staff, that neither the Executive nor Congress frontally faced the question of constitutional compatibility of how they were engineering the budget process. In fact, the words you have been using, as the three lawyers [of the DBM, and both Houses of Congress] has also been using is surprise; surprised that all of these things are now surfacing. In fact, I thought that <b><u>what the 2013 PDAF provisions did was to codify in one section all the past practice that [had] been done since 1991</u></b>. In a certain sense, we should be thankful that they are all now in the PDAF Special Provisions. x x x (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>Ultimately, legislators cannot exercise powers which they do not have, whether through formal measures written into the law or informal practices institutionalized in government agencies, else the Executive department be deprived of what the Constitution has vested as its own.<br><blockquote><b>2. Non-delegability of Legislative Power.</b><br><blockquote><b>a. Statement of Principle.</b><br></blockquote></blockquote>As an adjunct to the separation of powers principle,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[194]</sup> legislative power shall be exclusively exercised by the body to which the Constitution has conferred the same. In particular, Section 1, Article VI of the 1987 Constitution states that such power shall be vested in the Congress of the Philippines which shall consist of a Senate and a House of Representatives, except to the extent reserved to the people by the provision on initiative and referendum.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[195]</sup> Based on this provision, it is clear that only Congress, acting as a bicameral body, and the people, through the process of initiative and referendum, may constitutionally wield legislative power and no other. This premise embodies the principle of non-delegability of legislative power, and the only recognized exceptions thereto would be: (<i>a</i>) delegated legislative power to local governments which, by immemorial practice, are allowed to legislate on purely local matters;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[196]</sup> and (<i>b</i>) constitutionally-grafted exceptions such as the authority of the President to, by law, exercise powers necessary and proper to carry out a declared national policy in times of war or other national emergency,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[197]</sup> or fix within specified limits, and subject to such limitations and restrictions as Congress may impose, tariff rates, import and export quotas, tonnage and wharfage dues, and other duties or imposts within the framework of the national development program of the Government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[198]</sup><br><br>Notably, the principle of non-delegability should not be confused as a restriction to <b><u>delegate rule-making</u></b> authority to implementing agencies for the <b>limited purpose</b> of either filling up the details of the law for its enforcement (<b>supplementary rule-making</b>) or ascertaining facts to bring the law into actual operation (<b>contingent rule-making</b>).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[199]</sup> The conceptual treatment and limitations of delegated rule-making were explained in the case of <i>People v.

Secretary of Justice and Insular Auditor</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[202]</sup> (<i>Bengzon</i>), held that the power of appropriation involves <b><i>(a)</i></b> the <b>setting apart by law of a certain sum</b> from the public revenue for <b><i>(b)</i></b> a <b>specified purpose</b>. Essentially, under the 2013 PDAF Article, individual legislators are given a personal lump-sum fund from which they are able to dictate (<b><i>a</i></b>) <b>how much</b> from such fund would go to (<b>b</b>) a <b>specific project or beneficiary</b> that they themselves also determine. As these two (2) acts comprise the exercise of the power of appropriation as described in Bengzon, and given that the 2013 PDAF Article authorizes individual legislators to perform the same, undoubtedly, said legislators have been conferred the power to legislate which the Constitution does not, however, allow. Thus, keeping with the principle of non-delegability of legislative power, the Court hereby declares the 2013 PDAF Article, as well as all other forms of Congressional Pork Barrel which contain the similar legislative identification feature as herein discussed, as unconstitutional.<br><blockquote><b>3. Checks and Balances.</b><br><blockquote><b>a. Statement of Principle; Item-Veto Power.</b><br></blockquote></blockquote>The fact that the three great powers of government are intended to be kept separate and distinct does not mean that they are absolutely unrestrained and independent of each other. The Constitution has also provided for an elaborate system of checks and balances to secure coordination in the workings of the various departments of the government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[203]</sup><br><br>A prime example of a constitutional check and balance would be the <b>President’s power to veto an item written into an appropriation, revenue or tariff bill</b> submitted to him by Congress for approval through a process known as "bill presentment.” The President‘s item-veto power is found in Section 27(2), Article VI of the 1987 Constitution which reads as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 27. x x x. <br><br>x x x x <br><br>(2) The President shall have the power to veto any particular item or items in an appropriation, revenue, or tariff bill, but the veto shall not affect the item or items to which he does not object.</blockquote><br>The presentment of appropriation, revenue or tariff bills to the President, wherein he may exercise his power of item-veto, forms part of the <b>"single, finely wrought and exhaustively considered, procedures</b>” for law-passage as specified under the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[204]</sup> As stated in <i>Abakada</i>, the final step in the law-making process is the "submission [of the bill] to the President for approval. Once approved, it takes effect as law after the required publication.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[205]</sup> Elaborating on the President‘s item-veto power and its relevance as a check on the legislature, the Court, in <i>Bengzon</i>, explained that:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[206]</sup><br><br><blockquote>The former Organic Act and the present Constitution of the Philippines make the Chief Executive an integral part of the law-making power. <b>His disapproval of a bill, commonly known as a veto, is essentially a legislative act.</b> The questions presented to the mind of the Chief Executive are precisely the same as those the legislature must determine in passing a bill, except that his will be a broader point of view.<br><br><b>The Constitution is a limitation upon the power of the legislative department of the government, but in this respect it is a grant of power to the executive department.</b> The Legislature has the affirmative power to enact laws; the <b>Chief Executive has the negative power by the constitutional exercise of which he may defeat the will of the Legislature.</b> It follows that the Chief Executive must find his authority in the Constitution. But in exercising that authority he may not be confined to rules of strict construction or hampered by the unwise interference of the judiciary. The courts will indulge every intendment in favor of the constitutionality of a veto [in the same manner] as they will presume the constitutionality of an act as originally passed by the Legislature. (Emphases supplied)</blockquote><br>The justification for the President‘s item-veto power rests on a variety of policy goals such as to prevent log-rolling legislation,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[207]</sup> impose fiscal restrictions on the legislature, as well as to fortify the executive branch‘s role in the budgetary process.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[208]</sup> In <i>Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Chadha</i>, the US Supreme Court characterized the President‘s item-power as "a salutary check upon the legislative body, calculated to guard the community against the effects of factions, precipitancy, or of any impulse unfriendly to the public good, which may happen to influence a majority of that body”; phrased differently, it is meant to "increase the chances in favor of the community <b>against the passing of bad laws</b>, through haste, inadvertence, or design.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[209]</sup><br><br><b>For the President to exercise his item-veto power, it necessarily follows that there exists a proper “item” which may be the object of the veto.</b> An item, as defined in the field of appropriations, pertains to "the particulars, the details, the distinct and severable parts of the appropriation or of the bill.” In the case of <i>Bengzon v. Secretary of Justice of the Philippine Islands</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[210]</sup> the US Supreme Court characterized an item of appropriation as follows:<br><br><blockquote>An item of an appropriation bill obviously means an item which, in itself, is a <b>specific appropriation of money, not some general provision of law</b> which happens to be put into an appropriation bill. (Emphases supplied)</blockquote><br>On this premise, it may be concluded that an appropriation bill, <b>to ensure that the President may be able to exercise his power of item veto</b>, must contain "specific appropriations of money” and not only "general provisions” which provide for parameters of appropriation.<br><br>Further, it is significant to point out that an item of appropriation must be an item characterized by <b>singular correspondence</b> – meaning an allocation of <b><u>a specified singular amount for a specified singular purpose</u></b>, otherwise known as a "<b>line-item</b>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[211]</sup> This treatment not only allows the item to be consistent with its definition as a "specific appropriation of money” but also ensures that the President may discernibly veto the same. Based on the foregoing formulation, the existing Calamity Fund, Contingent Fund and the Intelligence Fund, being appropriations which state a specified amount for a specific purpose, would then be considered as "line-item” appropriations which are rightfully subject to item veto. Likewise, it must be observed that an appropriation <b>may be validly apportioned into component percentages or values</b>; however, it is crucial that<b> each percentage or value must be allocated for its own corresponding purpose</b> for such component to be considered as a proper line-item. Moreover, as Justice Carpio correctly pointed out, a valid appropriation may even have several related purposes that are by accounting and budgeting practice considered as one purpose, <i>e.g., </i>MOOE (maintenance and other operating expenses), in which case the related purposes shall be deemed sufficiently specific for the exercise of the President‘s item veto power. Finally, special purpose funds and discretionary funds would equally square with the constitutional mechanism of item-veto <b>for as long as they follow the rule on singular correspondence</b> as herein discussed. Anent special purpose funds, it must be added that Section 25(4), Article VI of the 1987 Constitution requires that the "'special appropriations bill <b>shall specify the purpose for which it is intended</b>, and <b>shall be supported by funds actually available as certified by the National Treasurer, or to be raised by a corresponding revenue proposal therein</b>.” Meanwhile, with respect to discretionary funds, Section 25(6), Article VI of the 1987 Constitution requires that said funds "shall be disbursed only for public purposes to be <b>supported by appropriate vouchers and subject to such guidelines as may be prescribed by law</b>.”<br><br>In contrast, what beckons constitutional infirmity are appropriations which merely provide for a <b>singular lump-sum amount</b> to be tapped as a source of funding for <b>multiple purposes</b>. Since such appropriation type necessitates the further determination of <b><u>both</u></b> the <b>actual amount</b> to be expended <b><u>and</u></b> the <b>actual purpose</b> of the appropriation which must still be chosen from the multiple purposes stated in the law, it cannot be said that the appropriation law already indicates a "specific appropriation of money” and hence, without a proper line-item which the President may veto. As a practical result, the President would then be faced with the predicament of either vetoing the entire appropriation if he finds some of its purposes wasteful or undesirable, or approving the entire appropriation so as not to hinder some of its legitimate purposes. Finally, it may not be amiss to state that such arrangement also raises non-delegability issues considering that the implementing authority would still have to determine, again, both the actual amount to be expended and the actual purpose of the appropriation. Since the foregoing determinations constitute the integral aspects of the power to appropriate, the implementing authority would, in effect, be exercising legislative prerogatives in violation of the principle of non-delegability.<br><blockquote><b>b. Application.</b><br></blockquote>In these cases, petitioners claim that "[i]n the current x x x system where the PDAF is a lump-sum appropriation, the legislator‘s identification of the projects after the passage of the GAA denies the President the chance to veto that item later on.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[212]</sup> Accordingly, they submit that the "item veto power of the President mandates that appropriations bills adopt line-item budgeting” and that "Congress cannot choose a mode of budgeting [which] effectively renders the constitutionally-given power of the President useless.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[213]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, respondents maintain that the text of the Constitution envisions a process which is intended to meet the demands of a modernizing economy and, as such, lump-sum appropriations are essential to financially address situations which are barely foreseen when a GAA is enacted. They argue that the decision of the Congress to create some lump- sum appropriations is constitutionally allowed and textually-grounded.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[214]</sup><br><br>The Court agrees with petitioners.<br><br>Under the 2013 PDAF Article, the amount of P24.79 Billion only appears as a collective allocation limit since the said amount would be further divided among individual legislators who would then receive personal lump-sum allocations and could, after the GAA is passed, effectively appropriate PDAF funds based on their own discretion. As these intermediate appropriations are made by legislators only after the GAA is passed and hence, outside of the law, it necessarily means that the actual items of PDAF appropriation would not have been written into the General Appropriations Bill and thus effectuated without veto consideration. This kind of <b>lump-sum/post-enactment legislative identification budgeting system</b> fosters the creation of a "budget within a budget” which subverts the prescribed procedure of presentment and consequently impairs the President‘s power of item veto. As petitioners aptly point out, the above- described system forces the President to decide between (<i>a</i>) accepting the entire P24.79 Billion PDAF allocation without knowing the specific projects of the legislators, which may or may not be consistent with his national agenda and (<i>b</i>) rejecting the whole PDAF to the detriment of all other legislators with legitimate projects.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[215]</sup><br><br>Moreover, even without its post-enactment legislative identification feature, the 2013 PDAF Article would remain constitutionally flawed since it would then operate as a prohibited form of lump-sum appropriation as above-characterized. In particular, the lump-sum amount of P24.79 Billion would be treated as a mere funding source allotted for multiple purposes of spending, <i>i.e.</i>, scholarships, medical missions, assistance to indigents, preservation of historical materials, construction of roads, flood control, etc. This setup connotes that the appropriation law leaves the actual amounts and purposes of the appropriation for further determination and, therefore, does not readily indicate a discernible item which may be subject to the President‘s power of item veto.<br><br>In fact, on the accountability side, the same lump-sum budgeting scheme has, as the CoA Chairperson relays, "limit[ed] state auditors from obtaining relevant data and information that would aid in more stringently auditing the utilization of said Funds.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[216]</sup> Accordingly, she recommends the adoption of a "line by line budget or amount per proposed program, activity or project, and per implementing agency.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[217]</sup><br><br>Hence, in view of the reasons above-stated, the Court finds the 2013 PDAF Article, as well as all Congressional Pork Barrel Laws of similar operation, to be unconstitutional. That such budgeting system provides for a greater degree of flexibility to account for future contingencies cannot be an excuse to defeat what the Constitution requires. Clearly, the first and essential truth of the matter is that unconstitutional means do not justify even commendable ends.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[218]</sup><br><blockquote><b>c. Accountability.</b><br></blockquote>Petitioners further relate that the system under which various forms of Congressional Pork Barrel operate defies public accountability as it renders Congress incapable of checking itself or its Members. In particular, they point out that the Congressional Pork Barrel "gives each legislator a direct, financial interest in the smooth, speedy passing of the yearly budget” which turns them "from fiscalizers” into "financially-interested partners.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[219]</sup> They also claim that the system has an effect on re-election as "the PDAF excels in self-perpetuation of elective officials.” Finally, they add that the "PDAF impairs the power of impeachment” as such "funds are indeed quite useful, 'to well, accelerate the decisions of senators.‘“<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[220]</sup><br><br>The Court agrees in part.<br><br>The aphorism forged under Section 1, Article XI of the 1987 Constitution, which states that "public office is a public trust,” is an overarching reminder that every instrumentality of government should exercise their official functions only in accordance with the principles of the Constitution which embodies the parameters of the people‘s trust. The notion of a public trust connotes accountability,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[221]</sup> hence, the various mechanisms in the Constitution which are designed to exact accountability from public officers.<br><br>Among others, an accountability mechanism with which the proper expenditure of public funds may be checked is the power of congressional oversight. As mentioned in <i>Abakada</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[222]</sup> congressional oversight may be performed either through: (<i>a</i>) <b>scrutiny</b> based primarily on Congress‘ power of appropriation and the budget hearings conducted in connection with it, its power to ask heads of departments to appear before and be heard by either of its Houses on any matter pertaining to their departments and its power of confirmation;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[223]</sup> or (<i>b</i>) <b>investigation and monitoring</b> of the implementation of laws pursuant to the power of Congress to conduct <b>inquiries in aid of legislation</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[224]</sup><br><br>The Court agrees with petitioners that certain features embedded in some forms of Congressional Pork Barrel, among others the 2013 PDAF Article, has an effect on congressional oversight. The fact that individual legislators are given post-enactment roles in the implementation of the budget makes it difficult for them to become disinterested "observers” when scrutinizing, investigating or monitoring the implementation of the appropriation law. To a certain extent, the conduct of oversight would be tainted as said legislators, who are vested with post-enactment authority, would, in effect, be checking on activities in which they themselves participate. Also, it must be pointed out that this very same concept of post- enactment authorization runs afoul of Section 14, Article VI of the 1987 Constitution which provides that:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 14. No Senator or Member of the House of Representatives may personally appear as counsel before any court of justice or before the Electoral Tribunals, or quasi-judicial and other administrative bodies. Neither shall he, directly or indirectly, be interested financially in any contract with, or in any franchise or special privilege granted by the Government, or any subdivision, agency, or instrumentality thereof, including any government-owned or controlled corporation, or its subsidiary, during his term of office. <b>He shall not intervene in any matter before any office of the Government for his pecuniary benefit or where he may be called upon to act on account of his office.</b> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Clearly, allowing legislators to intervene in the various phases of project implementation – a matter before another office of government – renders them susceptible to taking undue advantage of their own office.<br><br>The Court, however, cannot completely agree that the same post- enactment authority and/or the individual legislator‘s control of his PDAF per se would allow him to perpetuate himself in office. Indeed, while the Congressional Pork Barrel and a legislator‘s use thereof may be linked to this area of interest, the use of his PDAF for re-election purposes is a matter which must be analyzed based on particular facts and on a case-to-case basis.<br><br>Finally, while the Court accounts for the possibility that the close operational proximity between legislators and the Executive department, through the former‘s post-enactment participation, may affect the process of impeachment, this matter largely borders on the domain of politics and does not strictly concern the Pork Barrel System‘s intrinsic constitutionality. As such, it is an improper subject of judicial assessment.<br><br>In sum, insofar as its post-enactment features dilute congressional oversight and violate Section 14, Article VI of the 1987 Constitution, thus impairing public accountability, the 2013 PDAF Article and other forms of Congressional Pork Barrel of similar nature are deemed as unconstitutional.<br><blockquote><b>4. Political Dynasties.</b><br></blockquote>One of the petitioners submits that the Pork Barrel System enables politicians who are members of political dynasties to accumulate funds to perpetuate themselves in power, in contravention of Section 26, Article II of the 1987 Constitution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[225]</sup> which states that:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 26. The State shall guarantee equal access to opportunities for public service, and <b>prohibit political dynasties <u>as may be defined by law</u></b>. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>At the outset, suffice it to state that the foregoing provision is considered as <b>not self-executing due to the qualifying phrase “as may be defined by law.</b>” In this respect, said provision does not, by and of itself, provide a judicially enforceable constitutional right but merely specifies a guideline for legislative or executive action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[226]</sup> Therefore, since there appears to be no standing law which crystallizes the policy on political dynasties for enforcement, the Court must defer from ruling on this issue.<br><br>In any event, the Court finds the above-stated argument on this score to be largely speculative since it has not been properly demonstrated how the Pork Barrel System would be able to propagate political dynasties.<br><blockquote><b>5. Local Autonomy.</b><br></blockquote>The State‘s policy on local autonomy is principally stated in Section 25, Article II and Sections 2 and 3, Article X of the 1987 Constitution which read as follows:<br><br><blockquote><center>ARTICLE II</center><br>Sec. 25. The State shall ensure the autonomy of local governments.<br><br><center>ARTICLE X<br></center><br>Sec. 2. The territorial and political subdivisions shall enjoy local autonomy.<br><br>Sec. 3. The Congress shall enact a local government code which shall provide for a more responsive and accountable local government structure instituted through a system of decentralization with effective mechanisms of recall, initiative, and referendum, allocate among the different local government units their powers, responsibilities, and resources, and provide for the qualifications, election, appointment and removal, term, salaries, powers and functions and duties of local officials, and all other matters relating to the organization and operation of the local units.</blockquote><br>Pursuant thereto, Congress enacted RA 7160,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[227]</sup> otherwise known as the "Local Government Code of 1991” (LGC), wherein the policy on local autonomy had been more specifically explicated as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 2. <i>Declaration of Policy</i>. – (a) It is hereby declared the policy of the State that the territorial and political subdivisions of the State <b><u>shall enjoy genuine and meaningful local autonomy to enable them to attain their fullest development as self-reliant communities and make them more effective partners in the attainment of national goals</u></b>. Toward this end, the State shall provide for a more responsive and accountable local government structure instituted through a system of decentralization whereby local government units shall be given more powers, authority, responsibilities, and resources. The process of decentralization shall proceed from the National Government to the local government units.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(c) It is likewise the policy of the State to <b><u>require all national agencies and offices to conduct periodic consultations with appropriate local government units</u></b>, nongovernmental and people‘s organizations, and other concerned sectors of the community <b><u>before any project or program is implemented in their respective jurisdictions</u></b>. (Emphases and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>The above-quoted provisions of the Constitution and the LGC reveal the policy of the State to empower local government units (LGUs) to develop and ultimately, become self-sustaining and effective contributors to the national economy. As explained by the Court in<i> Philippine Gamefowl Commission v. Intermediate Appellate Court</i>:<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[228]</sup></font><br><br><blockquote>This is as good an occasion as any <b>to stress the commitment of the Constitution to the policy of local autonomy which is intended to provide the needed impetus and encouragement to the development of our local political subdivisions as “self-reliant communities</b>.” In the words of Jefferson, ?Municipal corporations are the small republics from which the great one derives its strength.” The vitalization of local governments will enable their inhabitants to fully exploit their resources and more important, imbue them with a deepened sense of involvement in public affairs as members of the body politic. <b><u>This objective could be blunted by undue interference by the national government in purely local affairs which are best resolved by the officials and inhabitants of such political units</u></b>. The decision we reach today conforms not only to the letter of the pertinent laws but also to the spirit of the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[229]</sup> (Emphases and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>In the cases at bar, petitioners contend that the Congressional Pork Barrel goes against the constitutional principles on local autonomy since it allows district representatives, who are national officers, to substitute their judgments in utilizing public funds for local development.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[230]</sup><br><br>The Court agrees with petitioners.<br><br><i>Philconsa</i> described the 1994 CDF as an attempt "to make equal the unequal” and that ?[i]t is also a recognition that individual members of Congress, far more than the President and their congressional colleagues, are likely to be knowledgeable about the needs of their respective constituents and the priority to be given each project.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[231]</sup> Drawing strength from this pronouncement, previous legislators justified its existence by stating that ?the relatively small projects implemented under [the Congressional Pork Barrel] complement and link the national development goals to the countryside and grassroots as well as to depressed areas which are overlooked by central agencies which are preoccupied with mega-projects.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[232]</sup> Similarly, in his August 23, 2013 speech on the "abolition” of PDAF and budgetary reforms, President Aquino mentioned that the Congressional Pork Barrel was originally established for a worthy goal, which is to enable the representatives to identify projects for communities that the LGU concerned cannot afford.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[233]</sup><br><br>Notwithstanding these declarations, the Court, however, finds an inherent defect in the system which actually belies the avowed intention of "making equal the unequal.” In particular, the Court observes that <b>the gauge of PDAF and CDF allocation/division is based solely on the fact of office, without taking into account the specific interests and peculiarities of the district the legislator represents</b>. In this regard, the allocation/division limits are clearly not based on genuine parameters of equality, wherein economic or geographic indicators have been taken into consideration. As a result, a district representative of a highly-urbanized metropolis gets the same amount of funding as a district representative of a far-flung rural province which would be relatively "underdeveloped” compared to the former. To add, what rouses graver scrutiny is that even Senators and Party-List Representatives – and in some years, even the Vice- President – who do not represent any locality, receive funding from the Congressional Pork Barrel as well. These certainly are anathema to the Congressional Pork Barrel‘s original intent which is "to make equal the unequal.” Ultimately, the PDAF and CDF had become personal funds under the effective control of each legislator and given unto them on the sole account of their office.<br><br>The Court also observes that this concept of legislator control underlying the CDF and PDAF conflicts with the functions of the various Local Development Councils (LDCs) which are already legally mandated to "assist the corresponding <i>sanggunian</i> in setting the direction of economic and social development, and coordinating development efforts within its territorial jurisdiction.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[234]</sup> Considering that LDCs are instrumentalities whose functions are essentially geared towards managing local affairs,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[235]</sup> their programs, policies and resolutions should not be overridden nor duplicated by individual legislators, who are national officers that have no law-making authority except only when acting as a body. The undermining effect on local autonomy caused by the post-enactment authority conferred to the latter was succinctly put by petitioners in the following wise:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[236]</sup><br><br><blockquote>With PDAF, a Congressman can simply bypass the local development council and initiate projects on his own, and even take sole credit for its execution. Indeed, this type of personality-driven project identification has not only contributed little to the overall development of the district, but has even contributed to ?further weakening infrastructure planning and coordination efforts of the government.”</blockquote><br>Thus, insofar as individual legislators are authorized to intervene in purely local matters and thereby subvert genuine local autonomy, the 2013 PDAF Article as well as all other similar forms of Congressional Pork Barrel is deemed unconstitutional.<br><br>With this final issue on the Congressional Pork Barrel resolved, the Court now turns to the substantive issues involving the Presidential Pork Barrel.<br><blockquote><b>C. Substantive Issues on the Presidential Pork Barrel.</b><br><blockquote><b>1. Validity of Appropriation.</b><br></blockquote></blockquote>Petitioners preliminarily assail Section 8 of PD 910 and Section 12 of PD1869 (now, amended by PD 1993), which respectively provide for the Malampaya Funds and the Presidential Social Fund, as invalid appropriations laws since they do not have the "primary and specific” purpose of authorizing the release of public funds from the National Treasury. Petitioners submit that Section 8 of PD 910 is not an appropriation law since the "primary and specific” purpose of PD 910 is the creation of an Energy Development Board and Section 8 thereof only created a Special Fund incidental thereto.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[237]</sup> In similar regard, petitioners argue that Section 12 of PD 1869 is neither a valid appropriations law since the allocation of the Presidential Social Fund is merely incidental to the "primary and specific” purpose of PD 1869 which is the amendment of the Franchise and Powers of PAGCOR.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[238]</sup> In view of the foregoing, petitioners suppose that such funds are being used without any valid law allowing for their proper appropriation in violation of Section 29(1), Article VI of the 1987 Constitution which states that: "No money shall be paid out of the Treasury except in pursuance of an <b>appropriation made by law</b>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[239]</sup><br><br>The Court disagrees.<br><br>"An appropriation made by law” under the contemplation of Section 29(1), Article VI of the 1987 Constitution exists when a provision of law (a) sets apart <b>a determinate or determinable</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[240]</sup> <b>amount</b> of money and (b) allocates the same for a<b> particular public purpose</b>. These two minimum designations of <b>amount</b> and <b>purpose</b> stem from the very definition of the word "appropriation,” which means "to allot, assign, set apart or apply to a particular use or purpose,” and hence, if written into the law, <b>demonstrate that the legislative <u>intent to appropriate</u> exists.</b> As the Constitution "does not provide or prescribe any particular form of words or religious recitals in which an authorization or appropriation by Congress shall be made, except that it be 'made by law,‘“ an appropriation law may – according to <i>Philconsa</i> – be "detailed and as broad as Congress wants it to be” for as long as the intent to appropriate may be gleaned from the same. As held in the case of <i>Guingona, Jr</i>.: <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[241]</sup><br><br><blockquote><b>[T]here is no provision in our Constitution that provides or prescribes any particular form of words or religious recitals in which an authorization or appropriation by Congress shall be made, except that it be “made by law,”</b> such as precisely the authorization or appropriation under the questioned presidential decrees. In other words, in terms of time horizons, an appropriation may be made impliedly (as by past but subsisting legislations) as well as expressly for the current fiscal year (as by enactment of laws by the present Congress), just as said appropriation may be made in general as well as in specific terms. The Congressional authorization may be embodied in annual laws, such as a general appropriations act or in special provisions of laws of general or special application which appropriate public funds for specific public purposes, such as the questioned decrees. <b><u>An appropriation measure is sufficient if the legislative intention clearly and certainly appears from the language employed</u> (In re Continuing Appropriations, 32 P. 272), whether in the past or in the present.</b> (Emphases and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>Likewise, as ruled by the US Supreme Court in<i> State of Nevada v. La Grave</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[242]</sup><br><br><blockquote>To constitute an appropriation there must be money placed in a fund applicable to the designated purpose. <b>The word appropriate means to allot, assign, set apart or apply to a particular use or purpose</b>. An appropriation in the sense of the constitution means the <b>setting apart a portion of the public funds for a public purpose. No particular form of words is necessary for the purpose, if the intention to appropriate is plainly manifested.</b> (Emphases supplied)</blockquote><br>Thus, based on the foregoing, the Court cannot sustain the argument that the appropriation must be the "primary and specific” purpose of the law in order for a valid appropriation law to exist. To reiterate, if a legal provision designates a determinate or determinable amount of money and allocates the same for a particular public purpose, then the legislative intent to appropriate becomes apparent and, hence, already sufficient to satisfy the requirement of an "appropriation made by law” under contemplation of the Constitution.<br><br>Section 8 of PD 910 pertinently provides:<br><blockquote>Section 8. <i>Appropriations</i>. x x x<br><br><b>All fees, revenues and receipts of the Board from any and all sources</b> including receipts from service contracts and agreements such as application and processing fees, signature bonus, discovery bonus, production bonus; all money collected from concessionaires, representing unspent work obligations, fines and penalties under the Petroleum Act of 1949; as well as the government share representing royalties, rentals, production share on service contracts and similar payments on the exploration, development and exploitation of energy resources, shall form part of a Special Fund to be used<b> to finance energy resource development and exploitation programs and projects of the government and for such other purposes as may be hereafter directed by the President.</b> (Emphases supplied)</blockquote><br>Whereas Section 12 of PD 1869, as amended by PD 1993, reads:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 12. Special Condition of Franchise. — <b>After deducting five (5%) percent as Franchise Tax, the Fifty (50%) percent share of the Government in the aggregate gross earnings of the Corporation from this Franchise, or 60% if the aggregate gross earnings be less than P150,000,000.00</b> shall be set aside and shall accrue to the General Fund<b> to finance the priority infrastructure development projects and to finance the restoration of damaged or destroyed facilities due to calamities, as may be directed and authorized by the Office of the President of the Philippines.</b> (Emphases supplied)</blockquote><br>Analyzing the legal text vis-à-vis the above-mentioned principles, it may then be concluded that (a) Section 8 of PD 910, which creates a Special Fund comprised of "all fees, revenues, and receipts of the [Energy Development] Board from any and all sources” (<b>a determinable amount</b>) "to be used to finance energy resource development and exploitation programs and projects of the government and for such other purposes as may be hereafter directed by the President” (<b>a specified public purpose</b>), and (b) Section 12 of PD 1869, as amended by PD 1993, which similarly sets aside, "[a]fter deducting five (5%) percent as Franchise Tax, the Fifty (50%) percent share of the Government in the aggregate gross earnings of [PAGCOR], or 60%[,] if the aggregate gross earnings be less than P150,000,000.00” (<b>also a determinable amount</b>) "to finance the priority infrastructure development projects and x x x the restoration of damaged or destroyed facilities due to calamities, as may be directed and authorized by the Office of the President of the Philippines” (<b>also a specified public purpose</b>), are legal appropriations under Section 29(1), Article VI of the 1987 Constitution.<br><br>In this relation, it is apropos to note that the 2013 PDAF Article cannot be properly deemed as a legal appropriation under the said constitutional provision precisely because, as earlier stated, it contains post- enactment measures which effectively create a system of intermediate appropriations. These intermediate appropriations are the actual appropriations meant for enforcement and since they are made by individual legislators after the GAA is passed, they occur outside the law. As such, the Court observes that the real appropriation made under the 2013 PDAF Article is not the P24.79 Billion allocated for the entire PDAF, but rather the post-enactment determinations made by the individual legislators which are, to repeat, occurrences outside of the law. Irrefragably, the 2013 PDAF Article does not constitute an "appropriation made by law” since it, in its truest sense, only <b>authorizes individual legislators to appropriate</b> in violation of the non-delegability principle as afore-discussed.<br><blockquote><b>2. Undue Delegation.</b><br></blockquote>On a related matter, petitioners contend that Section 8 of PD 910 constitutes an undue delegation of legislative power since the phrase "and for such other purposes as may be hereafter directed by the President” gives the President "unbridled discretion to determine for what purpose the funds will be used.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[243]</sup> Respondents, on the other hand, urged the Court to apply the principle of<i> ejusdem generis</i> to the same section and thus, construe the phrase "and for such other purposes as may be hereafter directed by the President” to refer only to other purposes related "to energy resource development and exploitation programs and projects of the government.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[244]</sup><br><br>The Court agrees with petitioners‘ submissions.<br><br>While the designation of a determinate or determinable amount for a particular public purpose is sufficient for a legal appropriation to exist, the appropriation law must contain <b>adequate legislative guidelines</b> if the same law delegates rule-making authority to <b>the Executive</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[245]</sup> either for the purpose of (<i>a</i>)<b> filling up the details</b> of the law for its enforcement, known as supplementary rule-making, or (<i>b</i>) <b>ascertaining facts</b> to bring the law into actual operation, referred to as contingent rule-making.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[246]</sup> There are two (2) fundamental tests to ensure that the legislative guidelines for delegated rule- making are indeed adequate. The first test is called the "<b>completeness test.</b>” Case law states that a law is complete when it sets forth therein the policy to be executed, carried out, or implemented by the delegate. On the other hand, the second test is called the "<b>sufficient standard test</b>.” Jurisprudence holds that a law lays down a sufficient standard when it provides adequate guidelines or limitations in the law to map out the boundaries of the delegate‘s authority and prevent the delegation from running riot.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[247]</sup> To be sufficient, the standard must specify the limits of the delegate‘s authority, announce the legislative policy, and identify the conditions under which it is to be implemented.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[248]</sup><br><br>In view of the foregoing, the Court agrees with petitioners that the phrase "and for such other purposes as may be hereafter directed by the President” under <b><u>Section 8 of PD 910</u></b> constitutes an undue delegation of legislative power insofar as it does not lay down a sufficient standard to adequately determine the limits of the President‘s authority with respect to the purpose for which the Malampaya Funds may be used. <b>As it reads, the said phrase gives the President wide latitude to use the Malampaya Funds for any other purpose he may direct and, in effect, allows him to unilaterally appropriate public funds beyond the purview of the law.</b> That the subject phrase may be confined only to "energy resource development and exploitation programs and projects of the government” under the principle of <i>ejusdem generis</i>, meaning that the general word or phrase is to be construed to include – or be restricted to – things akin to, resembling, or of the same kind or class as those specifically mentioned,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[249]</sup> is belied by three (3) reasons: <b>first</b>, the phrase "energy resource development and exploitation programs and projects of the government” states <b>a <u>singular and general</u> class</b> and hence, cannot be treated as a statutory reference of specific things from which the general phrase "for such other purposes” may be limited; <b>second</b>, the said phrase also exhausts the class it represents, namely energy development programs of the government;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[250]</sup> and, <b>third</b>, the Executive department has, in fact, used the Malampaya Funds for non-energy related purposes under the subject phrase, thereby contradicting respondents‘ own position that it is limited only to "energy resource development and exploitation programs and projects of the government.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[251]</sup> Thus, while Section 8 of PD 910 may have passed the completeness test since the policy of energy development is clearly deducible from its text, the phrase "and for such other purposes as may be hereafter directed by the President” under the same provision of law should nonetheless be stricken down as unconstitutional as it lies independently unfettered by any sufficient standard of the delegating law. This notwithstanding, it must be underscored that the rest of Section 8, insofar as it allows for the use of the Malampaya Funds "to finance energy resource development and exploitation programs and projects of the government,” remains legally effective and subsisting. Truth be told, the declared unconstitutionality of the aforementioned phrase is but an assurance that the Malampaya Funds would be used – as it should be used – only in accordance with the avowed purpose and intention of PD 910.<br><br>As for the Presidential Social Fund, the Court takes judicial notice of the fact that Section 12 of PD 1869 has already been amended by PD 1993 which thus moots the parties‘ submissions on the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[252]</sup> Nevertheless, since the amendatory provision may be readily examined under the current parameters of discussion, the Court proceeds to resolve its constitutionality.<br><br>Primarily, Section 12 of PD 1869, as amended by PD 1993, indicates that the Presidential Social Fund may be used "to [<b>first</b>,] finance the priority infrastructure development projects and [<b>second</b>,] to finance the restoration of damaged or destroyed facilities due to calamities, as may be directed and authorized by the Office of the President of the Philippines.” The Court finds that while the second indicated purpose adequately curtails the authority of the President to spend the Presidential Social Fund only for restoration purposes which arise from calamities, the first indicated purpose, however, gives him <i>carte blanche</i> authority to use the same fund for any infrastructure project he may so determine as a "priority”. Verily, the law does not supply a definition of "priority infrastructure development projects” and hence, leaves the President without any guideline to construe the same. To note, the delimitation of a project as one of "infrastructure” is too broad of a classification since the said term could pertain to any kind of facility. This may be deduced from its lexicographic definition as follows: "[t]he underlying framework of a system, [especially] public services and facilities (such as highways, schools, bridges, sewers, and water-systems) needed to support commerce as well as economic and residential development.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[253]</sup> In fine, the phrase "to finance the priority infrastructure development projects” must be stricken down as unconstitutional since – similar to the above- assailed provision under Section 8 of PD 910 – it lies independently unfettered by any sufficient standard of the delegating law. As they are severable, all other provisions of Section 12 of PD 1869, as amended by PD 1993, remains legally effective and subsisting.<br><br><b>D. Ancillary Prayers.<br><br>1. Petitioners’ Prayer to be Furnished Lists and Detailed Reports.</b><br><br>Aside from seeking the Court to declare the Pork Barrel System unconstitutional – as the Court did so in the context of its pronouncements made in this Decision – petitioners equally pray that the Executive Secretary and/or the DBM be ordered to release to the CoA and to the public: (<i>a</i>) "the complete schedule/list of legislators who have availed of their PDAF and VILP from the years 2003 to 2013, specifying the use of the funds, the project or activity and the recipient entities or individuals, and all pertinent data thereto” (PDAF Use Schedule/List);<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[254]</sup> and (<i>b</i>) "the use of the Executive‘s [lump-sum, discretionary] funds, including the proceeds from the x x x Malampaya Fund[s] [and] remittances from the [PAGCOR] x x x from 2003 to 2013, specifying the x x x project or activity and the recipient entities or individuals, and all pertinent data thereto”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[255]</sup> (Presidential Pork Use Report). Petitioners‘ prayer is grounded on Section 28, Article II and Section 7, Article III of the 1987 Constitution which read as follows:<br><br><blockquote><center>ARTICLE II<br></center><br>Sec. 28. Subject to reasonable conditions prescribed by law, the State adopts and implements a policy of full public disclosure of all its transactions involving public interest.<br><br><center>ARTICLE III<br></center><br>Sec. 7. The right of the people to information on matters of public concern shall be recognized. Access to official records, and to documents and papers pertaining to official acts, transactions, or decisions, as well as to government research data used as basis for policy development, shall be afforded the citizen, subject to such limitations as may be provided by law.</blockquote><br>The Court denies petitioners‘ submission.<br><br>Case law instructs that the proper remedy to invoke the right to information is to file a petition for mandamus. As explained in the case of <i>Legaspi v. Civil Service Commission</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[256]</sup><br><br><blockquote>[W]hile the manner of examining public records may be subject to reasonable regulation by the government agency in custody thereof, the duty to disclose the information of public concern, and to afford access to public records cannot be discretionary on the part of said agencies. Certainly, its performance cannot be made contingent upon the discretion of such agencies. Otherwise, the enjoyment of the constitutional right may be rendered nugatory by any whimsical exercise of agency discretion. The constitutional duty, not being discretionary, <b>its performance may be compelled by a writ of mandamus in a <i>proper case</i>.</b><br><br>But what is a proper case for Mandamus to issue? In the case before Us, the public right to be enforced and the concomitant duty of the State are unequivocably set forth in the Constitution. <b>The decisive question on the propriety of the issuance of the writ of mandamus in this case is, whether the information sought by the petitioner is within the ambit of the constitutional guarantee</b>. (Emphases supplied)<br></blockquote><br>Corollarily, in the case of <i>Valmonte v. Belmonte Jr.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[257]</sup> (<i>Valmonte</i>), it has been clarified that the right to information does not include the right to compel the preparation of "lists, abstracts, summaries and the like.” In the same case, it was stressed that it is essential that the "applicant has a well- defined, clear and certain legal right to the thing demanded and that it is the imperative duty of defendant to perform the act required.” Hence, without the foregoing substantiations, the Court cannot grant a particular request for information. The pertinent portions of <i>Valmonte</i> are hereunder quoted:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[258]</sup><br><br><blockquote>Although citizens are afforded the right to information and, pursuant thereto, are entitled to "access to official records," <b>the Constitution does not accord them a right to compel custodians of official records to prepare lists, abstracts, summaries and the like in their desire to acquire information on matters of public concern.</b><br><br>It must be stressed that it is essential for a writ of mandamus to issue that <b>the applicant has a well-defined, clear and certain legal right to the thing demanded and that it is the imperative duty of defendant to perform the act required.</b> The corresponding duty of the respondent to perform the required act must be clear and specific [<i>Lemi v. Valencia</i>, G.R. No. L-20768, November 29,1968,126 SCRA 203; <i>Ocampo v. Subido</i>, G.R. No. L-28344, August 27, 1976, 72 SCRA 443.] <b>The request of the petitioners fails to meet this standard, there being no duty on the part of respondent to prepare the list requested</b>. (Emphases supplied)</blockquote><br>In these cases, aside from the fact that none of the petitions are in the nature of mandamus actions, the Court finds that petitioners have failed to establish a "a well-defined, clear and certain legal right” to be furnished by the Executive Secretary and/or the DBM of their requested PDAF Use Schedule/List and Presidential Pork Use Report. Neither did petitioners assert any law or administrative issuance which would form the bases of the latter‘s duty to furnish them with the documents requested. While petitioners pray that said information be equally released to the CoA, it must be pointed out that the CoA has not been impleaded as a party to these cases nor has it filed any petition before the Court to be allowed access to or to compel the release of any official document relevant to the conduct of its audit investigations. While the Court recognizes that the information requested is a matter of significant public concern, however, if only to ensure that the parameters of disclosure are properly foisted and so as not to unduly hamper the equally important interests of the government, it is constrained to deny petitioners‘ prayer on this score, without prejudice to a proper mandamus case which they, or even the CoA, may choose to pursue through a separate petition.<br><br>It bears clarification that the Court‘s denial herein should only cover petitioners‘ plea to be furnished with such schedule/list and report and not in any way deny them, or the general public, access to official documents which are already existing and of public record. <b>Subject to reasonable regulation and absent any valid statutory prohibition, access to these documents should not be proscribed</b>. Thus, in <i>Valmonte</i>, while the Court denied the application for mandamus towards the preparation of the list requested by petitioners therein, it nonetheless allowed access to the documents sought for by the latter, subject, however, to the custodian‘s reasonable regulations, viz.:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[259]</sup><br><br><blockquote>In fine, petitioners are entitled to access to the documents evidencing loans granted by the GSIS, subject to reasonable regulations that the latter may promulgate relating to the manner and hours of examination, to the end that damage to or loss of the records may be avoided, that undue interference with the duties of the custodian of the records may be prevented and that the right of other persons entitled to inspect the records may be insured [<i>Legaspi v. Civil Service Commission, supra</i> at p. 538, quoting <i>Subido v. Ozaeta,</i> 80 Phil. 383, 387.] The petition, as to the second and third alternative acts sought to be done by petitioners, is meritorious.<br><br>However, the same cannot be said with regard to the first act sought by petitioners, i.e., "to furnish petitioners the list of the names of the Batasang Pambansa members belonging to the UNIDO and PDP- Laban who were able to secure clean loans immediately before the February 7 election thru the intercession/marginal note of the then First Lady Imelda Marcos.”</blockquote><br>The Court, therefore, applies the same treatment here.<br><br>2. <b>Petitioners’ Prayer to Include Matters in Congressional Deliberations.</b><br><br>Petitioners further seek that the Court "[order] the inclusion in budgetary deliberations with the Congress of all presently, off-budget, lump sum, discretionary funds including but not limited to, proceeds from the x x x Malampaya Fund, remittances from the [PAGCOR] and the [PCSO] or the Executive‘s Social Funds[.]”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[260]</sup><br><br>Suffice it to state that the above-stated relief sought by petitioners covers a matter which is generally left to the prerogative of the political branches of government. Hence, lest the Court itself overreach, it must equally deny their prayer on this score.<br><br><b>3. Respondents’ Prayer to Lift TRO; Consequential Effects of Decision.</b><br><br>The final issue to be resolved stems from the interpretation accorded by the DBM to the concept of released funds. In response to the Court‘s September 10, 2013 TRO that enjoined the release of the remaining PDAF allocated for the year 2013, the DBM issued Circular Letter No. 2013-8 dated September 27, 2013 (DBM Circular 2013-8) which pertinently reads as follows:<br><br><blockquote>3.0 Nonetheless, PDAF projects funded under the FY 2013 GAA, where a Special Allotment Release Order (SARO) has been issued by the DBM and such SARO has been obligated by the implementing agencies prior to the issuance of the TRO, may continually be implemented and disbursements thereto effected by the agencies concerned.</blockquote><br>Based on the text of the foregoing, the DBM authorized the continued implementation and disbursement of PDAF funds as long as they are: first, covered by a SARO; and, <b>second</b>, that said SARO had been obligated by the implementing agency concerned prior to the issuance of the Court‘s September 10, 2013 TRO.<br><br>Petitioners take issue with the foregoing circular, arguing that ?the issuance of the SARO does not yet involve the release of funds under the PDAF, as release is only triggered by the issuance of a Notice of Cash Allocation [(NCA)].”<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[261]</sup></font> As such, PDAF disbursements, even if covered by an obligated SARO, should remain enjoined.<br><br>For their part, respondents espouse that the subject TRO only covers "unreleased and unobligated allotments.” They explain that once a SARO has been issued and obligated by the implementing agency concerned, the PDAF funds covered by the same are already "beyond the reach of the TRO because they cannot be considered as 'remaining PDAF.‘“ They conclude that this is a reasonable interpretation of the TRO by the DBM.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[262]</sup></font><br><br>The Court agrees with petitioners in part.<br><br>At the outset, it must be observed that the issue of whether or not the Court‘s September 10, 2013 TRO should be lifted is a matter rendered moot by the present Decision. The unconstitutionality of the 2013 PDAF Article as declared herein has the consequential effect of converting the temporary injunction into a permanent one. <b>Hence, from the promulgation of this Decision, the release of the remaining PDAF funds for 2013, among others, is now permanently enjoined.</b><br><br>The propriety of the DBM‘s interpretation of the concept of "release” must, nevertheless, be resolved as it has a practical impact on the execution of the current Decision. In particular, the Court must resolve the issue of whether or not PDAF funds covered by obligated SAROs, at the time this Decision is promulgated, may still be disbursed following the DBM‘s interpretation in DBM Circular 2013-8.<br><br>On this score, the Court agrees with petitioners‘ posturing for the fundamental reason that funds covered by an obligated SARO are yet to be "released” under legal contemplation. A SARO, as defined by the DBM itself in its website, is "[a]specific authority issued to identified<b> agencies to incur obligations</b> not exceeding a given amount during a specified period for the purpose indicated. It shall cover expenditures <b>the release of which is subject to compliance</b> with specific laws or regulations, or is <b>subject to separate approval or clearance by competent authority.</b>”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[263]</sup> Based on this definition, it may be gleaned that a SARO only evinces the existence of an obligation and not the directive to pay. Practically speaking, the SARO does not have the direct and immediate effect of placing public funds beyond the control of the disbursing authority. In fact, a SARO may even be withdrawn under certain circumstances which will prevent the actual release of funds. On the other hand, the actual release of funds is brought about by the issuance of the NCA,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[264]</sup> which is subsequent to the issuance of a SARO. As may be determined from the statements of the DBM representative during the Oral Arguments:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[265]</sup><br><br><blockquote>Justice Bernabe: Is the notice of allocation issued simultaneously with the SARO?<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Atty. Ruiz: It comes after. <b>The SARO, Your Honor, is only the go signal for the agencies to obligate or to enter into commitments. <u>The NCA, Your Honor, is already the go signal to the treasury for us to be able to pay or to liquidate the amounts obligated in the SARO</u></b>; so it comes after. x x x The NCA, Your Honor, is the go signal for the MDS for the authorized government-disbursing banks to, therefore, pay the payees depending on the projects or projects covered by the SARO and the NCA.<br><br>Justice Bernabe: Are there instances that SAROs are cancelled or revoked?<br><br>Atty. Ruiz: Your Honor, I would like to instead submit <b>that there are instances that the SAROs issued are <u>withdrawn</u> by the DBM.</b><br><br>Justice Bernabe: They are withdrawn?<br><br>Atty. Ruiz: Yes, Your Honor x x x. (Emphases and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>Thus, unless an NCA has been issued, public funds should not be treated as funds which have been "released.” In this respect, therefore, the disbursement of 2013 PDAF funds which are only covered by obligated SAROs, and without any corresponding NCAs issued, must, <b>at the time of this Decision’s promulgation</b>, be enjoined and consequently<b> reverted to the unappropriated surplus of the general fund.</b> Verily, in view of the declared unconstitutionality of the 2013 PDAF Article, the funds appropriated pursuant thereto cannot be disbursed even though already obligated, else the Court sanctions the dealing of funds coming from an unconstitutional source.<br><br>This same pronouncement must be equally applied to (a) the Malampaya Funds which have been obligated but not released – meaning, those merely covered by a SARO – under the phrase "and for such other purposes as may be hereafter directed by the President” pursuant to Section 8 of PD 910; and (b) funds sourced from the Presidential Social Fund under the phrase "to finance the priority infrastructure development projects” pursuant to Section 12 of PD 1869, as amended by PD 1993, which were altogether declared by the Court as unconstitutional. However, these funds should not be reverted to the general fund as afore-stated but instead, respectively remain under the Malampaya Funds and the Presidential Social Fund to be utilized for their corresponding special purposes not otherwise declared as unconstitutional.<br><br><b>E. Consequential Effects of Decision.</b><br><br>As a final point, it must be stressed that the Court‘s pronouncement anent the <b>unconstitutionality</b> of (a) the 2013 PDAF Article and its Special Provisions, (b) all other Congressional Pork Barrel provisions similar thereto, and (c) the phrases (1) ?and for such other purposes as may be hereafter directed by the President” under Section 8 of PD 910, and (2) "to finance the priority infrastructure development projects” under Section 12 of PD 1869, as amended by PD 1993, must only be treated as <b>prospective in effect</b> in view of the <b>operative fact doctrine.</b><br><br>To explain, the operative fact doctrine exhorts the recognition that until the judiciary, in an appropriate case, declares the invalidity of a certain legislative or executive act, such act is presumed constitutional and thus, entitled to obedience and respect and should be properly enforced and complied with. As explained in the recent case of <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. San Roque Power Corporation</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[266]</sup> the doctrine merely "reflect[s] awareness that precisely because the judiciary is the governmental organ which has the final say on whether or not a legislative or executive measure is valid, a period of time may have elapsed before it can exercise the power of judicial review that may lead to a declaration of nullity. It would be to deprive the law of its quality of fairness and justice then, if there be no recognition of what had transpired prior to such adjudication.”<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[267]</sup></font> "In the language of an American Supreme Court decision: 'The actual existence of a statute, prior to such a determination [of unconstitutionality], is an <b>operative fact</b> and may have consequences which cannot justly be ignored.‘“<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[268]</sup><br><br>For these reasons, this Decision should be heretofore applied prospectively.<br><br><b><center>Conclusion</center></b><br>The Court renders this Decision to rectify an error which has persisted in the chronicles of our history. In the final analysis, the Court must strike down the Pork Barrel System as <b>unconstitutional</b> in view of the inherent defects in the rules within which it operates. To recount, insofar as it has allowed legislators to wield, in varying gradations, non-oversight, post- enactment authority in vital areas of budget execution, the system has violated the<b> principle of separation of powers</b>; insofar as it has conferred unto legislators the power of appropriation by giving them personal, discretionary funds from which they are able to fund specific projects which they themselves determine, it has similarly violated the <b>principle of non- delegability of legislative power</b>; insofar as it has created a system of budgeting wherein items are not textualized into the appropriations bill, it has flouted the <b>prescribed procedure of presentment</b> and, in the process, <b>denied the President the power to veto items</b>; insofar as it has diluted the effectiveness of congressional oversight by giving legislators a stake in the affairs of budget execution, an aspect of governance which they may be called to monitor and scrutinize, the system has equally impaired <b>public accountability</b>; insofar as it has authorized legislators, who are national officers, to intervene in affairs of purely local nature, despite the existence of capable local institutions, it has likewise subverted genuine <b>local autonomy</b>; and again, insofar as it has conferred to the President the power to appropriate funds intended by law for energy-related purposes only to other purposes he may deem fit as well as other public funds under the broad classification of "priority infrastructure development projects,” it has once more transgressed the principle of <b>non-delegability</b>.<br><br>For as long as this nation adheres to the rule of law, any of the multifarious unconstitutional methods and mechanisms the Court has herein pointed out should never again be adopted in any system of governance, by any name or form, by any semblance or similarity, by any influence or effect. Disconcerting as it is to think that a system so constitutionally unsound has monumentally endured, the Court urges the people and its co- stewards in government to look forward with the optimism of change and the awareness of the past. At a time of great civic unrest and vociferous public debate, the Court fervently hopes that its Decision today, while it may not purge all the wrongs of society nor bring back what has been lost, guides this nation to the path forged by the Constitution so that no one may heretofore detract from its cause nor stray from its course. After all, this is the Court‘s bounden duty and no other‘s.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petitions are <b>PARTLY GRANTED</b>. In view of the constitutional violations discussed in this Decision, the Court hereby declares as <b>UNCONSTITUTIONAL</b>: (<b><u>a</u></b>) the entire 2013 PDAF Article; (<b><u>b</u></b>) all legal provisions of past and present Congressional Pork Barrel Laws, such as the previous PDAF and CDF Articles and the various Congressional Insertions, which authorize/d legislators – whether individually or collectively organized into committees – to intervene, assume or participate in any of the various post-enactment stages of the budget execution, such as but not limited to the areas of project identification, modification and revision of project identification, fund release and/or fund realignment, unrelated to the power of congressional oversight; (<i><b>c</b></i>) all legal provisions of past and present Congressional Pork Barrel Laws, such as the previous PDAF and CDF Articles and the various Congressional Insertions, which confer/red personal, lump-sum allocations to legislators from which they are able to fund specific projects which they themselves determine; (<b><u>d</u></b>) all informal practices of similar import and effect, which the Court similarly deems to be acts of grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction; and (<b><u>e</u></b>) the phrases (1) ?and for such other purposes as may be hereafter directed by the President” under Section 8 of Presidential Decree No. 910 and (2) "to finance the priority infrastructure development projects” under Section 12 of Presidential Decree No. 1869, as amended by Presidential Decree No. 1993, for both failing the sufficient standard test in violation of the principle of non-delegability of legislative power.<br><br>Accordingly, the Court‘s temporary injunction dated September 10, 2013 is hereby declared to be <b>PERMANENT</b>. Thus, the disbursement/release of the remaining PDAF funds allocated for the year 2013, as well as for all previous years, and the funds sourced from (1) the Malampaya Funds under the phrase "and for such other purposes as may be hereafter directed by the President” pursuant to Section 8 of Presidential Decree No. 910, and (2) the Presidential Social Fund under the phrase ?to finance the priority infrastructure development projects” pursuant to Section 12 of Presidential Decree No. 1869, as amended by Presidential Decree No. 1993, which are, at the time this Decision is promulgated, not covered by Notice of Cash Allocations (NCAs) but only by Special Allotment Release Orders (SAROs), whether obligated or not, are hereby <b>ENJOINED</b>. The remaining PDAF funds covered by this permanent injunction shall not be disbursed/released but instead reverted to the unappropriated surplus of the general fund, while the funds under the Malampaya Funds and the Presidential Social Fund shall remain therein to be utilized for their respective special purposes not otherwise declared as unconstitutional.<br><br>On the other hand, due to improper recourse and lack of proper substantiation, the Court hereby <b>DENIES</b> petitioners‘ prayer seeking that the Executive Secretary and/or the Department of Budget and Management be ordered to provide the public and the Commission on Audit complete lists/schedules or detailed reports related to the availments and utilization of the funds subject of these cases. Petitioners‘ access to official documents already available and of public record which are related to these funds must, however, not be prohibited but merely subjected to the custodian‘s reasonable regulations or any valid statutory prohibition on the same. This denial is without prejudice to a proper mandamus case which they or the Commission on Audit may choose to pursue through a separate petition.<br><br>The Court also <b>DENIES</b> petitioners‘ prayer to order the inclusion of the funds subject of these cases in the budgetary deliberations of Congress as the same is a matter left to the prerogative of the political branches of government.<br><br>Finally, the Court hereby <b>DIRECTS</b> all prosecutorial organs of the government to, within the bounds of reasonable dispatch, investigate and accordingly prosecute all government officials and/or private individuals for possible criminal offenses related to the irregular, improper and/or unlawful disbursement/utilization of all funds under the Pork Barrel System.<br><br>This Decision is immediately executory but prospective in effect.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Peralta, Bersamin, Del Castillo, Villarama, Jr., Perez, Mendoza</i>, and <i>Reyes, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><i>Sereno, C.J.</i>, Carpio, see concurring opinion.<br><i>Velasco, Jr., J.</i>, no part.<br><i>Leonardo-De Castro, J.</i>, I concur and also join the concurring opinion of Justice Carpio.<br><i>Brion, J.,</i> I join the opinion of Justice Carpio, subject to my concurring &amp; dissenting opinion.<br><i>Abad, J.,</i> I join the concurring opinion of J.

It is no accident, for instance, that the release of the allocations often coincides with the passage of a Palace- sponsored bill. <br><br>That pork funds have grown by leaps and bounds in the last decade can be traced to presidents in need of Congress support. The rise in pork was particularly notable during the Ramos administration, when the president and House Speaker Jose de Venecia, Jr. used generous fund releases to convince congressmen to support Malacañang-initiated legislation. The Ramos era, in fact, became known as the 'golden age of pork.‘<br><br>Through the years, though, congressmen have also taken care to look after their very own. More often than not, pork-barrel funds are funneled to projects in towns and cities where the lawmakers' own relatives have been elected to public office; thus, pork is a tool for building family power as well. COA has come across many instances where pork-funded projects ended up directly benefiting no less than the lawmaker or his or her relatives.” (CHUA, YVONNE T. and CRUZ, BOOMA, "Pork is a Political, Not A Developmental, Tool.” <http: pcij.org="" stories="" 2004="" pork.html=""> [visited October 22, 2013].) 91 With reports from Inquirer Research and Salaverria, Leila, "Candazo, first whistle-blower on pork barrel scam, dies; 61,” Philippine Daily Inquirer, August 20, 2013, <http: newsinfo.="" inquirer.net="" 469439="" candazo-first-whistle-blower-on-pork-barrel-scam-dies-61=""> (visited October 21, 2013.)<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> Id. <br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> Id. <br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> Id. <br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> <i>Lawyers Against Monopoly and Poverty (LAMP) v.

The foregoing proviso should be read as a textual reference to the savings requirement stated under Section 25(5), Article VI of the 1987 Constitution which pertinently provides that " x x x the President, the President of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and the heads of Constitutional Commissions may, by law, be authorized to augment any item in the general appropriations law for their respective offices from <b>savings</b> in other items of their respective appropriations. In addition, Sections 4.2.3, 4.2.4 and 4.3.3 of DBM Circular 547-13, the implementing rules of the 2013 PDAF Article, respectively require that: (a) "the allotment is still valid or has not yet lapsed”; (b) "[r]equests for realignment of <b>unobligated allotment</b> as of December 31, 2012 treated as continuing appropriations in FY 2013 shall be submitted to the DBM not later than June 30, 2013”; and (c) requests for realignment shall be supported with, among others, a "[c]ertification of availability of funds.” As the letter of the law and the guidelines related thereto evoke the legal concept of <b>savings</b>, Special Provision 4 must be construed to be a provision on realignment of PDAF funds, which would necessarily but only incidentally include the projects for which the funds have been allotted to. To construe it otherwise would effectively allow PDAF funds to be realigned outside the ambit of the foregoing provision, thereby sanctioning a constitutional aberration. <br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[190]</sup> Aside from the sharing of the executive‘s realignment authority with legislators in violation of the separation of powers principle, it must be pointed out that Special Provision 4, insofar as it confers fund realignment authority to department secretaries, is already unconstitutional by itself. As recently held in <i>Nazareth v. Villar (Nazareth)</i>, G.R. No. 188635, January 29, 2013, 689 SCRA 385, 403-404, Section 25(5), Article VI of the 1987 Constitution, limiting the authority to augment, is "strictly but reasonably construed as exclusive” in <b>favor of the high officials named therein.</b> As such, the authority to realign funds allocated to the implementing agencies is exclusively vested in the President, <i>viz</i>.:<br><br><blockquote><b>It bears emphasizing that the exception in favor of the high officials named in Section 25(5), Article VI of the Constitution limiting the authority to transfer savings only to augment another item in the GAA is strictly but reasonably construed as <u>exclusive</u>.</b> As the Court has expounded in <i>Lokin, Jr. v. Commission on Elections</i>: <br><br><b>When the statute itself enumerates the exceptions to the application of the general rule, the exceptions are strictly but reasonably construed.</b> The exceptions extend only as far as their language fairly warrants, and all doubts should be resolved in favor of the general provision rather than the exceptions. Where the general rule is established by a statute with exceptions, none but the enacting authority can curtail the former. Not even the courts may add to the latter by implication, and it is a rule that an express exception excludes all others, although it is always proper in determining the applicability of the rule to inquire whether, in a particular case, it accords with reason and justice.<br><br>The appropriate and natural office of the exception is to exempt something from the scope of the general words of a statute, which is otherwise within the scope and meaning of such general words. <b>Consequently, the existence of an exception in a statute clarifies the intent that the statute shall apply to all cases not excepted</b>. Exceptions are subject to the rule of strict construction; hence, any doubt will be resolved in favor of the general provision and against the exception. Indeed, the liberal construction of a statute will seem to require in many circumstances that the exception, by which the operation of the statute is limited or abridged, should receive a restricted construction. (Emphases and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br><br>The cogence of the <i>Nazareth</i> dictum is not enfeebled by an invocation of the doctrine of qualified political agency (otherwise known as the ?alter ego doctrine”) for the bare reason that the same is <b>not applicable when the Constitution itself requires the President himself to act on a particular matter</b>, such as that instructed under Section 25(5), Article VI of the Constitution. As held in the landmark case of <i>Villena v.

One is the doctrine of <b>separation of powers</b>: Why go to the trouble of separating the three powers of government if they can straightway remerge on their own motion? The second is the concept of<b> due process of law</b>, which precludes the transfer of regulatory functions to private persons. Lastly, there is the maxim of agency "<b><i>Delegata potestas non potest delegari</i></b>,” which John Locke borrowed and formulated as a dogma of political science . . . Chief Justice Taft offered the following explanation of the origin and limitations of this idea as a postulate of constitutional law: "The well-known maxim '<i>delegata potestas non potest delefari</i>,‘ applicable to the law of agency in the general common law, is well understood and has had wider application in the construction of our Federal and State Constitutions than it has in private law . . . The Federal and State Constitutions than it has in private law . . . The Federal Constitution and State Constitutions of this country divide the governmental power into three branches . . . In carrying out that constitutional division . . . it is a breach of the National fundamental law if Congress gives up its legislative power and transfers it to the President, or to the Judicial branch, or <b>if by law it attempts to invest itself or its members</b> with either executive power of judicial power. This is not to say that the three branches are not co-ordinate parts of one government and that each in the field of its duties may not invoke government and that each in the field of its duties may not invoke the action of the two other branches in so far as the action invoked shall not be an assumption of the constitutional field of action of another branch. In determining what it may do in seeking assistance from another branch, the extent and character of that assistance must be fixed according to common sense and the inherent necessities of the governmental coordination.

Quite the contrary, the 1st paragraph of the said provision clearly indicates that the Presidential Social Fund shall be used to finance specified types of priority infrastructure and socio-civic projects, namely, Flood Control, Sewerage and Sewage, Nutritional Control, Population Control, Tulungan ng Bayan Centers, Beautification and Kilusang Kabuhayan at Kaunlaran (KKK) projects located within the Metropolitan Manila area. However, with regard to the stated geographical-operational limitation, the 2nd paragraph of the same provision nevertheless allows the Presidential Social Fund to finance "priority infrastructure and socio-civic projects throughout the Philippines as may be directed and authorized by the Office of the President of the Philippines.” It must, however, be qualified that the 2nd paragraph should not be construed to mean that the Office of the President may direct and authorize the use of the Presidential Social Fund to any kind of infrastructure and socio-civic project throughout the Philippines. Pursuant to the maxim of noscitur a sociis, (meaning, that a word or phrase‘s "correct construction may be made clear and specific by considering the company of words in which it is founded or with which it is associated”; see <i>Chavez v. Judicial and Bar Council,</i> G.R. No. 202242, July 17, 2012, 676 SCRA 579, 598-599) the 2nd paragraph should be construed only as an expansion of the geographical-operational limitation stated in the 1st paragraph of the same provision and not a grant of <i>carte blanche</i> authority to the President to veer away from the project types specified thereunder. In other words, what the 2<sup>nd</sup> paragraph merely allows is the use of the Presidential Social Fund for Flood Control, Sewerage and Sewage, Nutritional Control, Population Control, Tulungan ng Bayan Centers, Beautification and Kilusang Kabuhayan at Kaunlaran (KKK) projects even though the same would be located outside the Metropolitan Manila area. To deem it otherwise would be tantamount to unduly expanding the rule-making authority of the President in violation of the sufficient standard test and, ultimately, the principle of non-delegability of legislative power.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[253]</sup> Black‘s Law Dictionary (7th Ed., 1999), p. 784.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[254]</sup> <i>Rollo</i> (G.R.

In striking down the Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) for being unconstitutional and violative of the principle of separation of powers, the Members of this Court have acted as one sober voice of reason amidst the multitude of opinions surrounding the present controversy. It is in the spirit of this need for sobriety and restraint – from which the Court draws its own legitimacy – that I must add essential, clarificatory points.<br><br>The Court does not deny that the PDAF had also benefited some of our countrymen who most need the government’s assistance. Yet by striking it down, the Court has simply exercised its constitutional duty to re-emphasize the roles of the two political branches of government, in the matter of the needs of the nation and its citizens. The Decision has not denied health and educational assistance to Filipinos; rather, it has emphasized that it is the Executive branch which implements the State’s duty to provide health and education, among others, to its citizens. This is the structure of government under the Constitution, which the Court has merely set aright.<br><br>Guided by the incisive Concurring Opinion penned by Justice Florentino Feliciano in the seminal case of <i>Oposa v. Factoran,</i> I suggest that the Court circumscribe what may be left for future determination in an appropriate case – lest we inflict what he termed “excessive violence” to the language of the Constitution. Any collegial success in our Decision is measurable by the discipline to rule only on defined issues, and to curb any excess against the mandated limitations of judicial review.<br><br>As Justice Feliciano has stated in <i>Oposa</i>, in certain areas, “our courts have no claim to special technical competence, experience and professional qualification. Where no specific, operable norms and standards are shown to exist, then the policy making departments — the legislative and executive departments — must be given a real and effective opportunity to fashion and promulgate those norms and standards, and to implement them before the courts should intervene.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Otherwise, the drastic alternative would be “to propel courts into the uncharted ocean of social and economic policy making.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Thus, I must address the dissonance between what is delineated in the <i>fallo</i> of the Decision, as opposed to what some may mistakenly claim to be the implicit consequences of the discussion.<br><br>The only question that appears to be a loose end in the ponencia was whether we still needed to have an extended discussion on lump-sums versus line-items for this Court to dispose of the main reliefs prayed for, i.e., to strike down portions of the 2013 General Appropriations Act (GAA) regarding the PDAF, the Malampaya Fund or P.D. No. 910, and the Presidential Social Fund or P.D. No. 1869 as amended by P.D. no. 1993 for unconstitutionality.<br><br>The remaining concern is founded on the need to adhere to the principle of judicial economy: for the Court to rule only on what it needs to rule on, lest unintended consequences be generated by its extensive discussion on certain long-held budgetary practices that have evolved into full-bodied statutory provisions, and that have even been validated by the Supreme Court in its prior decisions. After, however, it was clarified to the Court by the <i>ponente</i> herself that the effect of the <i>fallo</i> was only with respect to the appropriation type contained in Article XIV of the 2013 GAA, the unanimous vote of the Court was inevitable. The entire Court therefore supported the <i>ponencia</i>, without prejudice to the opinions of various Members, including myself.<br><br>As it stands now, the conceptual formulations on lump-sums, while not pronouncing doctrine could be premature and confusing. This is evidenced by the fact that different opinions had different definitions of lump-sum appropriations. Justice Carpio cites Sections 35 and 23 of the Administrative Code to say that the law does not authorize lump-sum appropriations in the GAA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> But Section 35 itself talks of how to deal with lump-sum appropriations. Justice Brion made no attempt to define the term. Justice Leonen recognized the fact that such discussion needs to be initiated by a proper case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Even the <i>ponencia</i> itself stated that Article XIV of the 2013 GAA is unconstitutional for being, among others, a “prohibited form of lump-sum,” which implies that there are allowable forms of lump-sum. This begs the question: what are allowable forms of lump-sum? In the first place, what are lump-sums? Administrative practice and congressional categories have always been liberal about the definition of lump-sums. Has this Court not neglected to accomplish its preliminary task, by first and foremost agreeing on the definition of a lump-sum?<br><br>Both Justice Brion<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> and Justice Leonen<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> warned against the possibility of the Court exceeding the bounds set by the actual case and controversy before us. That a total condemnation of lump-sum funding is an “extreme position that disregards the realities of national life,” as Justice Brion stated, and that it is by no means doctrinal and “should be clarified further in a more appropriate case,” as discussed by Justice Leonen, are correct. In the same spirit, I separately clarify the import of our decision, so that no unnecessary inferences are made.<br><br>As worded in the dispositive portion,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> the following are unconstitutional: first, the entire 2013 PDAF Article; second, all legal provisions, of past and present Congressional Pork Barrel Laws, such as the previous PDAF and CDF Articles and the various Congressional Insertions; and third, all informal practices of similar import and effect. The extent of their unconstitutionality has been defined as follows: (1) these authorize/d legislators – whether individually or collectively organized into committees – to intervene, assume or participate in any of the various post-enactment stages of the identification, modification and revision of project identification, fund release and/or fund realignment, unrelated to the power of congressional oversight; (2) these confer/red personal, lump-sum allocations from which they are able to fund specific projects which they themselves determine.<br><br>Given the circumscribed parameters of our decision, it is clear that this Court made no doctrinal pronouncement that <b>all lump-sum appropriations <i>per se</i> are unconstitutional</b>.<br><br>At most, the dispositive portion contained the term “lump-sum allocations” which was tied to the specific characterization of the PDAF system found in the body of the decision – that is, “a singular lump-sum amount to be tapped as a source of funding for multiple purposes x x x such appropriation type necessitat[ing] the further determination of <b><u>both</u></b> the actual amount to be expended <b><u>and</u></b> the actual purpose of the appropriation which must still be chosen from the multiple purposes stated in the law x x x x <b>[by] individual legislators</b>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>&nbsp; The <i>ponencia,</i> in effect, considers that the PDAF’s infirmity is brought about by the confluence of (1) sums dedicated to multiple purposes; (2) requiring post-enactment measures; (3) participated in, not by the Congress, but by its individual Members.<br><br>For the Court, it is this three-tiered nature of the PDAF system – as a singular type of lump-sum appropriation for individual legislators – which makes it unconstitutional. Any other type, kind, form, or assortment beyond this aggregated formulation of “lump-sum allocation” is not covered by our declaration of unconstitutionality.<br><br>Although Commission on Audit Chairperson Maria Gracia M. Pulido Tan recommended the adoption of a “line by line budget or amount per proposed program, activity or project, and per implementing agency:” such remains a mere recommendation. Chairperson Tan made the recommendation to relay to the Court the operational problems faced by state auditors in the conduct of post-audit examination. A policy suggestion made to solve a current problem of budget implementation&nbsp; cannot be the legal basis upon which unwarranted legal conclusions are anchored.<br><br>Briefly, I fully support the following pronouncements:<br><br>First, that the 2013 Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) is unconstitutional for violating the separation of powers, and;<br><br>Second, that the PDAF is unconstitutional for being an undue delegation of legislative functions.<br><br>However, I believe that the discussions on lump-sum appropriations, line-item appropriations, and item-veto power are premature.<br><br>These discussions were wrought, to my mind, by the blurring of the limits of the power of judicial review, the role of the judiciary in the constitutional landscape of the State, and of the basic principles of appropriation law. Above all, this Court must remember its constitutional mandate, which is to interpret the law and not to create it. We are given the power, during certain instances, to restate the constitutional allocation to the other two branches of government; but this power must be exercised with sufficient respect for the other powers. The Members of this Court are not elected by the people. We are not given the honoured privilege to represent the people in law-making, but are given the sacred duty to defend them by upholding the Constitution. This is the only path the judiciary can tread. We cannot advocate; we adjudicate.<br><br>To arrive at an unwarranted conclusion, i.e. that all lump-sum appropriations are invalid, whether in the 2013 GAA only or in all appropriation laws, is not sufficiently sensitive to the process of deliberation that the Members of this Court undertook to arrive at a significant resolution. More importantly, this inaccurate inference will jeopardize our constitutional limitation to rule only on actual cases ripe for adjudication fully litigated before the Court.<br><br><b>I. COEQUALITY OF THE THREE BRANCHES NECESSITATES JUDICIAL RESTRAINT</b><br><br><i><b>In any dispute before this Court,<br> judicial restraint is the general rule.</b></i><br><br>Since the <i>ponencia</i> crafted a ruling on a highly technical matter, it is only fitting that the nuances, implications, and conclusions on our pronouncement be elucidated. My views are guided by the inherent restraint on the judicial office; as unelected judges, we cannot haphazardly set aside the acts of the Filipino people’s representatives. This is the import of the requirement for an actual case or controversy to exist before we may exercise judicial review, as aptly noted by the pre-eminent constitutionalist, former Associate Justice Vicente V. Mendoza:<br><br><blockquote>Insistence on the existence of a case or controversy before the judiciary undertakes a review of legislation gives it the opportunity, denied to the legislature, of seeing the actual operation of the statute as it is applied to actual facts and thus enables it to reach sounder judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></blockquote><br>In fact, the guiding principle for the Court should not be to “anticipate a question of constitutional law in advance of the necessity of deciding it,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> but rather to treat the function of judicial review as a most important and delicate matter; after all, we cannot replace the wisdom of the elected using our own, by adding qualifications under the guise of constitutional “interpretation.” While it is true that the Constitution must be interpreted both in its written word and underlying intent, the intent must be reflected in taking the Constitution itself as one cohesive, functional whole.<br><br><blockquote>A foolproof yardstick in constitutional construction is the intention underlying the provision under consideration. Thus, it has been held that the Court in construing a Constitution should bear in mind the object sought to be accomplished by its adoption, and the evils, if any, sought to be prevented or remedied. A doubtful provision will be examined in the light of the history of the times, and the condition and circumstances under which the Constitution was framed. The object is to ascertain the reason which induced the framers of the Constitution to enact the particular provision and the purpose sought to be accomplished thereby, in order to construe the whole as to make the words consonant to that reason and calculated to effect that purpose.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></blockquote><br>In other words, alongside deciding what the law is given&nbsp; a particular set of facts, <b>we must decide “what not to decide.”</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Justice Mendoza likens our Supreme Court to the U.S. Supreme Court, in that “its teachings…x x x have peculiar importance because it interprets principles of fact and of value, not merely in the abstract, but in their bearing upon the concrete, immediate problems which are at any given moment puzzling and dividing us… For this reason the court holds a unique place in the cultivation of our national intelligence.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Thus, in matters such as the modality to be employed in crafting the national budget, this Court must be sensitive of the extent and the limits of its pronouncements. As Justice Laurel instructively stated, the structure of government provided by the Constitution sets the general metes and bounds of the powers exercised by the different branches; the judiciary cannot traverse areas where the charter does not allow its entry. We cannot interpret the Constitution’s silence in order to conform to a perceived preference on how the budget should be run. After all, it is the Constitution, not the Court, which has “blocked out with deft strokes and in bold lines,” the allotment of power among the different branches, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>(T)his power of judicial review is limited to actual cases and controversies to be exercised after full opportunity of argument by the parties, and limited further to the constitutional question raised or the very lis mota presented. Any attempt at abstraction could only lead to dialectics and barren legal questions and to sterile conclusions unrelated to actualities. <b>Narrowed as its function is in this manner, the judiciary does not pass upon questions of wisdom, justice or expediency of legislation. More than that, courts accord the presumption of constitutionality to legislative enactments, not only because the legislature is presumed to abide by the Constitution but also because the judiciary in the determination of actual cases and controversies must reflect the wisdom and justice of the people as expressed through their representatives in the executive and legislative departments of the governments of the government.</b><br><br>But much as we might postulate on the internal checks of power provided in our Constitution, it ought not the less to be remembered that, in the language of James Madison, the system itself is not "the chief palladium of constitutional liberty . . . the people who are authors of this blessing must also be its guardians . . . their eyes must be ever ready to mark, their voice to pronounce . . . aggression on the authority of their constitution." In the last and ultimate analysis, then, must the success of our government in the unfolding years to come be tested in the crucible of Filipino minds and hearts than in consultation rooms and court chambers.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><b><i>Wholesale rejection of lump-sum <br>allocations contrives a rule of <br>constitutional law broader than <br>what is required by the precise facts<br> in the case.</i></b><br><br>To conclude that a line-item budgeting scheme is a matter of constitutional requirement is to needlessly strain the Constitution’s silence on the matter. Foremost among the duties of this Court is, as previously discussed, to proceed based only on what it needs to resolve. Hence, I see no need to create brand new doctrines on budgeting, especially not ones that needlessly restrict the hands of budget-makers according to an apparently indiscriminate condemnation of lump-sum funding. To further create a constitutional obligation of the Executive and Legislative to follow a line-item budgeting procedure, and - more dangerously - give it the strength of a fundamental norm, goes beyond what the petitioners were able to establish, and ascribes a constitutional intent where there is none.<br><br>Again, the Court’s power of judicial review must be confined only to dispositions which are constitutionally supportable. Aside from the jurisdictional requirements for the exercise thereof, other guidelines are also mandated, i.e., that the question to be answered must be in a form capable of judicial resolution; that as previously discussed, the Court will not anticipate a question in advance of the necessity of deciding it; and, most relevant to the present case, <b>that the Court “will not formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts on which it is to be applied.”</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Given a controversy that raises several issues, the tribunal must limit its constitutional construction to the precise facts which have been established. This rule is most applicable “in determining whether one, some or all of the remaining substantial issues should be passed upon.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Thus, the Court is not authorized to take cognizance of an issue too far-removed from the other.<br><br><b><i>The above rule is bolstered by the<br> fact that petitioners have raised<br> other grounds more supportable<br> by the text of the Constitution.</i></b><br><br><u>The <i>lis mota</i> or the relevant controversy<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> in the present petitions concerns the principles of separation of powers, non-delegability of legislative functions, and checks and balances in relation to the PDAF as applied only to Article XLIV of the 2013 General Appropriations Act or R.A.

Again, this ruling is already determinative of the lis mota of the case, as it directly addressed petitioners’ principal claim that the PDAF unduly delegates legislative power.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Given that the <i>lis mota</i> has been squarely disposed of on these thorough, responsive, and determinative constitutional grounds, it was unnecessary to stretch the discussion to include the propriety of lump-sum appropriations in the budget.<br><br>The questions surrounding lump-sum appropriations, in the context of how they arose during the interpellation, are not legal questions. Unlike the first two reasons advanced by the <i>ponencia</i> in finding for the unconstitutionality of the PDAF, the invalidity of lump-sum appropriations finds no textual support in the Constitution. By its very words, the Constitution does not prohibit lump-sum appropriations. In fact, the history of legislative appropriations suggests otherwise.<br><br><i><b>As it stands now, the plain text of the <br>Constitution and the Revised Administrative <br>Code renders the modality of budgeting to be<br> a political question.</b></i><br><br>The Constitution contains provisions that regulate appropriation law, namely: it must originate from the House of Representatives,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> its items can be vetoed by the President,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> it is initiated by the Executive,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> and money can only be paid out of the Treasury by virtue of appropriations provided by law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Congress may not increase the appropriations recommended by the President for the operation of the Government as specified in the budget.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>The form, content, and manner of preparation of the budget must be prescribed by law, and no provision or enactment shall be embraced in the general appropriations bill unless it relates specifically to some particular appropriation therein, and such provision or enactment shall be limited in its operation to the appropriation to which it relates.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Procedures involving appropriations must be uniform.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> A special appropriations bill must be specific in purpose and supported or supportable by funds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Only the heads of the branches of government, as well as the constitutional commissions and fiscally independent bodies may be authorized to augment items in appropriations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Discretionary funds are regulated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Appropriations of the previous year are automatically revived if Congress fails to pass a new law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Appropriations for fiscally autonomous agencies are released automatically.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Furthermore, in relation to all this, the Constitution gives to the President the duty to faithfully execute the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Beneath this framework runs a sea of options, from which the two political branches must carve a working, functioning fiscal system for the State. So long as these basic tenets are maintained, the political branches can ply the route of the way they deem appropriate to achieve the purpose of the government’s budget. What are thus clearly set forth are requirements for appropriations, and not the modalities of budgeting which fall squarely under the technical domain of the Executive branch, namely, the Department of Budget and Management (DBM).<br><br>When the Constitution gives the political branches a “textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue[,]”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>&nbsp; or the lack of “judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it[,]”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> or even the “impossibility of a court’s undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government[,]”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> then there is a political question that this Court, in the absence of grave abuse of discretion, cannot conclude.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Apart from the provisions already discussed, there are no constitutional restrictions on how the government should prepare and enact its budget. In fact, these restrictions are mostly procedural and not <u>formal</u>. If the Constitution does not impose a specific mode of budgeting, be it purely line-item budgeting, purely lump-sum budgeting, a mixture of the two, or something else entirely, e.g. zero balance lump-sum, loan repayment schemes, or even performance-informed budgeting, then neither should this Court impose the line-item budgeting formula on the Executive and Legislative branches.<br><br>This confusion appears to have stemmed from the highly limited exchanges in the oral arguments between one of the petitioners and the Chairperson of the Commission on Audit (COA), on one hand, and a Member of the Court, on the other. The argument progressed on the basis of&nbsp; the Member’s own suggestion that the item-veto power of the President is negated by lump-sum budgeting despite the fact that it was not the very issue identified in the petitions. While it is true that the COA Chairperson opined that line-item is preferred, that statement is an operational standard, not a legal standard. It cannot be used to support a judicial edict that requires Congress to adopt an operational standard preferred, even if suggested by the COA Chairperson.<br><br>The Court never asked Congress what its response would be to a wholesale striking down of lump-sum budgeting.&nbsp; It never asked the DBM whether it could submit an expenditure proposal that has nothing but line-item budgets.&nbsp; To reject even very limited forms of lump-sum budgeting without asking whether it can even be operationally done within the very tight timeline of the Constitution for preparing, submitting, and passing into law a national budget is simply plain wrong and most unfair.&nbsp; <i>It is as if this Court is trying to teach both political branches - who constitute the nation’s top 300 elected officials - what they can and cannot do, in a manner that will completely take them by surprise, as lump-sum budgeting was never the</i> lis mota<i> in this case</i>.&nbsp; At the very least, this is not the case for that matter, if eventually this matter were also to be decided.<br><br><b>II. MODALITIES UNDER THE APPROPRIATIONS LAW</b><br><br>Government accounting takes place through concurrent processes. First is the call to all agencies, including fiscally independent ones, such as the Supreme Court. The deadline for this is usually in March or April. Then the proposals are all collated in a comprehensive document, and vetted by the DBM, and submitted to the President for approval. Alongside this, the government makes a schedule of revenues, with all its economic assumptions and growth targets. Next is the budget formulation, which results in a proposed national expenditure program (NEP) also from the Executive.<br><br>The duty to formulate the above documents is given by law to the DBM, in coordination with the National Economic Development Authority (NEDA), the Department of Finance (DOF), and all the various agencies of the government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>&nbsp; After the NEP is finalized, it is submitted to the House of Representatives’ Committee on Appropriations no later than thirty days from the opening of every regular session.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Thereupon the Committee crafts a draft General Appropriations Act on the basis of the NEP for the specified fiscal year, which is passed on to the Senate Committee on Finance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> The Senate is given the power to propose amendments to the House bill under the 1987 Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Finally, after going through the committees involved, which potentially includes a bicameral conference committee for the national budget, the bill is passed into law through the usual course of legislation.<br><br>Once the appropriations law is passed, the day-to-day management of the national budget is left to the DBM and DOF, in accordance with the appropriate rules and regulations. Simultaneously, the COA is tasked to conduct auditing and post-auditing throughout the fiscal year, with a final audit report presented to the President and Congress at the end of such year.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>In this whole process, an appropriation can be made and has been made at the lump-sum level. While not initially broken down in the budget formulation aspect of the entire expenditure process, the individual expenditures sourced from these lump-sum appropriations are broken down in journal entries after the fact,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> during the auditing process of the COA, which has the power to issue notices of disallowance should it find a particular expenditure to have been improper under law and accounting rules.<br><br>Consequently, a lump-sum appropriation can still be audited and accounted for properly. This recognizes the fact that lump-sum appropriating is a formal concern of the COA, and all other agencies and instrumentalities of the government that take part in the appropriations process. In fact, the Administrative Code gives formal discretion to the President, in the following manner:<br><br><blockquote>Section 12. Form and Content of the Budget. – xxx The budget shall be presented to the Congress in such form and content as may be approved by the President and may include the following: xxx<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br></blockquote><br>It thus appears from the perspective of this process, that the Legislature never considered the <u>form</u> of the budget as being constitutionally infirm for containing lump-sums, an attitude engendered from the birth of the 1987 Constitution, that has lasted up until this case was argued before this Court. It is perplexing to see any eager discussion at this opportunity to make pre-emptive declarations on the invalidity of the lump-sum budgeting form, when no party has raised the issue in the principal petitions.<br><br><i><b>Lump-sum appropriations are not <br>textually prohibited by the <br>Constitution.&nbsp; </b></i><br><br>The purported basis for this preference for line-item is that the item-veto power of the President is negated by the existence of lump-sum appropriations. This implication, however, oversimplifies the concept of the item-veto, as understood in the wording of the Constitution as well as jurisprudence.<br><br>In the first place, all cases in which this Court ruled on the item-veto power were generated by an actual controversy. In stark contrast, the veto power has never been raised as an issue in this case until raised as a possible issue in the oral arguments. Neither the President (who should be invoking a direct injury if the power were allegedly denied him) nor Congress (whose product would then be tampered with by a presidential veto) is complaining.&nbsp; It behooves this Court to step back and not needlessly create a controversy over the item-veto power when there is none.<br><br>The item veto-power of the Governor-General in past appropriation laws originating from the United States was given to the President, Prime Minister, and President respectively in the 1935, 1973, and 1987 Constitutions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> The most recent incarnation is stated thusly:<br><br><blockquote>The President shall have the power to veto any particular item or items in an appropriation, revenue, or tariff bill, but the veto shall not affect the item or items to which he does not object.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></blockquote><br>It is noteworthy that the veto refers to “any particular item or items” and not “line-items” or “earmarked appropriations.” In <i>Gonzales v. Macaraig,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> we declared that the term “item” in the Constitution referred to a specific appropriation of money, dedicated to a <u>stated</u> purpose, and not a general provision of law:<br><br><blockquote>The terms item and provision in budgetary legislation and practice are concededly different.&nbsp; <b>An item in a bill refers to the particulars, the details, the distinct and severable parts x x x of the bill.&nbsp; It is an indivisible sum of money dedicated to a stated purpose</b> The United States Supreme Court, in the case of Bengzon v. Secretary of Justice declared "that an ‘item’ of an appropriation bill obviously <b>means an item which in itself is a specific appropriation of money, not some general provision of law</b>, which happens to be put into an appropriation bill." (Citations omitted, emphasis supplied).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></blockquote><br>The Constitution’s “item” is, therefore, an allocation of money for a stated purpose, as opposed to a general provision in the appropriations law that does not deal with the appropriation of money, or in the words of <i>Gonzales</i>, “inappropriate provisions.” Thus, a lump-sum appropriation is an item for purposes of the Presidential veto, considering the fact that it is an appropriation of money for a stated purpose. The constitutional provision does nothing to prohibit the appropriation apart from that. As will be discussed, this is the crucial point, because a lump-sum item as defined does not, as it stands, appear to violate the requirement of stated purpose and specificity.<br><br>This Court has, in fact, already ruled on the status of lump-sum appropriation. The vetoed item that was the subject of dispute in <i>Bengzon v. Drilon</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> was a <u>lump-sum appropriation</u> for the “general fund adjustment,” and that it was “<b>an item</b> which appropriates P500,000,000.00 to enable the Government to meet certain unavoidable obligations which may have been inadequately funded by the specific items for the different branches, departments, bureaus, agencies, and offices of the government.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Since the Court itself in <i>Bengzon</i> had defined lump-sum provisions to be constitutional “items,” then the item-veto power of the President against lump-sum funds remains intact.<br><br>It has been stated that the President’s item-veto power is hampered when the “pork barrel” is lumped together with beneficial programs, which thus destroys the check and balance between the Executive and Legislative. This view seems to confuse the actual definition of lump-sum items (as discussed <i>infra</i>, items with more than one object) with line-items (singular object). Lump-sum items are not items without a specific purpose. Their stated purpose simply allows the funds to be used on multiple objects. “Specific” should not be equated with “singular.” The former is an aspect of quality, the latter quantity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Singularity and multiplicity qualify the word “object” and not purpose, which are wholly different since a purpose can refer to several objects, e.g., the use of the plural “projects” instead of “project.”<br><br>In fact, the law journal article cited in the Separate Opinion of Justice Carpio, which was cited to define the “pork barrel” as an “appropriation yielding rich patronage benefits,” <i>itself</i> acknowledges the validity of lump-sum budgeting, citing the United States’ own budgeting practice. It goes even further to highlight the disadvantages inherent in adopting a purely line-item budget, <i>viz</i>.:<br><br><blockquote>Congress has traditionally budgeted appropriations so that each encompasses several projects or activities.&nbsp; Such lump-sum budgeting allows the President and administrative agencies to determine how funds within and sometimes between budget accounts should be spent.&nbsp; Were Congress instead to appropriate narrowly by line-item the President would, in the absence of an item veto, lose much of the discretion and flexibility he modernly enjoys at the appropriation stage.<br><br><b>Lump-sum budgeting allows the President not only to selectively allocate lump sums, but also to transfer funds between budget accounts when necessary to save programs that might otherwise perish because Congress appropriated too little or was unable to anticipate unforeseen developments.&nbsp; More significantly for purposes of comparison with a line-item veto, lump-sum budgeting also authorizes the President to shift funds within a single appropriation account by reprogramming.&nbsp; Unlike a transfer of funds, which typically requires either statutory support or a national emergency, reprogramming is subject to mostly non-statutory controls “to be discovered in committee reports, committee hearings, agency directives, correspondence between subcommittee chairmen and agency officials, and also gentlemen’s agreements and understandings that are not part of the public record.”</b>&nbsp; The justification for reprogramming is congressional recognition “that in most instances it is desirable to maintain executive flexibility to shift around funds within a particular lump-sum appropriation account so that agencies can make necessary adjustments for ‘unforeseen developments, changing requirements... and legislation enacted subsequent to appropriation.’”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted.)</blockquote><br>To restate, <i>Gonzales</i> outlined the following legal requirements for valid appropriations on budget items:<br><br>First, that an item is “an indivisible sum of money dedicated to a <b>stated purpose</b>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>Second, that an item is in itself is a “<b>specific appropriation</b> of money, not some general provision of law.” <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>There is therefore no condition that the purpose be <u>singular</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> As will be demonstrated, the difference between a lump-sum and line-item is just the number of objects a lump-fund may have. After all, even if the purpose has multiple objects, it is still a <u>stated purpose.</u><br><br>The use of the COA Memorandum<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> to buttress the argument that the Constitution requires line-item budgeting is misleading. Again, even if the COA Chairperson prefers line-item budgeting, such preference is not equivalent to a legal standard sufficient for this Court to strike down all forms of lump-sum budgeting.<br><br>At this point, there appears to be an attempted transformation of policy recommendations into legal imperatives.&nbsp; No matter how desirable these recommendations on adopting a purely line-item budget may sound – and they may turn out to be the best alternative – we cannot equate seeming consensus on good and desirable policy, with what the law states. The choice of policy is not ours to make, no matter how intelligent or practical we deem ourselves to be.<br><br><b><i>In any case, prevailing jurisprudence<br> allows for the conclusion that the<br> item-veto power of the President <br>cannot be impaired.</i></b><br><br>The Court in <i>Gonzales</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> described the three modes of veto available to the President. The first is the veto of an entire bill under Article VI, Section 27(1). The second is the item-veto in an appropriation, revenue, or tariff bill. The third is an iteration of the second, which is the veto of provisions as previously defined by the 1935 Constitution. With respect to the second mode of veto, <i>Gonzales</i> extends the application of the item veto power to “inappropriate provisions,” as we stated:<br><br><blockquote>Consequently, Section 55 (FY '89) and Section 16 (FY ‘90) although labelled as "provisions," are actually inappropriate provisions that <b>should be treated as items for the purpose of the President's veto power</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)</blockquote><br>Thus, even if we were to assume that a lump-sum appropriation is not an “item” as defined by <i>Gonzales</i>, as previously expounded, <u>for purposes of the Presidential veto, it is still an item</u>, and the item-veto power appears to remain unimpaired by virtue of jurisprudential precedent.<br><br>To summarize, whether the appropriation is a line-item, as claimed by petitioners, or a lump-sum appropriation item, as proposed in an Opinion, or even a general provision of law that is unrelated to the appropriation law, the power of the President to exercise item-veto is intact. Whichever interpretation we accept as to the nature of lump-sum appropriations - though as I have shown, they are properly appropriation “items” – is irrelevant.<br><br>As will be discussed <i>infra</i>, an analysis of the nature of a lump-sum appropriation can clear the apparent misunderstanding on lump-sums.<br><br><i>History of Appropriations and the Federal Legacy</i><br><br>Historically, the constitutional provisions on appropriations were adopted from the United States’ Jones Law of 1916,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> which governed the Philippines until its transition into a Commonwealth and, later on, a fully independent state. Section 3(m) of the law provides:<br><br><blockquote>(m) <i>How public funds to be spent</i>.-That no money shall be paid out of the treasury except in pursuance of an appropriation by law.<br></blockquote><br>Section 19(b) expressed what is now coined the “item-veto” power of the President, in this manner:<br><br><blockquote>(b) <i>The veto on appropriations</i>.-The Governor-General shall have the power to veto any particular item or items of an appropriation bill, but the veto shall not affect the item or items to which he does not object. The item or items objected to shall not take effect except in the manner heretofore provided in this section as to bills and joint resolutions returned to the Legislature without his approval.</blockquote><br>In fact, the present mechanism that retains the previous year’s appropriation law in case the Legislature fails to pass a new one was also based on the Jones Law, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>(d) <i>Revisal of former appropriations</i>.-If at the termination of any fiscal year the appropriations necessary for the support of Government for the ensuing fiscal year shall not have been made, the several sums appropriated in the last appropriation bills for the objects and purposes therein specified, so far as the same may be done, shall be deemed to be reappropriated for the several objects and purposes specified in said last appropriation bill; and until the Legislature shall act in such behalf the treasurer shall, when so directed by the Governor-General, make the payments necessary for the purposes aforesaid.<br></blockquote><br>Even the NEP’s procedure was conceptualized long before the 1987 Constitution was drafted:<br><br><blockquote>[The Governor-General] shall submit within ten days of the opening of each regular session of the Philippine Legislature a budget of receipts and expenditures, which shall be the basis of the annual appropriation bill.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup></blockquote><br>Clearly then, our current constitutional provisions on appropriations were derived from the United States’ own concept of federal appropriations. In adopting their budgetary methodology, we have also adopted the basic principles that govern how these appropriations are to be treated.<br><br><i>Principles of Federal Appropriations</i><br><br>The Red Book<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> on federal appropriations distinguishes a “lump-sum” appropriation from an earmark, or “line-item” appropriation. It defines a lump-sum appropriation as “one that is made to cover a number of <b>specific programs, projects, or items</b>[,]”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> which may be as few as only two programs. In the language of appropriation law, the essence of a lump-sum appropriation is that it is available for more than one object,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> which refers to what the money allocated can be used for.<br><br>A line-item appropriation, on the other hand, is only for a single specific object described by the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> This distinction is very precise. It is the singularity of the object for which the allocation is made that makes an appropriation “line-item,” and its plurality is what makes it “lump-sum.”<br><br>Taking the requirements of stated purpose and specificity of amount and applying them to this definition of lump-sum, we can easily conclude that a lump-sum falls within the parameters of <i>Gonzales</i>. Its purpose, although referring to more than one object, is <u>stated by the text of the appropriation law</u>. The amount of the appropriation is a <u>specific amount</u>.<br><br>The key factor that makes lump-sum appropriations desirable for the United States Legislature is the flexibility<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> in the use of the appropriation. As Justice Souter stated in <i>Lincoln v. Vigil</i>, a lump-sum appropriation’s purpose is to give the agency discretion, and allow it to remain flexible in meeting whatever contingencies arise:<br><br><blockquote>The allocation of funds from a lump-sum appropriation is another administrative decision traditionally regarded as committed to agency discretion. <b>After all, the very point of a lump-sum appropriation is to give an agency the capacity to adapt to changing circumstances and meet its statutory responsibilities in what it sees as the most effective or desirable way.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>The use of lump-sum appropriations inherently springs from the reality that the government cannot completely predict at the beginning of a fiscal year where funds will be needed in certain instances. Since Congress is the source of the appropriation law in accordance with the principle of separation of powers, it can craft the law in such a way as to give the Executive enough fiscal tools to meet the exigencies of the year. Lump-sum appropriations are one such tool. After all, the different agencies of government are in the best position to determine where the allocated money might best be spent for their needs:<br><br><blockquote>[A]n agency's allocation of funds from a lump-sum appropriation requires "a complicated balancing of a number of factors which are peculiarly within its expertise": whether its "resources are best spent" on one program or another; whether it "is likely to succeed" in fulfilling its statutory mandate; whether a particular program "best fits the agency's overall policies"; and, "indeed, whether the agency has enough resources" to fund a program "at all."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup></blockquote><br>Thus, the importance of allowing lump-sum appropriations for budgetary flexibility and good governance has been validated in other jurisdictions. The evolution of the government’s budgeting from a small amount in past decades, into what is now a massive undertaking that contains complexities, and involves an exponentially larger sum than before, suggests that a mixture of lump-sum and line-item budgeting within the same appropriation law could also be a feasible form of budgeting. At the very least, this Court owes it to Congress to ask it the question directly, on whether an exclusively line-item budgeting system is indeed feasible. Simply put, there appears, even in the United States, a necessity for the inclusion of lump-sum appropriations in the budget:<br><br><blockquote>Congress has been making appropriations since the beginning of the Republic. In earlier times when the federal government was much smaller and federal programs were (or at least seemed) much simpler, very specific line-item appropriations were more common. In recent decades, however, as the federal budget has grown in both size and complexity, <b>a lump-sum approach has become a virtual necessity.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>The Legislative Branch foresaw that these types of appropriations had to be regulated by law, since “a fundamental principle of appropriations law is that where Congress merely appropriates lump-sum amounts without statutorily restricting what can be done with those funds, a clear inference arises that it does not intend to impose legally binding restrictions.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup>&nbsp; Without statutory regulation, an untrammelled system of lump-sum appropriations would breed corruption, or at the very least, make the Executive less circumspect in preparing and proposing the budget to the Legislature. Hence, Congress promulgated the Administrative Code of 1987,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> which regulates, in its provisions on budgeting, lump-sum funds:<br><br><blockquote><b>Section 35</b>. <i>Special Budgets for Lump Sum Appropriations</i>. - Expenditures from lump-sum appropriations authorized for any purpose or for any department, office or agency in any annual General Appropriations Act or other Act and from any fund of the National Government, shall be made in accordance with a special budget to be approved by the President, which shall include but shall not be limited to the number of each kind of position, the designations, and the annual salary proposed for which an appropriation is intended. This provision shall be applicable to all revolving funds, receipts which are automatically made available for expenditure for certain specific purposes, aids and donations for carrying out certain activities, or deposits made to cover the cost of special services to be rendered to private parties. Unless otherwise expressly provided by law, when any Board, head of department, chief of bureau or office, or any other official, is authorized to appropriate, allot, distribute or spend any lump-sum appropriation or special, bond, trust, and other funds, such authority shall be subject to the provisions of this section.<br><br>In case of any lump-sum appropriation for salaries and wages of temporary and emergency laborers and employees, including contractual personnel, provided in any General Appropriation Act or other Acts, the expenditure of such appropriation shall be limited to the employment of persons paid by the month, by the day, or by the hour.<br><br>x x x<br><br><b>Section 47</b>. <i>Administration of Lump Sum Funds. </i>- The Department of Budget shall administer the Lump-Sum Funds appropriated in the General Appropriations Act, except as otherwise specified therein, including the issuance of Treasury Warrants covering payments to implementing agencies or other creditors, as may be authorized by the President.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup></blockquote><br>Additionally, the Administrative Code provides that certain items may be lump-sum funds, such as the budget for coordinating bodies,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> the budget for the pool of Foreign Service officers,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup>&nbsp; and merit increases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br><br>As a result, this Court should not read from the text of the Constitution and the law, a mandate to craft the national budget in a purely line-item format. To do so would be equivalent to judicial legislation, because the Court would read into the law an additional requirement that is not supported by its text or spirit of the law, in accordance with its own perceived notion of how a government budget should be formulated. If we rule out lump-sum budgeting, what happens then to the various provisions of the law, principally the Administrative Code, that govern lump-sum funds? Is there such a thing as a collateral constitutional attack? Too many questionable effects will result from a sledgehammer denunciation of lump-sum appropriations. This Court does not even know how many lump-sum appropriation laws will be affected by such a ruling. Thus, it is important to emphasize that the <i>fallo</i> only afflicts the 2013 GAA, Article XIV.<br><br><b><i>Practical consequences of the <br>unwarranted conclusions on <br>lump-sums in the Separate <br>Opinion</i></b><br><br>The baseless conclusion that the lump-sum characteristic, taken alone, results in the unconstitutionality of the law that carries it, can create additional dangers as illustrated below.<br><br>Closer to today’s events, the Executive would have immediately been prevented from using the lump-sum funds such as Calamity Funds – which under the Federal Appropriations Law is a ‘lump-sum’ – to alleviate the State of National Calamity<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> brought about by super typhoon Yolanda. With the intensity of a signal number four storm, the first one in 22 years<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> and considered the biggest super typhoon in world history,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> Yolanda is one such unforeseen event for which lump-sum funds are intended. In other words, lump-sum appropriations are currently the form of preparation Congress saw fit to address these disasters. This is the point recognized precisely in the law journal article cited by Justice Carpio: there is congressional recognition that lump-sum appropriation allows the President and administrative agencies the executive flexibility to make necessary adjustments for “unforeseen developments, changing requirements . . . and legislation enacted subsequent to appropriations.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> If the problem is a lack of a definition, or a confusion pertaining to the same, then let the Court define it when the definition itself becomes the legal issue before us.<br><br>In addition, the Executive and its line agencies would be deprived of the ability to make use of <i>additional</i> sources of funds. Suppose that a source of revenue was anticipated by government, the exact amount of which could not be determined during the budget preparation stage. Suppose also that Congress agreed upon items which had to be implemented once the funding materializes, and that this funding could support more than one budget item, as is usually the case with major financing arrangements negotiated with the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and other development partners. Can Congress be prevented from deciding to include in the appropriations law a provision for these items, to be funded by the said additional sources? Should the Court thereby deprive the Legislature of its discretion to bestow leeway upon the Executive branch, so that it may effectively utilize the funds realized only later on? Congress, in this case, cannot be reasonably expected to predetermine all sources of revenue, and neither can it pinpoint the items to be prioritized with a rigid specificity, since it is only within the budget execution stage that the financing materialized.<br><br>It is also respectfully suggested that any discussion on “savings” and the power to augment under the Constitution is not an issue in this case and that said discussion might in fact demonstrate the unwarranted potential of over-extending this Court’s reach into matters that are not lis mota. My misgivings on discussing “savings,” which is the main issue of a pending matter before us involving the Disbursement Allocation Program (DAP),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> impels me to caution the Court: a narrow approach to the PDAF better serves the interest of the rule of law. Any reformulation or redefinition of the powers under Article VI, Section 25(5) of the Constitution, i.e. transfer and augmentation of appropriations, is improper in this case, and better ventilated before us in the course of resolving DAP petitions.<br><br>In light of the above, I cast my vote to <b>CONCUR</b> in the <i>ponencia</i>, but with a strong emphasis that this Court has not thereby made an invalidation of any lump-sum appropriation except in the form that was described in the <i>fallo</i>.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> J. Feliciano stated: “The Court has also declared that the complaint has alleged and focused upon "one specific fundamental legal right — the right to a balanced and healthful ecology" (Decision, p. 14). There is no question that "the right to a balanced and healthful ecology" is "fundamental" and that, accordingly, it has been "constitutionalized." But although it is fundamental in character, I suggest, with very great respect, that it cannot be characterized as "specific," without doing excessive violence to language.

At least in respect of the vast area of environmental protection and management, our courts have no claim to special technical competence and experience and professional qualification. Where no specific, operable norms and standards are shown to exist, then the policy making departments — the legislative and executive departments — must be given a real and effective opportunity to fashion and promulgate those norms and standards, and to implement them before the courts should intervene.” G.R.

The present petitions test the limits of our Constitution – whether this grave national crisis can be resolved within, or outside, the present Constitution.<br><br>For resolution in the present cases are the following threshold issues:<br><br>1.

As we held in <i>Pascual v.

Well-entrenched in our jurisdiction is the principle of separation of powers, which ordains that each of the three great branches of government is supreme in the exercise of its functions within its own constitutionally allocated sphere.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Lawmaking belongs to Congress, implementing the laws to the Executive, and settling legal disputes to the Judiciary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Any encroachment on the functions of a co-equal branch by the other branches violates the principle of separation of powers, and is thus unconstitutional. In <i>Bengzon v. Drilon,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> this Court declared:<br><br><blockquote>It cannot be overstressed that in a constitutional government such as ours, the rule of law must prevail. The Constitution is the basic and paramount law to which all other laws must conform and to which all persons including the highest official of this land must defer. From this cardinal postulate, it follows that the three branches of government must discharge their respective functions within the limits of authority conferred by the Constitution. Under the principle of separation of powers, neither Congress, the President nor the Judiciary may encroach on fields allocated to the other branches of government. The legislature is generally limited to the enactment of laws, the executive to the enforcement of laws and the judiciary to their interpretation and application to cases and controversies.</blockquote><br>In the present petitions, the Court is faced with issues of paramount importance as these issues involve the core powers of the Executive and the Legislature. Specifically, the petitions raise questions on the Executive’s constitutional power to implement the laws and the Legislature’s constitutional power to appropriate. The latter necessarily involves the President’s constitutional power to veto line-items in appropriation laws.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Under the Constitution, the President submits every year a proposed national expenditures program (NEP) to Congress. The NEP serves as basis for the annual general appropriations act (GAA) to be enacted by Congress. This is provided in the Constitution, as follows:<br><br><blockquote>The President shall submit to the Congress within thirty days from the opening of every regular session, as the basis of the general appropriations bill, a budget of expenditures and sources of financing, including receipts from existing and proposed revenue measures.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></blockquote><br>While the President proposes the expenditures program to Congress, it is Congress that exercises the power to appropriate and enact the GAA. The Constitution states that “all appropriation x x x shall originate exclusively in the House of Representatives, but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> The Constitution likewise mandates, “No money shall be paid out of the Treasury except in pursuance of an appropriation made by law.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>The Administrative Code of 1987 defines “appropriation” as “an authorization made by law or other legislative enactment directing payment out of government funds under specified conditions or for specified purposes.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Thus, the power to appropriate is the exclusive legislative power to direct by law the payment of government funds under specified conditions or specified purposes. The appropriation must state the <b><i>specific purpose</i></b> of the payment of government funds. The appropriation must also necessarily state the <b><i>specific amount</i></b> since it is a directive to pay out government funds.<br><br>Once the appropriations bill is signed into law, its implementation becomes the exclusive function of the President. The Constitution states, “The executive power shall be vested in the President.” The Constitution has vested the executive power <b>solely in the President</b> and to no one else in government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> The Constitution also mandates that the President “shall ensure that the laws be faithfully executed.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> The President cannot refuse to execute the law not only because he is constitutionally mandated to ensure its execution, but also because he has taken a constitutionally prescribed solemn oath to <b>“faithfully and conscientiously”</b> execute the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>To exercise the executive power effectively, the President must necessarily control the entire Executive branch. Thus, the Constitution provides, “The President shall have control of all the executive departments, bureaus, and offices.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> The Constitution does not exempt any executive office from the President’s control.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>The GAA is a law. The implementation of the GAA belongs exclusively to the President, and cannot be exercised by Congress. The President cannot share with the Legislature, its committees or members the power to implement the GAA. The Legislature, its committees or members cannot exercise functions vested in the President by the Constitution; otherwise, there will be a violation of the separation of powers.<br><br>The Legislature, its committees or members cannot also exercise any veto power over actions or decisions of executive departments, bureaus or offices because this will divest the President of control over the executive agencies. Control means the power to affirm, modify or reverse, and even to pre-empt, the actions or decisions of executive agencies or their officials.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Any provision of law requiring the concurrence of the Legislature, its committees or members before an executive agency can exercise its functions violates the President’s control over executive agencies, and is thus unconstitutional.<br><br>In <i>LAMP</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> this Court declared:<br><br><blockquote>Under the Constitution, the power of appropriation is vested in the Legislature, subject to the requirement that appropriation bills originate exclusively in the House of Representatives with the option of the Senate to propose or concur with the amendments. While the budgetary process commences from the proposal submitted by the President to Congress, it is the latter which concludes the exercise by crafting an appropriation act it may deem beneficial to the nation, based on its own judgment, wisdom and purposes. Like any other piece of legislation, the appropriation act may then be susceptible to objection from the branch tasked to implement it, by way of a Presidential veto. Thereafter, budget execution comes under the domain of the Executive branch which deals with the operational aspects of the cycle including the allocation and release of funds earmarked for various projects. Simply put, from the regulation of fund releases, the implementation of payment schedules and up to the actual spending of the funds specified in the law, the Executive takes the wheel. x x x.</blockquote><br>The 2013 PDAF, or Article XLIV of Republic Act No. 10352, provides in part as follows:<br><blockquote><br>XLIV. <b>PRIORITY DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE FUND</b><br><br>For fund requirements of priority development programs and projects, as indicated hereunder .....................................................

These provisions allow congressional committees and legislators not only to exercise in part the Executive’s exclusive power to implement the appropriations law, they also grant congressional committees and legislators a veto power over the Executive’s exclusive power to implement the appropriations law.<br><br><i>A. Special Provision Nos. 2 and 3 on identification of projects</i><br><br>While Special Provision No. 2 of the 2013 PDAF provides that projects shall be taken from a priority list provided by the Executive, <b><i>legislators actually identify the projects to be financed under the PDAF</i></b>. This is clear from Special Provision No. 3 which states that <b><i>“the total amount of projects to be identified by the legislators shall be as follows</i></b>: x x x.” This identification of projects by legislators is <b>mandatory</b> on the Executive. This is clear from the second paragraph of Special Provision No. 4 which requires the <b>“favorable endorsement”</b> of the House Committee on Appropriations or the Senate Committee on Finance (Congressional Committees) in case of <b>“any x x x revision and modification”</b> of the project identified by the legislator. This requirement of <b>“favorable endorsement”</b> constitutes a veto power by either of the Congressional Committees on the exclusive power of the Executive to implement the law. This requirement also encroaches on the President’s control over executive agencies.<br><br>It is the individual House member or individual Senator who identifies the project to be funded and implemented under the PDAF. This identification is made after the enactment into law of the GAA. Unless the individual legislator identifies the project, the Executive cannot implement the project. Any revision or modification of the project by the Executive requires the “favorable endorsement” of either of the Congressional Committees. The Executive does not, and cannot, identify the project to be funded and implemented. Neither can the Executive, on its own, modify or revise the project identified by the legislator. This divests the President of control over the implementing agencies with respect to the PDAF. Clearly, the identification of projects by legislators under the 2013 PDAF, being mandatory on the Executive, is unconstitutional.<br><br>The Constitution states, “The legislative power shall be vested in the Congress of the Philippines which shall consist of a Senate and a House of Representatives.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> The legislative power can be exercised only by Congress, not by an individual legislator, not by a congressional committee, and not even by either the House of Representatives or the Senate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Once the GAA becomes law, only Congress itself, and not its committees or members, can add, subtract, complete or modify the law by passing an amendatory law. The Congressional Committees or individual legislators, on their own, cannot exercise legislative power.<br><br>Respondents argue that this Court already upheld the authority of individual legislators to identify projects to be funded by the Countrywide Development Fund (CDF), later known as PDAF. In particular, respondents cite the decisions of this Court in <i>Philippine Constitution Association (PHILCONSA) v. Enriquez</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> and in <i>Lawyers Against Monopoly and Poverty (LAMP) v. Secretary of Budget and Management</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br><i>PHILCONSA</i> and <i>LAMP</i> do not apply to the present cases because the mandatory identification of projects by individual legislators in the 2013 GAA is not present in the 1994 and 2004 GAAs. A comparison of Article XLI of the 1994 GAA, Article XLVII of the 2004 GAA, and Article XLIV of the 2013 GAA shows that only the 2013 GAA provides for the mandatory identification of projects by legislators.<br><br>In <i>PHILCONSA,</i> Republic Act No. 7663, or the 1994 GAA, authorized members of Congress to identify projects in the CDF allotted to them. Article XLI of the 1994 GAA provides:<br><br><blockquote>Special Provisions<br><br>1. Use and Release of Funds. The amount herein appropriated shall be used for infrastructure, purchase of ambulances and computers and other priority projects and activities, and credit facilities to qualified beneficiaries as proposed and identified by officials concerned according to the following allocations: Representatives, P12,500,000 each; Senators, P18,000,000 each; Vice-President, P20,000,000; PROVIDED, That, the said credit facilities shall be constituted as a revolving fund to be administered by a government financial institution (GFI) as a trust fund for lending operations. Prior years releases to local government units and national government agencies for this purpose shall be turned over to the government financial institution which shall be the sole administrator of credit facilities released from this fund.<br><br>The fund shall be automatically released quarterly by way of Advice of Allotments and Notice of Cash Allocation directly to the assigned implementing agency not later than five (5) days after the beginning of each quarter upon submission of the list of projects and activities by the officials concerned.<br><br>2. Submission of Quarterly Reports. The Department of Budget and Management shall submit within thirty (30) days after the end of each quarter a report to the Senate Committee on Finance and the House Committee on Appropriations on the releases made from this Fund. The report shall include the listing of the projects, locations, implementing agencies and the endorsing officials.</blockquote><br>It is clear from the CDF provisions of the 1994 GAA that the authority vested in legislators was limited to the mere identification of projects. There was nothing in the 1994 GAA that made identification of projects by legislators mandatory on the President. <b>The President could change the projects identified by legislators without the favorable endorsement of any congressional committee, and even without the concurrence of the legislators who identified the projects</b>. The Court ruled in <i>PHILCONSA</i>:<br><br><blockquote>The authority given to the members of Congress is only to propose and identify projects to be implemented by the President. Under Article XLI of the GAA of 1994, the President must perforce examine whether the proposals submitted by members of Congress fall within the specific items of expenditures for which the Fund was set up, and if qualified, he next determines whether they are in line with other projects planned for the locality. Thereafter, if the proposed projects qualify for funding under the Fund, it is the President who shall implement them. <b>In short, the proposals and identifications made by members of Congress are merely recommendatory</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><i>LAMP</i> is likewise not applicable to the cases before us. Article XLVII of the 2004 GAA, which was the subject matter in LAMP, only states the following on the PDAF:<br><br><blockquote>Special Provision<br><br>1. Use and Release of the Fund. The amount herein appropriated shall be used to fund priority programs and projects or to fund the required counterpart for foreign-assisted programs and projects: PROVIDED, That such amount shall be released directly to the implementing agency or Local Government Unit concerned: PROVIDED, FURTHER, That the allocations authorized herein may be realigned to any expense class, if deemed necessary: PROVIDED FURTHERMORE, That a maximum of ten percent (10%) of the authorized allocations by district may be used for procurement of rice and other basic commodities which shall be purchased from the National Food Authority.</blockquote><br><b>The PDAF provision in the 2004 GAA does not even state that legislators may propose or identify projects to be funded by the PDAF. The 2004 PDAF provision is completely silent on the role of legislators or congressional committees in the implementation of the 2004 PDAF</b>. Indeed, the petitioner in <i>LAMP </i>even argued that the Special Provision of the 2004 GAA “does not empower individual members of Congress to propose, select and identify programs and projects to be funded out of PDAF,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> and thus “the pork barrel has become legally defunct under the present state of GAA 2004.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> The Court ruled in <i>LAMP</i> that there was no convincing proof that there were direct releases of funds to members of Congress. The Court also reiterated in <i>LAMP</i> that members of Congress may propose projects, which is merely recommendatory, and thus constitutional under case law.<br><br>Thus, <i>PHILCONSA</i> and <i>LAMP</i> are not applicable to the present cases before us.<br><br><i>B. Special Provision No. 4 on realignment of funds</i><br><br>The first paragraph of Special Provision No. 4 clearly states that the Executive’s <b>realignment of funds</b> under the PDAF is conditioned, among others, on the <b>“concurrence of the legislator concerned.”</b> Such concurrence allows the legislator not only to share with the Executive the implementation of the GAA, but also to veto any realignment of funds initiated by the Executive. Thus, the President cannot exercise his constitutional power to realign savings<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> without the “concurrence” of legislators. This violates the separation of powers, and is thus unconstitutional.<br><br>The second paragraph of Special Provision No. 4 states that “any realignment” of funds shall have the <b>“favorable endorsement”</b> of either of the Congressional Committees. The word <b>“endorse” </b>means to “declare one’s public approval or support.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> The word <b>“favorable”</b> stresses that there must be an affirmative action. Thus, the phrase “favorable endorsement,” as used in Special Provision No. 4 of the PDAF, means categorical approval, agreement, consent, or concurrence by the Congressional Committees. This means that the President cannot realign savings in the PDAF, which is an appropriation for the Executive branch, without the concurrence of either of the Congressional Committees, contrary to the constitutional provision that it is the President who can realign savings in the Executive branch. This violates the separation of powers, and is thus unconstitutional.<br><br>The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) argues that Special Provision No. 4 involves not a realignment of funds but a realignment of projects, despite the clear wording of the heading in Special Provision No. 4 stating <b>“Realignment of Funds.”</b> The OSG contends that realignment “happens when the project is no longer feasible such as when projects initially proposed by the legislator have already been accomplished by the national government or the LGU, or when projects as originally proposed cannot be accomplished due to certain contingencies.” None of the situations cited by the OSG is found in Special Provision No. 4. Even then, the situations cited by the OSG will actually result in the realignment of funds. If the project identified by the legislator has already been undertaken and completed with the use of other funds in the GAA, or if the identified project is no longer feasible due to contingencies, the funds allocated to the legislator under the PDAF will have to be logically realigned to another project to be identified by the same legislator.<br><br>Moreover, Special Provision No. 4 provides, as one of the conditions for the realignment, that the <b><i>“allotment released has not yet been obligated for the original project/scope of work.”</i></b> Special Provision No. 4 also states that <b>“in case of realignments, modifications and revisions of projects to be implemented by LGUs, <i>the LGU concerned shall certify that the cash has not yet been disbursed and the funds have been deposited back to the BTr</i></b> (Bureau of Treasury).” Clearly, the realignment in Special Provision No. 4, as stated in its heading “Realignment of Funds”, refers to realignment of funds because the realignment speaks of “allotment” and “cash.” In any event, even if we assume that Special Provision No. 4 refers to realignment of projects and not realignment of funds, still the realignment of projects within the menu of projects authorized in the PDAF provision of the GAA is an Executive function. The “<b>concurrence of the legislator concerned</b>” and the <b>“favorable endorsement”</b> of either of the Congressional Committees to the realignment of projects will still violate the separation of powers.<br><br>Under Section 25(5), Article VI of the Constitution, the power to realign is lodged in the President for the Executive branch, the Speaker for the House of Representatives, the Senate President for the Senate, the Chief Justice for the Judiciary, and the Heads of the Constitutional Commissions for their respective constitutional offices. This constitutional provision reads:<br><br><blockquote>(5) <b>No law shall be passed authorizing <i>any transfer of appropriations</i></b>; however, the President, the President of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and the heads of Constitutional Commissions may, by law, be authorized <b>to augment any item in the general appropriations law for their respective offices from savings in other items of their respective appropriations</b>. (Boldfacing and italicization supplied)</blockquote><br>The Constitution expressly states that what can be realigned are <b>“savings”</b> from an item in the GAA, and such savings can only be used to augment another existing <b>“item”</b> in the <b>“respective appropriations”</b> of the Executive, Legislature, Judiciary, and the Constitutional Commissions <b>in the same GAA</b>. The term “funds” in Special Provision No. 4 is not the same as “savings.” <b>The term “funds” means appropriated funds, whether savings or not. The term “savings” is much narrower, and must strictly qualify as such under Section 53 of the General Provisions of the 2013 GAA</b>, which is a verbatim reproduction of the definition of “savings” in previous GAAs. Section 53 of the 2013 GAA defines “savings” as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 53. <b>Meaning of Savings</b> and Augmentation. Savings refer to portions or balances of any programmed appropriation in this Act free from any obligation or encumbrance which are: (i) still available after the completion or final discontinuance or abandonment of the work, activity or purpose for which the appropriation is authorized; (ii) from appropriation balances arising from unpaid compensation and related costs pertaining to vacant positions and leaves of absence without pay; and (iii) from appropriation balances realized from the implementation of measures resulting in improved systems and efficiencies and thus enabled agencies to meet and deliver the required or planned targets, programs and services approved in this Act at a lesser cost. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Indisputably, only <b>“savings”</b> can be realigned. Unless there are savings, there can be no realignment.<br><br>Funds, or “appropriations” as used in the first clause of Section 25(5) of Article VI, cannot be transferred from one branch to another branch or to a Constitutional Commission, or even within the same branch or Constitutional Commission. Thus, funds or appropriations for the Office of the President cannot be transferred to the Commission on Elections. Likewise, funds or appropriations for one department of the Executive branch cannot be transferred to another department of the Executive branch. <b>The transfer of funds or appropriations is absolutely prohibited, <i>unless the funds qualify as “savings,”</i></b> in which case the savings can be realigned to an existing item of appropriation but only within the same branch or Constitutional Commission.<br><br>Special Provision No. 4 allows realignment of <b>funds,</b> not <b>savings</b>. That only <b>savings,</b> and not <b>funds,</b> can be realigned has already been settled in <i>Demetria v. Alba,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> and again in <i>Sanchez v. Commission on Audit.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> In <i>Demetria,</i> we distinguished between<i> transfer of funds and transfer of savings </i>for the purpose of augmenting an existing item in the GAA, the former being unconstitutional and the latter constitutional. Thus, in <i>Demetria</i>, we struck down as unconstitutional paragraph 1, Section 44 of Presidential Decree No. 1177,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> for authorizing the President to transfer funds as distinguished from savings. In <i>Demetria</i>, we ruled:<br><br><blockquote>Paragraph 1 of Section 44 of P.D. No. 1177 unduly overextends the privilege granted under said Section 16(5) [of Article VIII of the 1973 Constitution]. It empowers the President to indiscriminately transfer funds from one department, bureau, office or agency of the Executive Department to any program, project or activity of any department, bureau or office included in the General Appropriations Act or approved after its enactment, <b>without regard as to whether or not the funds to be transferred are actually savings in the item from which the same are to be taken, or whether or not the transfer is for the purpose of augmenting the item to which said transfer is to be made.</b> It does not only completely disregard the standards set in the fundamental law, thereby amounting to an undue delegation of legislative powers, but likewise goes beyond the tenor thereof. <b>Indeed, such constitutional infirmities render the provision in question null and void</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>In <i>Sanchez</i>, we emphasized that “<b>[a]ctual savings is a sine qua non to a valid transfer of funds.</b>”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> We stated the two essential requisites in order that a realignment of savings may be legally effected: “<i>First</i>, there must be savings in the programmed appropriation of the transferring agency. <i>Second</i>, there must be an existing item, project or activity with an appropriation in the receiving agency to which the savings will be transferred.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> The essential requisites for realignment of savings were discarded in Special Provision No. 4, which allows realignment of <b>“funds,”</b> and not “<b>savings</b>” as defined in Section 53 of the 2013 GAA. As in Demetria and <i>Sanchez</i>, the realignment of “funds” in Special Provision No. 4 is unconstitutional.<br><br>The President’s constitutional power to realign savings cannot be delegated to the Department Secretaries but must be exercised by the President himself. Under Special Provision No. 4, the President’s power to realign is delegated to Department Secretaries, which violates the Constitutional provision that it is the President who can realign savings.

The practical effect of this requirement, therefore, is to shift to the legislator the power to spend.

However, under Special Provision No. 5, prior approval of either of the Congressional Committees is required for the release of funds. Thus, the Congressional Committees effectively control the release of funds to implement projects identified by legislators. Unless the funds are released, the projects cannot be implemented. Without doubt, the Congressional Committees and legislators are exercising Executive functions in violation of the separation of powers. The Congressional Committees and the legislators are also divesting the President of control over the implementing agencies with respect to the PDAF.<br><br>A law that invests Executive functions on the Legislature, its committees or members is unconstitutional for violation of the separation of powers.

Here the members of the Legislature who constitute a majority of the ‘board’ and ‘committee,’ respectively, are not charged with the performance of any legislative functions or with the doing of anything which is in aid of the performance of any such functions by the Legislature. Putting aside for the moment the question whether the duties devolved upon these members are vested by the Organic Act in the Governor General, it is clear that they are not legislative in character, and still more clear that they are not judicial. The fact that they do not fall within the authority of either of these two constitutes logical ground for concluding that they do fall within that of the remaining one of the three among which the powers of government are divided.

As specified, the President may not veto less than all of an item of an Appropriations Bill. In other words, the power given the executive to disapprove any item or items in an Appropriations Bill does not grant the authority to veto a part of an item and to approve the remaining portion of the same item.</blockquote><br>In Gonzales, the Court defined the term <b>“item”</b> as used in appropriation laws as <b>“an indivisible sum of money dedicated to a stated purpose.”</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> The amount in an item is <b>“indivisible”</b> because the amount cannot be divided for any purpose other than the specific purpose stated in the item.

(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>In place of lump-sum appropriations, COA Chairperson Tan recommends a <b>“line by line budget or amount per proposed program, activity, or project,</b> and per implementing agency.”<br><br>For the President to exercise his constitutional power to veto a particular item of appropriation, the GAA must provide line-item, instead of lump-sum, appropriations. This means Congress has the constitutional duty to present to the President a GAA containing items, instead of lump-sums, stating in detail the <b>specific purpose for each amount of appropriation</b>, precisely to enable the President to exercise his line-item veto power. Otherwise, the President’s line-item veto power is negated by Congress in violation of the Constitution.<br><br>The President’s line-item veto in appropriation laws<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> is intended to eliminate “wasteful parochial spending,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> primarily the pork-barrel.

The pork-barrel is mischievously included in lump-sum appropriations that fund much needed projects. The President is faced with the difficult decision of either vetoing the lump-sum appropriation that includes beneficial programs or approving the same appropriation that includes the wasteful pork-barrel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> To banish the evil of the pork-barrel, the Constitution vests the President with the line-item veto power, <b>which for its necessary and proper exercise</b> requires the President to propose, and Congress to enact, only line-item appropriations.<br><br>The President should not frustrate his own constitutional line-item veto power by proposing to Congress lump-sum expenditures in the NEP. Congress should not also negate the President’s constitutional line-item veto power by enacting lump-sum appropriations in the GAA. When the President submits lump-sum expenditures in the NEP, and Congress enacts lump-sum appropriations in the GAA, both in effect connive to violate the Constitution. This wreaks havoc on the check-and-balance system between the Executive and Legislature with respect to appropriations. While Congress has the power to appropriate, that power should always be subject to the President’s line-item veto power. If the President exercises his line-item veto power unreasonably, Congress can override such veto by two-thirds vote of the House of Representatives and the Senate voting separately.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> This constitutional check-and-balance should at all times be maintained to avoid wastage of taxpayers’ money.<br><br>The President has taken a constitutionally prescribed oath to “preserve and defend” the Constitution. Thus, the President has a constitutional duty to preserve and defend his constitutional line-item veto power by submitting to Congress only a line-item NEP without lump-sum expenditures, and then by demanding that Congress approve only a line-item GAA without lump-sum appropriations. Congress violates the Constitution if it circumvents the President’s line-item veto power by enacting lump-sum appropriations in the GAA. <b><i> To repeat, the President has a constitutional duty to submit to Congress only a line-item NEP without lump-sum expenditures, while Congress has a constitutional duty to enact only a line-item GAA without lump-sum appropriations.</i></b><br><br>In fact, the law governing the <b>“content”</b> of the GAA already mandates that there must be <b>“corresponding appropriations for each program and project,”</b> or <b><i>line-item budgeting</i></b>, in the GAA.

(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Under Section 23, <b>“each program and project”</b> in the GAA must have <b>“corresponding appropriations.”</b> Indisputably, the Administrative Code mandates line-item appropriations in the GAA. <b>There can be no lump-sum appropriations in the GAA because the Administrative Code requires “corresponding appropriations for each program and project.”</b> This means a corresponding appropriation for each program, and a corresponding appropriation for each project of the program. <b>To repeat, lump-sum appropriations are not allowed in the GAA.</b><br><br>Appropriations for personal services need not be itemized further, as long as the <i><b>specific purpose,</b></i><b> which is personal services, has a specific corresponding amount.</b> Section 35, Chapter 5, Book VI of the Administrative Code of 1987 explains how appropriations for personal services shall be itemized further, thus:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 35. <b>Special Budgets</b> for Lump-Sum Appropriations.—Expenditures from lump-sum appropriations authorized for any purpose or for any department, office or agency in any annual General Appropriations Act or other Act and from any fund of the National Government, shall be made in accordance with a <b>special budget</b> to be approved by the President, which <b>shall include but shall not be limited to the <i>number of each kind of position, the designations, and the annual salary</i> proposed for which an appropriation is intended</b>.

The constitutional test for validity is not how itemized the appropriation is down to the project level but whether the purpose of the appropriation is specific enough to allow the President to exercise his line-item veto power. Section 23, Chapter 4, Book VI of the Administrative Code provides a <b>stricter requirement</b> by mandating that there must be a corresponding appropriation for each program and for each project.

The Constitution allows the creation of discretionary and special funds but <b>with certain specified conditions.

The particular public officials must support the use of discretionary funds with appropriate vouchers under guidelines prescribed by law. “Discretionary funds” already existed in GAAs under the 1935 and 1973 Constitutions.

A valid appropriation includes the payment of funds <b>`</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> The framers of the 1987 Constitution decided to regulate in the Constitution itself the disbursement of discretionary funds “to avoid abuse of discretion in the use of discretionary funds”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> in the light of the experience during the Martial Law regime when discretionary funds “were spent for the personal aggrandizement of the First Family and some of their cronies.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>The “special funds” mentioned in the Constitution do not come from the General Funds as in the case of ordinary special funds, but from a corresponding “tax levied for a <b>special purpose.</b>” Unlike ordinary special funds, the “special funds” mentioned in the Constitution cannot be commingled with other funds and must be “<b>paid out for such (special) purpose only.</b>” The “special funds” mentioned in the Constitution are also <b>not subject to realignment</b> because once the special purpose of the fund is accomplished or abandoned, any balance “shall be transferred to the general funds of the Government.”<br><br>It must be stressed that the “calamity fund,” “contingent fund,” and “intelligence fund” in the GAAs are not lump-sum appropriations because they have specific purposes and corresponding amounts. The “calamity fund” can be used only if there are calamities, a use of fund that is sufficiently specific. A “contingent fund” is ordinary and necessary in the operations of both the private and public sectors, and the use of such fund is limited to actual contingencies. The “intelligence fund” has a specific purpose – for use in intelligence operations. All these funds are the proper subject of line-item appropriations.<br><br>An appropriation must specify the purpose and the corresponding amount which will be expended for that specific purpose. <b>The purpose of the appropriation must be sufficiently specific to allow the President to exercise his line-item veto power</b>. The appropriation may have several related purposes that are by accounting and budgeting practice considered as one purpose, e.g. MOOE (maintenance and other operating expenses), in which case the related purposes shall be deemed sufficiently specific for the exercise of the President’s line-item veto power. However, if the appropriation has several purposes which are normally <b>divisible</b> but there is only a single amount for all such purposes, and the President cannot veto the use of funds for one purpose without vetoing the entire appropriation, then the appropriation is a lump-sum appropriation.<br><br>In the 2013 GAA, the PDAF is a lump-sum appropriation, the purpose of which is the “support for priority programs and projects,” with a menu of programs and projects listed in the PDAF provision that does not itemize the amount for each listed program or project. <b> Such <i>non-itemization</i> of the specific amount for each listed program or project fails to satisfy the requirement for a valid appropriation. </b>To repeat, the PDAF merely provides a lump sum without stating the specific amount allocated for each listed program or project. The PDAF ties the hands of the President since he has no choice except to accept the entire PDAF or to veto it entirely. Even if the PDAF undeniably contains pork-barrel projects, the President might hesitate to veto the entire PDAF for to veto it would result not only in rejecting the pork barrel projects, but also in denying financial support to legitimate projects. This dilemma is the evil in lump-sum appropriations. The President’s line-item veto, which necessarily requires line-item appropriations from the Legislature, is intended precisely to exorcise this evil from appropriation laws.<br><br>Clearly, the PDAF negates the President’s constitutional line-item veto power, and also violates the constitutional duty of Congress to enact a line-item GAA. Thus, Article XLIV, on the Priority Development Assistance Fund, of the 2013 GAA is unconstitutional. Whatever funds that are still remaining from this invalid appropriation shall revert to the unappropriated surplus or balances of the General Fund.<br><br>The balance of the 2013 PDAF, having reverted to the unappropriated surplus or balances of the General Fund, can be the subject of an emergency supplemental appropriation to aid the victims of Typhoon Yolanda as well as to fund the repair and reconstruction of facilities damaged by the typhoon.

The President then, in the exercise of his law-making powers, could determine in the future the other purposes for which the Malampaya Fund would be used. This is precisely the reason for the phrase “as may be <i>hereafter directed</i> by the President.” Thus, in light of the executive and legislative powers exercised by the President at that time, the phrase “for such other purposes as may be hereafter directed by the President” has a <b>broader meaning</b> than the phrase “energy resource development and exploitation programs and projects of the government.”<br><br>This does not mean, however, that the phrase “energy resource development and exploitation programs and projects” should be unreasonably interpreted narrowly. To finance “energy resource development and exploitation programs and projects” includes all expenditures necessary and proper to carry out such development and exploitation – including expenditures to secure and protect the gas and oil fields in Malampaya from encroachment by other countries or from threats by terrorists. Indeed, the security of the gas and oil fields is absolutely essential to the development and exploitation of such fields. Without adequate security, the gas and oil fields cannot be developed or exploited, thus generating no income to the Philippine government.<br><br>Under the 1987 Constitution, determining the purpose of the expenditure of government funds is an exclusive legislative power. The Executive can only propose, but cannot determine the purpose of an appropriation. An appropriation cannot validly direct the payment of government funds “for such other purposes as may be hereafter directed by the President,” absent the proper application of the <i>ejusdem generis </i>rule. Section 8 of PD No. 910 authorizes the use of the Malampaya Fund for other projects approved only by the President. To repeat, Congress has the exclusive power to appropriate public funds, and vesting the President with the power to determine the uses of the Malampaya Fund violates the exclusive constitutional power of Congress to appropriate public funds.<br><br><center><b><i>V.<br>The phrase “to finance the priority infrastructure development projects x x x, as may be directed and authorized by the x x x President” under Section 12, Title IV of PD No. 1869, relating to the Use of the Government’s Share in PAGCOR’s Gross Earnings, is Unconstitutional.</i></b></center><br><br>The assailed provision in PD No. 1869 refers to the President’s use of the government’s share in the gross earnings of PAGCOR. Section 12, Title IV of PD No. 1869, or the PAGCOR charter, as amended, provides:<br><br><blockquote>Section 12. Special Condition of Franchise. — After deducting five (5%) percent as Franchise Tax, the fifty (50%) percent share of the government in the aggregate gross earnings of the Corporation from this Franchise, or 60% if the aggregate gross earnings be less than P150,000,000.00, shall immediately be set aside and shall accrue to the General Fund <b>to finance the priority infrastructure development projects and to finance the restoration of damaged or destroyed facilities due to calamities, as may be directed and authorized by the Office of the President of the Philippines</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Similar to PD No. 910, PD No. 1869 was issued when then President Marcos exercised both executive and legislative powers. Under the 1987 Constitution, the President no longer wields legislative powers. The phrase that the government’s share in the gross earnings of PAGCOR shall be used <b>“to finance the priority infrastructure development projects x x x as may be directed and authorized by the Office of the President of the Philippines,”</b> is an undue delegation of the legislative power to appropriate.<br><br>An infrastructure is any of the “basic physical and organizational structures and facilities (e.g. buildings, roads, power supplies) needed for the operation of a society.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> An appropriation for any infrastructure, or for various infrastructures, to be determined by the President is certainly not a specific purpose since an infrastructure is <b>any basic facility needed by society</b>. This power granted to the President to determine what kind of infrastructure to prioritize and fund is a power to determine the purpose of the appropriation, an undue delegation of the legislative power to appropriate.<br><br>The appropriation in Section 12 has <b>two divisible purposes</b>: one to finance any infrastructure project, and the other to finance the restoration of damaged or destroyed facilities due to calamities. To be a valid appropriation, each divisible purpose must have a corresponding specific amount, whether an absolute amount, a percentage of an absolute amount, or a percentage or the whole of a revenue stream like periodic gross earnings or collections. Section 12 is a lump-sum appropriation in view of its two divisible purposes and its single lump-sum amount.<br><br>However, since the first appropriation purpose – to finance any infrastructure project as the President may determine – is unconstitutional, Section 12 has in effect only one appropriation purpose. That purpose, to finance the restoration of facilities damaged or destroyed by calamities, is a specific purpose because the facilities to be restored are only those damaged by calamities. This purpose meets the specificity required for an item to be a valid appropriation. The entire amount constituting the government’s share in PAGCOR’s gross earnings then becomes the specific amount to finance a specific purpose – the restoration of facilities damaged or destroyed by calamities, which is a valid appropriation.<br><br>In sum, only the phrase “to finance the priority infrastructure development projects” in Section 12 of the PAGCOR Charter is unconstitutional for being an undue delegation of legislative power. The rest of Section 12 is constitutional.<br><br><center><b><i>A Final Word</i></b></center><br>The PDAF bluntly demonstrates how a breakdown in the finely crafted constitutional check-and-balance system could lead to gross abuse of power and to wanton wastage of public funds. When the Executive and the Legislature enter into a constitutionally forbidden arrangement - the former proposing lump-sum expenditures in negation of its own line-item veto power and the latter enacting lump-sum appropriations to implement with facility its own chosen projects – the result can be extremely detrimental to the Filipino people.<br><br>We have seen the outrage of the Filipino people to the revulsive pork-barrel system spawned by this forbidden Executive-Legislative arrangement. The Filipino people now realize that there are billions of pesos in the annual budget that could lift a large number of Filipinos out of abject poverty but that money is lost to corruption annually. The Filipino people are now desperately in search of a solution to end this blighted pork-barrel system.<br><br>The solution lies with this Court, which must rise to this historic challenge. <b>The supreme duty of this Court is to restore the constitutional check-and-balance that was precisely intended to banish lump-sum appropriations and the pork-barrel system.</b> The peaceful and constitutional solution to banish all forms of the pork-barrel system from our national life is for this Court to declare all lump-sum appropriations, whether proposed by the Executive or enacted by the Legislature, as unconstitutional.<br><br>Henceforth, as originally intended in the Constitution, the President shall submit to Congress only a line-item NEP, and Congress shall enact only a line-item GAA. The Filipino people can then see in the GAA for what specific purposes and in what specific amounts their tax money will be spent. This will allow the Filipino people to monitor whether their tax money is actually being spent as stated in the GAA.<br><br><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, I vote to <b>GRANT</b> the petitions and <b>DECLARE</b> Article XLIV, on the Priority Development Assistance Fund, of Republic Act No. 10352 <b>UNCONSTITUTIONAL</b> for violating the separation of powers, negating the President’s constitutional line-item veto power, violating the constitutional duty of Congress to enact a line-item General Appropriations Act, and violating the requirement of line-item appropriations in the General Appropriations Act as prescribed in the Administrative Code of 1987. Further, the last phrase of Section 8 of Presidential Decree No. 910, authorizing the use of the Malampaya Fund “for such other purposes as may hereafter be directed by the President,” and the phrase in Section 12, Title IV, of Presidential Decree No. 1869, as amended, authorizing the President to use the government’s share in PAGCOR’s gross earnings “to finance the priority infrastructure development projects” as the President may determine, are likewise declared <b>UNCONSTITUTIONAL</b> for being undue delegations of legislative power.

No. 910, but hold that the first part of this section relating to funds used for <i>“energy resource development and exploitation programs and projects” </i>is constitutionally infirm for being a discretionary lump sum appropriation whose purpose lacks specificity for the projects or undertakings contemplated, and that denies Congress of its constitutional prerogative to participate in laying down national policy on energy matters.<br><br>I submit my own reasons for the unconstitutionality of the portion relating to <i>“priority infrastructure projects”</i> under Section 12, P.D.

They raise constitutional questions that touch on our basic principles of governance; they raise issues, too, involving practices that might have led to monumental corruption at the highest levels of our government. These issues, even singly, raise deeply felt and disturbing questions that we must address quickly and completely, leaving no nagging residues behind.<br><br>I contribute this Opinion to the Court with the thought and the hope that, through our collective efforts, we can resolve the present dispute and restore to its proper track our constitutional budgetary process in the manner expected from this Court by the framers of our Constitution and by our quiet but internally seething citizenry.<br><br><center><b><u>DISCUSSION OF THE ISSUES</u></b></center><br><b>I. The Doctrine of Separation of Powers</b><br><br>The powers of government are generally divided into the executive, the legislative and the judicial, and are distributed among these three great branches under carefully defined terms, to ensure that no branch becomes so powerful that it can dominate the others, all for the good of the people that the government serves.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>This power structure – which serves as the basic foundation for the governance of the State under our republican system of government – is essentially made operational by two basic doctrines: the <b>doctrine of separation of powers</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and the <b>doctrine of checks and balances</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Governmental powers are distributed and made <i>distinctly separate from one another</i> so that these different branches may check and balance each other, again to ensure proper, balanced and accountable governance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>A necessary corollary to this arrangement is that <b>no branch of government may delegate its constitutionally-assigned powers</b> and thereby disrupt the Constitution’s carefully laid out plan of governance. Neither may one branch or any combination of branches <b>deny the other or others their constitutionally mandated prerogatives</b> – either through the exercise of sheer political dominance or through collusive practices – without committing a breach that must be addressed through our constitutional processes. To be sure, political dominance, whether the brazen or the benign kind, should be abhorred by our people for we should have learned our lessons by now.<br><br>Thus, Congress – the government’s policy making body – may not delegate its constitutionally-assigned power to make laws and to alter and repeal them, in the same manner that the President – who enforces and implements the laws passed by Congress – cannot pass on to the Congress or to the Judiciary, its enforcement or implementation powers.<br><br>Nor can we in the Judiciary intrude into the domains of the other two branches except as called for by our assigned duties of interpreting the laws and dispensing justice. But when the call to duty is sounded, we cannot and should not shirk as no other entity in our system of governance except this Court is given the task of peacefully delineating governmental powers through constitutional interpretation.<br><br>In terms of congressional powers, the test to determine if an undue or prohibited delegation has been made is the <b><u>completeness test</u></b> which asks the question: <b>is the law complete in all its terms and conditions when it leaves the legislature such that the delegate is confined to its implementation and has no need to determine for and by himself or herself what the terms or the conditions of the law should be</b>?<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>An aspect of implementation notably left for the delegate’s determination is the question of <i>how</i> the law may be enforced. To cover the gray area that seemingly arises as a law transits from formulation to implementation, jurisprudence has established the rule that for as long as the law has provided sufficient implementation standards to guide the delegate, the latter may fill in the details that the law needs for its prompt, efficient and orderly implementation. This is generally referred to as the <b><u>sufficient standard test</u></b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>The question in every case is whether there is or are adequate standards, guidelines or limitations in the law to map out the boundaries of the delegate’s authority and thus prevent the delegation from spilling into the area that is essentially law or policy formulation. This statutory standard, which may be express or implied, defines legislative policy, marks its limits, maps out the boundaries of the law, and specifies the public agency to apply it; the standard indicates the circumstances or criterion under which the legislative purpose and command may be carried out.<br><br><b>II. Legislative Power of Appropriation</b><br><br>Under our system of government, part of the legislative powers of Congress is the <b><u>power of the purse</u></b> which, broadly described, is the power to determine the areas of national life where government shall devote its funds; to define the amount of these funds and authorize their expenditure; and to provide measures to raise revenues to defray the amounts to be spent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> This power is regarded as the “the most complete and effectual weapon with which any constitution can arm the immediate representatives of the people.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>By granting Congress this power, the Constitution allows the Filipino people, through their representatives, to effectively shape the nation’s future through the control of the funds that render the implementation of national plans possible. Consistent with the separation of powers and the check and balance doctrines, the power of the purse also allows Congress to control <b><i>executive spending</i></b> as the Executive actually disburses the money that Congress sets aside and determines to be available for spending.<br><br>Congress carries out the power of the purse through the appropriation of funds under a general appropriations law (titled as the General <i>Appropriations Act</i> or the GAA) that can easily be characterized as one of the most important pieces of legislation that Congress enacts each year. For this reason, the 1987 Constitution (and previous Constitutions) has laid down the general framework by which Congress and the Executive make important decisions on how public funds are raised and spent - from the policy-making phase to the actual spending phase, including the raising of revenues as source of government funds.<br><br>The Constitution expressly provides that “<i>[n]o money shall be paid out of the Treasury except in pursuance of an appropriation made by law.</i>”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> The Administrative Code of 1987, on the other hand, defines “<b>appropriation</b>” as the authorization made by law or other legislative enactment, directing payment out of government funds under <b><i>specified conditions or for specified purposes</i></b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> It is the legislative act of setting apart or assigning public funds to a <b><i>particular use</i></b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> This power carries with it the power to specify the project or activity to be funded under the appropriation law and, necessarily, the amount that would be allocated for the purpose.<br><br>Significantly, the people themselves in their sovereign capacity, have cast in negative tenor the limitation on the executive’s power over the budget when it provided in the Constitution that <b><i>no money shall be paid</i></b> out of the treasury, until their representatives, by law, have assigned and set aside the public revenues of the State for specific purposes.<br><br>The requirements – that Congress itself both identify a determined or determinable amount to be appropriated and the specific purpose or project to which the appropriation will be devoted – characterize an appropriations law to be purely legislative in nature. Consequently, to pass and allow an appropriation that fails to satisfy these requirements amounts to an illegal abdication of legislative power by Congress. For instance, when a law allows the President to dictate his will on an appropriation matter and thereby displaces the power of Congress in this regard, the arrangement cannot but be constitutionally infirm. Presidential Decree No. 1177 (the Budget Reform Decree of 1977) concretely expresses these requirements when it provides that <i>“[a]ll moneys appropriated for functions, activities, projects and programs shall be available solely for the specific purposes for which these are appropriated.”</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br><b>III.&nbsp;&nbsp; Check and Balance Doctrine as Applied in the Budgeting Process</b><br><br><b><i>A. Budget Preparation &amp; Proposal</i></b><br><br>The budgeting process demonstrates, not only how the Constitution canalizes governmental powers to achieve its purpose of effective governance, but also how this separation checks and balances the exercise of powers by the different branches of government.<br><br>In this process, the Executive initially participates through its role in <b>budget preparation and proposal</b> which starts the whole process. It is the Executive who lays out the budget proposal that serves as basis for Congress to act upon. This function is expressed under the Constitution in the following terms:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br><blockquote>Article VII, Section 22. The President shall submit to the Congress, within thirty days from the opening of every regular session as the basis for the general appropriations bill, a budget of expenditures and sources of financing, including receipts from existing and proposed revenue measures.</blockquote><br>A notable feature of this provision that impacts on the present case is the requirement that revenue sources be reported to Congress. Notably, too, the President’s recommended appropriations may not be increased by Congress pursuant to Section 25, Article VI of the Constitution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> - a feature that immeasurably heightens the power and participation of the President in the budget process.<br><br>Arguably, Section 22 above refers only to the general <i>appropriations bill</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> so that there may be no need to report all sources of government revenue, particularly those emanating from funds like the Malampaya Fund.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> The power of Congress, however, will be less than plenary if this omission will happen as Congress would then be denied a complete picture of government revenues and would consequently be denied its rightful place in setting national policies on matters of national importance, among them energy matters. The Constitution would similarly be violated if Congress cannot also demand that the revenues of special funds (like the Malampaya Fund) be reported together with a listing of their items of expenditures. Since the denial would be by the Office of the President, the incapacity of Congress would be because of intrusive action by the Executive into what is otherwise a congressional preserve.<br><br>Already, it is reported that these funds (also called <b>off-budget accounts</b>) are sizeable and are not all subject to the annual appropriation exercise; have no need for annual appropriation by Congress; and whose receipts and expenditures are kept in separate book of accounts (357 accounts as of 2007) that are not commonly found in public records. While efforts have been made to consolidate them in a general account under the “one fund” concept, these efforts have not been successful. Attempts have been made as early as 1977 during the Marcos administration, and again during the Aquino and Estrada administrations without significant success up to the present time. Controls have reportedly not been very strict although the funds are already sizeable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Constitutionally, a disturbing aspect of these funds is that they are under the control of the President (as <b>presidential pork barrel</b>), as from this perspective, they are in defiance of what the Constitution prescribes under Section 25 and 27, Article VI, with respect to the handling of public funds, the authority of Congress to decide on the budget, and the congressional scrutiny and monitoring that should take place.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>As of October 2013, the Malampaya Fund alone already amounts to Php137.288 billion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> <b>The COA, despite assurances during the oral arguments, have so far failed to provide a summary of the extent and utilization of the Malampaya Fund in the last three (3) years.</b><br><br><b><i>B. Budget Legislation</i></b><br><br>Actual appropriation or <b>budget legislation</b> is undertaken by Congress under the strict terms of Section 25, Article VI of the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> A theme that runs through the various subdivisions of this provision is the Constitution’s strict treatment of the budget process, apparently in its desire to plug all holes that have appeared through our years of constitutional history and to ensure that funds are used according to congressional intent.<br><br>Of special interest in the present case are Sections 25(2) which speaks of the need for particularity in an appropriation; Section 25(4) on special appropriation bill and its purpose; and Section 25(6) on discretionary funds and the special purpose they require.<br><br><i><b>C. Line-Item Veto</b></i><br><br>Check and balance measures are evident in passing the budget as the President is constitutionally given the opportunity to exercise his line item veto, i.e., the authority to reject specific items in the budget bill while approving the whole bill.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>The check and balance measure, of course, runs both ways. In the same manner that Congress cannot deny the President his authority to exercise his line veto power except through an override of the veto,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> the President cannot also deny Congress its share in national policymaking by including lump sum appropriations in its recommended expenditure program. Lump sum appropriations, in the words of J. Perlas-Bernabe, is wrong as it leaves the President with “no item” to act on and denies him the exercise of his line item veto power.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> The option when this happens and if he rejects an appropriation, is therefore not the veto of a specific item but the veto of the whole lump sum appropriation.<br><br>A lump sum appropriation like the PDAF cannot and should not pass Congress unless the Executive and the Legislative branches collude, in which case, the turn of this Court to be an active constitutional player in the budget process comes into play. The PDAF, as explained in the Opinions of Justice Carpio and Bernabe, is a prime example of a lump sum appropriation that, over the years, for reasons beneficial to both branches of government, have successfully negotiated the congressional legislative process, to the detriment of the general public.<br><br><b><i>D. Budget Execution/Implementation</i></b><br><br>Budget action again shifts to the Executive during the <b>budget execution phase</b>; the Executive implements the budget (<b>budget execution</b>) by handling the allocated funds and managing their releases. This is likewise a closely regulated phase, subject not only to the terms of the Constitution, but to the Administrative Code as well, and to the implementing regulations issued by the Executive as implementing agency.<br><br>Constitutionally, <b>Section 25(5)</b> on the transfer of appropriation (a practice that would technically subvert the will of Congress through the use of funds on a project or activity other than that intended, unless a constitutional exception is made under this provision), and <b>Section 25(6)</b> on discretionary funds and its disbursement, assume critical materiality.<br><br><b><i>E. Budget Accountability, Scrutiny and Investigation</i></b><br><br>The last phase of the budgetary process is the <b>budget accountability</b> phase that Congress is empowered to enforce in order to check on compliance with its basic intents in allocating measured funds under the appropriation act.<br><br>At the budget hearings during the legislation phase, Congress already checks on the need for the recommended appropriations (as Congress may delete a recommended appropriation that it perceives to be unneeded), and on the propriety, efficiency and effectiveness of budget implementation, both past and impending. Technically, this portion of the budgetary exercise involves <b>legislative scrutiny</b> that is part of the <b>overall oversight powers</b> of Congress over the budget.<br><br>Another part of the oversight authority is <b>legislative investigation</b>. Former Chief Justice Puno expounded on this aspect of the budgetary process in his Separate Opinion in <i>Macalintal v. Commission on Elections</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>and he best sums up the breadth and scope of this power, as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Broadly defined, the power of oversight embraces all activities undertaken by Congress <b>to enhance its understanding of and influence over the implementation of legislation</b> it has enacted. Clearly, oversight concerns post-enactment measures undertaken by Congress: (a) to monitor bureaucratic compliance with program objectives, (b) to determine whether agencies are properly administered, (c) <b>to eliminate executive waste and dishonesty, (d) to prevent executive usurpation of legislative authority</b>, and (d) to assess executive conformity with the congressional perception of public interest.<br><br>The power of oversight has been held to be intrinsic in the grant of legislative power itself and integral to the checks and balances inherent in a democratic system of government. Xxx<br><br>Over the years, Congress has invoked its oversight power with increased frequency to check the perceived “exponential accumulation of power” by the executive branch. By the beginning of the 20th century, Congress has delegated an enormous amount of legislative authority to the executive branch and the administrative agencies. Congress, thus, uses its oversight power to make sure that the administrative agencies perform their functions within the authority delegated to them.</blockquote><br>Compared with one another, the two modalities can be appreciated for their individual merits but operationally, the power of investigation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> – which is a power mostly used after appropriations have been spent – cannot compare with legislative scrutiny made during budget hearings as all participating government officials in these hearings can attest. Legislative scrutiny is a timely intervention made <i>at the point of budget deliberations and approval</i>, and is consequently an effective intervention by Congress in the formulation of national policy. Legislative investigation, if at all and as the recent <i>Napoles</i> hearing at the Senate has shown, can at best examine compliance with legislative purposes and intent, with aid to future legislation as its goal, and may only possibly succeed if the legislators are truly minded to exercise their power of investigation purposefully, with firmness and political will.<br><br>If indeed specific monitoring is needed, two constitutional bodies readily fit the bill – the <u>Commission on Audit</u> which looks at specific expenditures from the perspective of legality, effectiveness and efficiency,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> and the <b>Ombudsma</b>n, from the point of view of administrative and criminal liability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br><b>IV. Assessment and Prognosis</b><br><br>On the whole, I believe the Constitution has provided the nation a reasonably effective and workable system of setting national policy through the budget process.<br><br>The President, true to constitutional intent, remains a powerful official who can respond to the needs of the nation through his significant participation on both national planning and implementation of policies; the budget process leaves him with the needed muscle to enforce the laws and implement policies without lacking funds, except only if revenue collection and the economy both falter.<br><br>Additionally, current practices that Congress has given him his own pork barrel – generally, lump sum funds that he can utilize at his discretion without passing through the congressional mill and without meaningful congressional scrutiny. As I have stated, <b>this is a constitutionally anomalous practice that requires Court intervention as the budgetary partners will allow matters to remain as they are unless externally restrained by legally binding actions.</b><br><br>Congress, for its part, is given significant authority to decide on the projects and activities that will take place, and to allocate funds for these national undertakings. It has not at all complained about the loss of its budgeting prerogatives to the President;<b> it appeared to have surrendered these without resistance as it has been given its share in budget implementation as the current PDAF findings show. Thus, what confronts the Court is a situation where two partners happily scratch each other’s back in the pork barrel system, although the Constitution prohibits, or at the very least, limits the practice.</b><br><br>If, as current newspaper headlines and accounts now vividly banner and narrate, irregularities have transpired as a consequence of the budgetary process, these anomalies are more attributable to the officials acting in the process than to the system the Constitution designed; the men and women who are charged with their constitutional duties have simply not paid close attention to what their duties require.<br><br>Thus, as things are now, the budgetary process the Constitution provided the nation can only be effective if the basic constitutionally-designed safeguards, particularly the doctrines of separation of powers and checks and balances, are observed. Or, more plainly stated, <b>the aims of the budgetary process cannot be achieved, <i>to the eventual detriment of the people the government serves</i>, if intrusion into powers and the relaxation of built-in checks are allowed.</b><br><br>With these ground rules plainly stated as premises, I now proceed to discuss the concrete issues. In doing so, I shall not belabor the points that my colleagues – Justices Carpio and Perlas-Bernabe – have covered on the constitutional status of PDAF, except only to state my observations or disagreements. But as I also stated at the start, I agree largely with the conclusion reached that the <b>PDAF is unconstitutional</b> as it subverts and can fatally strike at our constitutional processes unless immediately stopped; it is, in my view, a villain that “must be slain at sight.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br><b><i>A. Constitutionality of Section 12 of P.D. No. 1869, as amended</i></b><br><br>P.D. No. 1869 – whether under the 1973 or the 1987 Constitutions – is an appropriation law as it sets aside a determinable amount of money to be disbursed and spent for a stated public purpose. This presidential decree, prior to its amendment, made allocations to fund the following: “infrastructure and socio-civic projects within the Metropolitan Manila Area: (a) Flood Control (b) Sewerage and Sewage (c) Nutritional Control (d) Population Control (e) Tulungang Bayan Centers (f) Beautification (g) Kilusang Kabuhayan at Kaunlaran (KKK) projects.” Additionally, it provided that the amount allocated “<i>may also be appropriated and allocated to fund and finance infrastructure and/or socio-civic projects throughout the Philippines as may be directed and authorized by the Office of the President of the Philippines.</i>”<br><br>As the decree then stood i.e., prior to its amendment, the above italicized portion already rendered the authority given to the Office of the President of the Philippines of doubtful validity as it gave the President authority to designate and specify the projects to be funded without any clear guiding standards and fixed parameters. Only two things, to my mind, would have saved this provision from unconstitutionality.<br><br>The <i>first reason</i> is the specification of the projects in Metro Manila to which the allocated funds could be devoted. This specification arguably identified the type of projects to which the President could apply the funds, limiting it to the types of infrastructure and socio-civic projects specified for Metro Manila. Thus, unconstitutionality would have occurred only if the funds had been applied to the projects that did not fall within the general class of the listed projects.<br><br>The <i>second reason</i>, now part of Philippine and legal history, is the nature of the exercise of power of the Philippine President <i>at that time</i>. The decree was promulgated by then President Ferdinand E. Marcos in the exercise of his combined legislative and executive powers, which remained valid and binding even after the passage of the then 1973 Constitution. In strictly legal terms, there then existed a legal cover to justify its validity despite an arrangement where the <i>delegating authority</i> was himself the <i>delegate</i>.<br><br>Section 12 of P.D. No. 1869, however,<b> has since been amended by P.D. No 1973</b> and now reads:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 12.Special Condition of Franchise. — After deducting five (5%) percent as Franchise Tax, the fifty (50%) percent share of the government in the aggregate gross earnings of the Corporation from this Franchise, or 60% if the aggregate gross earnings be less than P150,000,000.00, shall immediately be set aside and shall accrue to the General Fund <b>to finance the priority infrastructure development projects</b> and to finance the restoration of damaged or destroyed facilities due to calamities, <b>as may be directed and authorized by the Office of the President of the Philippines.</b></blockquote><br>Unlike its earlier wording, P.D. No. 1869, as amended, no longer identifies and specifies the “infrastructure and socio-civic projects that can serve as a model for the structures to which the fund shall be devoted. Instead, the decree now generally refers to “priority infrastructure development projects,” unsupported by any listing that gave the previous unamended version a taint of specificity.<br><br>Thus, what these “priority infrastructure development projects” are, P.D. No. 1869 does not identify and state with particularity. This deficiency is rendered worse by the absence of defined legislative parameters, assuming that legislative purpose can be supplied through parameters. In fact, neither does P.D. No. 1869’s <i>Whereas</i> clauses sufficiently disclose the decree’s legislative purpose to save the objectionable portion of this law.<br><br>Even granting <i>arguendo</i> that these “infrastructure and development projects” may be validly determined by the President himself as part of his law-execution authority, the question of which “infrastructure and development projects” should receive “priority” treatment is a matter that the legislature itself has not determined. “Priority” is defined as a matter or concern that is more important than others, and that needs to be done or dealt with first. Which infrastructure development project must be prioritized is a question that the President alone cannot decide. Strictly, it is a matter appropriate for national policy consideration since national funds are involved, and must have the imprimatur of Congress which has the power of the purse and is the repository of plenary legislative power.<br><br>From another perspective, while Congress’ authority to identify the project or activity to be funded is indisputable. Contrary to the Court’s ruling in <i>Philippine Constitution Association v. Enriquez</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>(<i>Philconsa</i>), this authority cannot be “as broad as Congress wants it to be.” If the President can exercise the <b>power to prioritize</b> at all, such power is limited to his choice of which <i>of the already identified projects</i> must be given preferential attention <b>in a situation <i>when there are not enough funds to allocate for each project because of budgetary shortfall</i></b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Additionally, unlike President Marcos during his time, the present President, indisputably exercises only executive powers under the 1987 Constitution and now labors under the constitutional limits in the exercise of his executive powers, as discussed above. He cannot enjoy, therefore, the practically unlimited scope of governmental power that the former President enjoyed.<br><br>As matters now stand, the President would enjoy, under the amended P.D. No. 1869, the non-delegable aspect of the legislative power of appropriation that is denied him by the Constitution. Consequently, we have to strike down this aspect of the law.<br><br>Unlike the first portion of the law, the second portion referring to <i>“the restoration of damaged or restored facilities due to calamities”</i> does not need to be stricken down because it refers to particular objects that must be funded only when the required specific instances occur. These instances are the “<b><i>calamities</i></b>” that now enjoy, not only a dictionary meaning, but a distinct instinctive meaning in the minds of Filipinos. The President can only spend the PAGCOR FUNDS when these calamities come; he is even limited to the items he can use the public funds for – to the restoration of damaged or destroyed facilities.<br><br>From this perspective, the presidential exercise of discretion approaches the level of insignificance; the President only has to undertake a fact-finding to operationalize the expenditure of the funds at his disposal. Nor can the appropriation be objected to for being a lump sum amount. In the sense everybody can understand, rather than a whole lump sum, the President is effectively given an advance or standby fund to be spent when calamities occur. This can in no way be understood as an objectionable discretionary lump sum.<br><br><b><i>B. Constitutionality of Section 8 of P.D. No. 910</i></b><br><br>The Section 8, P.D. No. 910 funds or the Malampaya Fund consist of two components: the funds <i>“to be used to finance energy resource development and exploitation programs and projects,”</i> and the funds <i>“for such other purposes as may be…directed by the President.”</i><br><br>I join Justice Carpio in the view that the second “<i>for such other purposes</i>” component is a complete nullity as it is an undue delegation of legislative power. I submit that this is additionally objectionable for being a part of a constitutionally objectionable lump sum payment that violates the separation of powers doctrine. I will discuss this view under the first component of Section 8.<br><br>I vote to strike down the “<i>energy</i>” component of Section 8, P.D. No. 910 as it is a discretionary lump sum fund that is not saved at all by its <i>energy development and exploitation</i> purpose. It is a pure and simple pork barrel granted to the President under a martial law regime decree that could have escaped invalidity then under the 1973 Constitution and the prevailing unusual times, but should be struck down now for being out of step with the requirements of the 1987 Constitution.<br><br>As a fund, it is a prohibited lump sum because it consists of a fund of indefinite size that has now grown to gigantic proportions, whose accounts and accounting are far from the usual in government, and which is made available to the President for his disposition, from year to year, with very vague controls, and free from the legal constraints of the budget process now in place under the 1987 Constitution. Admittedly, it is a fund raised and intended for special purposes but the characterization “special purpose” is not reason enough and is not a magical abracadabra phrase that could whisk a fund out of the constitutional budget process, defying even common reason in the process.<br><br>While a provision exists in the Constitution providing for a special purpose fund, its main reason for being and its “special” appellation are traceable to its source and the intent to use its proceeds to replenish and replicate energy sources all over the country. This description at first blush can pass muster but must fail on deeper inspection and consideration.<br><br>As already mentioned, the legitimacy of the fund and its purpose were beyond question at the time the fund was created, but this status was mainly and largely due to the prevailing situation then. No reason exists to assume that its validity continued or would continue after the Marcos Constitution had been overtaken by the 1987 Constitution. Thus, now, it should be tested based on the new constitutional norms.<br><br>That it is a lump sum that <b>escapes the year to year congressional budget review</b> is indisputable. The fund is one indivisible amount that keeps accumulating from its source and from interests earned from year to year.<br><br>That it is intended and has been <b>used for different projects</b>, now existing and yet to exist if the fund is maintained, cannot also be disputed. It is <b>not intended for one energy project alone but for many</b>, including those to occur in the future and are as yet unknown. In short, it is one big fund supporting or intended to support multiple projects.<br><br>Who determines the projects or activities to which the funds will be devoted is plain from the law itself. It is subject to the <b>sole discretion of the President, completely devoid of any participation from Congress</b>. In other words, we have here with us now a major component of Philippine development – for it cannot be doubted that energy is a <b>major component of national life and economic development</b> – that is <b>left to the will of one man</b> in terms of its growth, economic trajectory and future development. That the discretion is given to the President of the Philippines is not at all a valid argument, and the existence of a law allowing the grant of discretion is likewise not valid, simply because that legal situation should no longer be allowed under the 1987 Philippine Constitution that requires a valid appropriation by Congress for every use of the public fund. In fact, even the argument that there has been no abuse in the exercise of discretion cannot be acceptable as the grant should have justified its existence when the 1987 Constitution took effect.<br><br>Of course, the magical word “energy” is there to justify the lump sum grant, but as I said, that “energy” purpose cannot, by and of itself, be a valid justification. The other circumstances surrounding the fund must also be known, read and taken into account, particularly the non-participation of Congress in the formulation of major national policy on energy.<br><br>How the purpose is served and under what conditions this purpose is served should also be considered. For example, <b><i>is the President’s choice in the exercise of his discretion made under such neutral conditions that would approximate the choice and policy-making by Congress with policy inputs and recommendations from the President, or is it an exercise of discretion that can be made strictly along political lines with no effective control from anyone within the governmental hierarchy</i></b>? To be sure, this situation of dominance and unlimited exercise of power, particularly over a very sizeable sum of money (reportedly in the hundreds of billions), is one that the framers of the 1987 Constitution have frowned upon and which our people continue to reject. We will be less than faithful to our duties as a Court if we do not raise these questions.<br><br><b>Why a very sizeable sum has to be kept under the control of one man also has to be explained</b>. Considering the nature of energy development and exploitation projects, they are best discussed at many levels that take into account political, technical, and economic considerations, at the very least. Unlike calamities, these projects are subject to long gestation periods and do not at all require quick and ready responses in the way that a calamity does. There thus appears no reason why the Malampaya Fund are held as captive funds. The <b>constitutional alternative</b> of course is to subject this fund to regular budgetary process as this can be done without removing the “special” nature of the fund and while keeping it exclusive for particular uses, to be determined after due consideration by the constitutionally-assigned bodies. That we continue to accept the “energy” excuse, when the constitutional alternative is available and when the <i>status quo</i> has lapsed into illegality, remains a continuing enigma.<br><br>In sum, I question the legitimacy of the present status of the fund, particularly its purpose and lack of specificity; its lump sum nature and its disbursement solely at the discretion of one man, unchecked by any other; how and why a multi-project and multi-activity fund covering many projects and activities, now and in the future, should be held at the discretion of one man; and the legal situation where the power of Congress and its participation in national policymaking through the budget process is disregarded. All these can be encapsulated as violations of the doctrines of separation of powers and checks and balances which can be addressed and remedied if only the fund can be subjected to the usual budget processes, with adjustments that circumstances of the fund and its use would require.<br><br>Lest this conclusion be misunderstood, I do not<i> per se </i>take the position that all lump sum appropriations should be disallowed as this would be an extreme position that disregards the realities of national life. But the use of lump sums, to be allowed, should be within reason acceptable under the processes of the Constitution, respectful of the constitutional safeguards that are now in place, and understandable to the people based on their secular understanding of what is happening in government.<br><br>To cite two obvious examples, a sizeable amount, set aside under the budget as contingent advance to be <b>devoted to calamities</b>, cannot be objectionable despite its size if it is set aside under the regular budget process; if it is in the nature of an advance, reportable at the end of the year if no calamities occur, and subject to replenishment if, from year to year, it goes below a certain predetermined level. Of course, this is without prejudice to identifiable expenditures for calamity preparedness that can already be identified and for restoration and reconstruction activities for which specific budgetary items can be appropriated.<br><br>Another example is intelligence funds that by practice, usages and nature are confidential in character and cannot but be entrusted to specific individuals in government who keep information to themselves, with limited checks on the specific uses and other circumstances of the fund. Subject to reasonable safeguards (for again, no grant can be unlimited), the grant of a lump sum appropriation for intelligence purposes can be understandable and reasonable unless the size and circumstances of use become scandalously unreasonable.<br><br>To recapitulate, the GAA is one of the most important pieces of legislation enacted by Congress each year. The constitutional grant to Congress of the power of appropriation; to scrutinize the budget submitted by the President; to prescribe the form, content, and manner of preparation of the budget; and to provide guidelines for the use of discretionary funds, all speak loudly of the Constitution’s intent of preserving the corollary principle of checks and balances among the different branches of government to achieve a workable government for the ultimate benefit of the nation. All these considerations call for the striking down of Section 8 of P.D. No. 910.<br><br><b>V. Violation of the TRO</b><br><br>In a Resolution dated September 10, 2013, the Court issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) <i>“enjoining the [DBM], the National Treasurer, the Executive Secretary, or any persons acting under their authority from releasing: (1) the remaining Priority Development Assistance Fund allocated to members of Congress under GAA of 2013...”</i><br><br>Despite the Court’s TRO, the DBM issued Circular Letter dated September 27, 2013, authorizing implementing agencies to continue with the implementation of PDAF projects and the disbursement of PDAF funds where the DBM has already issued a Special Allotment Order (SARO) and where the implementing agencies have already obligated the funds.<br><br>According to the <i>ponencia</i>, the Circular Letter is inconsistent with the DBM’s own definition of what a SARO. In its website the DBM stated that <i>“the actual release of funds is brought about by the issuance of the [Notice of Cash Allocation or NCA],” not by the mere issuance of a SARO. Thus, unless an NCA has been issued, public funds [are not considered as] ‘released.’”</i><br><br>While I agree with the <i>ponencia</i> that an NCA is necessary before funds could be treated as ‘released,’ I disagree with its conclusion that the release of funds covered by obligated SAROs should be forbidden only at the time of this Decision’s promulgation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>The fact that public funds are not considered released until they have been issued an NCA, coupled with the language of the Court’s TRO prohibiting the release of the 2013 PDAF funds, should point to four logical consequences:<br><br><b><i>First</i></b>, the disbursement of 2013 PDAF funds covered only by a SARO has been provisionally prohibited by the TRO that the Court had issued on September 10, 2013;<br><br><b><i>Second</i></b>, since the Court now finds that this provisional order should be made permanent, then the disbursement of 2013 PDAF funds without any NCA, and regardless of whether it had already been issued a SARO, should be permanently prohibited from the time the TRO was issued and not at the time of this Decision’s promulgation;<br><br><b><i>Third</i></b>, the 2013 PDAF funds released in violation of the TRO should be returned to the government’s coffers; and<br><br><b><i>Fourth</i></b>, the DBM secretary, in issuing the DBM Letter Circular in contravention of the TRO, should be directed to explain why he should not be held in contempt for issuing the DBM Letter Circular and penalized for disregarding the Court’s TRO.<br><br>In issuing the TRO, the Court is obviously aware that should it decide to rule against the constitutionality of the pork barrel system, the doctrine of operative fact will play a significant role in determining the consequences of its ruling. This doctrine, however, is never meant to weaken the force and effectivity of a provisional order the Court has issued. The purpose of the TRO is to preserve and protect rights and interests during the pendency of an action.<br><br>In the present case, these “rights and interests” range from the public’s right to prevent the misapplication and waste of public funds, to the right to demand accountability from its public officials as an express constitutional tenet and as a necessary consequence of holding public office.<br><br>While the DBM Circular Letter’s resulting violation of the Court’s TRO may seem innocuous on paper, the Court must not forget that its finding of the unconstitutionality of the system that created these funds is anchored on its violation of the fundamental doctrines on which our Constitution and our nation, rest.<br><br>That the funds that may have been released by virtue of the DBM Circular Letter may involve measly sums of money is beside the point: <b>public funds are merely held in trust by the government for the public good</b> and must be handled in accordance with law. Additionally, that the apparent violation may have been made by a high-ranking official of the government cannot serve as an excuse, for no one is above the law and the Constitution.<br><br>To gloss over this violation <i>despite a finding of the intrinsic unconstitutionality of the system from where funds (subject of the restraining order</i>) came may not speak well of the Court’s regard for the constitutional magnitude of this case and the staggering amounts that appear to have vanished.<br><br>The Court should be keenly aware that aside from its power, it also has the duty to enforce its authority, preserve its integrity, maintain its dignity, and ensure the effectiveness of the administration of justice. Specifically, courts have to penalize contempt, not simply because it has the power to do this, but because it carries this as a duty essential to its right to self-preservation.<br><br>Under the Rules of Court, contempt is classified into direct and indirect or constructive contempt. Direct contempt is misbehavior in the presence of or so near a court or judge as to obstruct or interrupt the proceedings before the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Where the act of contumacy is not committed in <i>facie curiae</i>, or “in the presence of or so near a court or judge, i.e., perpetrated outside the sitting of the court, it is considered indirect or constructive contempt, and may include “disobedience of or resistance to a lawful writ, process, order judgment, or command of a court, or injunction granted by a court or judge,” or “(a)ny abuse of or any unlawful interference with the process or proceedings of a court not constituting direct contempt,” or “any improper conduct tending, directly, or indirectly to impede, obstruct or degrade the administration of justice.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Based on this definition and classification, the issuance of the DBM Circular Letter is <i>prima facie</i> an indirect contempt for which the DBM Secretary himself should be liable unless he can show why he should not be punished.<br><br>As an element of due process, he must now be directed by resolution to explain why he should not be penalized for issuing and enforcing Circular Letter No. 2013-8 dated September 27, 2013 despite the Court’s TRO.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Angara v.

Among the major OBAs are the following:<br><br>1. Municipal Development Fund. This is a loan revolving fund set up to provide credit to local government units. Every year, the national government appropriates additional money to the equity of the Fund, and this added equity is properly reflected as expenditure of the national government and income of the Fund. Loan repayments, however, are retained as Fund Balance and used as credit assistance to LGUs without being included in the national budget. The average amount disbursed out of loan repayments in 2006-2007 was P 380 million.<br><br>2. President's Social Fund. This is funded by fixed percentage contributions from the income of two (2) government corporations, namely, the Philippine Amusements and Gaming Corporation and the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes.<br><br>The Fund is used as a discretionary purse for various social advocacies of the President, including direct assistance to the poor. The amount disbursed annually depends on actual receipts. In 2007, more than P600 million was disbursed from the Fund.<br><br>3. Manila Economic and Cultural Office (MECO). MECO is a government entity with a private character. It was created during the Aquino Administration to perform consular functions in Taiwan in behalf of the government. MECO reports directly to the Office of the President and its funds are supposed to be used for various economic and cultural purposes. There is no publicly available record of MECO financial accounts. It is reported, however, that Taiwan has one of the busiest consular operations in Asia, earning at least P100 million per year for the national government.<br><br>4. NABCOR Trust Funds. The National Agribusiness Corporation was created during the Marcos Administration as the business arm of the Department of Agriculture (DA). Subsequently, it was used as a conduit for various appropriations of the DA to implement various projects. The circuitous way by which DA funds are utilized through NABCOR have been the subject of curiosity among DA watchers. Specifically, determining the actual use of NABCOR-administered funds poses an interesting challenge to accountants and analysts in the absence of publicly available data.<br><br>Source: Off-Budget Accounts, July 2009, Management Systems International Corporate Services (the publication was made for the review of USAID).

The interplay and dynamics of these two components form the Pork Barrel System, which is likewise being questioned as unconstitutional insofar as it undermines the principle of separation of powers and the corollary doctrine of checks and balances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></blockquote><br>None of the original Petitions point to the provisions of law that they wish this Court to strike down. Petitioners used the Priority Development Assistance Fund in the General Appropriations Act of 2013 merely as a concrete example of the “legislative pork barrel” which is assailed by the petitioners as unconstitutional. Thus,<br><br><blockquote>This is a Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition with Prayer for the Issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order and/or Writ of Preliminary Injunction (the “instant Petition”) filed under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, <u>seeking to annul and set aside the Pork Barrel System presently embodied in the provisions of the General Appropriations Act (“GAA”) of 2013</u> providing for the Legislature's Priority Development Assistance Fund or any replacement thereto, and the Executive's various lump sum, discretionary funds colloquially referred to as the Special Purpose Funds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)<br><br>Petitioners consider the PDAF as it appears in the 2013 GAA as legislative pork barrel, considering that:<br><br><blockquote>a.

The PDAF gives lump-sum funds to Congressmen (PhP70 Million) and Senators (PhP200 Million);<br><br>c. Despite the existence of a menu of projects, legislators have discretionary power to propose and identify the projects or beneficiaries that will be funded by their respective PDAF allocations;<br><br>d. The legislative guidelines for the PDAF in the 2013 GAA are vague and overbroad insofar as the purpose for which the funds are to be used; and<br><br>e. Legislators, specifically Congressmen, are generally directed to channel their PDAF to projects located in their respective districts, but are permitted to fund projects outside of his or her district, with permission of the local district representative concerned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></blockquote></blockquote><br>For purposes of this litigation, we should focus on Title XVIV of the 2013 General Appropriations Act which now contains the Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) item. The ponencia ably chronicles the history of this aspect of “pork barrel” and notes that the specific features of the present Priority Development Assistance Fund is different from its predecessors. To the extent that our pronouncements today affect the common features of all these forms of “pork barrel” is the extent to which we affect the “system.”<br><br><center>II. C</center><br>Basic in litigation raising constitutional issues is the requirement that there must be an actual case or controversy. This Court cannot render an advisory opinion. We assume that the Constitution binds all other constitutional departments, instrumentalities, and organs. We are aware that in the exercise of their various powers, they do interpret the text of the Constitution in the light of contemporary needs that they should address. A policy that reduces this Court to an adviser for official acts by the other departments that have not yet been done would unnecessarily tax our resources. It is inconsistent with our role as final arbiter and adjudicator and weakens the entire system of the Rule of Law. Our power of judicial review is a duty to make a final and binding construction of law. This power should generally be reserved when the departments have exhausted any and all acts that would remedy any perceived violation of right. The rationale that defines the extent of our doctrines laying down exceptions to our rules on justiciability are clear: Not only should the pleadings show a convincing violation of a right, but the impact should be shown to be so grave, imminent, and irreparable that any delayed exercise of judicial review or deference would undermine fundamental principles that should be enjoyed by the party complaining or the constituents that they legitimately represent.<br><br>The requirement of an “actual case,” thus, means that the case before this Court “involves a conflict of legal rights, an assertion of opposite legal claims susceptible of judicial resolution; the case must not be moot or academic based on extra-legal or other similar considerations not cognizable by a court of justice.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Furthermore, “the controversy needs to be definite and concrete, bearing upon the legal relations of parties who are pitted against each other due to their adverse legal interests.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Thus, the adverse position of the parties must be sufficient enough for the case to be pleaded and for this Court to be able to provide the parties the proper relief/s prayed for.<br><br>The requirement of an ‘actual case’ will ensure that this Court will not issue advisory opinions.

A</center><br>The political question doctrine emerged as a corollary to the nature of judicial review. In the landmark case of Angara v. Electoral Commission,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> the essence of the duty of judicial review was explained, thus:<br><br><blockquote>But in the main, the Constitution has blocked out with deft strokes and in bold lines, allotment of power to the executive, the legislative and the judicial departments of the government. The overlapping and interlacing of functions and duties between the several departments, however, sometimes makes it hard to say just where one leaves off and the other begins. In times of social disquietude or political excitement, the great landmarks of the Constitution are apt to be forgotten or marred, if not entirely obliterated. <b>In cases of conflict, the judicial department is the only constitutional organ which can be called upon to determine the proper allocation of powers between the several departments and among the integral or constituent units thereof.</b><br><br>x x x x<br><br>The Constitution is a definition of the powers of government. Who is to determine the nature, scope and extent of such powers? The Constitution itself has provided for the instrumentality of the judiciary as the rational way. And <b>when the judiciary mediates to allocate constitutional boundaries, it does not assert any superiority over the other departments; it does not in reality nullify or invalidate an act of the legislature, but only asserts the solemn and sacred obligation assigned to it by the Constitution to determine conflicting claims of authority under the Constitution and to establish for the parties in an actual controversy the rights which that instrument secures and guarantees to them</b>. This is in truth all that is involved in what is termed "judicial supremacy" which properly is the power of judicial review under the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> (Emphasis provided)</blockquote><br>This Court in <i>Angara,</i> however, expressed caution and a policy of hesitance in the exercise of judicial review. This Court was quick to point out that this power cannot be used to cause interference in the political processes by limiting the power of review in its refusal to pass upon “questions of wisdom, justice or expediency of legislation,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> thus:<br><br><blockquote>x x x <b>Even then, this power of judicial review is limited to actual cases and controversies to be exercised after full opportunity of argument by the parties, and limited further to the constitutional question raised or the very <i>lis mota</i> presented. Any attempt at abstraction could only lead to dialectics and barren legal questions and to sterile conclusions unrelated to actualities</b>. Narrowed as its function is in this manner, <b><u>the judiciary does not pass upon questions of wisdom, justice or expediency of legislation</u></b>. More than that, courts accord the presumption of constitutionality to legislative enactments, not only because the legislature is presumed to abide by the Constitution but also because the judiciary in the determination of actual cases and controversies must reflect the wisdom and justice of the people as expressed through their representatives in the executive and legislative departments of the government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></blockquote><br>What were questions of wisdom and questions of legality that would be within the purview of the courts were earlier explained in <i>Tañada v. Cuenco</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br><blockquote>As already adverted to, the objection to our jurisdiction hinges on the question whether the issue before us is political or not. In this connection, Willoughby lucidly states:<br><br><blockquote>Elsewhere in this treatise the well-known and well-established principle is considered that it is not within the province of the courts to pass judgment upon <i>the policy</i> of legislative or executive action. Where, therefore, <i>discretionary</i> powers are granted by the Constitution or by statute, the <i>manner</i> in which those powers are exercised is not subject to judicial review. The courts, therefore, concern themselves only with the question as to the <i>existence and extent of these discretionary powers.</i><br><br>As distinguished from the judicial, the legislative and executive departments are spoken of as the <i>political</i> departments of government because in very many cases their action is necessarily dictated by considerations of public or political policy. <i>These considerations of public or political policy of course will not permit the legislature to violate constitutional provisions, or the executive to exercise authority not granted him by the Constitution or by statute, but, within these limits</i>, they do permit the departments, separately or together, to<i> recognize that a certain set of facts exists or that a given status exists,</i> and these determinations, together with the consequences that flow therefrom, may not be traversed in the courts." (Willoughby on the Constitution of the United States, Vol. 3, p. 1326; Emphasis supplied)<br><br>x x x x<br></blockquote>It is not easy, however, to define the phrase 'political question,' nor to determine what matters fall within its scope. It is frequently used to designate all questions that lie outside the scope of the judicial questions, which under the Constitution, are to be decided <i>by the people in their sovereign capacity</i>, or in regard to which <i>full discretionary authority</i> has been delegated to the <i>legislative</i> or executive branch of the government. (16 C.J.S., 413; See also Geauga Lake Improvement Ass'n. vs. Lozier, 182 N. E. 491, 125 Ohio St. 565; Sevilla vs. Elizalde, 112 F. 2d 29, 72 App. D.

See State vs. Cunningham, 81 Wis. 497, 51 L. R. A. 561; In Re Gunn, 50 Kan. 155; 32 Pac. 470, 948, 19 L. R. A. 519; Green vs. Mills, 69 Fed. 852, 16, C. C. A. 516, 30 L. R.

St. Rep. 220. x x x.<br><br>In short, the phrase "political question" connotes, in legal parlance, what it means in ordinary parlance, namely, a question of policy. In other words, in the language of Corpus Juris Secundum (<i>supra</i>), it refers to "those questions which, under the Constitution, are to be <i>decided by the people</i> in their sovereign capacity, or in regard to which <i>full discretionary authority</i> has been delegated to the Legislature or executive branch of the Government." It is concerned with issues dependent upon the wisdom, not legality, of a particular measure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></blockquote><br>In <i>Casibang v.

Carr</i>:<br><br><blockquote>x x x The term "political question" connotes what it means in ordinary parlance, namely, a question of policy. It refers to those questions which under the Constitution, are to be decided by the people in their sovereign capacity; or in regard to which full discretionary authority has been delegated to the legislative or executive branch of the government. It is concerned with issues dependent upon the wisdom, not legality, of a particular measure" (Tañada vs. Cuenco, L-1052, Feb. 28, 1957). A broader definition was advanced by U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brennan in <i>Baker vs. Carr</i> (369 U.S. 186 [1962]): <b>"Prominent on the surface of any case held to involve a political question is found a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department; or a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it; or the impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for non-judicial discretion; or the impossibility of a court's undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of respect due coordinate branches of the government; or an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made; or the potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question" </b>(p. 217). And Chief Justice Enrique M. Fernando, then an Associate Justice of this Court, fixed the limits of the term, thus: "The term has been made applicable to controversies clearly non-judicial and therefore beyond its jurisdiction or to an issue involved in a case appropriately subject to its cognizance, as to which there has been a prior legislative or executive determination to which deference must be paid (Cf. Vera vs. Avelino, 77 Phil. 192 [1946]; Lopez vs. Roxas, L-25716, July 28, 1966, 17 SCRA 756; <i>Gonzales vs. Commission on Elections,</i> L-28196, Nov. 9, 1967, 21 SCRA 774). It has likewise been employed loosely to characterize a suit where the party proceeded against is the President or Congress, or any branch thereof (Cf. Planas vs. Gil, 67 Phil. 62 [1937]; <i>Vera vs. Avelino, </i>77 Phil. 192 [1946]). If to be delimited with accuracy; 'political questions’ should refer to such as would under the Constitution be decided by the people in their sovereign capacity or in regard to which full discretionary authority is vested either in the President or Congress. It is thus beyond the competence of the judiciary to pass upon. x x x."

B<br></center><br>With this background and from our experience during Martial Law, the members of the Constitutional Commission clarified the power of judicial review through the second paragraph of Section 1 of Article VIII of the Constitution. This provides:<br><br><blockquote>Judicial power includes the duty of courts of justice to settle actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable <b><i>and to determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the government.</i></b> (Emphasis provided)</blockquote><br>This addendum was borne out of the fear that the political question doctrine would continue to be used by courts to avoid resolving controversies involving acts of the Executive and Legislative branches of government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Hence, judicial power was expanded to include the review of <b><i>any</i></b> act of grave abuse of discretion on any branch or instrumentality of the government.<br><br>The Constitutional Commissioners were working with their then recent experiences in a regime of Martial Law. The examples that they had during the deliberations on the floor of the Constitutional Commission were naturally based on those experiences. It appears that they did not want a Court that had veto on any and all actions of the other departments of government. Certainly, the Constitutional Commissioners did not intend that this Court’s discretion substitutes for the political wisdom exercised within constitutional parameters. However, they wanted the power of judicial review to find its equilibrium further than unthinking deference to political acts. Judicial review extends to review political discretion that clearly breaches fundamental values and principles congealed in provisions of the Constitution.<br><br><center>III. C</center><br>Grave abuse of discretion, in the context of the second paragraph of Section 1 of Article VIII of the Constitution, has been described in various cases.<br><br>In <i>Tañada v.

Although the ratification of treaties was undoubtedly a political act on the part of Congress, this Court treated it as a justiciable issue.

Defensor Santiago v. Sen. Guingona, Jr.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> this Court was tasked to review the act of the Senate President. The assailed act was the Senate President's recognition of respondent as the minority leader despite the minority failing to arrive at a clear consensus during the caucus. This Court, while conceding that the Constitution does not provide for rules governing the election of majority and minority leaders in Congress, nevertheless ruled that the acts of its members are still subject to judicial review when done in grave abuse of discretion:<br><br><blockquote><b>While no provision of the Constitution or the laws or the rules and even the practice of the Senate was violated, and while the judiciary is without power to decide matters over which full discretionary authority has been lodged in the legislative department, this Court may still inquire whether an act of Congress or its officials has been made with grave abuse of discretion.</b> This is the plain implication of Section 1, Article VIII of the Constitution, which expressly confers upon the judiciary the power and the duty not only "to settle actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable," but likewise "to determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> (Emphasis provided)<br></blockquote><br><center>III. D<br></center><br>Post-EDSA, this Court has even on occasion found exceptional circumstances when the political question doctrine would not apply.<br><br>Thus, in <i>SANLAKAS v.

While this Court conceded that the case was mooted by the issuance of Proclamation No. 435, which declared that the state of rebellion ceased to exist, it still decided the case. This Court pointed out that the issue has yet to be decided definitively, as evidenced by the dismissal of this Court of previous cases involving the same issue due to mootness:<br><br><blockquote>Once before, the President on May 1, 2001 declared a state of rebellion and called upon the AFP and the PNP to suppress the rebellion through Proclamation No. 38 and General Order No. 1. On that occasion, “‘an angry and violent mob armed with explosives, firearms, bladed weapons, clubs, stones and other deadly weapons’ assaulted and attempted to break into Malacañang.” Petitions were filed before this Court assailing the validity of the President’s declaration. Five days after such declaration, however, the President lifted the same. The mootness of the petitions in<i> Lacson v. Perez </i>and accompanying cases precluded this Court from addressing the constitutionality of the declaration.<br><br><b>To prevent similar questions from reemerging, we seize this opportunity to finally lay to rest the validity of the declaration of a state of rebellion in the exercise of the President’s calling out power, the mootness of the petitions notwithstanding</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> (Emphasis provided, citations omitted)</blockquote><br>In <i>Funa v. Villar</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> a Petition was filed contesting the appointment of Reynaldo A. Villar as Chairman of the Commission on Audit. During the pendency of the case, Villar sent a letter to the President signifying his intention to step down from office upon the appointment of his replacement. Upon the appointment of the current Chairman, Ma. Gracia Pulido-Tan, the case became moot and academic. This Court, guided by the principles stated in <i>David v. Arroyo</i>, still gave due course to the Petition:<br><br><blockquote>Although deemed moot due to the intervening appointment of Chairman Tan and the resignation of Villar, We consider the instant case as falling within the requirements for review of a moot and academic case, since it asserts at least four exceptions to the mootness rule discussed in David, namely: there is a grave violation of the Constitution; the case involves a situation of exceptional character and is of paramount public interest; the constitutional issue raised requires the formulation of controlling principles to guide the bench, the bar and the public; and the case is capable of repetition yet evading review. The situation presently obtaining is definitely of such exceptional nature as to necessarily call for the promulgation of principles that will henceforth “guide the bench, the bar and the public” should like circumstance arise. Confusion in similar future situations would be smoothed out if the contentious issues advanced in the instant case are resolved straightaway and settled definitely. There are times when although the dispute has disappeared, as in this case, it nevertheless cries out to be addressed. To borrow from <i>Javier v. Pacificador</i>, “Justice demands that we act then, not only for the vindication of the outraged right, though gone, but also for the guidance of and as a restraint in the future.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote><br><center>III. E<br></center><br>Thus, the addendum in the characterization of the power of judicial review should not be seen as a full and blanket reversal of the policy of caution and courtesy embedded in the concept of political questions. It assumes that the act or acts complained of would appear initially to have been done within the powers delegated to the respondents. However, upon perusal or evaluation of its consequences, it may be shown that there are violations of law or provisions of the Constitution.<br><br>The use of the Priority Development Assistance Fund or the “pork barrel” itself is questioned. It is not the act of a few but the practice of members of Congress and the President. The current Priority Development Assistance Fund amounts to twenty four (24) billion pesos; the alternative uses of this amount have great impact. Its wastage also will have lasting effects. To get a sense of its magnitude, we can compare it with the proposed budgetary allocation for the entire Judiciary. All courts get a collective budget that is about eighteen (18) billion pesos. The whole system of adjudication is dwarfed by a system that allocates funds for unclear political motives.<br><br>The concepts of accountability and separation of powers are fundamental values in our constitutional democracy. The effect of the use of the Priority Development Assistance Fund can have repercussions on these principles. Yet, it is difficult to discover anomalies if any. It took the Commission on Audit some time to make its special report for a period ending in 2009. It is difficult to expect such detail from ordinary citizens who wish to avail their rights as taxpayers. Clearly, had it not been for reports in both mainstream and social media, the public would not have been made aware of the magnitude.<br><br>What the present Petitions present is an opportune occasion to exercise the expanded power of judicial review. Due course should be given because these Petitions suggest a case where (a) there may be indications that there are pervasive breaches of the Constitution; (b) there is no doubt that there is a large and lasting impact on our societies; (c) what are at stake are fundamental values of our constitutional order; (d) there are obstacles to timely discovering facts which would serve as basis for regular constitutional challenges; and (e) the conditions are such that any delay in our resolution of the case to await action by the political branches will not entirely address the violations. With respect to the latter, our Decision will prevent the repetition of the same acts which have been historically shown to be “capable of repetition” and yet “evading review.” Our Decision today will also provide guidance for bench and bar.<br><br><center>IV<br></center><br>Respondents also argued that we should continue to respect our precedents.

Thus, in Article VI, Section 24:<br><br><blockquote>All appropriation, revenue or tariff bills, bills authorizing increase of the public debt, bills of local application, and private bills, shall originate exclusively in the House of Representatives, but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments.<br></blockquote><br>Thereafter, the General Appropriations Bill is considered by Congress in three readings like other pieces of legislation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> Should it become necessary, a bicameral committee is convened to harmonize the differences in the Third Reading copies of each Legislative chamber.

The President, in addition to a full approval or veto, is granted the power of an item veto.

Thus,<br><br><blockquote>We distinguish an item from a provision in the following manner:<br><br>The terms <i>item </i>and <i>provision</i> in budgetary legislations are concededly different. An item in a bill refers to the particulars, the details, the distinct and severable parts x x x of the bill. It is an indivisible sum of money dedicated to a stated purpose. The United States Supreme Court, in the case of <i>Bengzon v.

Also to be included in the category of "inappropriate provisions" are unconstitutional provisions and provisions which are intended to amend other laws, because clearly these kinds of laws have no place in an appropriations bill. These are matters of general legislation more appropriately dealt with in separate enactments. Former Justice Irene Cortes, as Amicus Curiae, commented that Congress cannot by law establish conditions for and regulate the exercise of powers of the President given by the Constitution for that would be an unconstitutional intrusion into executive prerogative.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br></blockquote><br><center>V.

It should assist elected representatives to discern the plans, programs, and projects that work and do not work.<br><br>Evaluating the spending of every agency in government requires that the Legislature is able to exact accountability. Not only must it determine whether the expenditures were efficient.

The equal allocation among members of the House of Representatives and more so among Senators shows the true color of the Priority Development Assistance Fund. It is to give a lump sum for each member of the House of Representatives and the Senate for them to spend on projects of their own choosing. This is usually for any purpose whether among their constituents and whether for the present or future.<br><br><b><i>In short, the Priority Development Assistance Fund is an appropriation for each Member of the House of Representative and each Senator.<br></i></b><br>This is why this item in the General Appropriations Act of 2013 is an invalid appropriation.

In such a case, the item facilitates an unconstitutional delegation of the power to authorize a budget. Instead of Congress acting collectively with its elected representatives deciding on the magnitude of the amounts for spending, it will be the officer who either recommends or spends who decides what the budget will be.<br><br>This is not what is meant when the Constitution provides that “no money shall be paid out of the Treasury except in pursuance of an appropriation made by law.” When no discernible purpose is defined in the law, money is paid out for a public official and not in pursuance of an appropriation.<br><br>This is exactly the nature of the Priority Development Assistance Fund.<br><br>Seventy million pesos of taxpayers’ money is appropriated for each member of the House of Representatives while two hundred million pesos is authorized for each Senator. The purpose is not discernible. The menu of options does not relate to each other in order to reveal a discernible purpose. Each legislator chooses the amounts that will be spent as well as the projects. The projects may not relate to each other. They will not be the subject of a purposive spending program envisioned to create a result. It is a kitty — a mini-budget — allowed to each legislator.<br><br>That each legislator has his or her own mini-budget makes the situation worse. Again, those who should check on the expenditures of all offices of government are compromised. They will not have the high moral ground to exact efficiency when there is none that can be evaluated from their allocation under the Priority Development Assistance Fund.<br><br>Purposes can be achieved through various programmed spending or through a series of related projects. In some instances, like in the provision of farm to market roads, the purpose must be specific enough to mention where the road will be built. Funding for the Climate Change Commission can be in lump sums as it could be expected that its expenditures would be dependent on the proper activities that should be done in the next fiscal year and within the powers and purposes that the Commission has in its enabling charter. In other instances, like for calamity funds, the amounts will be huge and the purpose cannot be more general than for expenses that may have to be done in cases of calamities.<br><br>Parenthetically, the provision of Various Infrastructure and Local Projects in the Department of Public Works and Highways title of the 2013 General Appropriations Act is also a clear example of an invalid appropriation.<br><br>In some instances, the purpose of the funding may be general because it is a requirement of either constitutional or statutory autonomy. Thus, the ideal would be that this Court would have just one item with a bulk amount with the expenditures to be determined by this Court’s En Banc. State universities and colleges may have just one lump sum for their institutions because the purposes for which they have been established are already provided in their charter.<br><br>While I agree generally with the view of the ponencia that “an item of appropriation must be an item characterized by a singular correspondence — meaning an allocation of a specified singular amount for a specified singular purpose,” our opinions on the generality of the stated purpose should be limited only to the Priority Development Assistance Fund as it is now in the 2013 General Appropriations Act. The agreement seems to be that the item has no discernible purpose. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup><br><br>There may be no need, for now, to go as detailed as to discuss the fine line between “line” and “lump sum” budgeting. A reading of the ponencia and the Concurring Opinions raises valid considerations about line and lump sum items. However, it is a discussion which should be clarified further in a more appropriate case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup><br><br>Our doctrine on unlawful delegation of legislative power does not fully square in cases of appropriations. Budgets are integral parts of plans of action. There are various ways by which a plan can be generated and fully understood by those who are to implement it. There are also many requirements for those who implement such plans to adjust to given realities which are not available through foresight.<br><br>The Constitution should not be read as a shackle that bounds creativity too restrictively. Rather, it should be seen as a framework within which a lot of leeway is given to those who have to deal with the fundamental vagaries of budget implementation. What it requires is an appropriation for a discernable purpose. The Priority Development Assistance Fund fails this requirement.<br><br><center>VI<br></center><br>The Constitution in Article VI, Section 29 (3) provides for another type of appropriations act, thus:<br><br><blockquote>All money collected on any tax levied for a special purpose shall be treated as a special fund and paid out for such purpose only. If the purpose for which a special fund was created has been fulfilled or abandoned, the balance, if any, shall be transferred to the general funds of the government.</blockquote><br>This provision provides the basis for special laws that create special funds and to this extent qualifies my concurrence with the ponencia’s result in so far as Section 8 of Presidential Decree No. 910 is concerned. This provision states:<br><br><blockquote>x x x All fees, revenues, and receipts of the Board from any and all sources including receipts from service contracts and agreements such as application and processing fees, signature bonus, discovery bonus, production bonus; all money collected from concessionaires, representing unspent work obligations, fines and penalties under the Petroleum Act of 1949; as well as the government share representing royalties, rentals, production share on service contracts and similar payments on the exploration, development and exploitation of energy resources, shall form part of a Special Fund to be used to finance energy resource development and exploitation programs and projects of the government <b><i><u>and for such other purposes as may be hereafter directed by the President. </u></i></b>(Emphasis provided)</blockquote><br>It is true that it may be the current administration’s view that the underscored provision should be read in relation to the specific purposes enumerated before it. However, there is no proscription to textually view it in any other way. Besides, there should have been no reason to provide this phrase had the intent of the law been as how the current administration reads and applies it.<br><br>As has been the practice in the past administration, monies coming from this special provision have been used for various purposes which do not in any way relate to “the energy resource development and exploitation programs and projects of the government.” Some of these expenditures are embodied in Administrative Order No. 244 dated October 23, 2008;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> and Executive Orders 254, 254-A, and 405 dated December 8, 2003, March 3, 2004, and February 1, 2005, respectively.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup><br><br>The phrase “for such other purposes as may hereafter directed by the President” has, thus, been read as all the infinite possibilities of any project or program. <i><b>Since it prescribes all, it prescribes none</b></i>.<br><br>Thus, I concur with the <i>ponencia</i> in treating this portion of Section 8, Presidential Decree No. 910, which allows the expenditures of that special fund “for other purposes as may be hereafter directed by the President,” as null and void.<br><br>The same vice infects a portion of the law providing for a Presidential Social Fund.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup> Section 12 of Presidential Decree No. 1869 as amended by Presidential Decree No. 1993 provides that the fund may be used “to finance the priority infrastructure projects and to finance the restoration of damaged or destroyed facilities due to calamities, as may be directed and authorized by the Office of the President of the Philippines.”<br><br>Two uses are contemplated by the provision: one, to finance “priority infrastructure projects,” and two, to provide the Executive with flexibility in times of calamities.<br><br>I agree that “priority infrastructure projects” may be too broad so as to actually encompass everything else. The questions that readily come to mind are which kinds of infrastructure projects are not covered and what kinds of parameters will be used to determine the priorities. These are not textually discoverable, and therefore, allow an incumbent to have broad leeway. This amounts to an unconstitutional delegation of the determination of the purpose for which the special levies resulting in the creation of the special fund. This certainly was not contemplated by Article VI, Section 29(3) of the Constitution.<br><br>I regret, however, that I cannot join Justice Brion in his view that even the phrase “to be used to finance energy resource development and exploitation programs and projects of the government” in Section 8 of Presidential Decree No. 910 is too broad. This is even granting that this phrase is likewise qualified with “as may be hereafter determined by the President.”<br><br>The kinds of projects relating to energy resource development and exploitation are determinable. There are obvious activities that do not square with this intent, for instance, expenditures solely for agriculture. The extent of latitude that the President is given is also commensurate with the importance of the energy sector itself. Energy is fundamental for the functioning of government as well as the private sector. It is essential to power all projects whether commercial or for the public interest. The formulation, thus, reasonably communicates discretion but puts it within reasonable bounds. In my view, and with due respect to the opinion of Justice Brion, the challenge of this phrase’s unconstitutionality lacks the clarity that should compel us to strike it down.<br><br><center>VII<br></center><br>A member of the House of Representatives or a Senator is not an automated teller machine or ATM from which the public could withdraw funds for sundry private purposes. They should be honorable elected officials tasked with having a longer and broader view. Their role is to use their experience and their understanding of their constituents to craft policy articulated in laws. Congress is entrusted to work with political foresight.<br><br>Congress, as a whole, checks the spending of the President as it goes through the annual exercise of deciding what to authorize in the budget. A level of independence and maturity is required in relation to the passage of laws requested by the Executive. Poverty and inefficiencies in government are the result of lack of accountability. Accountability should no longer be compromised.<br><br>Pork barrel funds historically encourage dole-outs. It inculcates a perverse understanding of representative democracy. It encourages a culture that misunderstands the important function of public representation in Congress. It does not truly empower those who are impoverished or found in the margins of our society.<br><br>There are better, more lasting and systematic ways to help our people survive. A better kind of democracy should not be the ideal. It should be the norm.<br><br>We listen to our people as we read the Constitution. We watch as others do their part and are willing to do more. We note the public’s message:<br><br>Politics should not be as it was. Eradicate greed. Exact accountability. Build a government that has a collective passion for real social justice.<br><br>ACCORDINGLY, I vote to <b>GRANT</b> the Petitions and <b>DECLARE</b> Title XLIV of the General Appropriations Act of 2013 <b>UNCONSTITUTIONAL</b>.
