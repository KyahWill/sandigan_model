				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This Court has long held that “[the] administration of justice is circumscribed with a heavy burden of responsibility. It requires that everyone involved in its dispensation — from the presiding judge to the lowliest clerk — live up to the strictest standards of competence, honesty, and integrity in the public service.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br><center><b>THE CASE</b></center><br>This is an administrative case that stemmed from the 6 July 2007 Memorandum of the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> The judicial audit team created by the OCA reported alleged irregularities in the solemnization of marriages in several branches of the Municipal Trial Court in Cities (MTCC) and Regional Trial Court (RTC) in Cebu City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Certain package fees were offered to interested parties by “fixers” or “facilitators” for instant marriages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br><center><b>THE FACTS</b><br></center><br>On 3 July 2007, Atty. Rullyn Garcia, Region 7 Judicial Supervisor, proceeded to Cebu City and headed the audit team created by OCA in investigating Branches 2, 3, 4, and 8 of the MTCC in Cebu City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> A female and male lawyer of the audit team went undercover as a couple looking to get married. They went to the Palace of Justice and were directed by the guard on duty to go to Branch 4 and look for a certain “Meloy”. The male lawyer feared that he would be recognized by other court personnel, specifically the Clerk of Court of Branch 4 who was a former law school classmate. The two lawyers then agreed that only the female lawyer would go inside and inquire about the marriage application process. Inside Branch 4, a woman named Helen approached and assisted the female lawyer. When the female lawyer asked if the marriage process could be rushed, Helen assured the lawyer that the marriage could be solemnized the next day, but the marriage certificate would only be dated the day the marriage license becomes available. Helen also guaranteed the regularity of the process for a fee of three thousand pesos (P3,000) only.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>In its 10 July 2007 Resolution, this Court treated the Memorandum dated 6 July 2007 of the judicial audit team as a formal administrative complaint and directed Judge Anatalio S.

Meloy asked for a fee of one thousand five hundred pesos (P1,500). According to Baguio-Manera, their marriage certificate was marked as “No marriage license was necessary, the marriage being solemnized under Art. 34 of Executive Order No. 209”. Their marriage was solemnized that day by Judge Rosabella M. Tormis. Baguio-Manera claimed that they did not understand what that statement meant at that time. However, in her affidavit, she declared that the situation premised under Article 34 did not apply to her and her fiancé.<br><br>Mary Anne Flores-Patoc was a resident of Barrio Luz, Cebu City. In her 5 July 2007 affidavit, she recounted how she and her boyfriend went to the Provincial Capitol to get married in February 2006. While logging in at the entrance, they were offered assistance by the guards for a fee of one thousand five hundred pesos (P1,500). The guard also offered to become “Ninong” or a witness to the wedding.

Acosta argues that the law only requires a marriage license and that he is not required to inquire whether the license was obtained from a location where one of the parties is an actual resident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> The judge believes that it is not his duty to verify the signature on the marriage license to determine its authenticity because he relies on the presumption of regularity of public documents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> The judge also outlines his own procedure in solemnizing marriages which involves: first, the determination whether the solemnization fee was paid; second, the presentation of the affidavit of cohabitation and birth certificates to ascertain identity and age of the parties; third, if one of the parties is a foreigner, the judge asks for a certificate of legal capacity to marry, passport picture, date of arrival, and divorce papers when the party is divorced; fourth, he then asks the parties and their witnesses questions regarding cohabitation and interviews the children of the parties, if any.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Judge Rosabella M. Tormis denies the charges brought by the OCA. She calls the actions of the judicial audit team during the investigation an “entrapment”.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> She also claims that there is nothing wrong with solemnizing marriages on the date of the issuance of the marriage license and with the fact that the issued marriage license was obtained from a place where neither of the parties resided.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> As to the pro forma affidavits of cohabitation, she argues that she cannot be faulted for accepting it as genuine as she and the other judges are not handwriting experts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> The affidavits also enjoy the presumption of regularity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Judge Tormis also discredits the affidavit of Baguio-Manera as hearsay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> The respondent said that when Baguio-Manera and her husband were confronted with the affidavit they executed, they affirmed the veracity of the statements, particularly the fact that they have been living together for five years.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> The judge also attributes the irregularity in the number of marriages solemnized in her sala to the filing clerks.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>Judge Edgemelo C.

He states that marriage certificates are required with the marriage license attached or the affidavit of cohabitation only and the other documents fall under the responsibility of the local civil registrar. He surmises that if the marriage certificate did not come with the marriage license or affidavit of cohabitation, the missing document might have been inadvertently detached, and it can be checked with the proper local civil registrar. As to the payment of the docket fee, he contends that it should be paid after the solemnization of the marriage and not before because judges will be pre-empted from ascertaining the qualifications of the couple. Besides, the task of collecting the fee belongs to the Clerk of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> The judge also argues that solemnization of marriage is not a judicial duty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>On 12 November 2007, Judges Tormis and Rosales filed a Memorandum of Law with Plea for Early Resolution, Lifting of Suspension and Dismissal of Case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> This Court in a Resolution dated 11 December 2007 lifted the suspension of the respondent judges but prohibited them from solemnizing marriages until further ordered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>On 7 December 2007, Judges Tormis and Rosales filed a Motion for Early Resolution with Waiver of Formal and/or Further Investigation and Motion to Dismiss.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> In a Resolution dated 15 January 2008, the Court noted the motion and granted the prayer of Judges Tormis and Rosales for the payment of their unpaid salaries, allowances and all other economic benefits from 9 July 2007.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br><center><b>THE REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE OCA</b></center><br>In its Memorandum dated 15 June 2010,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> the OCA recommended the dismissal of the respondent judges and some court employees, and the suspension or admonition of others.

Most of these documents showed visible signs of tampering, erasures, corrections or superimpositions of entries related to the parties’ place of residence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup> These included indistinguishable features such as the font, font size, and ink of the computer-printed entries in the marriage certificate and marriage license.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup> These actions of the respondent judges constitute gross inefficiency. In <i>Vega v. Asdala,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup>the Court held that inefficiency implies negligence, incompetence, ignorance, and carelessness.<br><br>Second, the judges were also found guilty of neglect of duty regarding the payment of solemnization fees. The Court, in <i>Rodrigo-Ebron v. Adolfo,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> defined neglect of duty as the failure to give one’s attention to a task expected of him and it is gross when, from the gravity of the offense or the frequency of instances, the offense is so serious in its character as to endanger or threaten public welfare. The marriage documents examined by the audit team show that corresponding official receipts for the solemnization fee were missing<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup> or payment by batches was made for marriages performed on different dates.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup> The OCA emphasizes that the payment of the solemnization fee starts off the whole marriage application process and even puts a “stamp of regularity” on the process.<br><br>Third, Judges Necessario, Tormis, and Rosales also solemnized marriages where a contracting party is a foreigner who did not submit a certificate of legal capacity to marry from his or her embassy. What the foreigners submitted were mere affidavits stating their capacity to marry. The irregularity in the certificates of legal capacity that are required under Article 21 of the Family Code<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup> displayed the gross neglect of duty of the judges. They should have been diligent in scrutinizing the documents required for the marriage license issuance. Any irregularities would have been prevented in the qualifications of parties to contract marriage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup><br><br>Fourth, Judges Necessario, Acosta, and Tormis are likewise guilty of gross ignorance of the law under Article 34 of the Family Code<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup> with respect to the marriages they solemnized where legal impediments existed during cohabitation such as the minority status of one party.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup> The audit team cites in their Supplemental Report that there were parties whose ages ranged from eighteen (18) to twenty-two (22) years old who were married by mere submission of a pro forma joint affidavit of cohabitation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[121]</sup>These affidavits were notarized by the solemnizing judge himself or herself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup><br><br>Finally, positive testimonies were also given regarding the solemnization of marriages of some couples where no marriage license was previously issued. The contracting parties were made to fill up the application for a license on the same day the marriage was solemnized.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup><br><br>The Court does not accept the arguments of the respondent judges that the ascertainment of the validity of the marriage license is beyond the scope of the duty of a solemnizing officer especially when there are glaring pieces of evidence that point to the contrary. As correctly observed by the OCA, the presumption of regularity accorded to a marriage license disappears the moment the marriage documents do not appear regular on its face.<br><br>In <i>People v. Jansen,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[124]</sup> this Court held that:<br><br><blockquote>…the solemnizing officer is not duty-bound to investigate whether or not a marriage license has been duly and regularly issued by the local civil registrar. All the solemnizing officer needs to know is that the license has been issued by the competent official, and it may be presumed from the issuance of the license that said official has fulfilled the duty to ascertain whether the contracting parties had fulfilled the requirements of law.</blockquote><br>However, this Court also said in <span style="font-style: italic;">Sevilla v. Cardenas</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[125]</sup> that “the presumption of regularity of official acts may be rebutted by affirmative evidence of irregularity or failure to perform a duty.” The visible superimpositions on the marriage licenses should have alerted the solemnizing judges to the irregularity of the issuance.<br><br>It follows also that although Article 21 of the Family Code requires the submission of the certificate from the embassy of the foreign party to the local registrar for acquiring a marriage license, the judges should have been more diligent in reviewing the parties’ documents and qualifications. As noted by the OCA, the absence of the required certificates coupled with the presence of mere affidavits should have aroused suspicion as to the regularity of the marriage license issuance.<br><br>The judges’ gross ignorance of the law is also evident when they solemnized marriages under Article 34 of the Family Code without the required qualifications and with the existence of legal impediments such as minority of a party. Marriages of exceptional character such as those made under Article 34 are, doubtless, the exceptions to the rule on the indispensability of the formal requisite of a marriage license.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[126]</sup> Under the rules of statutory construction, exceptions as a general rule should be strictly but reasonably construed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[127]&nbsp; </sup>The affidavits of cohabitation should not be issued and accepted pro forma particularly in view of the settled rulings of the Court on this matter. The five-year period of cohabitation should be one of a perfect union valid under the law but rendered imperfect only by the absence of the marriage contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[128]</sup> The parties should have been capacitated to marry each other during the entire period and not only at the time of the marriage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[129]</sup><br><br>To elaborate further on the gravity of the acts and omissions of the respondents, the Family Code provides the requisites for a valid marriage:<br><br><blockquote>Art. 3. The formal requisites of marriage are:<br><br>(1) Authority of the solemnizing officer;<br>(2) A valid marriage license except in the cases provided for in Chapter 2 of this Title; and<br>(3) A marriage ceremony which takes place with the appearance of the contracting parties before the solemnizing officer and their personal declaration that they take each other as husband and wife in the presence of not less than two witnesses of legal age. (53a, 55a)<br><br>Art. 4. The absence of any of the essential or formal requisites shall render the marriage void <span style="font-style: italic;">ab initio,</span> except as stated in Article 35 (2).<br><br>A defect in any of the essential requisites shall not affect the validity of the marriage but the party or parties responsible for the irregularity shall be civilly, criminally and administratively liable. (n)</blockquote><br>The absence of a marriage license will clearly render a marriage void<span style="font-style: italic;"> ab initio</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[130]</sup> The actions of the judges have raised a very alarming issue regarding the validity of the marriages they solemnized since they did not follow the proper procedure or check the required documents and qualifications. In <i>Aranes v. Judge Salvador Occiano,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[131]</sup> the Court said that a marriage solemnized without a marriage license is void and the subsequent issuance of the license cannot render valid or add even an iota of validity to the marriage. It is the marriage license that gives the solemnizing officer the authority to solemnize a marriage and the act of solemnizing the marriage without a license constitutes gross ignorance of the law.<br><br>As held by this <i>Court in Navarro v. Domagtoy</i>:<br><br><blockquote>The judiciary should be composed of persons who, if not experts are at least proficient in the law they are sworn to apply, more than the ordinary layman. They should be skilled and competent in understanding and applying the law. It is imperative that they be conversant with basic legal principles like the ones involved in the instant case. It is not too much to expect them to know and apply the law intelligently.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[132]</sup></blockquote><br>It is important to note that the audit team found out that Judge Rosabella M. Tormis ordered Celerina Plaza, a personal employee of the judge, to wait for couples outside the Hall of Justice and offer services.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[133]</sup> Crisanto Dela Cerna also stated in his affidavit that Judge Tormis instructed him to get all marriage certificates and bring them to her house when she found out about the judicial audit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[134]</sup> In the language of the OCA, Judge Tormis considered the solemnization of marriages not as a duty but as a business.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[135]</sup> The respondent judge was suspended for six (6) months in A.M. No. MTJ-071-962 for repeatedly disregarding the directives of this Court to furnish the complainant a copy of her comment. She was also fined the amount of five thousand pesos (P5,000) in A.M.

No. MTJ-12-1817, promulgated last 12 March 2013, Judge Tormis was found guilty of gross inefficiency, violation of Supreme Court rules, directives and circulars and gross ignorance of the law by this Court. She was dismissed from service, with forfeiture of all benefits and privileges, except accrued leave credits, if any, with prejudice to reemployment in any branch or instrumentality of the government, including government-owned or controlled corporations.<br><br>The respondent judges violated Canons 2<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[138]</sup> and 6<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[139]</sup> of the Canons of Judicial Ethics which exact competence, integrity and probity in the performance of their duties. This Court previously said that “Ignorance of the law is a mark of incompetence, and where the law involved is elementary, ignorance thereof is considered as an indication of lack of integrity.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[140]</sup> In connection with this, the administration of justice is considered a sacred task and upon assumption to office, a judge ceases to be an ordinary mortal. He or she becomes the visible representation of the law and more importantly of justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[141]</sup><br><br>The actuations of these judges are not only condemnable, it is outright shameful.<br><br><b><i>Liability of Other Court Personnel</i></b><br><br>The Court agrees with the recommendations of the OCA on the liability of the following employees:<br><br>Helen Mongaya, Court Interpreter of Judge Rosabella M. Tormis, MTCC, Branch 4, Cebu City, is guilty of grave misconduct when she informed the female lawyer of the judicial audit team that she can facilitate the marriage and the requirements on the same day of the lawyer’s visit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[142]</sup> What Monggaya was proposing was an open-dated marriage in exchange for a fee of P3,000. Section 2, Canon I of the Code of Conduct for Court Personnel prohibits court personnel from soliciting or accepting gifts, favor or benefit based on any explicit or implicit understanding that such gift, favor or benefit shall influence their official actions.<br><br>Mongaya’s claim that she was merely relating to the lady lawyer what she knew from other offices as the usual practice<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[143]</sup> is inexcusable. As found by the OCA in its Memorandum, “Monggaya deliberately gave false information for the purpose of perpetrating an illegal scheme. This, in itself, constitutes grave misconduct.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[144]</sup> Sec. 52, Rule IV of the Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service defines grave misconduct as “a grave offense that carries the extreme penalty of dismissal from the service even on a first offense.<br><br>In <i>Villaceran v. Rosete,</i> this Court held that:<br><br><blockquote>Court personnel, from the lowliest employee, are involved in the dispensation of justice; parties seeking redress from the courts for grievances look upon court personnel, irrespective of rank or position, as part of the Judiciary. In performing their duties and responsibilities, these court personnel serve as sentinels of justice and any act of impropriety on their part immeasurably affects the honor and dignity of the Judiciary and the people’s trust and confidence in this institution. Therefore, they are expected to act and behave in a manner that should uphold the honor and dignity of the Judiciary, if only to maintain the people's confidence in the Judiciary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[145]</sup></blockquote><br>Mongaya acted improperly and in a manner opposite of what is expected of court personnel. Her actions placed doubts on the integrity of the courts.<br><br>Rhona Rodriguez, Administrative Officer I of the Office of the Clerk of Court of the MTCC, Cebu City, is guilty of gross misconduct. She assisted the couple, Moreil Sebial and Maricel Albater, and demanded and accepted P4,000 from them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[146]</sup> The act was a violation of Section 2, Canon I of the Code of Conduct for Court Personnel. As found by the OCA and adopted by this Court, Rodriguez induced Albater to falsify the application for marriage license by instructing her to indicate her residence as Barili, Cebu.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[147]</sup> The claim that she gave the amount to a certain Borces who was allegedly the real facilitator belies her participation in facilitating the marriage. According to the OCA, when the couple went back for their marriage certificate, they approached Rodriguez and not Borces.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[148]</sup> When Borces told Rodriguez that the marriage certificate had been misplaced, it was Rodriguez who instructed Sebial to fill up another marriage certificate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[149]</sup><br><br>This Court has held that improper solicitations prohibited by Section 2, Canon I of the Code of Conduct for Court Personnel, merits a grave penalty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[150]</sup> Such penalty can be dismissal from service.<br><br>Desiderio Aranas, Branch 3 Process Server, MTCC, Cebu City and Rebecca Alesna are guilty of conduct prejudicial to the best of interest of the service. Aranas provided couples who were to be married under Article 34 of the Family Code with the required affidavit of cohabitation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[151]</sup> On the other hand, Alesna refers such couples to Aranas to acquire the said affidavit which according to Alesna costs P10. As aptly put by the OCA, even if the amount involved in the transaction is minimal, the act of soliciting money still gives the public the wrong impression that court personnel are making money out of judicial transactions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[152]</sup><br><br>The Court said in <i>Roque v. Grimaldo</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[153]</sup> that acts of court personnel outside their official functions constitute conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service because these acts violate what is prescribed for court personnel. The purpose of this is to maintain the integrity of the Court and free court personnel from suspicion of any misconduct.<br><br>Celeste P. Retuya, Clerk III of Branch 6 of the MTCC, Cebu City, Emma Valencia, Stenographer III of Branch 18, RTC, Cebu City, and Rebecca Alesna, Court Interpreter of Branch 1, MTCC, Cebu City, admitted to the audit team that they received food from couples they assisted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[154]</sup> This is in violation of Section 2(b), Canon III of the Code of Conduct for Court Personnel which prohibits court personnel from receiving tips or other remuneration for assisting or attending to parties engaged in transactions or involved in actions or proceedings with the Judiciary. As recommended by the OCA, they are admonished considering that this is their first offense and the tips were of minimal value. In <i>Reyes-Domingo v. Morales,</i> this Court held that commission of an administrative offense for the first time is an extenuating circumstance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[155]</sup><br><br>The Court finds that there is insufficient evidence against Corazon P.

The OCA reports that Corazon Retuya admitted initially that she received P5,000 from spouses Ichiro Kamiaya and Mary Grace Gabiana to secure necessary documents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[156]</sup> The information was volunteered by Corazon Retuya with no supporting sworn statement from the couple. However, she denies this fact later on in her Comment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[157]</sup> Finding the earlier statement of Corazon Retuya as unclear and lacking support from evidence, the Court adopts the findings of the OCA and decides to give her the benefit of the doubt.<br><br>The Court also finds insufficient evidence to support the claims against Marilou Cabañez. Cabañez was only implicated in this case through the sworn statement of Jacqui Lou Baguio-Manera who attested that they paid a certain “Meloy” P1,200 for the wedding under Article 34 of the Family through the assistance of Cabañez.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[158]</sup> Cabañez denies that she was the one who assisted the couple and explained that it may have been Celerina Plaza, the personal assistant of Judge Rosabella M.

Baguio-Manera got the nickname “Meloy” not from Cabañez herself but from Baguio-Manera’s younger sister.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[159]</sup> When Baguio-Manera met the said “Meloy” at the Hall of Justice, she did not obtain confirmation that the said “Meloy” is Cabañez. The Court adopts the findings of the OCA that there is lack of positive identification of Cabañez and finds merit in her denial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[160]</sup><br><br>The Court accepts the recommendation of the OCA as to the dismissal of the case against Judge Geraldine Faith A.
