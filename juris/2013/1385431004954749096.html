Tañada not a nuisance candidate.<br><br><center><b>The Facts</b></center><br>Petitioner Wigberto R. Tañada, Jr., (Wigberto) and respondents Angelina D. Tan (Angelina) and Alvin John S. Tañada (Alvin John) were contenders for the position of Member of the House of Representatives for the 4<sup>th</sup> District of Quezon Province in the just concluded May 13, 2013 National Elections.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Wigberto ran under the banner of the Liberal Party; Alvin John was the official congressional candidate of Lapiang Manggagawa; while Angelina was fielded by the National People’s Coalition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>On October 10, 2012, Wigberto filed before the COMELEC two separate petitions: first, to cancel Alvin John’s CoC;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> and, second, to declare him as a nuisance candidate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> The said petitions were docketed as SPA Nos. 13-056 (DC) and 13-057 (DC), respectively.<br><br>In a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> dated January 29, 2013, the COMELEC First Division dismissed both petitions for lack of merit. On Wigberto’s motion for reconsideration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> the COMELEC <i>En Banc</i>, in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> dated April 25, 2013, upheld the COMELEC First Division’s ruling in SPA No. 13-057 (DC) that Alvin John was not a nuisance candidate as defined under Section 69<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> of Batas Pambansa Bilang 881, as amended, otherwise known as the “Omnibus Election Code of the Philippines” (OEC).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> However, in SPA No. 13-056 (DC), it granted the motion for reconsideration and cancelled Alvin John’s CoC for having committed false material representations concerning his residency in accordance with Section 78<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> of the OEC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>On May 15, 2013, Wigberto filed a 2<sup>nd</sup> Motion for Partial Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> of the COMELEC <i>En Banc’s</i> ruling in SPA No. 13-057 (DC) on the ground of newly discovered evidence. He alleged that Alvin John’s candidacy was not <i>bona fide</i> because: (<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>) Alvin John was merely forced by his father to file his CoC; (<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) he had no election paraphernalia posted in official COMELEC posting areas in several barangays of Gumaca, Quezon Province; (<span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>) he did not even vote during the May 13, 2013 National Elections; and (<span style="font-style: italic;">d</span>) his legal representation appeared to have been in collusion with the lawyers of Angelina.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>On May 15 and 16, 2013, Wigberto filed with the COMELEC <i>En Banc</i> an Extremely Urgent Motion to Admit Additional and Newly Discovered Evidence and to Urgently Resolve Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> and an Urgent Manifestation and Supplemental<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> thereto. These motions, however, remained un-acted upon until the filing of the present petition before the Court on May 27, 2013. Thus, in order to avoid charges of forum-shopping, said motions were withdrawn by Wigberto.<br><br>In a related development, despite the cancellation of Alvin John’s CoC due to his material misrepresentations therein, his name was not deleted from – and thus, remained printed on – the ballot, prompting Wigberto to file a motion<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> with the Provincial Board of Canvassers of Quezon Province (PBOC) asking that the votes cast in the name of Alvin John be credited to him instead in accordance with the Court’s ruling in <i>Dela Cruz v. COMELEC</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> and COMELEC Resolution No. 9599.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> The PBOC, however, denied Wigberto’s motion in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> dated May 16, 2013, holding that the votes of Alvin John could not be counted in favor of Wigberto because the cancellation of the former’s CoC was on the basis of his material misrepresentations under Section 78 of the OEC and not on being a nuisance candidate under Section 69 of the same law. Consequently, the PBOC canvassed the votes of all three contenders separately, and thereafter, on May 16, 2013, proclaimed Angelina as the winning candidate for the position of Member of the House of Representatives for the 4<sup>th</sup> District of Quezon Province.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> According to Wigberto, it was for the foregoing reason that he impleaded Angelina as a party-respondent in the instant petition for <i>certiorari</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>It appears, however, that Wigberto had already filed with the COMELEC a Petition to Annul the Proclamation of Angelina (Petition to Annul) under SPC No. 13-013, asserting that had the PBOC followed pertinent rulings,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> the votes cast for Alvin John would have been counted in his favor which could have resulted in his victory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> While the Petition to Annul was still pending resolution, Wigberto initiated the instant <i>certiorari</i> case against the COMELEC <i>En Banc</i> Resolution dated April 25, 2013 declaring Alvin John not a nuisance candidate.<br><br>On July 3, 2013, Wigberto filed a Manifestation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> informing the Court that he had caused the filing of an Election Protest <i>Ad Cautelam </i>entitled <i>“Wigberto R. Tañada, Jr. v. Angelina ‘Helen’ D. Tan,</i>” before the House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal (HRET), which was docketed as Electoral Protest Case No. 13-018.<br><br>The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), on behalf of public respondent COMELEC, affirmed in its Comment dated August 18, 2013,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> that an Election Protest <i>Ad Cautelam</i> had, indeed, been filed by Wigberto against Angelina before the HRET, praying that he be declared the winner in the 2013 congressional race in the 4<sup>th</sup> District of Quezon Province. It also alleged that on June 28, 2013, the COMELEC Second Division issued a Resolution annulling the proclamation of Angelina as Member of the House of Representatives for the 4<sup>th</sup> District of Quezon Province. The propriety of this ruling is now pending resolution before the COMELEC <i>En Banc.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br><center><b>The Issues Before the Court</b></center><br>Wigberto assails the COMELEC <i>En Banc</i> Resolution dated April 25, 2013 declaring that Alvin John was not a nuisance candidate as defined under Section 69 of the OEC. In consequence, he seeks that the votes cast in favor of Alvin John be credited to him and, thereafter, to be declared the winning candidate for the congressional post.<br><br><center><b>The Court’s Ruling</b></center><br>The petition must fail.<br><br>Section 17, Article VI of the 1987 Philippine Constitution provides that the HRET is the sole judge of all contests relating to the election, returns, and qualifications of its respective members:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 17. The Senate and the House of Representatives shall each have an Electoral Tribunal which shall be the <b><u>sole judge of all contests relating to the election, returns, and qualifications</u></b> of their respective Members. Each Electoral Tribunal, shall be composed of nine Members, three of whom shall be Justices of the Supreme Court to be designated by the Chief Justice, and the remaining six shall be Members of the Senate or the House of Representatives, as the case may be, who shall be chosen on the basis of proportional representation from the political parties and the parties or organizations registered under the party-list system represented therein. The senior Justice in the Electoral Tribunal shall be its Chairman. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>Case law states that the proclamation of a congressional candidate following the election divests the COMELEC of jurisdiction over disputes relating to the election, returns, and qualifications of the proclaimed representative in favor of the HRET.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> The phrase “election, returns and qualifications” refers to all matters affecting the validity of the contestee’s title. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> In particular, the term “election” refers to the conduct of the polls, including the listing of voters, the holding of the electoral campaign, and the casting and counting of the votes; “returns” refers to the canvass of the returns and the proclamation of the winners, including questions concerning the composition of the board of canvassers and the authenticity of the election returns; and “qualifications” refers to matters that could be raised in a <i>quo warranto</i> proceeding against the proclaimed winner, such as his disloyalty or ineligibility or the inadequacy of his CoC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>In the foregoing light, considering that Angelina had already been proclaimed as Member of the House of Representatives for the 4<sup>th</sup> District of Quezon Province on May 16, 2013, as she has in fact taken her oath and assumed office past noon time of June 30, 2013,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> the Court is now without jurisdiction to resolve the case at bar. As they stand, the issues concerning the conduct of the canvass and the resulting proclamation of Angelina as herein discussed are matters which fall under the scope of the terms “election” and “returns” as above-stated and hence, properly fall under the HRET’s sole jurisdiction.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DISMISSED</b>.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED</b>.<br><br><i>Sereno, C.J., Carpio, Leonardo-De Castro, Brion, Peralta, Abad, Villarama, Jr., Mendoza, Reyes</i>, and <i>Leonen, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Velasco, Jr., J</span>., no part being the HRET Chairman.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Bersamin, J., </span>no part being a member of the HRET.<br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Del Castillo, J., </span>on official leave.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Perez, J.,</span> on official leave.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo, </i>pp. 5-48.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Id. at 457-472.
