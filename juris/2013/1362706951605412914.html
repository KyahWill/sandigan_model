On originating calls the total amounts due to be paid to the foreign administration in terms of U.S. dollars based on established accounting rates will be determined at the end of each month.&nbsp; This amount will be converted at the current rate of exchange prevailing at the end of each month which will then be deducted from the total amount of Philippine charges on originating calls for the month involved.&nbsp; The balance of the charges collected will then be divided in accordance with paragraph 1 above.<br><br>(b) On incoming calls, the Philippine share of revenue in terms of U.S. dollars will be determined at the end of each month through correspondence with each foreign administration involved.&nbsp; This amount will then be converted to Philippine currency at the current rate of exchange prevailing at the end of said month and the total resulting revenue will also be available for division in accordance with paragraph 1 above.</blockquote><br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PLDT agrees and guarantees to course all outgoing telephone traffic to Singapore and Taiwan through the PLDT and ETPI circuits and facilities connecting the Philippines-Singapore and the Philippines-Taiwan streams in the same proportion as the number of circuits provided separately by both PLDT and ETPI to each such country bears to the total number of circuits separately provided by PLDT and ETPI with Singapore-Telecoms for Singapore and ITA-Taiwan under their respective correspondentship agreements.&nbsp; Both parties agree to exert their best efforts to persuade Singapore-Telecoms of Singapore and ITA-Taiwan of Taiwan to course the incoming telephone traffic to the Philippines in the same proportion.&nbsp;

No pronouncement as to costs.&nbsp; (Emphases ours.)</blockquote><br>Thereafter, on September 4, 1997 and December 24, 1998 ETPI filed, respectively, a Motion for Enforcement/Execution and an Urgent Motion, alleging, among others, that PLDT violated the terms of the above Compromise Agreement.&nbsp; For its part, PLDT filed its Opposition with Compulsory Counter-Motion, claiming that it was ETPI that breached their Compromise Agreement by failing to pay the revenue shares of PLDT and by engaging in toll bypass activities.<br><br>Subsequently, PLDT and ETPI jointly moved for a suspension of the proceedings in order for them to explore the possibility of an amicable settlement of the case.&nbsp; The RTC agreed thereto.<br><br>Thereafter, on March<b> </b>29, 1999, PLDT and ETPI arrived at a<b> Letter-Agreement</b>, the pertinent terms of which state:<br><br><blockquote>March 29, 1999<br><br>Mr. Manuel V.

(Smart), Subic Telecoms, Inc., Clark Telephone, Inc. and Philippine Association of Private Telephone Companies, Inc.&nbsp; On September 27, 2001, PLDT allegedly excluded Piltel and Smart from its definition of On-Net traffic retroactive on January 1, 2001 and charged ETPI higher accounting rates for calls to Piltel and Smart starting on January 1, 2001.&nbsp; Thereafter, PLDT wanted to push back to October 1, 2000 the effectivity of the higher rates for calls to Piltel and Smart.&nbsp; ETPI claimed that it protested PLDT’s distinction between On-Net and Off-Net traffic and the higher accounting rates for Off-Net traffic since the Compromise Agreement did not make any distinction between the two.<br><br>Despite negotiations to amicably resolve their issues, PLDT threatened to block on October 31, 2001 all calls to and from the REACH-ETPI circuits unless the TAR between REACH and ETPI was increased and PLDT’s higher accounting rate for Off-Net traffic was accepted.&nbsp; ETPI, thus, prayed for the issuance of a <i>status quo</i> order to maintain the unrestricted flow of telecommunication calls and data between Hong Kong and the Philippines through the REACH-ETPI circuits and to prevent PLDT from using its gateway and facilities to block telephone calls to and from Hong Kong through the REACH-ETPI circuits.&nbsp; ETPI further prayed for the trial court to direct PLDT to comply with the Compromise Agreement, specifically by settling with ETPI in accordance with the prevailing established TAR with respect to the Philippine-Hong Kong telephone traffic passing through the REACH-ETPI circuits, without any qualification as to On-Net/Off-Net telephone traffic.<br><br>In its Opposition,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> PLDT stated that the subject matter sought to be enjoined by ETPI was beyond the jurisdiction of the RTC.&nbsp; PLDT averred that the Compromise Agreement was novated by the Letter-Agreement dated March 29, 1999, which provided that claims between PLDT and ETPI were to be settled amicably or through arbitration.&nbsp; Furthermore, PLDT contended that the motion for the issuance of a <i>status quo</i> order had no actual and/or legal basis as ETPI had not established that there was a clear violation of its right and that PLDT was guilty of bad faith.&nbsp; PLDT also argued that the issuance of the order sought by ETPI would be tantamount to a prejudgment of the accounting rate controversy between the parties.<br><br>Claiming that it needed to mitigate its damages, PLDT proceeded to block at midnight of October 31, 2001 the incoming telephone traffic from Hong Kong to the Philippines through the REACH-ETPI circuits.<br><br>In an <b>Order</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> <b>dated October 31, 2001</b>, but which was received by PLDT only on November 5, 2001, the RTC disregarded the contentions of PLDT.&nbsp; The RTC declared that it had jurisdiction on the matter sought to be enjoined by ETPI.&nbsp; The trial court reasoned that the Compromise Agreement was, at that time, still subsisting, as there was no written notice of termination presented therefor.&nbsp; The RTC also ruled that PLDT’s Letter dated October 3, 2001, which revealed the company’s intent to completely block telephone traffic from REACH Hong Kong effective midnight of October 31, 2001, was held to be in contravention of the Compromise Agreement.&nbsp; In addition, the act of PLDT of making a distinction between On-Net and Off-Net traffic was similarly viewed to be violative of the said agreement.&nbsp; The RTC decreed:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the court hereby directs defendant PLDT to comply with all the terms and conditions of the Compromise Agreement, particularly paragraph 3 thereof and to desist from threatening or pursuing its threat to block telecommunication calls and data to and from Hongkong and the Philippines thru REACH-ETPI Circuits.<br><br>This, however, does not preclude the parties from availing of the provisions of Republic Act <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">[7925]</span>.<br></blockquote><br>Consequently, on November 6, 2001, PLDT filed an Omnibus Motion for Disqualification with Clarification and/or Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> of the above Order.&nbsp; On even date, ETPI filed an Urgent Manifestation,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> informing the trial court of PLDT’s violation of the Order dated October 31, 2001.&nbsp; ETPI prayed that the RTC initiate proceedings to compel PLDT to show cause why the latter, together with its officers and erring personnel, should not be declared in contempt of court.<br><br>On November 19, 2001, ETPI filed an Urgent Motion,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> praying for the court to issue an order requiring the appropriate officer and/or technical personnel of the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) to be deputized in order that the Order dated October 31, 2001 be executed.<br><br>In the RTC Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> dated December 12, 2001, Judge Abrogar partially granted the Omnibus Motion for Disqualification with Clarification and/or Reconsideration of PLDT by inhibiting himself from further hearing Civil Case No. 17694.&nbsp; With respect to the other pending incidents of the case, the same were left for the resolution of the court where the case would be re-raffled.<br><br>Thereafter, the case was re-raffled to Branch 60 of the RTC of Makati City, which was presided over by Judge Marissa Macaraig-Guillen.<br><br>On January 29, 2002, ETPI filed an Urgent Omnibus Motion,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> reminding the RTC of the pending incidents of the case.&nbsp; ETPI likewise prayed for the issuance of a <i>status quo</i> order, directing PLDT not to threaten and/or carry out its threat to block all telecommunication calls and data from the Philippines to Hong Kong passing through the REACH-ETPI circuits.&nbsp; If PLDT already carried out its threat, ETPI prayed for an order commanding PLDT to restore the free flow of telecommunication calls and data in the aforesaid REACH-ETPI circuits.<br><br>In the <b>Order</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> <b>dated April 10, 2002</b>, the RTC resolved the above pending incidents of the case.&nbsp; Contrary to the position of the PLDT, the RTC ruled that it retained jurisdiction over the case as the Letter-Agreement dated March 29, 1999 did not novate or modify the Compromise Agreement dated February 9, 1990.&nbsp; The trial court held that there was nothing in the terms of the Letter-Agreement to justify the inference that the parties intended the same to supersede or substitute the Compromise Agreement.&nbsp; Moreover, the trial court agreed with PLDT that it had no authority to issue a <i>status quo</i> order in the case.&nbsp; Be that as it may, the trial court posited that it could enforce compliance with the terms and conditions of the Compromise Agreement upon mere filing of a motion.&nbsp; While Section 6, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court sought to limit the period within which a party may enforce a final and executory decision of a court to five years from the date of the judgment’s entry, the trial court stated that said rule was given to several notable exceptions.&nbsp; One exception is when a compromise agreement approved by the court provides for a period within which the parties are to comply with the terms and conditions of the contract.<br><br>The trial court was convinced that the parties’ intentions were to allow continued access to the trial court for relief in case of breach of any of the terms of the Compromise Agreement during the entire period the said agreement was in full force and effect.&nbsp; Necessarily, the procedure by which a party could seek redress for the alleged injury suffered by reason of the breach would be through the filing of the appropriate motion, which ETPI complied with in the case.<br><br>Moreover, since PLDT admitted to blocking the incoming telephone traffic from Hong Kong passing through the REACH-ETPI circuits, even before November 5, 2001, it was clear to the trial court that the same was in violation of paragraph 11 of the Compromise Agreement.&nbsp; As regards the suggestion of PLDT that it was prepared to cut-off the flow of outbound telecommunication calls from the Philippines to Hong Kong passing through the REACH-ETPI circuits, the trial court reminded PLDT of the latter’s commitment in paragraph 3 of the Compromise Agreement wherein it guaranteed that “all the outgoing telephone traffic to Hong Kong destined to ETPI’s correspondent therein, Cable &amp; Wireless Hong Kong Ltd., its successors and assigns, shall be coursed by PLDT through the ETPI provided circuits and facilities between the Philippines to Hong Kong.”<br><br>As regards the dispute of the parties on the appropriate TAR that should be applied, the RTC left the same for the parties to decide whether to present their respective evidence before the trial court on said issue or to submit the same for mediation before the Philippine Mediation Center or arbitration.<br><br>In the end, the trial court decreed:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, [ETPI’s] Urgent Omnibus Motion is partially GRANTED, in that defendant PLDT is ordered to comply with the court’s Decision of 9 February 1990, specifically Sections 3 and 11 of the Compromise Agreement which served as basis for the judgment.<br><br>As a consequence of this ruling, defendant PLDT is ordered to restore the free flow of telecommunication calls and data from the Philippines to Hongkong passing through the REACH-ETPI circuits.<br><br>Plaintiff ETPI’s prayer for the issuance of a <i>status quo</i> Order contained in the said Urgent Omnibus Motion is[,] however, DENIED for lack of merit.<br><br>In turn, due to their reasons herein provided for, defendant PLDT’s Omnibus Motion for Reconsideration of the Court’s 31 October 2001 Order is likewise denied for lack of merit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Thereafter, the RTC clarified the second paragraph of the above dispositive portion in its subsequent Orders dated June 7, 2002<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> and July 5, 2002.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>&nbsp; The said paragraph was amended to read:<br><br><blockquote>“As a consequence of this ruling, defendant PLDT is ordered to restore the free flow of telecommunication calls and [data] <b>from Hong Kong to the Philippines</b> passing through the REACH-ETPI circuits.”&nbsp; (Emphasis ours.)</blockquote><br><b><i><u>Proceedings before the Court of Appeals</u></i></b><br><br>Undaunted by the unfavorable rulings of the RTC, PLDT filed with the Court of Appeals on June 11, 2002 a Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> Under Rule 65 (With Application for the Issuance of a TRO and/or Writ of Preliminary Injunction),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> which was docketed as <b>CA-G.R. SP No. 71103</b>.&nbsp; The petition sought the declaration of nullity of the RTC Orders dated October 31, 2001 and April 10, 2002 in Civil Case No. 17694, which were allegedly issued without jurisdiction and with clear grave abuse of discretion.<br><br>In the <b>Decision dated December 26, 2002</b>, the Court of Appeals granted the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> of PLDT, disposing thus:<br><br><blockquote><b><i>WHEREFORE</i></b>, the Petition is <b>GRANTED</b> and the Orders dated October 31, 2001 and April 10, June 7 and July 5, 2002 are hereby declared as <b>NULL and VOID</b> for having been issued without jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></blockquote><br>The Court of Appeals ruled that the RTC committed grave error in issuing the Orders assailed in PLDT’s petition.&nbsp; Contrary to the trial court’s judgment, the Court of Appeals opined that the Letter-Agreement modified or novated the prior Compromise Agreement between PLDT and ETPI.&nbsp; According to the appellate court, the Letter-Agreement specified the respective rights and obligations of the parties, particularly “without prejudice to other claims of PLDT and ETPI against each other, which they endeavor to settle amicably or through arbitration.”&nbsp; This clearly indicated that both parties agreed to modify paragraph 15 of the Compromise Agreement, which provided that in case of breach, the parties may obtain judicial relief, including a writ of execution.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals likewise disagreed with the finding of the RTC that the Letter-Agreement was merely a provisional arrangement agreed upon by the parties while they tried to settle certain pending issues.<br><br>Furthermore, the Court of Appeals took judicial notice of the fact that Section 18 of Republic Act No. 7925<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> and its implementing rules and regulations, expressly conferred exclusive and original jurisdiction to the NTC to resolve disputes between telecommunications companies regarding settlement of access charge and/or revenue sharing.&nbsp; Therefore, the appellate court ruled that ETPI should have first availed of the administrative remedies afforded it by Republic Act No. 7925 and sought recourse from the NTC, instead of going back to the trial court.&nbsp; ETPI’s premature invocation of the trial court was deemed fatal and rendered its motion susceptible of dismissal for lack of cause of action.&nbsp; The trial court should have recognized and enforced the agreement of the parties to submit their claims to arbitration.&nbsp; At the very least, the trial court should have suspended the proceedings to allow the parties to submit to arbitration in accordance with the terms of their agreement.<br><br>Lastly, the Court of Appeals agreed with PLDT that a <i>status quo</i> order functioned as a temporary restraining order (TRO) or a writ of preliminary injunction.&nbsp; Therefore, in ruling that ETPI was not entitled to a <i>status quo</i> order, the trial court should not have directed PLDT to do or undo certain acts, which is tantamount to granting ETPI injunctive relief.<br><br>ETPI duly filed a Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> of the above Court of Appeals Decision and was able to have the same overturned.<br><br>In the assailed <b>Amended Decision dated November 19, 2003</b>, the Court of Appeals revisited its previous ruling and entered a decree, which stated:<br><br><blockquote><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, our Decision dated December 26, 2002 is hereby <b>RECONSIDERED</b> and <b>SET ASIDE</b>, and the Orders dated October 31, 2001 and April 10, 2002 (as amended by the Order dated June 7, 2002) of the court <i>a quo</i> are <b>AFFIRMED</b><i> in toto</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></blockquote><br>The Court of Appeals stated that after the approval of the Compromise Agreement by the RTC, the decision based on the judicial compromise between the parties became immediately final and executory.&nbsp; On the basis thereof, the appellate court declared that the trial court is clothed with the residual power to have its judgment executed.&nbsp; By virtue of this power, it is inherent with the court to compel obedience to its judgment, orders and processes.<br><br>Furthermore, the Court of Appeals ruled that the invocation of the provisions of Republic Act No. 7925, which transferred jurisdiction of the subject matter with the NTC, did not divest the trial court of its jurisdiction to enforce its judgment through the issuance of the necessary writs.&nbsp; The appellate court reiterated the doctrine that jurisdiction once acquired is not removed by law unless express prohibitory words are used.&nbsp; In this case, Republic Act No. 7925 did not contain any such prohibitory words enjoining the RTC from implementing and enforcing its decision.<br><br>With respect to the execution of the Letter-Agreement, the Court of Appeals held that the same did not revise, modify or novate the Compromise Agreement.&nbsp; In the Letter-Agreement, PLDT and ETPI agreed to continue working on a new agreement that would supersede the Compromise Agreement.&nbsp; In the meantime, the appellate court observed that the parties continued to be bound by the provisions of the Compromise Agreement.&nbsp; Despite the existence of an arbitration clause, the appellate court stated that the case pending before the trial court should be allowed to proceed in the interest of speedy justice and to avoid multiplicity of suits.<br><br>Finally, even assuming that the Letter-Agreement modified the Compromise Agreement, the Court of Appeals ruled that the parties were still bound to comply with paragraph 11 of the Compromise Agreement, which in part required them not to use or threaten to use their gateway or any other facility to subvert the purposes of the Compromise Agreement.&nbsp; For the appellate court, a violation of said paragraph should not be subject to arbitration for to do so would be to allow the offending party to have a final judgment reopened by violating the Compromise Agreement and then ask that the case be submitted to arbitration.&nbsp; In the words of the appellate court, “[s]uch an occurrence would throw the case into an unending process.”<br><br>PLDT moved for the reconsideration of the above Amended Decision, but the same was denied in the assailed Court of Appeals Resolution dated March 30, 2004.<br><br>Hence, the instant petition.<br><br>Before this Court, PLDT set forth the following issues:<br><br><blockquote><center>ISSUES<br><br>A.<br></center><br>WHETHER OR NOT THE RTC-MAKATI CEASED TO HAVE JURISDICTION OVER THE SUBJECT MATTER OF CIVIL CASE NO. 17694 IN VIEW OF THE NOVATION OF THE COMPROMISE AGREEMENT BY THE LETTER-AGREEMENT, WHICH PROVIDED FOR ARBITRATION AS THE MEANS FOR SETTLING DISPUTES BETWEEN PLDT AND ETPI THAT COULD NOT BE SETTLED AMICABLY;<br><br><center>B.<br></center><br>WHETHER OR NOT THERE WAS NOVATION OF THE COMPROMISE AGREEMENT BY THE LETTER-AGREEMENT;<br><br><center>C.<br></center><br>WHETHER OR NOT BY VIRTUE OF R.A.

SP No. 71103.&nbsp; The assailed decision resolved the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> Under Rule 65 (With Application for the Issuance of a TRO and/or Writ of Preliminary Injunction) filed by PLDT, which questioned the Orders of the RTC dated October 31, 2001 and April 10, 2002 in Civil Case No. 17694.<br><br>The RTC Order dated October 31, 2001 arose from the filing of ETPI of an Urgent Motion for Enforcement (With Prayer for <i>Status Quo</i> Order) to prevent PLDT from using its gateway and facilities to block telephone calls to and from Hong Kong through the REACH-ETPI circuits, as well as to direct PLDT to abide by the provisions of the Compromise Agreement.&nbsp; In the Order dated October 31, 2001, the RTC directed PLDT to comply with the terms and conditions of the Compromise Agreement, particularly paragraph 3 thereof, wherein PLDT guaranteed that all outgoing telephone traffic to Hong Kong destined to ETPI’s correspondent therein shall be coursed by PLDT through ETPI provided circuits and facilities between the Philippines and Hong Kong.&nbsp; The RTC likewise commanded PLDT to desist from threatening or pursuing its threat to block communication calls and data to and from Hong Kong and the Philippines through the REACH-ETPI circuits.<br><br>On the other hand, the RTC Order dated April 10, 2002 resolved, <i>inter alia</i>, PLDT’s Omnibus Motion for Disqualification with Clarification and/or Reconsideration, insofar as PLDT’s motion to have the trial court reconsider the October 31, 2001 Order.&nbsp; In the Order dated April 10, 2002, the RTC directed PLDT to comply with the terms of the Compromise Agreement, particularly the above-stated paragraph 3 thereof, as well as paragraph 11, which provided that “[n]either party shall use or threaten to use its gateway or any other facilities to subvert the purposes of [the Compromise Agreement].”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; Consequently, the RTC decreed that: “[a]s a consequence of [its] ruling, defendant PLDT is ordered to restore the free flow of telecommunication calls and data from the Philippines to Hong Kong passing through the REACH-ETPI circuits.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Thereafter, the dispositive portion of the Order dated April 10, 2002 was clarified in the RTC Orders dated June 7, 2002<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> and July 5, 2002<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> to read:<br><br><blockquote>“As a consequence of this ruling, defendant PLDT is ordered to restore the free flow of telecommunication calls and [data] <b>from Hong Kong</b> to the Philippines passing through the REACH-ETPI circuits.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>&nbsp; (Emphasis ours.)</blockquote><br>In the assailed Amended Decision dated November 19, 2003, the Court of Appeals affirmed <i>in toto</i> the Orders of the RTC dated October 31, 2001 and April 10, 2002.<br><br>Therefore, when PLDT questioned <i>via</i> the instant petition the Amended Decision dated November 19, 2003, PLDT essentially asked the Court to determine whether the RTC could validly issue the said Orders, which directed PLDT to unblock and/or restore the telecommunication calls and data from the Philippines to Hong Kong passing through the REACH-ETPI circuits.<br><br>In the instant petition, however, PLDT informed the Court that the Compromise Agreement, by its own terms, already expired on November 28, 2003.&nbsp; Furthermore, PLDT insisted in its Memorandum that:<br><br><blockquote>The Compromise Agreement, by its own terms, was effective only until 28 November 2003.&nbsp; The RTC-Makati Decision pertinently states:<br><blockquote>“12. Upon (a) approval of the respective Boards of ETPI and PLDT, and (b) approval of this Honorable Court, <u>this</u> <b>Agreement shall take effect and shall continue in effect until November 28, 2003, provided that a written notice of termination is given by one party to the other not later than November 28, 2001.&nbsp; In the absence of such written notice, this Agreement shall continue in effect beyond November 28, 2003 but may [be] terminated thereafter by either party by giving to the other a prior two[-]year notice of termination</b>. x x x.”<br></blockquote>The conditions for the termination of the Compromise Agreement were complied with in that: (a) both PLDT and ETPI are now coursing traffic through their respective networks; (b) foreign telecommunications companies such as Hong Kong REACH, Singtel and Chung Hua TelCom, were advised about the expiration of the Compromise Agreement; and (c) the parties are negotiating and/or have already concluded their respective agreements.<br><br>It is a fact that <b>there is now nothing to unblock</b> because circuits have already been deactivated and migrated pursuant to the existing interconnection agreements between PLDT and ETPI.<br><br><b>As a result of the expiration of the Compromise Agreement, there is nothing for the RTC-Makati to enforce and/or act upon</b>. x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></blockquote><br>Far from controverting the above submissions of PLDT, ETPI sustained the same and insisted on the mootness of PLDT’s petition.<br><br>Verily, in <i>Gancho-on v. Secretary of Labor and Employment,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> the Court emphatically stated that:<br><br><blockquote>It is a rule of universal application, almost, that courts of justice constituted to pass upon substantial rights will not consider questions in which no actual interests are involved; they decline jurisdiction of moot cases. And where the issue has become moot and academic, there is no justiciable controversy, so that a declaration thereon would be of no practical use or value. There is no actual substantial relief to which petitioners would be entitled and which would be negated by the dismissal of the petition. (Citations omitted.)</blockquote><br>Applying the above pronouncement, there was no justiciable controversy anymore in the instant petition in view of the expiration of the Compromise Agreement sought to be enforced.&nbsp; There was no longer any purpose in determining whether the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the RTC Orders dated October 31, 2001 and April 10, 2002 since any declaration thereon would be of no practical use or value.&nbsp; By the very admission of PLDT, it can no longer be compelled to undo its act of blocking the telecommunication calls and data from the Philippines to Hong Kong passing through the REACH-ETPI circuits since, effectively, there were no more circuits to speak of.<br><br>Clearly, any decision of this Court on the present petition, whether it be an affirmance or a reversal of the Amended Decision of the Court of Appeals, would be equivalent in effect to an affirmance or an invalidation of the challenged Orders of the RTC.&nbsp; But as can be gleaned from the above discussion, and as succinctly put by PLDT in its Memorandum, there is nothing more for the RTC to enforce and/or act upon.&nbsp; As such, any discussion on the matter would be a mere surplusage.<br><br>Although the moot and academic principle admits of certain exceptions,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> none of them are applicable in the instant case.<br><br>In light of the foregoing, the other issues invoked by the parties need no longer be discussed.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i> is <b>DENIED</b> for being moot and academic.&nbsp; No costs.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Sereno, C.J., (Chairperson), Bersamin, Villarama, Jr.,</i> and<i> Reyes, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo</i> (Vol. I), pp. 12-83.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Id. at 86-93; penned by Associate Justice Eubulo G.
