Thus, they prayed that the Decision be reconsidered and that the Complaint be dismissed.<br><br>In a January 30, 2006 Omnibus Order,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> the trial court declined to reconsider.&nbsp; Only petitioners went up to the CA on appeal.<br><br><b><i>Ruling of the Court of Appeals</i></b><br><br>In the CA, petitioners maintained that the Decision is erroneous and the awards excessive, echoing their previous argument below that the lease agreement did not authorize respondents to charge additional rents for their extended stay and interest on delayed rental payments.&nbsp; They added that respondents are not entitled to moral and exemplary damages and attorney’s fees.&nbsp; Finally, they bemoaned the trial court’s act of resolving their Verified Motion for Reconsideration of the Decision without conducting oral arguments.<br><br>The CA, however, was unconvinced.&nbsp; It held that the preponderance of evidence,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> which remained uncontroverted by petitioners, points to the fact that petitioners indeed failed to pay rent in full, considering that their postdated checks bounced upon presentment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> and their unauthorized extended stay from July 1 until August 11, 1999.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup>&nbsp; It added that petitioners were undeniably guilty of violating several provisions of the lease agreement, as it has also been shown that they failed to pay rent on time and illegally subleased the property to one Cynthia Reyes, who even made direct payments of rentals to respondents on several occasions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>On petitioners’ argument that respondents are not entitled to additional rent for petitioners’ extended stay beyond the lease expiration date, the CA held that the respondents are in fact authorized to collect whatever damages they may have incurred by reason of the lease,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> citing Section 16 of the lease agreement which provides as follows:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 16.&nbsp; TERMINATION OR CANCELLATION OF THE LEASE.&nbsp; Any delay in or violation, failure or refusal of the LESSEE to perform and comply with any of the obligations stipulated hereunder shall automatically give an absolute right to the LESSORS to cancel, terminate or otherwise rescind this Contract of Lease. x x x.<br><br>x x x x<br><br><b>The above provisions shall, however, be without prejudice to any right of claim by the LESSORS against the LESSEE for whatever damages which may be incurred or assessed under this Contract of Lease.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>The CA found no error in the award of moral and exemplary damages, noting that petitioners’ violations of the lease agreement compelled respondents to litigate and endure unreasonable delays, sleepless nights, mental anguish, and serious anxiety.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup>&nbsp; As for attorney’s fees, the CA sustained the trial court’s award of 25%, saying that such stipulation may be justified under Article 2208 of the Civil Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup>&nbsp; Since respondents were compelled to incur expenses to protect their interests as a result of petitioners’ acts and omissions, they should be allowed to collect the stipulated attorney’s fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>Finally, the CA held that the matter of conducting further oral arguments on a party’s Motion for Reconsideration rests upon the sound discretion of the court.&nbsp; Because petitioners’ Verified Motion for Reconsideration is a mere reiteration of their defenses which they raised all throughout the proceedings below, conducting a hearing on the motion would have been a mere superfluity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br>The CA thus dismissed the petitioners’ appeal and sustained in toto the January 31, 2005 decision of the trial court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup>&nbsp; Their Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> was denied as well, through the questioned September 15, 2008 Resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br><center><b>Issues</b><br></center><br>The instant Petition thus raises the following issues:<br><br><blockquote><center>A</center><br>THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS GRIEVOUSLY ERRED IN NOT CALLING THE TRIAL COURT TO TASK FOR REFUSING TO RECEIVE EVIDENCE IN SUPPORT OF THE VERIFIED MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF PETITIONERS ON THE GROUND THAT THE AWARD OF DAMAGES IS EXCESSIVE.<br><br><center>B</center><br>THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS GRIEVOUSLY ERRED IN NOT DISCERNING THE INTERNAL FACTUAL INCONSISTENCIES OF THE FINDINGS OF THE TRIAL COURT AS WELL AS THE LACK OF LEGAL BASIS THEREOF, <i>VIS-À-VIS</i> THE CLAIM OF UNPAID RENT AND INTEREST, IN CLEAR DISREGARD OF THE PRONOUNCEMENTS OF THIS HONORABLE COURT IN <i>MARTIN V.

They argue that although Reyes paid a portion of the rentals, this may not be taken as sufficient proof of the existence of a sublease agreement between them; and even assuming that a sublease agreement indeed existed between them, such arrangement was condoned by respondents when they accepted payments of rents made directly to them by Reyes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br>Regarding damages and attorney’s fees, petitioners maintain that there could not have been delay in the payment of rentals as to warrant the award of moral damages, since they have paid the rents in full; their supposed liability was only for the additional rent incurred for their extended stay.&nbsp; Petitioners proceed to argue that if only respondents had exercised their option – allowed under the lease agreement – to forcibly evict petitioners from the premises, then they would not have incurred the damages they claim to be entitled to.&nbsp; As for the award of exemplary damages and attorney’s fees, petitioners find no factual and legal bases for the grant thereof.&nbsp; Since they did not act with malice or bad faith in all matters relative to the lease, respondents should not be entitled thereto.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup><br><br><b><i>Respondents’ Arguments</i></b><br><br>In their Comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> respondents insist that petitioners committed several violations of the lease agreement,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> specifically: for their failure to pay the rents on time,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> for subleasing the property to Reyes,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> for neglecting to maintain the warehouses which resulted in their damaged condition after the lease,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> for refusing to vacate the premises upon the expiration of the lease,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> and for their neglect and refusal to pay the required fishpond license and permit fees imposed by the municipality of Bulacan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup>&nbsp;

The trial court may not be faulted for denying what it could have perceived was another of petitioners’ delaying tactics, given how they acted throughout the proceedings.&nbsp; It may have been a baffling situation for the trial court to find itself suddenly confronted with petitioners’ zeal in presenting their case, at such a late stage, when they have repeatedly waived such right during the trial of the case.&nbsp; Indeed, it possessed sufficient discretion to grant or deny the hearing sought for their motion for reconsideration; under the circumstances, the Court finds that such discretion was exercised soundly.&nbsp; Besides, as will be seen, the evidence is ample and clear enough to warrant judgment outside of a hearing.<br><br>Both courts erred in finding that there are outstanding rents owing to the respondents in the amount of P863,796.00.
