CV No. 66071, which ordered petitioner Robern Development Corporation (Robern) to reconvey the 2,000-square meter lot it bought from Al-Amanah Islamic Development Bank of the Philippines (Al-Amanah) to respondent People’s Landless Association (PELA).<br><br><b><i>Factual Antecedents<br></i></b><br>Al-Amanah owned a 2000-square meter lot located in Magtu-od, Davao City and covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 138914.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>&nbsp; On December 12, 1992, Al-Amanah Davao Branch, thru its officer-in-charge Febe O.

Ututalum-Al Haj, wrote then PELA President Bonifacio Cuizon, Sr.&nbsp; informing him of the Head Office’s disapproval of PELA’s offer to buy the said 2,000-square meter lot, viz:<br><br><blockquote>Dear Mr. Cuizon[,] Sr.,<br><br>Please be inform[ed] that your offer to purchase the lot covered by TCT No. T-138914, containing an area of 2,000 square meters, located at Bakingan, Barangay Magtuod, Davao City for P300,000.00 has been turned down by the top management, due to the reason that your offered price is way below the selling price of the Bank which is P500.00 per square meter, or negotiate but on Cash basis only.<br><br>You had been told regarding this matter, but you failed to counter offer since you have [conferred] with the Bank’s local management.&nbsp; Despite x x x the time given to you to counter offer or to vacate the lot presently and illegally occupied by you and the members of the association, still you refrain to hear our previous notices. You even deliberately construct more residential structures without our permission.&nbsp; As such, you are finally instructed to vacate the lot and remove all the house structures erected on the said lot within 15 days upon receipt of this letter.&nbsp; Failure on your part including that of the members, the Bank will be constrained to take legal action against you.<br><br>Furthermore, you can withdraw the amount deposited in the name of your association anytime during banking hours.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></blockquote><br>Subsequently, Al-Amanah sent similarly worded letters,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> all dated December 14, 1993, to 19 PELA members demanding that they vacate the lot.<br><br>In a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> dated December 20, 1993, PELA, through Atty. Pedro S. Castillo, replied that it had already reached an agreement with Al-Amanah regarding the sale of the subject lot based on their offered price:<br><br><blockquote>Dear Mr. Ututalum-Al-Haj,<br><br>The People’s Landless Association, Inc., through Mr. Bonifacio Cuizon, Sr. has requested us to assist them in communicating with you anent your letter of 29 November 1993.&nbsp; According to Mr. Cuizon the present occupants of the lot covered by T.C.T. No. T-138914 with an area of 2,000 square meters, had a definite agreement with the Islamic Bank through its previous Manager or Officer[-]in[-]Charge to buy this foreclosed property at P300,000.00.&nbsp; As a matter of fact their deposit of P150,000.00 was on that basis. For this reason, the occupants, who are members of the association, have already made lot allocations among themselves and have improved their respective houses.<br><br>It would be most unfair if the Bank would now renege on its [commitment] and eject these occupants.&nbsp; In line with the national policy of granting landless members of our society the opportunity of owning [land] and providing shelter to their families, it would be equitable and socially justifiable to grant these occupants their occupied areas pursuant to the earlier agreement with the Bank.<br><br>For the foregoing reasons we hope that the Islamic Bank, for legal, moral and social grounds would reconsider.</blockquote><br>Meanwhile, acting on Robern’s undated written offer,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Al-Amanah issued a Recommendation Sheet<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> dated December 27, 1993 addressed to its Board Operations Committee, indicating therein that Robern is interested to buy the lot for P400,000.00; that it has already deposited 20% of the offered purchase price; that it is buying the lot on “as is” basis; and, that it is willing to shoulder the relocation of all informal settlers therein.&nbsp; On December 29, 1993, the Head Office informed the Davao Branch Manager that the Board Operations Committee had accepted Robern’s offer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Eight days later, Robern was informed of the acceptance.&nbsp; Al-Amanah stressed that it is Robern’s responsibility to eject the occupants in the subject lot, if any, as well as the payment of the remaining amount within 15 days; otherwise, the P80,000.00 deposit shall be forfeited.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>In a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> dated January 13, 1994, Robern expressed to Al-Amanah its uncertainty on the status of the subject lot, <i>viz</i>.:<br><br><blockquote>This is in connection with TCT No. 138914 which your bank offered to sell to us and which we committed to buy.<br><br>A group calling itself PEOPLE[’]S LANDLESS ASSOCIATION, INC. made representation with our office bringing with them copies of official receipts totalling P150,000.00 issued by your bank which stated---“PARTIAL PAYMENT/DEPOSIT on sale of TCT #138914”.<br><br>While condition no. 6 in the sale of property to us states that the buyer shall be responsible for ejecting the squatters of the property, the occupants of the said lot could hardly be categorized as squatters considering the supposed transaction previously entered by your bank with them.&nbsp; We were greatly appalled that we should learn about this not from the bank but from outside sources.<br><br>My company is ready to finalize our transaction provided, however, that the problem with this group is cleared.&nbsp; In this connection, we are requesting for a definite statement from your bank on whether the official receipts being brandished by this group are genuine or not, and if they were, were they ever invalidated by virtue of the return of their deposit and whether there was a cancellation of your agreement with them.<br><br>In the meantime, please consider the 15-day period for us to pay the amount of P320,000.00 imposed by your bank suspended until such time that the legal problem with the lot occupants is settled.</blockquote><br>To convince Robern that it has no existing contract with PELA, Al-Amanah furnished it with copies of the Head Office’s rejection letter of PELA’s bid, the demand letters to vacate, and the proof of consignment of PELA’s P150,000.00 deposit to the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Davao City that PELA refused to withdraw.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>&nbsp; Thereafter, on February 2, 1994, it informed Robern that should the latter fail to pay the balance by February 9, 1994, its P80,000.00 deposit will be forfeited and the lot shall be up for sale to other prospective buyers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>&nbsp; Meanwhile, Al-Amanah requested for assistance for the removal of the houses not only from the Office of the City Engineer of Davao City<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> but also from Mayor Rodrigo Duterte.&nbsp; Gaining a favorable legal opinion from the City Legal Officer, the matter was indorsed to the Chief of Demolition Consensus of the Department of Public Services for action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>On March 4, 1994, Robern paid the balance of the purchase price.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>&nbsp; The Deed of Sale<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> over the realty was executed on April 6, 1994 and TCT No. T-212983<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> was issued in Robern’s name the following day.<br><br>A week later, PELA consigned P150,000.00 in the RTC of Davao City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>&nbsp; Then on April 14, 1994, it wrote<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Al-Amanah asking the latter to withdraw the amount consigned.&nbsp; Part of the letter states:<br><br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br>On March 21, 1994 (almost one month before the April 15, 1994 deadline) we came to your bank to remit the balance and full payment [for] the abovementioned lot.&nbsp;

Farouk Carpizo (Engr. Carpizo), OIC Dalig, Robern, and Robern’s President and General Manager, petitioner Rodolfo Bernardo (Bernardo) before the RTC of Davao City.&nbsp; It insisted that as early as March 1993 it has a perfected contract of sale with Al-Amanah.&nbsp; However, in an apparent act of bad faith and in cahoots with Robern, Al-Amanah proceeded with the sale of the lot despite the prior sale to PELA.<br><br>Incidentally, the trial court granted PELA’s prayer for a temporary restraining order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>&nbsp; Subsequently, it issued on August 12, 1994 an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> finding merit in the issuance of the writ of preliminary injunction,<i> inter alia</i>.&nbsp; The RTC’s grant of injunctive relief was affirmed by the CA in CA-G.R.

Carpizo claimed that the bank has every right to sell its lot to any interested buyer with the best offer and thus they chose Robern.&nbsp; They clarified that the P150,000.00 PELA handed to them is not part of the payment but merely a deposit in connection with its offer.&nbsp; They asserted that PELA was properly apprised that its offer to buy was subject to the approval of Al-Amanah’s Head Office.&nbsp; They stressed that Al-Amanah never entered into a sale with PELA for there was no perfected agreement as to the price since the Head Office rejected PELA’s offer.<br><br>For their part, Robern and Bernardo asserted the corporation’s standing as a purchaser in good faith and for value in the sale of the property, having relied on the clean title of Al-Amanah.&nbsp; They also alleged that the purported sale to PELA is violative of the Statute of Frauds<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> as there is no written agreement covering the same.<br><br><b><i>Ruling of the Regional Trial Court</i></b><br><br>In its August 10, 1999 Decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> the RTC dismissed PELA’s Complaint.&nbsp; It opined that the March 18, 1993 letter PELA has been relying upon as proof of a perfected contract of sale was a mere offer which was already rejected.&nbsp; Furthermore, the annotation appearing in the bottom part of the said letter could not be construed as an acceptance because the same is a mere acknowledgment of receipt of the letter (not the offer) which will still be subject to processing.&nbsp; The RTC likewise ruled that being a corporation, only Al-Amanah’s board of directors can bind the bank with third persons involving the sale of its property.&nbsp; Thus, the purported offer made by Al-Amanah’s OIC, who was never conferred authority by the board of directors to sell the lot, cannot bind the bank.&nbsp; In contrast, when the Head Office accepted Robern’s offered price, it was duly approved by the board of directors, giving birth to a perfected contract of sale between Al-Amanah and Robern.<br><br>Refusing to accept the Decision, PELA elevated its case to the CA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br><b><i>Ruling of the Court of Appeals</i></b><br><br>Reversing the RTC in its assailed Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> of August 16, 2005, the CA ruled that there was already a perfected contract of sale between PELA and Al-Amanah.&nbsp; It held that the annotation on the lower portion of the March 18, 1993 letter could be construed to mean that for Al-Amanah to accept PELA’s offer, the sum of P150,000.00 must be first put up.&nbsp; The CA also observed that the subsequent receipt by Al-Amanah of the amounts totalling P150,000.00, and the annotation of “deposit on sale of TCT No. 138914,” on the receipts it issued explicitly indicated an acceptance of the association’s offer to buy.&nbsp; Consequently, the CA invalidated the sale between Robern and Al-Amanah.<br><br>The CA also concluded that Al-Amanah is guilty of bad faith in dealing with PELA because it took Al-Amanah almost seven months to reject PELA’s offer while holding on to the P150,000.00 deposit.&nbsp; The CA thus adjudged PELA entitled to moral and exemplary damages as well as attorney’s fees.<br><br>The dispositive portion of the CA Decision reads:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the assailed Decision is <b>SET ASIDE</b>.&nbsp; Judgment is hereby rendered:<br><br><ol><li><b>DECLARING</b> the contract of sale between PELA and defendant Bank valid and subsisting.<br></li><li><b>ORDERING</b> the defendant Bank to receive the balance of P150,000.00 of the purchase price from PELA as consigned in court.<br></li><li><b>DECLARING</b> the deed of sale executed by defendant Bank in favor or Robern Development Corporation as invalid and, therefore, void.<br></li><li><b>ORDERING</b> defendant Bank to return to Robern the full amount of P400,000.00 which Robern paid as the purchase price of the subject property within ten (10) days from finality of this decision.&nbsp; It shall earn a legal interest of twelve percent (12%) per annum from the tenth (10th) day aforementioned if there is delay in payment.<br></li><li><b>ORDERING</b> Robern Development Corporation to reconvey the land covered by T.C.T.

No. T-138914, portions of which are occupied by their houses.&nbsp; These occupants have formed and registered [a] group of x x x landless families who have occupied shoulders of National Highways, to be able to raise an amount that would meet the approval of the Bank as the consideration for the purchase of the property. <b> The group which [is] known as PELA or People’s Landless Association, is offering the bank the amount of THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND PESOS (P300,000.00) for the whole 2,000 sq. meters.&nbsp; Of this amount the buyers will pay a down payment of ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PESOS (P150,000.00) and the balance payable in one (1) year.</b><br><br>According to the plan of PELA, about 24 landless families can be accommodated in the property.&nbsp; We hope the Bank can help these families own even a small plot for their shelter.&nbsp; This would be in line with the government’s program of housing which the present administration promised to put in high gear this year.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>Neither can the note written by the bank that “[s]ubject offer has been acknowledged/received but processing to take effect upon putting up of the partial amount of P150,000.00 on or before April 15, 1993” be construed as acceptance of PELA’s offer to buy.&nbsp; Taken at face value, the annotation simply means that the bank merely acknowledged receipt of PELA’s letter-offer.&nbsp; Furthermore, by ‘processing,’ Al-Amanah only meant that it will ‘act on the offer’, i.e., it still has to evaluate whether PELA’s offer is acceptable.&nbsp; Until and unless Al-Amanah accepts, there is as yet no perfected contract of sale.&nbsp; Notably here, the bank never signified its ‘approval’ or ‘acceptance’ of the offer.<br><br>We cannot agree with the CA’s ratiocination that receipt of the amount, coupled with the phrase written on the four receipts as “deposit on sale of TCT No. 138914,” signified a tacit acceptance by Al-Amanah of PELA’s offer.&nbsp; For sure, the money PELA gave was not in the concept of an earnest money.&nbsp; Besides, as testified to by then OIC Dalig, it is the usual practice of Al-Amanah to require submission of a bid deposit which is acknowledged by way of bank receipts before it entertains offers.&nbsp; Thus:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY">Atty.
