Such rules and limitations ought to be observed in any succeeding lease agreements between petitioner and respondent for they are, in themselves, material conditions of the donation of the subject land.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>In this connection, petitioner cites item 2(g) of the <i>Deed of Donation</i> and <i>Amended Deed of Donation</i> that supposedly limits the amount of rent for the lease over the second twenty-five (25) years to only “<i>three percent (3%) of the fair market value of the [subject] land excluding the improvements</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>For petitioner then, the rental stipulations of both the <i>2000 Lease Contract</i> and <i>2005 Lease Contract</i> cannot be enforced as they are clearly, in view of their exorbitant exactions, in violation of the aforementioned threshold in item 2(g) of the <i>Deed of Donation</i> and <i>Amended Deed of Donation</i>. Consequently, petitioner insists that the amount of rent it has to pay thereon is and must still be governed by the limitations prescribed in the <i>Deed of Donation</i> and <i>Amended Deed of Donation</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br><center><u><i>The Demand Letters</i></u><br></center><br>On 1 June 2009, respondent sent a letter (<i>First Demand Letter</i>)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> to petitioner notifying the latter of its default “<i>per Section 12 of the [2005 Lease Contract]</i>” and demanding for the settlement of the rent and “<i>donation</i>” due for the year 2009.

The respondent insists upon the enforceability and validity of such stipulations, whereas, petitioner, in substance, repudiates them. It is from petitioner’s apparent breach of the <i>2005 Lease Contract</i> that respondent filed the instant unlawful detainer action.<br><br>One cannot escape the conclusion that, under the foregoing premises, the dispute between the petitioner and respondent arose from the <i>application</i> or <i>execution</i> of the <i>2005 Lease Contract</i>. Undoubtedly, such kinds of dispute are covered by the arbitration clause of the <i>2005 Lease Contract</i> to wit:<br><blockquote>19. <u>Governing Law</u> – The provisions of this [2005 Lease Contract] shall be governed, interpreted and construed in all aspects in accordance with the laws of the Republic of the Philippines.<br><br><b>Any disagreement as to the interpretation, application or execution of this [2005 Lease Contract] shall be submitted to a board of three (3) arbitrators constituted in accordance with the arbitration law of the Philippines.

However, before discussing what these legal effects are, We shall first deal with the challenges posed against the application of such arbitration clause.<br><br><b><i>Challenges Against the Application of the Arbitration Clause of the 2005 Lease Contract&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</i>&nbsp; </b><br><br>Curiously, despite the lucidity of the arbitration clause of the <i>2005 Lease Contract</i>, the petitioner, as well as the MeTC, RTC and the Court of Appeals, vouched for the non-application of the same in the instant case. A plethora of arguments was hurled in favor of bypassing arbitration. We now address them.<br><br>At different points in the proceedings of this case, the following arguments were offered against the application of the arbitration clause of the <i>2005 Lease Contract</i>:<br><ol><li>The disagreement between the petitioner and respondent is non-arbitrable as it will inevitably touch upon the issue of the validity of the <i>2005 Lease Contract</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> It was submitted that one of the reasons offered by the petitioner in justifying its failure to pay under the <i>2005 Lease Contract</i> was the nullity of such contract for being contrary to law and public policy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> The Supreme Court, in <b><i>Gonzales v. Climax Mining, Ltd.</i></b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> held that “<i>the validity of contract cannot be subject of arbitration proceedings” as such questions are “legal in nature and require the application and interpretation of laws and jurisprudence which is necessarily a judicial function</i>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br></li><li>The petitioner cannot validly invoke the arbitration clause of the <i>2005 Lease Contract</i> while, at the same time, impugn such contract’s validity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br></li><li>Even assuming that it can invoke the arbitration clause whilst denying the validity of the <i>2005 Lease Contract</i>, petitioner still did not file a formal application before the MeTC so as to render such arbitration clause operational.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> Section 24 of Republic Act No. 9285 requires the party seeking arbitration to first file a “<i>request</i>” or an application therefor with the court <i>not later than the preliminary conference</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br><br></li><li>Petitioner and respondent already underwent Judicial Dispute Resolution (JDR) proceedings before the RTC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> Hence, a further referral of the dispute to arbitration would only be circuitous.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> Moreover, an ejectment case, in view of its summary nature, already fulfills the prime purpose of arbitration, <i>i.e.</i>, to provide parties in conflict with an expedient method for the resolution of their dispute.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> Arbitration then would no longer be necessary in this case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br></li></ol>None of the arguments have any merit.<br><br><i>First</i>. As highlighted in the previous discussion, the disagreement between the petitioner and respondent falls within the all-encompassing terms of the arbitration clause of the <i>2005 Lease Contract</i>. While it may be conceded that in the arbitration of such disagreement, the validity of the <i>2005 Lease Contract</i>, or at least, of such contract’s rental stipulations would have to be determined, the same would not render such disagreement non-arbitrable. The quotation from <b><i>Gonzales</i></b> that was used to justify the contrary position was taken out of context. A rereading of <b><i>Gonzales</i></b> would fix its relevance to this case.<br><br>In <b><i>Gonzales</i></b>, a complaint for arbitration was filed before the Panel of Arbitrators of the Mines and Geosciences Bureau (PA-MGB) seeking the nullification of a Financial Technical Assistance Agreement and other mining related agreements entered into by private parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> Grounds invoked for the nullification of such agreements include fraud and unconstitutionality.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> The pivotal issue that confronted the Court then was whether the PA-MGB has jurisdiction over that particular arbitration complaint. Stated otherwise, the question was whether the complaint for arbitration raises arbitrable issues that the PA-MGB can take cognizance of.<br><br><b><i>Gonzales</i></b> decided the issue in the negative. In holding that the PA-MGB was devoid of any jurisdiction to take cognizance of the complaint for arbitration, this Court pointed out to the provisions of R.A. No. 7942, or the Mining Act of 1995, which granted the PA-MGB with exclusive original jurisdiction only over <i>mining disputes, i.e.</i>, disputes involving “<i>rights to mining areas</i>,” “<i>mineral agreements or permits,</i>” and “<i>surface owners, occupants, claimholders or concessionaires</i>” requiring the technical knowledge and experience of mining authorities in order to be resolved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> Accordingly, since the complaint for arbitration in <b><i>Gonzales</i></b> did not raise <i>mining disputes</i> as contemplated under R.A. No. 7942 but only issues relating to the validity of certain mining related agreements, this Court held that such complaint could not be arbitrated before the PA-MGB.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> It is in this context that we made the pronouncement now in discussion:<br><blockquote>Arbitration before the Panel of Arbitrators is proper only when there is a disagreement between the parties as to some provisions of the contract between them, which needs the interpretation and the application of that particular knowledge and expertise possessed by members of that Panel. It is not proper when one of the parties repudiates the existence or validity of such contract or agreement on the ground of fraud or oppression as in this case. <b>The validity of the contract cannot be subject of arbitration proceedings.</b> Allegations of fraud and duress in the execution of a contract are matters within the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts of law. <b>These questions are legal in nature and require the application and interpretation of laws and jurisprudence which is necessarily a judicial function.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>The Court in <b><i>Gonzales</i></b> did not simply base its rejection of the complaint for arbitration on the ground that the issue raised therein, <i>i.e.</i>, the validity of contracts, is <i>per se</i> non-arbitrable. The real consideration behind the ruling was the <b>limitation that was placed by R.A. No. 7942 upon the jurisdiction of the PA-MGB as an arbitral body</b>. <b><i>Gonzales</i></b> rejected the complaint for arbitration because the issue raised therein is not a <i>mining dispute</i> per R.A. No. 7942 and it is for this reason, and only for this reason, that such issue is rendered non-arbitrable before the PA-MGB. As stated beforehand, R.A. No. 7942 clearly limited the jurisdiction of the PA-MGB only to <i>mining disputes</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup><br><br>Much more instructive for our purposes, on the other hand, is the recent case of <i><b>Cargill Philippines, Inc. v. San Fernando Regal Trading, Inc</b></i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> In <b><i>Cargill</i></b>, this Court answered the question of whether issues involving the rescission of a contract are arbitrable. The respondent in <b><i>Cargill</i></b> argued against arbitrability, also citing therein <b><i>Gonzales</i></b>. After dissecting <b><i>Gonzales</i></b>, this Court ruled in favor of arbitrability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> Thus, We held:<br><blockquote>Respondent contends that assuming that the existence of the contract and the arbitration clause is conceded, the CA's decision declining referral of the parties' dispute to arbitration is still correct. It claims that its complaint in the RTC presents the issue of whether under the facts alleged, it is entitled to rescind the contract with damages; and that issue constitutes a judicial question or one that requires the exercise of judicial function and cannot be the subject of an arbitration proceeding. Respondent cites our ruling in Gonzales, wherein we held that a panel of arbitrator is bereft of jurisdiction over the complaint for declaration of nullity/or termination of the subject contracts on the grounds of fraud and oppression attendant to the execution of the addendum contract and the other contracts emanating from it, and that the complaint should have been filed with the regular courts as it involved issues which are judicial in nature.<br><br><b>Such argument is misplaced and respondent cannot rely on the <i>Gonzales</i> case to support its argument.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> (Emphasis ours)<br></blockquote><i>Second</i>. Petitioner may still invoke the arbitration clause of the <i>2005 Lease Contract</i> notwithstanding the fact that it assails the validity of such contract. This is due to the <i>doctrine of separability</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup><br><br>Under the doctrine of separability, an arbitration agreement is considered as independent of the main contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> Being a separate contract in itself, the arbitration agreement may thus be invoked regardless of the possible nullity or invalidity of the main contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup><br><br>Once again instructive is <b><i>Cargill</i></b>, wherein this Court held that, as a further consequence of the doctrine of separability, even the very party who repudiates the main contract may invoke its arbitration clause.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup><br><br><i>Third</i>. The operation of the arbitration clause in this case is not at all defeated by the failure of the petitioner to file a formal “<i>request</i>” or application therefor with the MeTC. We find that the filing of a “<i>request</i>” pursuant to Section 24 of R.A. No. 9285 is <i>not</i> the sole means by which an arbitration clause may be validly invoked in a pending suit.<br><br>Section 24 of R.A. No. 9285 reads:<br><blockquote><b>SEC. 24. <i>Referral to Arbitration</i>.</b> - A court before which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject matter of an arbitration agreement shall, if at least one party so <b>requests</b> not later that the pre-trial conference, or upon the request of both parties thereafter, refer the parties to arbitration unless it finds that the arbitration agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed. [Emphasis ours; italics original]<br></blockquote>The “<i>request</i>” referred to in the above provision is, in turn, implemented by Rules 4.1 to 4.3 of A.M. No. 07-11-08-SC or the <i>Special Rules of Court on Alternative Dispute Resolution</i> (Special ADR Rules):<br><br><center><b>RULE 4: REFERRAL TO ADR</b></center><blockquote><b>Rule 4.1.</b> <i>Who makes the request</i>. - A party to a pending action filed in violation of the arbitration agreement, whether contained in an arbitration clause or in a submission agreement, <b>may</b> request the court to refer the parties to arbitration in accordance with such agreement.<br><br><b>Rule 4.2.</b> <i>When to make request</i>. - (A) <i>Where the arbitration agreement exists before the action is filed</i>. - The request for referral shall be made not later than the pre-trial conference. After the pre-trial conference, the court will only act upon the request for referral if it is made with the agreement of all parties to the case.<br><br>(B) <i>Submission agreement</i>. - If there is no existing arbitration agreement at the time the case is filed but the parties subsequently enter into an arbitration agreement, they may request the court to refer their dispute to arbitration at any time during the proceedings.<br><br><b>Rule 4.3.</b> <i>Contents of request</i>. - The request for referral shall be in the form of a motion, which shall state that the dispute is covered by an arbitration agreement.<br><br>Apart from other submissions, the movant shall attach to his motion an authentic copy of the arbitration agreement.<br><br>The request shall contain a notice of hearing addressed to all parties specifying the date and time when it would be heard. The party making the request shall serve it upon the respondent to give him the opportunity to file a comment or opposition as provided in the immediately succeeding Rule before the hearing. [Emphasis ours; italics original]<br></blockquote>Attention must be paid, however, to the salient wordings of Rule 4.1. It reads: “<i>[a] party to a pending action filed in violation of the arbitration agreement x x x <b>may</b> request the court to refer the parties to arbitration in accordance with such agreement</i>.”<br><br>In using the word “<i>may</i>” to qualify the act of filing a “<i>request</i>” under Section 24 of R.A. No. 9285, the Special ADR Rules clearly did not intend to limit the invocation of an arbitration agreement in a pending suit solely <i>via</i> such “<i>request</i>.” After all, non-compliance with an arbitration agreement is a valid defense to any offending suit and, as such, may even be raised in an <i>answer</i> as provided in our ordinary rules of procedure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup><br><br>In this case, it is conceded that petitioner was not able to file a separate “<i>request</i>” of arbitration before the MeTC. However, it is equally conceded that the petitioner, as early as in its <i>Answer with Counterclaim</i>, had already apprised the MeTC of the existence of the arbitration clause in the <i>2005 Lease Contract</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> and, more significantly, of its desire to have the same enforced in this case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> This act of petitioner is enough valid invocation of his right to arbitrate.<br><br><i>Fourth</i>. The fact that the petitioner and respondent already underwent through JDR proceedings before the RTC, will not make the subsequent conduct of arbitration between the parties unnecessary or circuitous. The JDR system is substantially different from arbitration proceedings.<br><br>The JDR framework is based on the processes of <i>mediation, conciliation</i> or <i>early neutral evaluation</i> which entails the submission of a dispute before a “<i>JDR judge</i>” who shall merely “<i>facilitate settlement</i>” between the parties in conflict or make a “<i>non-binding evaluation or assessment of the chances of each party’s case</i>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> Thus in JDR, the JDR judge lacks the authority to render a resolution of the dispute that is binding upon the parties in conflict. In arbitration, on the other hand, the dispute is submitted to an <i>arbitrator/s</i>—a neutral third person or a group of thereof—who shall have the authority to render a resolution binding upon the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup><br><br>Clearly, the mere submission of a dispute to JDR proceedings would <i>not</i> necessarily render the subsequent conduct of arbitration a mere surplusage. The failure of the parties in conflict to reach an amicable settlement before the JDR may, in fact, be supplemented by their resort to arbitration where a binding resolution to the dispute could finally be achieved. This situation precisely finds application to the case at bench.<br><br>Neither would the summary nature of ejectment cases be a valid reason to disregard the enforcement of the arbitration clause of the <i>2005 Lease Contract</i>. Notwithstanding the summary nature of ejectment cases, arbitration still remains relevant as it aims not only to afford the parties an expeditious method of resolving their dispute.<br><br>A pivotal feature of arbitration as an alternative mode of dispute resolution is that it is, first and foremost, a product of <i>party autonomy</i> or the freedom of the parties to “<i>make their own arrangements to resolve their own disputes</i>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> Arbitration agreements manifest not only the desire of the parties in conflict for an expeditious resolution of their dispute. They also represent, if not more so, the parties’ mutual aspiration to achieve such resolution outside of judicial auspices, in a more informal and less antagonistic environment under the terms of their choosing. Needless to state, this critical feature can never be satisfied in an ejectment case no matter how summary it may be.<br><br>Having hurdled all the challenges against the application of the arbitration clause of the <i>2005 Lease Agreement</i> in this case, We shall now proceed with the discussion of its legal effects.<br><br><b><i>Legal Effect of the Application of the Arbitration Clause&nbsp; </i></b><br><br>Since there really are no legal impediments to the application of the arbitration clause of the <i>2005 Contract of Lease</i> in this case, We find that the instant unlawful detainer action was instituted in violation of such clause. The Law, therefore, should have governed the fate of the parties and this suit:<br><blockquote><center><u>R.A. No. 876</u><br></center><br><b>Section 7.</b> <i>Stay of civil action</i>. - If any suit or proceeding be brought upon an issue arising out of an agreement providing for the arbitration thereof, the court in which such suit or proceeding is pending, upon being satisfied that the issue involved in such suit or proceeding is referable to arbitration, <b>shall stay the action or proceeding until an arbitration has been had in accordance with the terms of the agreement</b>: Provided, That the applicant for the stay is not in default in proceeding with such arbitration.

[Emphasis supplied]<br></blockquote>It is clear that under the law, the instant unlawful detainer action should have been stayed;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> the petitioner and the respondent should have been referred to arbitration pursuant to the arbitration clause of the <i>2005 Lease Contract</i>. The MeTC, however, did not do so in violation of the law—which violation was, in turn, affirmed by the RTC and Court of Appeals on appeal.<br><br>The violation by the MeTC of the clear directives under R.A. Nos. 876 and 9285 renders invalid all proceedings it undertook in the ejectment case <b><i><u>after</u></i></b> the filing by petitioner of its <i>Answer with Counterclaim</i>—the point when the petitioner and the respondent should have been referred to arbitration. This case must, therefore, be remanded to the MeTC and be suspended at said point. Inevitably, the decisions of the MeTC, RTC and the Court of Appeals must all be vacated and set aside.<br><br>The petitioner and the respondent must then be referred to arbitration pursuant to the arbitration clause of the <i>2005 Lease Contract</i>.<br><br>This Court is not unaware of the <i>apparent</i> harshness of the Decision that it is about to make.
