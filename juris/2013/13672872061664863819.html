CTA Case Nos. 7227, 7287, and 7317 claim a tax refund or credit of Mindanao II’s alleged excess or unutilized input taxes due to VAT zero-rated sales. In CTA Case No. 7227, Mindanao II claims a tax refund or credit of P3,160,984.69 for the first quarter of 2003. In CTA Case No. 7287, Mindanao II claims a tax refund or credit of P1,562,085.33 for the second quarter of 2003.

Pursuant to the provisions of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC), [Mindanao II] alleges that it can use its accumulated input tax credits to offset its output tax liability. Considering, however that its only revenue-generating activity is VAT zero-rated under RA No. 9136, [Mindanao II’s] input tax credits remain unutilized.<br><br>Thus, on the belief that its sales qualify for VAT zero-rating, [Mindanao II] adopted the VAT zero-rating of the EPIRA in computing for its VAT payable when it filed its Quarterly VAT Returns on the following dates:<br><br><table align="CENTER" border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td rowspan="2" width="25%"><div align="CENTER">CTA Case No.</div></td> <td rowspan="2" width="25%"><div align="CENTER">Period Covered (2003)</div></td> <td colspan="2"><div align="CENTER">Date of Filing</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td width="25%"><div align="CENTER">Original Return</div></td> <td width="25%"><div align="CENTER">Amended Return</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">7227</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">1<sup>st</sup> Quarter</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">April 23, 2003</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">July 3, 2002 (sic), <br> April 1, 2004 &amp; <br> October 22, 2004</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">7287</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">2<sup>nd</sup> Quarter</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">July 22, 2003</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">April 1, 2004</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">7317</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">3<sup>rd</sup> Quarter</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">Oct. 27, 2003</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">April 1, 2004</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">7317</div></td> <td><p align="CENTER">4<sup>th</sup> Quarter</p></td> <td><div align="CENTER">Jan. 26, 2004</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">April 1, 2004</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br><br>Considering that it has accumulated unutilized creditable input taxes from its only income-generating activity, [Mindanao II] filed an application for refund and/or issuance of tax credit certificate with the BIR’s Revenue District Office at Kidapawan City on April 13, 2005 for the four quarters of 2003.<br><br>To date [(September 22, 2008)], the application for refund by [Mindanao II] remains unacted upon by the [CIR].

The CIR further stated that Section 229 is a general provision, and governs cases not covered by Section 112(A).

CTA Case Nos. 7228, 7286, and 7318 claim a tax refund or credit of Mindanao I’s accumulated unutilized and/or excess input taxes due to VAT zero-rated sales.

It is therefore misleading to state that <i>Atlas</i> was the controlling doctrine at the time of filing of the claims.</b> The 1997 Tax Code, which took effect on 1 January 1998, was the applicable law at the time of filing of the claims in issue. As this Court explained in the recent consolidated cases of <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. San Roque Power Corporation, Taganito Mining Corporation v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, and Philex Mining Corporation v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue (San Roque)</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br><blockquote>Clearly, San Roque failed to comply with the 120-day waiting period, the time expressly given by law to the Commissioner to decide whether to grant or deny San Roque’s application for tax refund or credit. It is indisputable that compliance with the 120-day waiting period is <b>mandatory and jurisdictional</b>. The waiting period, originally fixed at 60 days only, was part of the provisions of the first VAT law, Executive Order No. 273, which took effect on 1 January 1988. The waiting period was extended to 120 days effective 1 January 1998 under RA 8424 or the Tax Reform Act of 1997. <b>Thus, the waiting period has been in our statute books for more than fifteen (15) years <i>before</i> San Roque filed its judicial claim.</b><br><br>Failure to comply with the 120-day waiting period violates a mandatory provision of law. It violates the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies and renders the petition premature and thus without a cause of action, with the effect that the CTA does not acquire jurisdiction over the taxpayer’s petition. Philippine jurisprudence is replete with cases upholding and reiterating these doctrinal principles.<br><br>The charter of the CTA expressly provides that its jurisdiction is to review on appeal “<b>decisions</b> of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue in cases involving x x x refunds of internal revenue taxes.” When a taxpayer prematurely files a judicial claim for tax refund or credit with the CTA without waiting for the decision of the Commissioner, there is no “decision” of the Commissioner to review and thus the CTA as a court of special jurisdiction has no jurisdiction over the appeal. The charter of the CTA also expressly provides that if the Commissioner fails to decide within “<b>a specific period</b>” required by law, such “<b>inaction shall be deemed a denial</b>” of the application for tax refund or credit. It is the Commissioner’s decision, or inaction “deemed a denial,” that the taxpayer can take to the CTA for review. Without a decision or an “inaction x x x deemed a denial” of the Commissioner, the CTA has no jurisdiction over a petition for review.<br><br>San Roque’s failure to comply with the 120-day <b>mandatory</b> period renders its petition for review with the CTA void. Article 5 of the Civil Code provides, “Acts executed against provisions of mandatory or prohibitory laws shall be void, except when the law itself authorizes their validity.” San Roque’s void petition for review cannot be legitimized by the CTA or this Court because Article 5 of the Civil Code states that such void petition cannot be legitimized “except when the law itself authorizes [its] validity.” There is no law authorizing the petition’s validity.<br><br>It is hornbook doctrine that a person committing a void act contrary to a mandatory provision of law cannot claim or acquire any right from his void act. A right cannot spring in favor of a person from his own void or illegal act. This doctrine is repeated in Article 2254 of the Civil Code, which states, “No vested or acquired right can arise from acts or omissions which are against the law or which infringe upon the rights of others.” For violating a mandatory provision of law in filing its petition with the CTA, San Roque cannot claim any right arising from such void petition. Thus, San Roque’s petition with the CTA is a mere scrap of paper.<br><br>This Court cannot brush aside the grave issue of the mandatory and jurisdictional nature of the 120-day period just because the Commissioner merely asserts that the case was prematurely filed with the CTA and does not question the entitlement of San Roque to the refund. The mere fact that a taxpayer has undisputed excess input VAT, or that the tax was admittedly illegally, erroneously or excessively collected from him, does not entitle him as a matter of right to a tax refund or credit. Strict compliance with the mandatory and jurisdictional conditions prescribed by law to claim such tax refund or credit is essential and necessary for such claim to prosper. <b>Well-settled is the rule that tax refunds or credits, just like tax exemptions, are strictly construed against the taxpayer</b>. The burden is on the taxpayer to show that he has strictly complied with the conditions for the grant of the tax refund or credit.<br><br>This Court cannot disregard mandatory and jurisdictional conditions mandated by law simply because the Commissioner chose not to contest the numerical correctness of the claim for tax refund or credit of the taxpayer. Non-compliance with mandatory periods, non-observance of prescriptive periods, and non-adherence to exhaustion of administrative remedies <b>bar</b> a taxpayer’s claim for tax refund or credit, whether or not the Commissioner questions the numerical correctness of the claim of the taxpayer. This Court should not establish the precedent that non-compliance with mandatory and jurisdictional conditions can be excused if the claim is otherwise meritorious, particularly in claims for tax refunds or credit. Such precedent will render meaningless compliance with mandatory and jurisdictional requirements, for then every tax refund case will have to be decided on the numerical correctness of the amounts claimed, regardless of non-compliance with mandatory and jurisdictional conditions.<br><br>San Roque cannot also claim being misled, misguided or confused by the <i>Atlas</i> doctrine because <b>San Roque filed its petition for review with the CTA more than four years before <i>Atlas</i> was promulgated.</b> The <i>Atlas</i> doctrine did not exist at the time San Roque failed to comply with the 120-day period. Thus, San Roque cannot invoke the <i>Atlas</i> doctrine as an excuse for its failure to wait for the 120-day period to lapse. In any event, the <i>Atlas</i> doctrine merely stated that the two-year prescriptive period should be counted from the date of payment of the output VAT, not from the close of the taxable quarter when the sales involving the input VAT were made. <b>The Atlas doctrine does not interpret, expressly or impliedly, the 120+30 day periods</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> (Emphases in the original; citations omitted)</blockquote><br><i>Prescriptive Period for the <br>Filing of Administrative Claims</i><br><br>In determining whether the administrative claims of Mindanao I and Mindanao II for 2003 have prescribed, we see no need to rely on either <i>Atlas </i>or <i>Mirant.</i> Section 112(A) of the 1997 Tax Code is clear: “[A]ny VAT-registered person, whose sales are zero-rated or effectively zero-rated may, <b>within two (2) years after the close of the taxable quarter when the sales were made,</b> apply for the issuance of a tax credit certificate or refund of creditable input tax due or paid attributable to such sales x x x.”<br><br>We rule on Mindanao I and II’s administrative claims for the first, second, third, and fourth quarters of 2003 as follows:<br><br>(1) The last day for filing an application for tax refund or credit with the CIR for the first quarter of 2003 was on 31 March 2005.

Mindanao II filed its administrative claim before the CIR on 13 April 2005, while Mindanao I filed its administrative claim before the CIR on 4 April 2005. <b>Both claims were filed on time, pursuant to Section 112(A) of the 1997 Tax Code.</b><br><br>(4) The last day for filing an application for tax refund or credit with the CIR for the fourth quarter of 2003 was on 2 January 2006. Mindanao II filed its administrative claim before the CIR on 13 April 2005, while Mindanao I filed its administrative claim before the CIR on 4 April 2005. <b> Both claims were filed on time, pursuant to Section 112(A) of the 1997 Tax Code.</b><br><br><i>Prescriptive Period for<br>the Filing of Judicial Claims</i><br><br>In determining whether the claims for the second, third and fourth quarters of 2003 have been properly appealed, we still see no need to refer to either <i>Atlas </i>or <i>Mirant,</i> or even to Section 229 of the 1997 Tax Code. The second paragraph of Section 112(C) of the 1997 Tax Code is clear: “In case of full or partial denial of the claim for tax refund or tax credit, or the failure on the part of the Commissioner to act on the application within the period prescribed above, the taxpayer affected may, within thirty (30) days from the receipt of the decision denying the claim or after the expiration of the one hundred twenty day-period, appeal the decision or the unacted claim with the Court of Tax Appeals.”<br><br>The mandatory and jurisdictional nature of the 120+30 day periods was explained in <i>San Roque</i>:<br><br><blockquote>At the time San Roque filed its petition for review with the CTA, the 120+30 day mandatory periods were already in the law. Section 112(C) expressly grants the Commissioner 120 days within which to decide the taxpayer’s claim. The law is clear, plain, and unequivocal: “x x x the Commissioner shall grant a refund or issue the tax credit certificate for creditable input taxes within one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of submission of complete documents.” Following the verba legis doctrine, this law must be applied exactly as worded since it is clear, plain, and unequivocal. The taxpayer cannot simply file a petition with the CTA without waiting for the Commissioner’s decision within the 120-day mandatory and jurisdictional period. The CTA will have no jurisdiction because there will be no “decision” or “deemed a denial” decision of the Commissioner for the CTA to review. In San Roque’s case, it filed its petition with the CTA a mere 13 days after it filed its administrative claim with the Commissioner. Indisputably, San Roque knowingly violated the mandatory 120-day period, and it cannot blame anyone but itself.<br><br>Section 112(C) also expressly grants the taxpayer a 30-day period to appeal to the CTA the decision or inaction of the Commissioner, thus:<br><br><blockquote>x x x the taxpayer affected may, <b>within thirty (30) days from the receipt of the decision denying the claim or after the expiration of the one hundred twenty day-period</b>, appeal the decision or the unacted claim with the Court of Tax Appeals. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>This law is clear, plain, and unequivocal. Following the well-settled <i>verba legis</i> doctrine, this law should be applied exactly as worded since it is clear, plain, and unequivocal. As this law states, the taxpayer may, if he wishes, appeal the decision of the Commissioner to the CTA within 30 days from receipt of the Commissioner’s decision, or if the Commissioner does not act on the taxpayer’s claim within the 120-day period, the taxpayer may appeal to the CTA within 30 days from the expiration of the 120-day period.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>There are three compelling reasons why the 30-day period need not necessarily fall within the two-year prescriptive period, as long as the administrative claim is filed within the two-year prescriptive period.<br><br><i>First</i>, Section 112(A) clearly, plainly, and unequivocally provides that the taxpayer “may, <b>within two (2) years</b> after the close of the taxable quarter when the sales were made, <b>apply for the issuance of a tax credit certificate or refund</b> of the creditable input tax due or paid to such sales.” In short, the law states that the taxpayer may apply with the Commissioner for a refund or credit <b>“within two (2) years,” which means at anytime within two years</b>. Thus, the application for refund or credit may be filed by the taxpayer with the Commissioner on the last day of the two-year prescriptive period and it will still strictly comply with the law. The two-year prescriptive period is a grace period in favor of the taxpayer and he can avail of the full period before his right to apply for a tax refund or credit is barred by prescription.<br><br>Second, Section 112(C) provides that the Commissioner shall decide the application for refund or credit “within one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of submission of complete documents in support of the application filed in accordance with Subsection (A).” The reference in Section 112(C) of the submission of documents “in support of the application filed in accordance with Subsection A” means that the application in Section 112(A) is the administrative claim that the Commissioner must decide within the 120-day period. In short, the two-year prescriptive period in Section 112(A) refers to the period within which the taxpayer can file an administrative claim for tax refund or credit. <b> Stated otherwise, the two-year prescriptive period does not refer to the filing of the judicial claim with the CTA but to the filing of the administrative claim with the Commissioner.</b> As held in <i>Aichi</i>, the “phrase ‘within two years x x x apply for the issuance of a tax credit or refund’ <b>refers to applications for refund/credit with the CIR and not to appeals made to the CTA.</b>”<br><br><i>Third</i>, if the 30-day period, or any part of it, is required to fall within the two-year prescriptive period (equivalent to 730 days), then the taxpayer must file his administrative claim for refund or credit within the first 610 days of the two-year prescriptive period.<b> Otherwise, the filing of the administrative claim beyond the first 610 days will result in the appeal to the CTA being filed beyond the two-year prescriptive period</b>. Thus, if the taxpayer files his administrative claim on the 611<sup>th</sup> day, the Commissioner, with his 120-day period, will have until the 731<sup>st</sup> day to decide the claim. If the Commissioner decides only on the 731<sup>st</sup> day, or does not decide at all, the taxpayer can no longer file his judicial claim with the CTA because the two-year prescriptive period (equivalent to 730 days) has lapsed. The 30-day period granted by law to the taxpayer to file an appeal before the CTA becomes utterly useless, even if the taxpayer complied with the law by filing his administrative claim within the two-year prescriptive period.<br><br>The theory that the 30-day period must fall within the two-year prescriptive period adds a condition that is not found in the law. It results in truncating 120 days from the 730 days that the law grants the taxpayer for filing his administrative claim with the Commissioner. This Court cannot interpret a law to defeat, wholly or even partly, a remedy that the law expressly grants in clear, plain, and unequivocal language.<br><br>Section 112(A) and (C) must be interpreted according to its clear, plain, and unequivocal language. The taxpayer can file his administrative claim for refund or credit at <b>anytime</b> within the two-year prescriptive period. If he files his claim on the last day of the two-year prescriptive period, his claim is still filed on time. The Commissioner will have 120 days from such filing to decide the claim. If the Commissioner decides the claim on the 120th day, or does not decide it on that day, the taxpayer still has 30 days to file his judicial claim with the CTA. This is not only the plain meaning but also the only logical interpretation of Section 112(A) and (C).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> (Emphases in the original; citations omitted)</blockquote><br>In <i>San Roque</i>, this Court ruled that “<b>all taxpayers can rely on BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 from the time of its issuance on 10 December 2003 up to its reversal in <i>Aichi</i> on 6 October 2010, where this Court held that the 120+30 day periods are mandatory and jurisdictional.</b>”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> We shall discuss later the effect of <i>San Roque’s </i>recognition of BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 on claims filed between 10 December 2003 and 6 October 2010.

In <i>San Roque</i>, we reiterated that “[f]ollowing the <i>verba legis</i> doctrine, [Section 112(C)] must be applied exactly as worded since it is clear, plain, and unequivocal. The taxpayer cannot simply file a petition with the CTA without waiting for the Commissioner’s decision within the 120-day mandatory and jurisdictional period. The CTA will have no jurisdiction because there will be no ‘decision’ or ‘deemed a denial decision’ of the Commissioner for the CTA to review.”<br><br>Notwithstanding a strict construction of any claim for tax exemption or refund, the Court in <i>San Roque</i> recognized that BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 constitutes equitable estoppel<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> in favor of taxpayers. <b>BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 expressly states that the “taxpayer-claimant need not wait for the lapse of the 120-day period before it could seek judicial relief with the CTA by way of Petition for Review</b>.” This Court discussed BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 and its effect on taxpayers, thus:<br><br><blockquote>Taxpayers should not be prejudiced by an erroneous interpretation by the Commissioner, particularly on a difficult question of law. The abandonment of the <i>Atlas</i> doctrine by <i>Mirant</i> and <i>Aichi</i> is proof that the reckoning of the prescriptive periods for input VAT tax refund or credit is a difficult question of law. The abandonment of the <i>Atlas </i>doctrine did not result in <i>Atlas,</i> or other taxpayers similarly situated, being made to return the tax refund or credit they received or could have received under <i>Atlas</i> prior to its abandonment. This Court is applying Mirant and Aichi prospectively. Absent fraud, bad faith or misrepresentation, the reversal by this Court of a general interpretative rule issued by the Commissioner, like the reversal of a specific BIR ruling under Section 246, should also apply prospectively. x x x.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Thus, the only issue is whether BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 is a general interpretative rule applicable to all taxpayers or a specific ruling applicable only to a particular taxpayer.<br><br>BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 is a general interpretative rule because it was a response to a query made, not by a particular taxpayer, but by a government agency tasked with processing tax refunds and credits, that is, the One Stop Shop Inter-Agency Tax Credit and Drawback Center of the Department of Finance. This government agency is also the addressee, or the entity responded to, in BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03. Thus, while this government agency mentions in its query to the Commissioner the administrative claim of Lazi Bay Resources Development, Inc., the agency was in fact asking the Commissioner what to do in cases like the tax claim of Lazi Bay Resources Development, Inc., where the taxpayer did not wait for the lapse of the 120-day period.<br><br>Clearly, BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 is a general interpretative rule. Thus, all taxpayers can rely on BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 from the time of its issuance on 10 December 2003 up to its reversal by this Court in <i>Aichi</i> on 6 October 2010, where this Court held that the 120+30 day periods are mandatory and jurisdictional.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Taganito, however, filed its judicial claim with the CTA on 14 February 2007, <b><i>after </i></b>the issuance of BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 on 10 December 2003. Truly, Taganito can claim that in filing its judicial claim prematurely without waiting for the 120-day period to expire, it was misled by BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03. Thus, Taganito can claim the benefit of BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03, which shields the filing of its judicial claim from the vice of prematurity.
