The CA, however, denied for lack of merit the said motion in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> dated April 17, 2006.<br><br>Hence, this Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari.</i><br><br><center><b>Issue</b></center><br>The basic issue in this case is whether the CA correctly modified the RTC Decision with respect to interests.<br><br><b><i>The Parties’ Arguments</i></b><br><br>As may be recalled, the RTC under paragraphs 2 and 3 of the dispositive portion of its Decision ordered the spouses Bonrostro to pay the spouses Luna the sums of P300,000.00 plus interest of 2% per month <i>from April 1993 to November 1993</i> and P330,000.00 plus interest of 2% per month <i>from July 1993 to November 1993</i>, respectively.&nbsp; The CA modified these by reckoning the payment of the 2% interest on the P300,000.00 from <i>May 1, 1993 until fully</i> paid and by <i>imposing interest at the legal rate</i> on the P330,000.00 reckoned from <i>August 1, 1993 until fully paid.</i><br><br>The spouses Bonrostro harp on the factual finding of the RTC, as affirmed by the CA, that Lourdes was willing and ready to pay her obligation as evidenced by her November 24, 1993 letter to Atty. Carbon.&nbsp; They also assert that the sending of the said letter constitutes a valid tender of payment on their part.&nbsp; Hence, they argue that they should not be assessed any interest subsequent to the date of the said letter.&nbsp; Neither should they be ordered to pay interest on the amount of P214,492.62 which covers the amortizations paid by the spouses Luna to Bliss.&nbsp; They point out that it was Constancia who prevented them from fulfilling their obligation to pay the amortizations when she instructed Bliss not to accept payment from them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>The spouses Luna, on the other hand, aver that the November 24, 1993 letter of Lourdes is not equivalent to tender of payment since the mere sending of a letter expressing the intention to pay, without the accompanying payment, cannot be considered a valid tender of payment.&nbsp; Also, if the spouses Bonrostro were really willing and ready to pay at that time and assuming that the spouses Luna indeed refused to accept payment, the former should have resorted to consignation.&nbsp; Anent the payment of amortization, the spouses Luna explain that under the parties’ Contract to Sell, Lourdes was to assume Constancia’s balance to Bliss by paying the monthly amortization in order to avoid the cancellation of the earlier Contract to Sell entered into by Constancia with Bliss.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>&nbsp; However, since Lourdes was remiss in paying the same, the spouses Luna were constrained to pay the amortization.&nbsp; They thus assert that reimbursement to them of the said amount with interest is proper considering that by reason of such payment, the spouses Bonrostro were spared from the interests and penalties which would have been imposed by Bliss if the amortizations remained unpaid.<br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b></center><br>The Petition lacks merit.<br><br><i>The spouses Bonrostro’s reliance on the<br>RTC’s&nbsp; factual finding that Lourdes was <br>willing and ready to pay on November <br>24, 1993 is misplaced.</i><br><br>As mentioned, the RTC in resolving the Complaint focused on the sole issue of whether the failure of spouses Bonrostro to pay the installments of P300,000.00 on April 30, 1993 and P330,000.00 on July 31, 1993 is a substantial breach of their obligation under the contract as to warrant the rescission of the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>&nbsp; The said court ratiocinated, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>After careful evaluation of the evidence testimonial and documentary, the Court believes that the defendants[’] delay in the payment of the two installment[s] is not so substantial [as to] warrant [rescission] of contract.&nbsp; Although, the defendant failed to pay the two installments [i]n due time, she was able to communicate with the plaintiffs through letters requesting for an extension of two months within which to pay the installment[s].&nbsp; In fact, on November 24, 1993 defendant informed Atty. Arlene Carbon that she was ready to pay the installments and the money is ready for pick-up.&nbsp; However, plaintiff did not bother to get or pick-up the money without any valid reason.&nbsp; It would be very prejudicial on the part of the defendant if the contract to sell be rescinded considering that she made a downpayment of P200,000.00 and made partial amortization to the Bliss Development Corporation.&nbsp; In fact, the defendant testified that she is willing and ready to pay the balance including the interest on November 24, 1993.<br><br>The Court is of the opinion that the delay in the payment of the balance of the purchase price of the house and lot is not [so] substantial [as to] warrant the rescission of the contract to sell.&nbsp; The question of whether a breach of contract is substantial depends upon the attendant circumstance.&nbsp; x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></blockquote><br>Clearly, the RTC arrived at the above-quoted conclusion based on its mistaken premise that rescission is applicable to the case.&nbsp; Hence, its determination of whether there was substantial breach.&nbsp; As may be recalled, however, the CA, in its assailed Decision, found the contract between the parties as a contract to sell, specifically of a real property on installment basis, and as such categorically declared rescission to be not the proper remedy.&nbsp; This is considering that in a contract to sell, payment of the price is a positive suspensive condition, failure of which is not a breach of contract warranting rescission under Article 1191<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> of the Civil Code but rather just an event that prevents the supposed seller from being bound to convey title to the supposed buyer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>&nbsp; Also, and as correctly ruled by the CA, Article 1191 cannot be applied to sales of real property on installment since they are governed by the Maceda Law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>There being no breach to speak of in case of non-payment of the purchase price in a contract to sell, as in this case, the RTC’s factual finding that Lourdes was willing and able to pay her obligation – a conclusion arrived at in connection with the said court’s determination of whether the non-payment of the purchase price in accordance with the terms of the contract was a substantial breach warranting rescission – therefore loses significance.&nbsp; The spouses Bonrostro’s reliance on the said factual finding is thus misplaced.&nbsp; They cannot invoke their readiness and willingness to pay their obligation on November 24, 1993 as an excuse from being made liable for interest beyond the said date.<br><br><i>The spouses Bonrostro are liable for<br>interest on the installments due from the<br>date of default until fully paid.</i><br><br>The spouses Bonrostro assert that Lourdes’ letter of November 24, 1993 amounts to tender of payment of the remaining balance amounting to P630,000.00.&nbsp; Accordingly, thenceforth, accrual of interest should be suspended.<br><br>Tender of payment “is the manifestation by the debtor of a desire to comply with or pay an obligation.&nbsp; If refused without just cause, the tender of payment will discharge the debtor of the obligation to pay but only after a valid consignation of the sum due shall have been made with the proper court.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; “Consignation is the deposit of the [proper amount with a judicial authority] in accordance with rules prescribed by law, after the tender of payment has been refused or because of circumstances which render direct payment to the creditor impossible or inadvisable.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>“Tender of payment, without more, produces no effect.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>&nbsp; “[T]o have the effect of payment and the consequent extinguishment of the obligation to pay, the law requires the companion acts of tender of payment and consignation.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>As to the effect of tender of payment on interest, noted civilist Arturo M. Tolentino explained as follows:<br><br><blockquote>When a tender of payment is made in such a form that the creditor could have immediately realized payment if he had accepted the tender, followed by a prompt attempt of the debtor to deposit the means of payment in court by way of consignation, the accrual of interest on the obligation will be suspended from the date of such tender. <b> But when the tender of payment is not accompanied by the means of payment, and the debtor did not take any immediate step to make a consignation, then interest is not suspended from the time of such tender. </b>x x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>Here, the subject letter merely states Lourdes’ willingness and readiness to pay but it was not accompanied by payment.&nbsp; She claimed that she made numerous telephone calls to Atty. Carbon reminding the latter to collect her payment, but, neither said lawyer nor Constancia came to collect the payment.&nbsp; After that, the spouses Bonrostro took no further steps to effect payment.&nbsp; They did not resort to consignation of the payment with the proper court despite knowledge that under the contract, non-payment of the installments on the agreed date would make them liable for interest thereon.&nbsp; The spouses Bonrostro erroneously assumed that their notice to pay would excuse them from paying interest.&nbsp; Their claimed tender of payment did not produce any effect whatsoever because it was not accompanied by actual payment or followed by consignation. Hence, it did not suspend the running of interest.&nbsp; The spouses Bonrostro are therefore liable for interest on the subject installments from the date of default until full payment of the sums of P300,000.00 and P330,000.00.<br><br><i>The spouses Bonrostro are likewise liable <br>for interest on the amount paid by the <br>spouses Luna to Bliss as amortization.</i><br><br>The spouses Bonrostro want to be relieved from paying interest on the amount of P214,492.62 which the spouses Luna paid to Bliss as amortizations by asserting that they were prevented by the latter from fulfilling such obligation.&nbsp; They invoke Art. 1186 of the Civil Code which provides that “the condition shall be deemed fulfilled when the <i>obligor</i> voluntarily prevents its fulfillment.”<br><br>However, the Court finds Art. 1186 inapplicable to this case.&nbsp; The said provision explicitly speaks of a situation where it is the obligor who voluntarily prevents fulfillment of the condition.&nbsp; Here, Constancia is not the obligor but the obligee.&nbsp; Moreover, even if this significant detail is to be ignored, the mere intention to prevent the happening of the condition or the mere placing of ineffective obstacles to its compliance, without actually preventing fulfillment is not sufficient for the application of Art. 1186.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>&nbsp; Two requisites must concur for its application, to wit: (1) intent to prevent fulfillment of the condition; and, (2) actual prevention of compliance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>In this case, while it is undisputed that Constancia indeed instructed Bliss on March 4, 1994 not to accept payment from anyone but her, there is nothing on record to show that Bliss heeded the instruction of Constancia as to actually prevent the spouses Bonrostro from making payments to Bliss.&nbsp; There is no showing that subsequent to the said letter, the spouses Bonrostro attempted to make payment to and was refused by Bliss.&nbsp; Neither was there a witness presented to prove that Bliss indeed gave effect to the instruction contained in Constancia’s letter.&nbsp; While Bliss’ Project Development Officer, Mr. Ariel Cordero, testified during trial, nothing could be gathered from his testimony regarding this except for the fact that Bliss received the said letter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>&nbsp; In view of these, the spouses Luna could not be said to have placed an effective obstacle as to actually prevent the spouses Bonrostro from making amortization payments to Bliss.<br><br>On the other hand, there are telling circumstances which militate against the spouses Bonrostro’s claimed keenness to comply with their obligation to pay the monthly amortization.&nbsp; After the execution of the contract in January 1993, they immediately took possession of the property but failed to make amortization payments.&nbsp; It was only after seven months or on November 18, 1993 that they made payments to Bliss in the amount of P46,303.44.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>&nbsp; Whether the same covers previous unpaid amortizations is also not clear as the receipt does not indicate the same<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> and per Statement of Account<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> as of March 8, 1994 issued by Bliss, the unpaid monthly amortizations for February to November 1993 in the total amount of P78,271.69 remained outstanding.&nbsp; There was also no payment made of the amortizations due on December 4, 1993 and January 4, 1994<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> before the filing of the Complaint on January 11, 1994.<br><br>On the part of the spouses Luna, it is understandable that they paid the amortizations due. The assumption of payment of the monthly amortization to Bliss was made part of the obligations of the spouses Bonrostro under their contract with the spouses Luna precisely to avoid the cancellation of the earlier contract entered into by Constancia with Bliss.&nbsp; But as the spouses Bonrostro failed in this obligation, the spouses Luna were constrained to pay Bliss to avoid the adverse effect of such failure.&nbsp; This act of the spouses Luna proved to be even more beneficial to the spouses Bonrostro as the cancellation of the Contract to Sell between Constancia and Bliss would result in the cancellation of the subsequent Contract to Sell between Constancia and Lourdes.&nbsp; Also, the spouses Bonrostro were relieved from paying the penalties that would have been imposed by Bliss if the monthly amortizations covered by the said payment remained unpaid. The Statements of Account<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> issued by Bliss clearly state that each monthly amortization is due on or before the fourth day of every month and a penalty equivalent to 1/10th of 1% per day of delay shall be imposed for all payments made after due date.&nbsp; That translates to 3% monthly or 36% <i>per annum</i> rate of interest, three times higher than the 12% <i>per annum</i> rate of interest correctly imposed by the CA.<br><br>Hence, the resulting situation is that the spouses Luna are constrained to part with their money while the spouses Bonrostro, despite being remiss in their obligation to pay the monthly amortization, are relieved from paying higher penalties at the expense of the former.&nbsp; This is aside from the fact that the spouses Bonrostro are in continued possession of the subject property and are enjoying the beneficial use thereof.&nbsp; Under the circumstances and considering that the spouses Bonrostro are obviously in delay in complying with their obligation to pay the amortizations due from February 1993 to January 1995 for which the spouses Luna paid P214,492.62,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> the CA correctly ordered the reimbursement to the latter of the said amount with interest. “Delay in the performance of an obligation is looked upon with disfavor because, when a party to a contract incurs delay, the other party who performs his part of the contract suffers damages thereby.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup>&nbsp; As discussed, the spouses Luna obviously suffered damages brought about by the failure of the spouses Bonrostro to comply with their obligation on time. “And, sans elaboration of the matter at hand, damages take the form of interest x x x.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>&nbsp; Under Article 2209 of the Civil Code, “[i]f the obligation consists in the payment of a sum of money, and the debtor incurs in delay, the indemnity for damages, there being no stipulation to the contrary, shall be the payment of the interest agreed upon, and in the absence of stipulation, the legal interest x x x.”&nbsp; There being no stipulation on interest in case of delay in the payment of amortization, the CA thus correctly imposed interest at the legal rate which is now 12% <span style="font-style: italic;">per annum.</span><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i> is <b>DENIED</b> and the assailed Decision dated April 15, 2005 and the Resolution dated April 17, 2006 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
