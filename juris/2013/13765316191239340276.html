Ordering all the abovenamed heirs to commission the survey of Lot 826-A-1 or to authorize in writing, one of them to commission such survey, in order to avoid a chaotic situation similar to the case at bar.&nbsp;

But since more than five years have elapsed from the time the Writ of Execution should have been enforced, the RTC denied the Motion in its Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> dated August 16, 2005.<br><br>This prompted respondent to file with the RTC a Petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> for Revival of Judgment, which was docketed as Civil Case No. 05-131.&nbsp; Petitioners opposed the revival of judgment assailing, among others, the jurisdiction of the RTC to take cognizance of the Petition for Revival of Judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>On June 20, 2006, the RTC rendered a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> granting the Petition.

They insist that it is the Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC), not the RTC, which has jurisdiction over the Petition for Revival of Judgment since the amount in the tax declarations of the properties involved is less than Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>&nbsp; They likewise assail the Decision dated August 30, 1999, claiming that the deeds and certificates of title subject of Civil Case No. 94-612 were falsified.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br><b><i>Respondent’s Arguments</i></b><br><br>Respondent, on the other hand, maintains that the Notice of Appeal was belatedly filed,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> and that the revival of judgment is unappealable as it is barred by prescription.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b><br></center><br>The Petition lacks merit.<br><br><b><i>The Notice of Appeal was belatedly filed.</i></b><br><br>It is basic and elementary that a Notice of Appeal should be filed “within fifteen (15) days from notice of the judgment or final order appealed from.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Under Section 3,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Rule 13 of the Rules of Court, pleadings may be filed in court either personally or by registered mail.&nbsp; In the first case, the date of filing is the date of receipt.&nbsp; In the second case, the date of mailing is the date of receipt.<br><br>In this case, however, the counsel for petitioners filed the Notice of Appeal via a private courier, a mode of filing not provided in the Rules.&nbsp; Though not prohibited by the Rules, we cannot consider the filing of petitioners’ Notice of Appeal via LBC timely filed.&nbsp; It is established jurisprudence that “the date of delivery of pleadings to a private letter-forwarding agency is not to be considered as the date of filing thereof in court;” instead, “the date of actual receipt by the court x x x is deemed the date of filing of that pleading.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>&nbsp; Records show that the Notice of Appeal was mailed on the 15<sup>th</sup> day and was received by the court on the 16<sup>th</sup> day or one day beyond the reglementary period.&nbsp; Thus, the CA correctly ruled that the Notice of Appeal was filed out of time.<br><br>Neither can petitioners use typhoon “Florita” as an excuse for the belated filing of the Notice of Appeal because work in government offices in Metro Manila was not suspended on July 13, 2006, the day petitioners’ Notice of Appeal was mailed via LBC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>And even if we, in the interest of justice, give due course to the appeal despite its late filing, the result would still be the same.&nbsp; The appeal would still be denied for lack of merit.<br><br><b><i>The Decision dated August 30, 1999 is <br>already final and executory.&nbsp; </i></b><br><br>An action for revival of judgment is a new and independent action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>&nbsp; It is different and distinct from the original judgment sought to be revived or enforced.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>&nbsp; As such, a party aggrieved by a decision of a court in an action for revival of judgment may appeal the decision, but only insofar as the merits of the action for revival is concerned.&nbsp; The original judgment, which is already final and executory, may no longer be reversed, altered, or modified.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>In this case, petitioners assail the Decision dated August 30, 1999, which is the original judgment sought to be revived or enforced by respondent.&nbsp; Considering that the said Decision had already attained finality, petitioners may no longer question its correctness.&nbsp; As we have said, only the merits of the action for revival may be appealed, not the merits of the original judgment sought to be revived or enforced.<br><br><b><i>RTC has jurisdiction over the<br>Petition for Revival of Judgment. </i></b><br><br>As to whether the RTC has jurisdiction, we rule in the affirmative.&nbsp; An action for revival of judgment may be filed either “in the same court where said judgment was rendered or in the place where the plaintiff or defendant resides, or in any other place designated by the statutes which treat of the venue of actions in general.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>&nbsp; In this case, respondent filed the Petition for Revival of Judgment in the same court which rendered the Decision dated August 30, 1999.<br><br>All told, we find no error on the part of the CA in denying the Petition and dismissing the appeal for having been filed out of time.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition is hereby <b>DENIED</b>.&nbsp;
