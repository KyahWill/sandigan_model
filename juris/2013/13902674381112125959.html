The RTC then issued the Order,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> dated February 24, 1992, disapproving the Republic’s appeal for failure to perfect it as it failed to notify the Bacases and granting the writ of execution.<br><br><i>Action of the Court of<br>Appeals and the Court<br>regarding the Republic’s<br>Appeal</i><br><br>The Republic filed a Notice of Appeal on April 1, 1992 from the February 24, 1992 of the RTC.

The CA sustained the government and, accordingly, annulled the said RTC order.<br><br>The respondents appealed to the Court, which later found no commission of a reversible error on the part of the CA.

CV No. 64142.<br><br>On November 12, 2007, the CA affirmed the ruling of the RTC. It explained that once a decree of registration was issued under the Torrens system and the reglementary period had passed within which the decree may be questioned, the title was perfected and could not be collaterally questioned later on.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Even assuming that an action for the nullification of the original certificate of title may still be instituted, the review of a decree of registration under Section 38 of Act No. 496 [Section 32 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1529] would only prosper upon proof that the registration was procured through actual fraud,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> which proceeded from an intentional deception perpetrated through the misrepresentation or the concealment of a material fact.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> The CA stressed that “[t]he fraud must be actual and extrinsic, not merely constructive or intrinsic; the evidence thereof must be clear, convincing and more than merely preponderant, because the proceedings which are assailed as having been fraudulent are judicial proceedings which by law, are presumed to have been fair and regular.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Citing the rule that “[t]he fraud is extrinsic if it is employed to deprive parties of their day in court and, thus, prevent them from asserting their right to the property registered in the name of the applicant,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> the CA found that there was none.&nbsp; The CA agreed with the RTC that there was substantial compliance with the requirement of the law. The allegation of the respondent that Camp Evangelista occupied portions of their property negated the complaint that they committed misrepresentation or concealment amounting to fraud.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>As regards the issue of exemption from the proclamation, the CA deemed that a discussion was unnecessary because the LRC already resolved it. The CA stressed that the proceeding was one<i> in rem</i>, thereby binding everyone to the legal effects of the same and that a decree of registration that had become final should be deemed conclusive not only on the questions actually contested and determined, but also upon all matters that might be litigated or decided in the land registration proceeding.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>Not in conformity, the Republic filed a motion for reconsideration which was denied on May 15, 2008 for lack of merit.<br><br>Hence, this petition.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b>GROUNDS RELIED UPON </b><br><b>
WARRANTING REVIEW OF </b><br><b>THE PETITION</b><br></div><blockquote><br><ol><li>THE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED SERIOUS ERROR IN HOLDING THAT THE LAND REGISTRATION COURT HAD JURISDICTION OVER THE APPLICATION FOR REGISTRATION FILED BY RESPONDENTS DESPITE THE LATTER’S FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE MANDATORY REQUIREMENT OF INDICATING ALL THE ADJOINING OWNERS OF THE PARCELS OF LAND SUBJECT OF THE APPLICATION.<br><br></li><li>THE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED SERIOUS ERROR IN HOLDING THAT RESPONDENTS HAVE A REGISTRABLE RIGHT OVER THE SUBJECT PARCELS OF LAND WHICH ARE WITHIN THE CAMP EVANGELISTA MILITARY RESERVATION.<br><br></li><li>IN G.R. NO. 157306 ENTITLED “<i>REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES VS. ANATALIA ACTUB TIU ESTONILO, ET AL.,</i>” WHICH INVOLVES PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS CLAIMING RIGHTS OVER PORTIONS OF THE CAMP EVANGELISTA MILITARY RESERVATION, THIS HONORABLE COURT HELD THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS COULD NOT HAVE VALIDLY OCCUPIED THEIR CLAIMED LOTS BECAUSE THE SAME WERE CONSIDERED INALIENABLE FROM THE TIME OF THEIR RESERVATION IN 1938. HERE, THE CERTIFICATES OF TITLE BEING SUSTAINED BY THE COURT OF APPEALS WERE ISSUED PURSUANT TO THE DECISIONS OF THE LAND REGISTRATION COURT IN APPLICATIONS FOR REGISTRATION FILED IN 1964 AND 1974. VERILY, THE COURT OF APPEALS, IN ISSUING THE HEREIN ASSAILED DECISION DATED NOVEMBER 15, 2007 AND RESOLUTION DATED MAY 15, 2008, HAS DECIDED THAT INSTANT CONTROVERSY IN A MANNER THAT IS CONTRARY TO LAW AND JURISPRUDENCE.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></li></ol></blockquote><br><b><i><u>Position of the Republic</u></i></b><br><br>In advocacy of its position, the Republic principally argues that (1) the CA erred in holding that the LRC acquired jurisdiction over the applications for registration of the reserved public lands filed by the respondents; and (2) the respondents do not have a registrable right over the subject parcels of land which are within the Camp Evangelista Military Reservation.<br><br>With respect to the first argument, the Republic cites Section 15 of P.D. No. 1529, which requires that applicants for land registration must disclose the names of the occupants of the land and the names and addresses of the owners of the adjoining properties.&nbsp; The respondents did not comply with that requirement which was mandatory and jurisdictional. Citing <i>Pinza v. Aldovino</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> it asserts that the LRC had no jurisdiction to take cognizance of the case. Moreover, such omission constituted fraud or willful misrepresentation.&nbsp; The respondents cannot invoke the indefeasibility of the titles issued since a “grant tainted with fraud and secured through misrepresentation is null and void and of no effect whatsoever.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>On the second argument, the Republic points out that Presidential Proclamation No. 265 reserved for the use of the Philippine Army certain parcels of land which included Lot No. 4354 and Lot No. 4357. Both lots were, however, allowed to be registered. Lot No. 4354 was registered as OCT No. 0-0358 and Lot No. 4357 as OCT No. O-669.<br><br>The Republic asserts that being part of the military reservation, these lots are inalienable and cannot be the subject of private ownership. Being so, the respondents do not have registrable rights over them. Their possession of the land, however long, could not ripen into ownership, and they have not shown proof that they were entitled to the land before the proclamation or that the said lots were segregated and withdrawn as part thereof.<br><br><b><i><u>Position of the Respondents</u></i></b><br><br><b><i><u>The Bacases</u></i></b><br><br>The Bacases anchor their opposition to the postures of the Republic on three principal arguments:<br><br><blockquote><i>First</i>, there was no extrinsic fraud committed by the Bacases in their failure to indicate Camp Evangelista as an adjoining lot owner as their application for registration substantially complied with the legal requirements. More importantly, the Republic was not prejudiced and deprived of its day in court.<br><br><i>Second</i>, the LRC had jurisdiction to adjudicate whether the Bacases had “private rights” over Lot No. 4354 in accordance with, and therefore exempt from the coverage of, Presidential Proclamation No.&nbsp; 265, as well as to determine whether such private rights constituted registrable title under the land registration law.<br><br><i>Third</i>, the issue of the registrability of the title of the Bacases over Lot No. 4354 is <i>res judicata</i> and cannot now&nbsp; be subject to a re-litigation or reopening in the annulment proceedings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Regarding the first ground, the Bacases stress that there was no extrinsic fraud because their application substantially complied with the requirements when they indicated that Camp Evangelista was an occupant by mere tolerance of Lot No. 4354.&nbsp; Also, the Republic filed its opposition to the respondents’ application and actively participated in the land registration proceedings by presenting evidence, through the Director of Lands, who was represented by the Solicitor General.&nbsp; The Republic, therefore, was not deprived of its day in court or prevented from presenting its case. Its insistence that the non-compliance with the requirements of Section 15 of P.D. No. 1529 is an argument that is at once both empty and dangerous.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>On jurisdiction, the Bacases assert that even in the case of <i>Republic v. Estonilo</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> it was recognized in Presidential Proclamation No. 265 that the reservation was subject to private rights. In other words, the LRC had authority to hear and adjudicate their application for registration of title over Lot No. 4354 if they would be able to prove that their private rights under the presidential proclamation constituted registrable title over the said lot.&nbsp; They claim that there is completely no basis for the Republic to argue that the LRC had no jurisdiction to hear and adjudicate their application for registration of their title to Lot No. 4354 just because the proclamation withdrew the subject land from sale and settlement and reserved the same for military purposes.&nbsp; They cited the RTC statement that “the parcels of land they applied for in those registration proceedings and for which certificates of title were issued in their favor are precisely exempted from the operation and effect of said presidential proclamation when the very same proclamation in itself made a proviso that the same will not apply to lands with existing ‘private rights’ therein.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>The Bacases claim that the issue of registrability is no longer an issue as what is only to be resolved is the question on whether there was extrinsic or collateral fraud during the land registration proceedings.&nbsp; There would be no end to litigation on the registrability of their title if questions of facts or law, such as, whether or not Lot No. 4354 was alienable and disposable land of the public domain prior to its withdrawal from sale and settlement and reservation for military purposes under Presidential Proclamation No.&nbsp; 265; whether or not their predecessors-in-interest had prior possession of the lot long before the issuance of the proclamation or the establishment of Camp Evangelista in the late 1930’s; whether or not such possession was held in the concept of an owner to constitute recognizable “private rights” under the presidential proclamation; and whether or not such private rights constitute registrable title to the lot in accordance with the land registration law, which had all been settled and duly adjudicated by the LRC in favor of the Bacases, would be re-examined under this annulment case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>The issue of registrability of the Bacases’ title had long been settled by the LRC and is <i>res judicata</i> between the Republic and the respondents.&nbsp; The findings of the LRC became final when the Republic did not appeal its decision within the period to appeal or file a petition to reopen or review the decree of registration within one year from entry thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>To question the findings of the court regarding the registrability of then title over the land would be an attempt to reopen issues already barred by <i>res judicata</i>.&nbsp; As correctly held by the RTC, it is estopped and barred by prior judgment to contest the findings of the LRC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br><b><u>The Chabons</u></b><br><br>In traversing the position of the Republic, the Chabons insist that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the CA was correct when it stated that there was substantial compliance<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> with the requirements of the P.D. No. 1529 because they expressly stated in their application that Camp Evangelista was occupying a portion of it.&nbsp; It is contrary to reason or common sense to state that Camp Evangelista is an adjoining owner when it is occupying a portion thereof.<br><br>And as to the decision, it was a consequence of a proceeding in rem and, therefore, the decree of registration is binding and conclusive against all persons including the Republic who did not appeal the same. It is now barred forever to question the validity of the title issued.

When the application is set by the court for initial hearing, it is then that <b>notice (of the hearing), addressed to all persons appearing to have an interest in the lot being registered and the adjoining owners</b>, and indicating the location, boundaries and technical description of the land being registered, shall be published in the Official Gazette for two consecutive times. It is this publication of the notice of hearing that is considered one of the essential bases of the jurisdiction of the court in land registration cases, for the proceedings being in rem, it is only when there is constructive seizure of the land, effected by the publication and notice, that jurisdiction over the res is vested on the court. Furthermore, it is such notice and publication of the hearing that <b>would enable all persons concerned, who may have any rights or interests in the property, to come forward and show to the court why the application for registration thereof is not to be granted</b>.</blockquote><br>Here, the Chabons did not make any mention of the ownership or occupancy by the Philippine Army. They also did not indicate any efforts or searches they had exerted in determining other occupants of the land. Such omission constituted fraud and deprived the Republic of its day in court. Not being notified, the Republic was not able to file its opposition to the application and, naturally, it was not able to file an appeal either.<br><br><i>The Republic can also question a final <br>and executory judgment when the LRC <br>had no jurisdiction over the land in question</i><br><br>With respect to the Bacases, although the lower courts might have been correct in ruling that there was substantial compliance with the requirements of law when they alleged that Camp Evangelista was an occupant, the Republic is not precluded and estopped from questioning the validity of the title.<br><br>The success of the annulment of title does not solely depend on the existence of actual and extrinsic fraud, but also on the fact that a judgment decreeing registration is null and void. In <i>Collado v. Court of Appeals and the Republic,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> the Court declared that any title to an inalienable public land is void ab initio. Any procedural infirmities attending the filing of the petition for annulment of judgment are immaterial since the LRC never acquired jurisdiction over the property. All proceedings of the LRC involving the property are null and void and, hence, did not create any legal effect. A judgment by a court without jurisdiction can never attain finality.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> In <i>Collado</i>, the Court made the following citation:<br><br><blockquote>The <b>Land Registration Court has no jurisdiction over non-registrable properties</b>, such as public navigable rivers which are parts of the public domain, and cannot validly adjudge the registration of title in favor of private applicant.

The subject parcels of land were withdrawn from sale or settlement or reserved for military purposes, “subject to private rights, if any there be.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>Such power of the President to segregate lands was provided for in Section 64(e) of the old Revised Administrative Code and C.A. No. 141 or the Public Land Act. Later, the power of the President was restated in Section 14, Chapter 4, Book III of the 1987 Administrative Code.&nbsp; When a property is officially declared a military reservation, it becomes inalienable and outside the commerce of man.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> It may not be the subject of a contract or of a compromise agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> A property continues to be part of the public domain, not available for private appropriation or ownership, until there is a formal declaration on the part of the government to withdraw it from being such.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> In the case of <i>Republic v.

The claims 0f persons who have settled on, occupied, and improved a parcel of public land which is later included in a reservation are considered worthy of protection and are usually respected, but where the President, as authorized by law, issues a proclamation reserving certain lands and warning all persons to depart therefrom, this terminates any rights previously acquired in such lands by a person who was settled thereon in order to obtain a preferential right of purchase. <b>And patents for lands which have been previously granted, reserved from sale, or appropriate, are void</b>.</blockquote><br>Regarding the subject lots, there was a reservation respecting “private rights.”&nbsp; In <i>Republic v. Estonilo,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> where the Court earlier declared that Lot No. 4318 was part of the Camp Evangelista Military Reservation and, therefore, not registrable, it noted the proviso in Presidential Proclamation No. 265 requiring the reservation to be subject to private rights as meaning that persons claiming rights over the reserved land were not precluded from proving their claims.&nbsp; Stated differently, the said proviso did not preclude the LRC from determining whether or not the respondents indeed had registrable rights over the property.<br><br>As there has been no showing that the subject parcels of land had been segregated from the military reservation, the respondents had to prove that the subject properties were alienable and disposable land of the public domain <i>prior </i>to its withdrawal from sale and settlement and reservation for military purposes under Presidential Proclamation No. 265. The question is of primordial importance because it is determinative if the land can in fact be subject to acquisitive prescription and, thus, registrable under the Torrens system. Without first determining the nature and character of the land, all the other requirements such as the length and nature of possession and occupation over such land do not come into play. The required length of possession does not operate when the land is part of the public domain.<br><br>In this case, however, the respondents miserably failed to prove that, before the proclamation, the subject lands were already private lands. They merely relied on such “recognition” of possible private rights. In their application, they alleged that at the time of their application,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> they had been in open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession of the subject parcels of land for at least thirty (30) years and became its owners by prescription. There was, however, no allegation or showing that the government had earlier declared it open for sale or settlement, or that it was already pronounced as inalienable and disposable.<br><br>It is well-settled that land of the public domain is not <i>ipso facto</i> converted into a patrimonial or private property by the mere possession and occupation by an individual over a long period of time.&nbsp; In the case of <i>Diaz v. Republic</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> it was written:<br><br><blockquote>But <b>even assuming that the land in question was alienable land before it was established as a military reservation</b>, there was nevertheless still a dearth of evidence with respect to its occupation by petitioner and her predecessors-in-interest for more than 30 years. x x x.<br><br>x x x. A mere casual cultivation of portions of the land by the claimant, and the raising thereon of cattle, do not constitute possession under claim of ownership. In that sense, possession is not exclusive and notorious as to give rise to a presumptive grant from the State. While grazing livestock over land is of course to be considered with other acts of dominion to show possession, the mere occupancy of land by grazing livestock upon it, without substantial enclosures, or other permanent improvements, is not sufficient to support a claim of title thru acquisitive prescription. The possession of public land, however long the period may have extended, never confers title thereto upon the possessor because the statute of limitations with regard to public land does not operate against the State unless the occupant can prove possession and occupation of the same under claim of ownership for the required number of years to constitute a grant from the State. [Emphases supplied]<br></blockquote><br>In the recent case of <i>Heirs of Mario Malabanan vs. Republic of the Philippines</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> the Court emphasized that fundamental is the rule that lands of the public domain, unless declared otherwise by virtue of a statute or law, are inalienable and can never be acquired by prescription. No amount of time of possession or occupation can ripen into ownership over lands of the public domain. All lands of the public domain presumably belong to the State and are inalienable. Lands that are not clearly under private ownership are also presumed to belong to the State and, therefore, may not be alienated or disposed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>Another recent case, <i>Diaz v. Republic</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> also held that possession even for more than 30 years cannot ripen into ownership.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> Possession is of no moment if applicants fail to sufficiently and satisfactorily show that the subject lands over which an application was applied for was indeed an alienable and disposable agricultural land of the public domain. It would not matter even if they declared it for tax purposes.&nbsp; In <i>Republic v. Heirs of Juan Fabio,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> the rule was reiterated. Thus:<br><br><blockquote>Well-entrenched is the rule that <b>unless a land is reclassified and declared alienable and disposable, occupation in the concept of an owner, no matter how long, cannot ripen into ownership and be registered as a title.</b> Consequently, respondents could not have occupied the Lot in the concept of an owner in 1947 and subsequent years when respondents declared the Lot for <b>taxation purposes</b>, or even earlier when respondents' predecessors-in-interest possessed the Lot, because the Lot was considered inalienable from the time of its declaration as a military reservation in 1904. Therefore, respondents failed to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that the Lot is alienable and disposable. Public lands not shown to have been classified as alienable and disposable land remain part of the inalienable public domain. In view of the lack of sufficient evidence showing that the Lot was already classified as alienable and disposable, the Lot applied for by respondents is inalienable land of the public domain, not subject to registration under Section 14(1) of PD 1529 and Section 48(b) of CA 141, as amended by PD 1073. Hence, there is no need to discuss the other requisites dealing with respondents' occupation and possession of the Lot in the concept of an owner. While it is an acknowledged policy of the State to promote the distribution of alienable public lands to spur economic growth and in line with the ideal of social justice, the law imposes stringent safeguards upon the grant of such resources lest they fall into the wrong hands to the prejudice of the national patrimony. We must not, therefore, relax the stringent safeguards relative to the registration of imperfect titles. [Emphases Supplied]</blockquote><br>In <i>Estonilo</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> where the Court ruled that persons claiming the protection of "private rights" in order to exclude their lands from military reservations must show by clear and convincing evidence that the properties in question had been acquired by a legal method of acquiring public lands, the respondents therein failed to clearly prove that the lands over which they lay a claim were alienable and disposable so that the same belonged and continued to belong to the State and could not be subject to the commerce of man or registration. Specifically, the Court wrote:<br><br><blockquote>Land that has not been acquired from the government, either by purchase or by grant, belongs to the State as part of the public domain. For this reason, imperfect titles to agricultural lands are subjected to rigorous scrutiny before judicial confirmation is granted. In the same manner, persons claiming the protection of "private rights" in order to exclude their lands from military reservations must show by clear and convincing evidence that the pieces of property in question have been acquired by a legal method of acquiring public lands.<br><br>In granting respondents judicial confirmation of their imperfect title, the trial and the appellate courts gave much weight to the tax declarations presented by the former. However, while the tax declarations were issued under the names of respondents’ predecessors-in-interest, the earliest one presented was issued only in 1954.<sup><u>19</u></sup> The <i>Director, Lands Management Bureau v. CA</i><sup><u>20</u></sup> held thus:<br><br>"x x x. <b>Tax receipts and tax declarations are not incontrovertible evidence of ownership. They are mere indicia of [a] claim of ownership</b>. In <i>Director of Lands vs. Santiago</i>:<br><blockquote>‘x x x [I]f it is true that the original owner and possessor, Generosa Santiago, had been in possession since 1925, why were the subject lands declared for taxation purposes for the first time only in 1968, and in the names of Garcia and Obdin? For although tax receipts and declarations of ownership for taxation purposes are not incontrovertible evidence of ownership, they constitute at least proof that the holder had a claim of title over the property.’"<br></blockquote>In addition, the lower courts credited the alleged prior possession by <i>Calixto and Rosendo Bacas</i>, from whom respondents’ predecessors had purportedly bought the property. This alleged prior possession, though, was totally devoid of any supporting evidence on record. Respondents’ evidence hardly supported the conclusion that their predecessors-in-interest had been in possession of the land since "time immemorial."<br><br>Moreover, as correctly observed by the Office of the Solicitor General, the evidence on record merely established the transfer of the property from <i>Calixto Bacas to Nazaria Bombeo</i>. The evidence did not show the nature and the period of the alleged possession by <i>Calixto and Rosendo Bacas.</i> It is important that <b>applicants for judicial confirmation of imperfect titles must present specific acts of ownership to substantiate their claims; they cannot simply offer general statements that are mere conclusions of law rather than factual evidence of possession</b>.<br><br>It must be stressed that respondents, as applicants, have the burden of proving that they have an imperfect title to Lot 4318. <b>Even the absence of opposition from the government does not relieve them of this burden. </b>Thus, it was erroneous for the trial and the appellate courts to hold that the failure of the government to dislodge respondents, judicially or extrajudicially, from the subject land since 1954 already amounted to a title.&nbsp; [Emphases supplied]</blockquote><br>The ruling reiterated the long standing rule in the case of <i>Director, Lands Management Bureau v. Court of Appeals,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br><blockquote>x x x. The petitioner is not necessarily entitled to have the land registered under the Torrens system simply because no one appears to oppose his title and to oppose the registration of his land.

Courts are not justified in registering property under the Torrens system, simply because there is no opposition offered.
