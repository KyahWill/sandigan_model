				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) of the parties in this case provides that the company shoulder the hospitalization expenses of the dependents of covered employees subject to certain limitations and restrictions.&nbsp; Accordingly, covered employees pay part of the hospitalization insurance premium through monthly salary deduction while the company, upon hospitalization of the covered employees’ dependents, shall pay the hospitalization expenses incurred for the same.&nbsp; The conflict arose when a portion of the hospitalization expenses of the covered employees’ dependents were paid/shouldered by the dependent’s own health insurance.&nbsp; While the company refused to pay the portion of the hospital expenses already shouldered by the dependents’ own health insurance, the union insists that the covered employees are entitled to the whole and undiminished amount of said hospital expenses.<br><br>By this Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> petitioner Mitsubishi Motors Philippines Salaried Employees Union (MMPSEU) assails the March 31, 2006 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and December 5, 2006 Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R.

Of this amount, P7,811.00 was paid by Jovita’s personal health insurance, Prosper Insurance Company (Prosper).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>&nbsp; MMPC paid the hospital the amount of P630.87,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> after deducting from the total medical expenses the amount paid by Prosper and the P47.48 discount given by the hospital.<br><br>In the case of Martin, his father, Jose, was admitted at The Medical City from March 26 to 27, 2000 due to Acid Peptic Disease and incurred medical expenses amounting to P9,101.30.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>&nbsp;

However, MMPC denied the claims contending that double insurance would result if the said employees would receive from the company the full amount of hospitalization expenses despite having already received payment of portions thereof from other health insurance providers.<br><br>This prompted the MMPSEU President to write the MMPC President<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> demanding full payment of the hospitalization benefits.&nbsp; Alleging discrimination against MMPSEU union members, she pointed out that full reimbursement was given in a similar claim filed by Luisito Cruz (Cruz), a member of the Hourly Union.&nbsp; In a letter-reply,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> MMPC, through its Vice-President for Industrial Relations Division, clarified that the claims of the said MMPSEU members have already been paid on the basis of official receipts submitted.&nbsp; It also denied the charge of discrimination and explained that the case of Cruz involved an entirely different matter since it concerned the admissibility of certified true copies of documents for reimbursement purposes, which case had been settled through voluntary arbitration.<br><br>On August 28, 2000, MMPSEU referred the dispute to the National Conciliation and Mediation Board and requested for preventive mediation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> <br><br><b><i>Proceedings before the Voluntary Arbitrator</i></b><br><br>On October 3, 2000, the case was referred to Voluntary Arbitrator Rolando Capocyan for resolution of the issue involving the interpretation of the subject CBA provision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>MMPSEU alleged that there is nothing in the CBA which prohibits an employee from obtaining other insurance or declares that medical expenses can be reimbursed only upon presentation of original official receipts.&nbsp; It stressed that the hospitalization benefits should be computed based on the formula indicated in the CBA without deducting the benefits derived from other insurance providers.&nbsp; Besides, if reduction is permitted, MMPC would be unjustly benefitted from the monthly premium contributed by the employees through salary deduction.&nbsp; MMPSEU added that its members had legitimate claims under the CBA and that any doubt as to any of its provisions should be resolved in favor of its members.&nbsp; Moreover, any ambiguity should be resolved in favor of labor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, MMPC argued that the reimbursement of the entire amounts being claimed by the covered employees, including those already paid by other insurance companies, would constitute double indemnity or double insurance, which is circumscribed under the Insurance Code.&nbsp; Moreover, a contract of insurance is a contract of indemnity and the employees cannot be allowed to profit from their dependents’ loss.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Meanwhile, the parties separately sought for a legal opinion from the Insurance Commission relative to the issue at hand.&nbsp; In its letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> to the Insurance Commission, MMPC requested for confirmation of its position that the covered employees cannot claim insurance benefits for a loss that had already been covered or paid by another insurance company.&nbsp; However, the Office of the Insurance Commission opted not to render an opinion on the matter as the same may become the subject of a formal complaint before it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>&nbsp; On the other hand, when queried by MMPSEU,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> the Insurance Commission, through Atty. Richard David C. Funk II (Atty. Funk) of the Claims Adjudication Division, rendered an opinion contained in a letter,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote><br><div style="text-align: right;">January 8, 2002<br></div><br>Ms. Cecilia L. Paras<br> President Mitsubishi Motors Phils. <br>[Salaried] Employees Union <br>Ortigas Avenue Extension, <br>Cainta, Rizal<br><br>Madam:<br><br>We acknowledge receipt of your letter which, to our impression, basically poses the question of whether or not recovery of medical expenses from a Health Maintenance Organization bars recovery of the same reimbursable amount of medical expenses under a contract of health or medical insurance.<br><br>We wish to opine that in cases of claims for reimbursement of medical expenses where there are two contracts providing benefits to that effect, recovery may be had on both simultaneously.&nbsp; In the absence of an Other Insurance provision in these coverages, the courts have uniformly held that an insured is entitled to receive the insurance benefits without regard to the amount of total benefits provided by other insurance. (INSURANCE LAW, A Guide to Fundamental Principles, Legal Doctrines, and Commercial Practices; Robert E. Keeton, Alau I. Widiss, p. 261).&nbsp; The result is consistent with the public policy underlying the collateral source rule – that is, x x x the courts have usually concluded that the liability of a health or accident insurer is not reduced by other possible sources of indemnification or compensation.&nbsp; (ibid).<br><br><div style="text-align: center; margin-left: 440px;">Very truly yours,<br><br>(SGD.)<br><b>RICHARD DAVID C.

Funk; and in not finding that the employees will be benefitted twice for the same loss.&nbsp; In its Comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> MMPSEU countered that MMPC will unjustly enrich itself and profit from the monthly premiums paid if full reimbursement is not made.<br><br>On March 31, 2006, the CA found merit in MMPC’s Petition.&nbsp; It ruled that despite the lack of a provision which bars recovery in case of payment by other insurers, the wordings of the subject provision of the CBA showed that the parties intended to make MMPC liable only for expenses actually incurred by an employee’s qualified dependent.&nbsp; In particular, the provision stipulates that payment should be made directly to the hospital and that the claim should be supported by actual hospital and doctor’s bills.&nbsp; These mean that the employees shall only be paid amounts not covered by other health insurance and is more in keeping with the principle of indemnity in insurance contracts.&nbsp; Besides, a contrary interpretation would "allow unscrupulous employees to unduly profit from the x x x benefits" and shall "open the floodgates to questionable claims x x x."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>The dispositive portion of the CA Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> reads:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the instant petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.&nbsp; The decision of the voluntary arbitrator dated December 3, 2002 is <b>REVERSED</b> and <b>SET ASIDE</b> and judgment is rendered declaring that under Art.

Funk erred in applying the <br>collateral source rule.&nbsp; </i><br><br>The Voluntary Arbitrator based his ruling on the opinion of Atty. Funk that the employees may recover benefits from different insurance providers without regard to the amount of benefits paid by each.&nbsp; According to him, this view is consistent with the theory of the collateral source rule.<br><br>As part of American personal injury law, the collateral source rule was originally applied to tort cases wherein the defendant is prevented from benefitting from the plaintiff’s receipt of money from other sources.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>&nbsp; Under this rule, if an injured person receives compensation for his injuries from a source wholly independent of the tortfeasor, the payment should not be deducted from the damages which he would otherwise collect from the tortfeasor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>&nbsp; In a recent Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> by the Illinois Supreme Court, the rule has been described as "an established exception to the general rule that damages in negligence actions must be compensatory."&nbsp; The Court went on to explain that although the rule appears to allow a double recovery, the collateral source will have a lien or subrogation right to prevent such a double recovery.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>&nbsp; In <i>Mitchell v. Haldar</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>&nbsp; the collateral source rule was rationalized by the Supreme Court of Delaware:<br><br><blockquote>The collateral source rule is ‘predicated on the theory that a tortfeasor has no interest in, and therefore no right to benefit from monies received by the injured person from sources unconnected with the defendant’.&nbsp; According to the collateral source rule, ‘a tortfeasor has no right to any mitigation of damages because of payments&nbsp;or compensation received by the injured person from an independent source.’ The rationale for the collateral source rule is based upon the quasi-punitive nature of tort law liability. It has been explained as follows:<br><br><blockquote>The collateral source rule is designed to strike a balance between two competing principles of tort law: (1) a plaintiff is entitled to compensation sufficient to make him whole, but no more; and (2) a defendant is liable for all damages that proximately result from his wrong.&nbsp; A plaintiff who receives a double recovery for a single tort enjoys a windfall; a defendant who escapes, in whole or in part, liability for his wrong enjoys a windfall.&nbsp; Because the law must sanction one windfall and deny the other, it favors the victim of the wrong rather than the wrongdoer.</blockquote>Thus, the tortfeasor is required to bear the cost for the full value of his or her negligent conduct even if it results in a windfall for the innocent plaintiff.&nbsp; (Citations omitted)</blockquote><br>As seen, the collateral source rule applies in order to place the responsibility for losses on the party causing them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>&nbsp; Its application is justified so that "'the wrongdoer should not benefit from the expenditures made by the injured party or take advantage of contracts or other relations that may exist between the injured party and third persons."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, it finds no application to cases involving no-fault insurances under which the insured is indemnified for losses by insurance companies, regardless of who was at fault in the incident generating the losses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>&nbsp; Here, it is clear that MMPC is a no-fault insurer.&nbsp; Hence, it cannot be obliged to pay the hospitalization expenses of the dependents of its employees which had already been paid by separate health insurance providers of said dependents.<br><br>The Voluntary Arbitrator therefore erred in adopting Atty. Funk’s view that the covered employees are entitled to full payment of the hospital expenses incurred by their dependents, including the amounts already paid by other health insurance companies based on the theory of collateral source rule.<br><br><i>The conditions set forth in the CBA provision<br> indicate an intention to limit MMPC’s liability<br> only to actual expenses incurred by the employees’ <br>dependents, that is, excluding the amounts paid<br> by dependents’ other health insurance providers.</i><br><br>The Voluntary Arbitrator ruled that the CBA has no express provision barring claims for hospitalization expenses already paid by other insurers.&nbsp; Hence, the covered employees can recover from both.&nbsp; The CA did not agree, saying that the conditions set forth in the CBA implied an intention of the parties to limit MMPC’s liability only to the extent of the expenses actually incurred by their dependents which excludes the amounts shouldered by other health insurance companies.<br><br>We agree with the CA.&nbsp; The condition that <i>payment should be direct to the hospital and doctor</i> implies that MMPC is only liable to pay medical expenses actually shouldered by the employees’ dependents.&nbsp; It follows that MMPC’s liability is limited, that is, it does not include the amounts paid by other health insurance providers.&nbsp; This condition is obviously intended to thwart not only fraudulent claims but also double claims for the same loss of the dependents of covered employees.<br><br>It is well to note at this point that the CBA constitutes a contract between the parties and as such, it should be strictly construed for the purpose of limiting the amount of the employer’s liability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup>&nbsp; The terms of the subject provision are clear and provide no room for any other interpretation.&nbsp; As there is no ambiguity, the terms must be taken in their plain, ordinary and popular sense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>&nbsp; Consequently, MMPSEU cannot rely on the rule that a contract of insurance is to be liberally construed in favor of the insured.&nbsp; Neither can it rely on the theory that any doubt must be resolved in favor of labor.<br><br><i>Samsel v. Allstate Insurance Co. is not<br> on all fours with the case at bar.&nbsp; </i><br><br>MMPSEU cannot rely on <i>Samsel v. Allstate Insurance Co.</i> where the Supreme Court of Arizona allowed the insured to enjoy medical benefits under an automobile policy insurance despite being able to also recover from a separate health insurer.&nbsp; In that case, the Allstate automobile policy does not contain any clause restricting medical payment coverage to expenses actually paid by the insured nor does it specifically provide for reduction of medical payments benefits by a coordination of benefits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>&nbsp; However, in the case before us, the dependents’ group hospitalization insurance provision in the CBA specifically contains a condition which limits MMPC’s liability only up to the extent of the expenses that should be paid by the covered employee’s dependent to the hospital and doctor.&nbsp; This is evident from the portion which states that "payment [by MMPC] shall be direct to the hospital and doctor."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>&nbsp; In contrast, the Allstate automobile policy expressly gives Allstate the authority to pay directly to the insured person or on the latter’s behalf all reasonable expenses actually incurred.&nbsp; Therefore, reliance on <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">[Samsel]</span> is unavailing because the facts therein are different and not decisive of the issues in the present case. <br><br><i>To allow reimbursement of amounts paid <br>under other insurance policies shall constitute<br> double recovery which is not sanctioned by law.</i><br><br>MMPSEU insists that MMPC is also liable for the amounts covered under other insurance policies; otherwise, MMPC will unjustly profit from the premiums the employees contribute through monthly salary deductions.<br><br>This contention is unmeritorious.<br><br>To constitute unjust enrichment, it must be shown that a party was unjustly enriched in the sense that the term unjustly could mean illegally or unlawfully.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup>&nbsp; A claim for unjust enrichment fails when the person who will benefit has a valid claim to such benefit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>The CBA has provided for MMPC’s limited liability which extends only up to the amount to be paid to the hospital and doctor by the employees’ dependents, excluding those paid by other insurers.&nbsp; Consequently, the covered employees will not receive more than what is due them; neither is MMPC under any obligation to give more than what is due under the CBA.<br><br>Moreover, since the subject CBA provision is an insurance contract, the rights and obligations of the parties must be determined in accordance with the general principles of insurance law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>&nbsp; Being in the nature of a non-life insurance contract and essentially a contract of indemnity, the CBA provision obligates MMPC to indemnify the covered employees’ medical expenses incurred by their dependents but only up to the extent of the expenses actually incurred.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup>&nbsp; This is consistent with the principle of indemnity which proscribes the insured from recovering greater than the loss.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup>&nbsp; Indeed, to profit from a loss will lead to unjust enrichment and therefore should not be countenanced.&nbsp; As aptly ruled by the CA, to grant the claims of MMPSEU will permit possible abuse by employees.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition is <b>DENIED</b>.&nbsp; The Decision dated March 31, 2006 and Resolution dated December 5, 2006 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
