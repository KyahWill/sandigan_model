				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"><center><b><u>The Case</u></b><br></center><br>This is a direct recourse to this Court from the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 107, Quezon City, through a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court on a pure question of law. The petition assails the Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated 31 January 2011 of the RTC in Civil Case No. Q-11-68582 and its Resolution dated 2 March 2011 denying petitioner’s Motion for Reconsideration. The RTC dismissed the petition for “Judicial Recognition of Foreign Judgment (or Decree of Absolute Nullity of Marriage)” based on improper venue and the lack of personality of petitioner, Minoru Fujiki, to file the petition.<br><br><center><b><u>The Facts</u></b><br></center><br>Petitioner Minoru Fujiki (Fujiki) is a Japanese national who married respondent Maria Paz Galela Marinay (Marinay) in the Philippines<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> on 23 January 2004. The marriage did not sit well with petitioner’s parents. Thus, Fujiki could not bring his wife to Japan where he resides. Eventually, they lost contact with each other.<br><br>In 2008, Marinay met another Japanese, Shinichi Maekara (Maekara). Without the first marriage being dissolved, Marinay and Maekara were married on 15 May 2008 in Quezon City, Philippines. Maekara brought Marinay to Japan. However, Marinay allegedly suffered physical abuse from Maekara. She left Maekara and started to contact Fujiki.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>Fujiki and Marinay met in Japan and they were able to reestablish their relationship. In 2010, Fujiki helped Marinay obtain a judgment from a family court in Japan which declared the marriage between Marinay and Maekara void on the ground of bigamy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> On 14 January 2011, Fujiki filed a petition in the RTC entitled: “Judicial Recognition of Foreign Judgment (or Decree of Absolute Nullity of Marriage).” Fujiki prayed that (1) the Japanese Family Court judgment be recognized; (2) that the bigamous marriage between Marinay and Maekara be declared void <i>ab initio</i> under Articles 35(4) and 41 of the Family Code of the Philippines;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> and (3) for the RTC to direct the Local Civil Registrar of Quezon City to annotate the Japanese Family Court judgment on the Certificate of Marriage between Marinay and Maekara and to endorse such annotation to the Office of the Administrator and Civil Registrar General in the National Statistics Office (NSO).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br><center><b><u>The Ruling of the Regional Trial Court</u></b><br></center><br>A few days after the filing of the petition, the RTC immediately issued an Order dismissing the petition and withdrawing the case from its active civil docket.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> The RTC cited the following provisions of the Rule on Declaration of Absolute Nullity of Void Marriages and Annulment of Voidable Marriages (A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC):<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 2. Petition for declaration of absolute nullity of void marriages. –<br><br>(a) <i>Who may file</i>. – A petition for declaration of absolute nullity of void marriage may be filed solely by the husband or the wife.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Sec. 4. <i>Venue</i>. – The petition shall be filed in the Family Court of the province or city where the petitioner or the respondent has been residing for at least six months prior to the date of filing, or in the case of a non-resident respondent, where he may be found in the Philippines, at the election of the petitioner. x x x</blockquote><br>The RTC ruled, without further explanation, that the petition was in “gross violation” of the above provisions. The trial court based its dismissal on Section 5(4) of A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC which provides that “[f]ailure to comply with any of the preceding requirements may be a ground for immediate dismissal of the petition.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Apparently, the RTC took the view that only “the husband or the wife,” in this case either Maekara or Marinay, can file the petition to declare their marriage void, and not Fujiki.<br><br>Fujiki moved that the Order be reconsidered. He argued that A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC contemplated ordinary civil actions for declaration of nullity and annulment of marriage. Thus, A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC does not apply. A petition for recognition of foreign judgment is a special proceeding, which “seeks to establish a status, a right or a particular fact,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> and not a civil action which is “for the enforcement or protection of a right, or the prevention or redress of a wrong.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> In other words, the petition in the RTC sought to establish (1) the status and concomitant rights of Fujiki and Marinay as husband and wife and (2) the fact of the rendition of the Japanese Family Court judgment declaring the marriage between Marinay and Maekara as void on the ground of bigamy. The petitioner contended that the Japanese judgment was consistent with Article 35(4) of the Family Code of the Philippines<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> on bigamy and was therefore entitled to recognition by Philippine courts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>In any case, it was also Fujiki’s view that A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC applied only to void marriages under Article 36 of the Family Code on the ground of psychological incapacity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Thus, Section 2(a) of A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC provides that “a petition for declaration of absolute nullity of void marriages may be filed solely by the husband or the wife.” To apply Section 2(a) in bigamy would be absurd because only the guilty parties would be permitted to sue. In the words of Fujiki, “[i]t is not, of course, difficult to realize that the party interested in having a bigamous marriage declared a nullity would be the husband in the prior, pre-existing marriage.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Fujiki had material interest and therefore the personality to nullify a bigamous marriage.<br><br>Fujiki argued that Rule 108 (Cancellation or Correction of Entries in the Civil Registry) of the Rules of Court is applicable. Rule 108 is the “procedural implementation” of the Civil Register Law (Act No. 3753)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> in relation to Article 413 of the Civil Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> The Civil Register Law imposes a duty on the “successful petitioner for divorce or annulment of marriage to send a copy of the final decree of the court to the local registrar of the municipality where the dissolved or annulled marriage was solemnized.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Section 2 of Rule 108 provides that entries in the civil registry relating to “marriages,” “judgments of annulments of marriage” and “judgments declaring marriages void from the beginning” are subject to cancellation or correction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> The petition in the RTC sought (among others) to annotate the judgment of the Japanese Family Court on the certificate of marriage between Marinay and Maekara.<br><br>Fujiki’s motion for reconsideration in the RTC also asserted that the trial court “gravely erred” when, on its own, it dismissed the petition based on improper venue. Fujiki stated that the RTC may be confusing the concept of venue with the concept of jurisdiction, because it is lack of jurisdiction which allows a court to dismiss a case on its own. Fujiki cited <i>Dacoycoy v. Intermediate Appellate Court</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> which held that the “trial court cannot pre-empt the defendant’s prerogative to object to the improper laying of the venue by motu proprio dismissing the case.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Moreover, petitioner alleged that the trial court should not have “immediately dismissed” the petition under Section 5 of A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC because he substantially complied with the provision.<br><br>On 2 March 2011, the RTC resolved to deny petitioner’s motion for reconsideration. In its Resolution, the RTC stated that A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC applies because the petitioner, in effect, prays for a decree of absolute nullity of marriage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> The trial court reiterated its two grounds for dismissal, i.e. lack of personality to sue and improper venue under Sections 2(a) and 4 of A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC. The RTC considered Fujiki as a “third person”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> in the proceeding because he “is not the husband in the decree of divorce issued by the Japanese Family Court, which he now seeks to be judicially recognized, x x x.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> On the other hand, the RTC did not explain its&nbsp; ground of impropriety of venue. It only said that “[a]lthough the Court cited Sec. 4 (Venue) x x x as a ground for dismissal of this case[,] it should be taken together with the other ground cited by the Court x x x which is Sec. 2(a) x x x.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>The RTC further justified its <span style="font-style: italic;">motu proprio</span> dismissal of the petition based on <i>Braza v. The City Civil Registrar of Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> The Court in Braza ruled that “[i]n a special proceeding for correction of entry under Rule 108 (Cancellation or Correction of Entries in the Original Registry), the trial court has no jurisdiction to nullify marriages x x x.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Braza emphasized that the “validity of marriages as well as legitimacy and filiation can be questioned only in a direct action seasonably filed by the proper party, and not through a collateral attack such as [a] petition [for correction of entry] x x x.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>The RTC considered the petition as a collateral attack on the validity of marriage between Marinay and Maekara. The trial court held that this is a “jurisdictional ground” to dismiss the petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Moreover, the verification and certification against forum shopping of the petition was not authenticated as required under Section 5<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> of A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC. Hence, this also warranted the “immediate dismissal” of the petition under the same provision.<br><br><center><b><u>The Manifestation and Motion of the Office of the Solicitor General and the Letters of Marinay and Maekara</u></b></center><br>On 30 May 2011, the Court required respondents to file their comment on the petition for review.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> The public respondents, the Local Civil Registrar of Quezon City and the Administrator and Civil Registrar General of the NSO, participated through the Office of the Solicitor General. Instead of a comment, the Solicitor General filed a Manifestation and Motion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>The Solicitor General agreed with the petition. He prayed that the RTC’s “pronouncement that the petitioner failed to comply with x x x A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC x x x be set aside” and that the case be reinstated in the trial court for further proceedings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> The Solicitor General argued that Fujiki, as the spouse of the first marriage, is an injured party who can sue to declare the bigamous marriage between Marinay and Maekara void. The Solicitor General cited <i>Juliano-Llave v. Republic</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> which held that Section 2(a) of A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC does not apply in cases of bigamy. In <i>Juliano-Llave</i>, this Court explained:<br><br><blockquote>[t]he subsequent spouse may only be expected to take action if he or she had only discovered during the connubial period that the marriage was bigamous, and especially if the conjugal bliss had already vanished. Should parties in a subsequent marriage benefit from the bigamous marriage, it would not be expected that they would file an action to declare the marriage void and thus, in such circumstance, the “injured spouse” who should be given a legal remedy is the one in a subsisting previous marriage. The latter is clearly the aggrieved party as the bigamous marriage not only threatens the financial and the property ownership aspect of the prior marriage but most of all, it causes an emotional burden to the prior spouse. The subsequent marriage will always be a reminder of the infidelity of the spouse and the disregard of the prior marriage which sanctity is protected by the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></blockquote><br>The Solicitor General contended that the petition to recognize the Japanese Family Court judgment may be made in a Rule 108 proceeding.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> In <i>Corpuz v. Santo Tomas</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> this Court held that “[t]he recognition of the foreign divorce decree may be made in a Rule 108 proceeding itself, as the object of special proceedings (such as that in Rule 108 of the Rules of Court) is precisely to establish the status or right of a party or a particular fact.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> While <i>Corpuz</i> concerned a foreign divorce decree, in the present case the Japanese Family Court judgment also affected the civil status of the parties, especially Marinay, who is a Filipino citizen.<br><br>The Solicitor General asserted that Rule 108 of the Rules of Court is the procedure to record “[a]cts, events and judicial decrees concerning the civil status of persons” in the civil registry as required by Article 407 of the Civil Code. In other words, “[t]he law requires the entry in the civil registry of judicial decrees that produce legal consequences upon a person’s legal capacity and status x x x.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> The Japanese Family Court judgment directly bears on the civil status of a Filipino citizen and should therefore be proven as a fact in a Rule 108 proceeding.<br><br>Moreover, the Solicitor General argued that there is no jurisdictional infirmity in assailing a void marriage under Rule 108, citing <i>De Castro v. De Castro</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> and <i>Niñal v. Bayadog</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> which declared that “[t]he validity of a void marriage may be collaterally attacked.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>Marinay and Maekara individually sent letters to the Court to comply with the directive for them to comment on the petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Maekara wrote that Marinay concealed from him the fact that she was previously married to Fujiki.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Maekara also denied that he inflicted any form of violence on Marinay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> On the other hand, Marinay wrote that she had no reason to oppose the petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> She would like to maintain her silence for fear that anything she say might cause misunderstanding between her and Fujiki.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br><center><b><u>The Issues</u></b></center><br>Petitioner raises the following legal issues:<br><br>(1) Whether the Rule on Declaration of Absolute Nullity of Void Marriages and Annulment of Voidable Marriages (A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC) is applicable.<br><br>(2) Whether a husband or wife of a prior marriage can file a petition to recognize a foreign judgment nullifying the subsequent marriage between his or her spouse and a foreign citizen on the ground of bigamy.<br><br>(3) Whether the Regional Trial Court can recognize the foreign judgment in a proceeding for cancellation or correction of entries in the Civil Registry under Rule 108 of the Rules of Court.<br><br><center><b><u>The Ruling of the Court</u></b></center><br>We grant the petition.<br><br>The Rule on Declaration of Absolute Nullity of Void Marriages and Annulment of Voidable Marriages (A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC) does not apply in a petition to recognize a foreign judgment relating to the status of a marriage where one of the parties is a citizen of a foreign country. Moreover, in <i>Juliano-Llave v. Republic</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> this Court held that the rule in A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC that only the husband or wife can file a declaration of nullity or annulment of marriage “does not apply if the reason behind the petition is bigamy.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br><center><b>I.</b><br></center><br>For Philippine courts to recognize a foreign judgment relating to the status of a marriage where one of the parties is a citizen of a foreign country, the petitioner only needs to prove the foreign judgment as a fact under the Rules of Court. To be more specific, a copy of the foreign judgment may be admitted in evidence and proven as a fact under Rule 132, Sections 24 and 25, in relation to Rule 39, Section 48(b) of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Petitioner may prove the Japanese Family Court judgment through (1) an official publication or (2) a certification or copy attested by the officer who has custody of the judgment. If the office which has custody is in a foreign country such as Japan, the certification may be made by the proper diplomatic or consular officer of the Philippine foreign service in Japan and authenticated by the seal of office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>To hold that A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC applies to a petition for recognition of foreign judgment would mean that the trial court and the parties should follow its provisions, including the form and contents of the petition,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> the service of summons,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> the investigation of the public prosecutor,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> the setting of pre-trial,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> the trial<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> and the judgment of the trial court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> This is absurd because it will litigate the case anew. It will defeat the purpose of recognizing foreign judgments, which is “to limit repetitive litigation on claims and issues.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> The interpretation of the RTC is tantamount to relitigating the case on the merits. In <i>Mijares v. Rañada</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> this Court explained that “[i]f every judgment of a foreign court were reviewable on the merits, the plaintiff would be forced back on his/her original cause of action, rendering immaterial the previously concluded litigation.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>A foreign judgment relating to the status of a marriage affects the civil status, condition and legal capacity of its parties. However, the effect of a foreign judgment is not automatic. To extend the effect of a foreign judgment in the Philippines, Philippine courts must determine if the foreign judgment is consistent with domestic public policy and other mandatory laws.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> Article 15 of the Civil Code provides that “[l]aws relating to family rights and duties, or to the status, condition and legal capacity of persons are binding upon citizens of the Philippines, even though living abroad.” This is the rule of <i>lex nationalii </i>in private international law. Thus, the Philippine State may require, for effectivity in the Philippines, recognition by Philippine courts of a foreign judgment affecting its citizen, over whom it exercises personal jurisdiction relating to the status, condition and legal capacity of such citizen.<br><br>A petition to recognize a foreign judgment declaring a marriage void does not require relitigation under a Philippine court of the case as if it were a new petition for declaration of nullity of marriage. Philippine courts cannot presume to know the foreign laws under which the foreign judgment was rendered. They cannot substitute their judgment on the status, condition and legal capacity of the foreign citizen who is under the jurisdiction of another state. Thus, Philippine courts can only recognize the foreign judgment <b>as a fact</b> according to the rules of evidence.<br><br>Section 48(b), Rule 39 of the Rules of Court provides that a foreign judgment or final order against a person creates a “presumptive evidence of a right as between the parties and their successors in interest by a subsequent title.” Moreover, Section 48 of the Rules of Court states that “the judgment or final order may be repelled by evidence of a want of jurisdiction, want of notice to the party, collusion, fraud, or clear mistake of law or fact.” Thus, Philippine courts exercise limited review on foreign judgments. Courts are not allowed to delve into the merits of a foreign judgment. Once a foreign judgment is admitted and proven in a Philippine court, it can only be repelled on grounds external to its merits, <i>i.e</i>. , “want of jurisdiction, want of notice to the party, collusion, fraud, or clear mistake of law or fact.” The rule on limited review embodies the policy of efficiency and the protection of party expectations,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> as well as respecting the jurisdiction of other states.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>Since 1922 in <i>Adong v. Cheong Seng Gee,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> Philippine courts have recognized foreign divorce decrees between a Filipino and a foreign citizen if they are successfully proven under the rules of evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> Divorce involves the dissolution of a marriage, but the recognition of a foreign divorce decree does not involve the extended procedure under A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC or the rules of ordinary trial. While the Philippines does not have a divorce law, Philippine courts may, however, recognize a foreign divorce decree under the second paragraph of Article 26 of the Family Code, to capacitate a Filipino citizen to remarry when his or her foreign spouse obtained a divorce decree abroad.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>There is therefore no reason to disallow Fujiki to simply prove as a fact the Japanese Family Court judgment nullifying the marriage between Marinay and Maekara on the ground of bigamy. While the Philippines has no divorce law, the Japanese Family Court judgment is fully consistent with Philippine public policy, as bigamous marriages are declared void from the beginning under Article 35(4) of the Family Code. Bigamy is a crime under Article 349 of the Revised Penal Code. Thus, Fujiki can prove the existence of the Japanese Family Court judgment in accordance with Rule 132, Sections 24 and 25, in relation to Rule 39, Section 48(b) of the Rules of Court.<br><br><center><b>II.</b><br></center><br>Since the recognition of a foreign judgment only requires proof of fact of the judgment, it may be made in a special proceeding for cancellation or correction of entries in the civil registry under Rule 108 of the Rules of Court. Rule 1, Section 3 of the Rules of Court provides that “[a] special proceeding is a remedy by which a party seeks to establish a status, a right, or a particular fact.” Rule 108 creates a remedy to rectify facts of a person’s life which are recorded by the State pursuant to the Civil Register Law or Act No. 3753. These are facts of public consequence such as birth, death or marriage,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> which the State has an interest in recording. As noted by the Solicitor General, in <i>Corpuz v. Sto. Tomas</i> this Court declared that “[t]he recognition of the foreign divorce decree may be made in a Rule 108 proceeding itself, as the object of special proceedings (such as that in Rule 108 of the Rules of Court) is precisely to establish the status or right of a party or a particular fact.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>Rule 108, Section 1 of the Rules of Court states:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 1. <i>Who may file petition</i>. — Any person <b>interested</b> in any <b>act, event, order or decree</b> concerning the <b>civil status of persons which has been recorded in the civil register,</b> may file a verified petition for the cancellation or correction of any entry relating thereto, with the Regional Trial Court of the province where the corresponding civil registry is located. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>Fujiki has the personality to file a petition to recognize the Japanese Family Court judgment nullifying the marriage between Marinay and Maekara on the ground of bigamy because the judgment concerns his civil status as married to Marinay. For the same reason he has the personality to file a petition under Rule 108 to cancel the entry of marriage between Marinay and Maekara in the civil registry on the basis of the decree of the Japanese Family Court.<br><br>There is no doubt that the prior spouse has a personal and material interest in maintaining the integrity of the marriage he contracted and the property relations arising from it. There is also no doubt that he is interested in the cancellation of an entry of a bigamous marriage in the civil registry, which compromises the public record of his marriage. The interest derives from the substantive right of the spouse not only to preserve (or dissolve, in limited instances<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup>) his most intimate human relation, but also to protect his property interests that arise by operation of law the moment he contracts marriage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> These property interests in marriage include the right to be supported “in keeping with the financial capacity of the family”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> and preserving the property regime of the marriage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br>Property rights are already substantive rights protected by the Constitution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> but a spouse’s right in a marriage extends further to relational rights recognized under Title III (“Rights and Obligations between Husband and Wife”) of the Family Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC cannot “diminish, increase, or modify” the substantive right of the spouse to maintain the integrity of his marriage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> In any case, Section 2(a) of A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC preserves this substantive right by limiting the personality to sue to the husband or the wife of the union recognized by law.<br><br>Section 2(a) of A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC does not preclude a spouse of a subsisting marriage to question the validity of a subsequent marriage on the ground of bigamy. On the contrary, when Section 2(a) states that “[a] petition for declaration of absolute nullity of void marriage may be filed <b>solely by the husband or the wife</b>”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup>—it refers to the husband or the wife of the subsisting marriage. Under Article 35(4) of the Family Code, bigamous marriages are void from the beginning. Thus, the parties in a bigamous marriage are neither the husband nor the wife under the law. The husband or the wife of the prior subsisting marriage is the one who has the personality to file a petition for declaration of absolute nullity of void marriage under Section 2(a) of A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC.<br><br>Article 35(4) of the Family Code, which declares bigamous marriages void from the beginning, is the civil aspect of Article 349 of the Revised Penal Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> which penalizes bigamy. Bigamy is a public crime. Thus, anyone can initiate prosecution for bigamy because any citizen has an interest in the prosecution and prevention of crimes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> If anyone can file a criminal action which leads to the declaration of nullity of a bigamous marriage,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> there is more reason to confer personality to sue on the husband or the wife of a subsisting marriage. The prior spouse does not only share in the public interest of prosecuting and preventing crimes, he is also personally interested in the purely civil aspect of protecting his marriage.<br><br>When the right of the spouse to protect his marriage is violated, the spouse is clearly an injured party and is therefore interested in the judgment of the suit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> <i>Juliano-Llave</i> ruled that the prior spouse “is clearly the aggrieved party as the bigamous marriage not only threatens the financial and the property ownership aspect of the prior marriage but most of all, it causes an emotional burden to the prior spouse.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> Being a real party in interest, the prior spouse is entitled to sue in order to declare a bigamous marriage void. For this purpose, he can petition a court to recognize a foreign judgment nullifying the bigamous marriage and judicially declare as a fact that such judgment is effective in the Philippines. Once established, there should be no more impediment to cancel the entry of the bigamous marriage in the civil registry.<br><br><center><b>III.</b></center><br>In <i>Braza v. The City Civil Registrar of Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental</i>, this Court held that a “trial court has no jurisdiction to nullify marriages” in a special proceeding for cancellation or correction of entry under Rule 108 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> Thus, the “validity of marriage[]&nbsp; x x x can be questioned only in a direct action” to nullify the marriage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> The RTC relied on <i>Braza</i> in dismissing the petition for recognition of foreign judgment as a collateral attack on the marriage between Marinay and Maekara.<br><br><i>Braza</i> is not applicable because <i>Braza</i> does not involve a recognition of a foreign judgment nullifying a bigamous marriage where one of the parties is a citizen of the foreign country.<br><br>To be sure, a petition for correction or cancellation of an entry in the civil registry cannot substitute for an action to invalidate a marriage. A direct action is necessary to prevent circumvention of the substantive and procedural safeguards of marriage under the Family Code, A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC and other related laws. Among these safeguards are the requirement of proving the limited grounds for the dissolution of marriage,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> support <i>pendente lite </i>of the spouses and children,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> the liquidation, partition and distribution of the properties of the spouses,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> and the investigation of the public prosecutor to determine collusion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> A direct action for declaration of nullity or annulment of marriage is also necessary to prevent circumvention of the jurisdiction of the Family Courts under the Family Courts Act of 1997 (Republic Act No. 8369), as a petition for cancellation or correction of entries in the civil registry may be filed in the Regional Trial Court “where the corresponding civil registry is located.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> In other words, a Filipino citizen cannot dissolve his marriage by the mere expedient of changing his entry of marriage in the civil registry.<br><br>However, this does not apply in a petition for correction or cancellation of a civil registry entry based on the recognition of a foreign judgment annulling a marriage where one of the parties is a citizen of the foreign country. There is neither circumvention of the substantive and procedural safeguards of marriage under Philippine law, nor of the jurisdiction of Family Courts under R.A. No. 8369. A recognition of a foreign judgment is not an action to nullify a marriage. It is an action for Philippine courts to recognize the effectivity of a foreign judgment, <b>which presupposes a case which was already tried and decided under foreign law</b>. The procedure in A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC does not apply in a petition to recognize a foreign judgment annulling a bigamous marriage where one of the parties is a citizen of the foreign country. Neither can R.A. No. 8369 define the jurisdiction of the foreign court.<br><br>Article 26 of the Family Code confers jurisdiction on Philippine courts to extend the effect of a foreign divorce decree to a Filipino spouse without undergoing trial to determine the validity of the dissolution of the marriage. The second paragraph of Article 26 of the Family Code provides that “[w]here a marriage between a Filipino citizen and a foreigner is validly celebrated and a divorce is thereafter validly obtained abroad by the alien spouse capacitating him or her to remarry, the Filipino spouse shall have capacity to remarry under Philippine law.” In <i>Republic v. Orbecido</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> this Court recognized the legislative intent of the second paragraph of Article 26 which is “to avoid the absurd situation where the Filipino spouse remains married to the alien spouse who, after obtaining a divorce, is no longer married to the Filipino spouse”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> under the laws of his or her country. The second paragraph of Article 26 of the Family Code only authorizes Philippine courts to adopt the effects of a foreign divorce decree precisely because the Philippines does not allow divorce. Philippine courts cannot try the case on the merits because it is tantamount to trying a case for divorce.<br><br>The second paragraph of Article 26 is only a corrective measure to address the anomaly that results from a marriage between a Filipino, whose laws do not allow divorce, and a foreign citizen, whose laws allow divorce. The anomaly consists in the Filipino spouse being tied to the marriage while the foreign spouse is free to marry under the laws of his or her country. The correction is made by extending in the Philippines the effect of the foreign divorce decree, which is already effective in the country where it was rendered. The second paragraph of Article 26 of the Family Code is based on this Court’s decision in <i>Van Dorn v. Romillo</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> which declared that the Filipino spouse “should not be discriminated against in her own country if the ends of justice are to be served.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup><br><br>The principle in Article 26 of the Family Code applies in a marriage between a Filipino and a foreign citizen who obtains a foreign judgment nullifying the marriage on the ground of bigamy. The Filipino spouse may file a petition abroad to declare the marriage void on the ground of bigamy. The principle in the second paragraph of Article 26 of the Family Code applies because the foreign spouse, after the foreign judgment nullifying the marriage, is capacitated to remarry under the laws of his or her country. If the foreign judgment is not recognized in the Philippines, the Filipino spouse will be discriminated—the foreign spouse can remarry while the Filipino spouse cannot remarry.<br><br>Under the second paragraph of Article 26 of the Family Code, Philippine courts are empowered to correct a situation where the Filipino spouse is still tied to the marriage while the foreign spouse is free to marry. Moreover, notwithstanding Article 26 of the Family Code, Philippine courts already have jurisdiction to extend the effect of a foreign judgment in the Philippines to the extent that the foreign judgment does not contravene domestic public policy. A critical difference between the case of a foreign divorce decree and a foreign judgment nullifying a bigamous marriage is that bigamy, as a ground for the nullity of marriage, is fully consistent with Philippine public policy as expressed in Article 35(4) of the Family Code and Article 349 of the Revised Penal Code. The Filipino spouse has the option to undergo full trial by filing a petition for declaration of nullity of marriage under A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC, but this is not the only remedy available to him or her. Philippine courts have jurisdiction to recognize a foreign judgment nullifying a bigamous marriage, without prejudice to a criminal prosecution for bigamy.<br><br>In the recognition of foreign judgments, Philippine courts are incompetent to substitute their judgment on how a case was decided under foreign law. They cannot decide on the “family rights and duties, or on the status, condition and legal capacity” of the foreign citizen who is a party to the foreign judgment. Thus, Philippine courts are limited to the question of whether to extend the effect of a foreign judgment in the Philippines. In a foreign judgment relating to the status of a marriage involving a citizen of a foreign country, Philippine courts only decide whether to extend its effect to the Filipino party, under the rule of <i>lex nationalii </i>expressed in Article 15 of the Civil Code.<br><br>For this purpose, Philippine courts will only determine (1) whether the foreign judgment is inconsistent with an overriding public policy in the Philippines; and (2) whether any alleging party is able to prove an extrinsic ground to repel the foreign judgment, i.e. want of jurisdiction, want of notice to the party, collusion, fraud, or clear mistake of law or fact. If there is neither inconsistency with public policy nor adequate proof to repel the judgment, Philippine courts should, by default, recognize the foreign judgment as part of the comity of nations. Section 48(b), Rule 39 of the Rules of Court states that the foreign judgment is already “presumptive evidence of a right between the parties.” Upon recognition of the foreign judgment, this right becomes conclusive and the judgment serves as the basis for the correction or cancellation of entry in the civil registry. The recognition of the foreign judgment nullifying a bigamous marriage is a subsequent event that establishes a new status, right and fact<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> that needs to be reflected in the civil registry. Otherwise, there will be an inconsistency between the recognition of the effectivity of the foreign judgment and the public records in the Philippines.<br><br>However, the recognition of a foreign judgment nullifying a bigamous marriage is without prejudice to prosecution for bigamy under Article 349 of the Revised Penal Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> The recognition of a foreign judgment nullifying a bigamous marriage is not a ground for extinction of criminal liability under Articles 89 and 94 of the Revised Penal Code. Moreover, under Article 91 of the Revised Penal Code, “[t]he term of prescription [of the crime of bigamy] shall not run when the offender is absent from the Philippine archipelago.”<br><br>Since A.M.
