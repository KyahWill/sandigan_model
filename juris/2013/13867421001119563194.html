rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br><b><i>Ruling of the Metropolitan Trial Court</i></b><br><br>On November 17, 2004, the MeTC rendered a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> in favor of respondent BPI and declared petitioner-spouses liable to pay their remaining obligation for failure to notify Citytrust or respondent BPI of the alleged theft of the mortgaged vehicle and to submit proof thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> The MeTC considered the testimony of petitioner Manolito dubious and self-serving.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Pertinent portions of the Decision read:<br><br><blockquote>[Petitioner Manolito] declared on the witness stand that he sent to [Citytrust], through “fax,” the papers necessary to formalize his report on the loss of [the] subject motor vehicle, which included the Alarm Sheet (Exhibit “1”) and the Sinumpaang Salaysay of one Reynaldo Llanos y Largo (TSN dated August 3, 2004, pp. 17-19).<br><br>However, [his claim that] such documents were indeed received by [Citytrust] only remains self-serving and gratuitous. No facsimile report has been presented that such documents were indeed transmitted to Citytrust. No formal letter was made to formalize the report on the loss. For an individual such as [petitioner Manolito], who rather appeared sharp and intelligent enough to know better, an apparent laxity has been displayed on his part. Heedless of the consequences, [petitioner Manolito] simply satisfied himself with making a telephone call, if indeed one was made, to [a rank and file employee] of Citytrust or [respondent BPI] x x x and did not exercise x x x due diligence to verify any feedback or action on the part of the banking institution.<br><br>Worse, [petitioners] x x x failed to prove that they indeed submitted proof of the loss or theft of the motor vehicle. [Petitioner-spouses] merely [presented] an Alarm Sheet and the Sinumpaang Salaysay of one Reynaldo Llanos y Largo. But a formal police report on the matter is evidently missing. It behooved [petitioner-spouses] to establish the alleged theft of the motor vehicle by submitting a police action on the matter, but this, they did not do.<br><br>Haplessly, therefore, the required notice and proof of such loss have not been satisfied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></blockquote><br>Thus, the MeTC disposed of the case in this wise:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of [respondent BPI] and against [petitioner-spouses] Lourdes E. De Leon and Jose Manolito De Leon, as follows:<br><br><blockquote>(i) Ordering [petitioner-spouses] to jointly and severally pay the sum of P130,018.08 plus 5% interest per month as late payment charges from date of default on August 10, 1997, until fully paid;<br><br>(ii)&nbsp; Ordering [petitioner-spouses] to jointly and severally pay attorney’s fees fixed in the reasonable sum of P10,000.00; and<br><br>(iii)&nbsp; Ordering [petitioner-spouses] to jointly and severally pay the costs of suit.</blockquote>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></blockquote><br><b><i>Ruling of the Regional Trial Court (RTC)</i></b><br><br>On appeal,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> the RTC, Branch 34, reversed the MeTC Decision. Unlike the<br><br>MeTC, the RTC gave credence to the testimony of petitioner Manolito that he informed Citytrust of the theft of the mortgaged vehicle by sending through fax all the necessary documents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> According to the RTC, since there was sufficient notice of the theft, respondent BPI should have collected the proceeds of the insurance policy and applied the same to the remaining obligation of petitioner-spouses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> The <i>fallo</i> of the RTC Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> dated July 18, 2005 reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premised from the above considerations and findings, the decision appealed from is hereby reversed and set aside.<br><br>The Complaint and the counterclaim are hereby DISMISSED for lack of merit.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></blockquote><i><b><br>Ruling of the Court of Appeals</b></i><br><br>Aggrieved, respondent BPI elevated the case to the CA via a Petition for Review under Rule 42 of the Rules of Court.<br><br>On November 16, 2007, the CA reversed and set aside the RTC Order and reinstated the MeTC Decision, thus:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the instant petition for review is GRANTED. The Order issued by the Regional Trial Court of Manila (Branch 34), dated July 18, 2005, in Civil Case No. 05-111630, is REVERSED and SET ASIDE and the Decision of the Metropolitan Trial Court of Manila (Branch 6) is REINSTATED. No pronouncement as to costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></blockquote><br>Petitioner-spouses moved for reconsideration, which the CA partly granted in its September 19, 2008 Resolution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the foregoing premises considered, our decision of 16 November 2007 is deemed amended only to the extent herein discussed and the dispositive portion of said decision should now read as follows:<br><br><blockquote>“WHEREFORE, the instant petition for review is GRANTED.

Petitioner-spouses, on the other hand, had to prove their defense that the obligation was extinguished by the loss of the mortgaged vehicle, which was insured.<br><br>However, as aptly pointed out by the MeTC, the mere loss of the mortgaged vehicle does not automatically relieve petitioner-spouses of their obligation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> as paragraph 7 of the Promissory Note with Chattel Mortgage provides that:<br><br><blockquote>7. The said MORTGAGOR covenants and agrees to procure and maintain through the MORTGAGEE, a comprehensive insurance from a duly accredited and responsible insurance company approved by the MORTGAGEE, over the personalty hereinabove mortgaged to be insured against loss or damage by accident, theft, and fire for a period of one (1) year from date hereof and every year thereafter until the mortgage DEBTS are fully paid with an insurance company or companies acceptable to the MORTGAGEE in an amount not less than the outstanding balance of the mortgage DEBTS; that he/it will make all loss, if any, under such policy or policies payable to the MORTGAGEE forthwith. x x x<br><br>x x x x<br><br>MORTGAGOR shall immediately notify MORTGAGEE in case of los[s], damage or accident suffered by herein personalty mortgaged and submit proof of such los[s], damages or accident. Said los[s], damage or accident for any reason including fortuitous event shall not suspend, abate, or extinguish [petitioner spouses’] obligation under the promissory note or sums due under this contract x x x<br><br>In case of loss or damage, the MORTGAGOR hereby irrevocabl[y] appoints the MORTGAGEE as his/its attorney-in-fact with full power and authority to file, follow-up, prosecute, compromise or settle insurance claims; to sign, execute and deliver the corresponding papers, receipts and documents to the insurance company as may be necessary to prove the claim and to collect from the latter the insurance proceeds to the extent of its interest. Said proceeds shall be applied by the MORTGAGEE as payment of MORTGAGOR’s outstanding obligation under the Promissory Note and such other sums and charges as may be due hereunder or in other instruments of indebtedness due and owing by the MORTGAGOR to the MORTGAGEE and the excess, if any, shall thereafter be remitted to the MORTGAGOR. MORTGAGEE however shall be liable in the event there is a deficiency.<br><br>x x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup></blockquote><br>Based on the foregoing, the mortgagor must notify and submit proof of loss to the mortgagee. Otherwise, the mortgagee would not be able to claim the proceeds of the insurance and apply the same to the remaining obligation.<br><br>This brings us to the question of whether petitioner-spouses sent notice and proof of loss to Citytrust or respondent BPI.<br><br><b><i>Testimonial evidence must also be credible, reasonable, and in accord with human experience.</i></b><br><br>Testimonial evidence, to be believed, must come not only from the mouth of a credible witness, but must also “be credible, reasonable, and in accord with human experience.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> A credible witness must, therefore, be able to narrate a convincing and logical story.<br><br>In this case, petitioner Manolito’s testimony that he sent notice and proof of loss of the mortgaged vehicle to Citytrust through fax lacks credibility especially since he failed to present the facsimile report evidencing the transmittal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> His failure to keep the facsimile report or to ask for a written acknowledgement from Citytrust of its receipt of the transmittal gives us reason to doubt the truthfulness of his testimony. His testimony on the alleged theft is likewise suspect. To begin with, no police report was presented.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> Also, the insurance policy was renewed even after the mortgaged vehicle was allegedly stolen.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> And despite repeated demands from respondent BPI, petitioner-spouses made no effort to communicate with the bank in order to clarify the matter. The absence of any overt act on the part of petitioner-spouses to protect their interest from the time the mortgaged vehicle was stolen up to the time they received the summons defies reason and logic. Their inaction is obviously contrary to human experience. In addition, we cannot help but notice that although the mortgaged vehicle was stolen in November 1997, petitioner-spouses defaulted on their monthly amortizations as early as August 10, 1997. All these taken together cast doubt on the truth and credibility of his testimony.<br><br>Thus, we are in full accord with the findings of the MeTC and the CA that petitioner Manolito’s testimony lacks credence as it is dubious and self-serving.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> Failing to prove their defense, petitioner-spouses are liable to pay their remaining obligation.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition is hereby <b>DENIED</b>.
