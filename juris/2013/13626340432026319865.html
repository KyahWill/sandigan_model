Upon instructions of the chief of the PDEG, a surveillance was conducted in the area by SPO2 Violago, as the team leader, together with PO1 Quizon, PO1 Dimla, and PO2 Carlito Bernardo[,] as members.<br><br>The surveillance team proceeded to Barangay Poblacion, particularly observing the perimeter of [De Jesus’] abode along Mabini Street from 1:30 p.m. to 5:00 p.m.&nbsp; Various persons were noticed to have been coming in and out of the said house.<br><br>A buy bust operation was instructed by the PDEG chief with the assistance of a confidential agent, known as alias “Erap”.&nbsp; PO2 Carlito Bernardo was designated as the poseur buyer with SPO2 Violago, PO1 Jacinto, and PO1 Quizon as back up.&nbsp; The former was given two (2) pieces of marked one hundred peso bills of which he placed his initials CB on the center of the seal of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas of each bill.<br><br>At around 12:15 p.m. of March 31[,] 2002, the buy-bust team proceeded to the house of their confidential agent at Barangay Poblacion, merely 70 meters away from the house of [De Jesus].&nbsp; The team conducted a briefing on the procedure of their operation at their confidential agent’s house.<br><br>Around 1:00 p.m., PO2 Carlito Bernardo and the confidential agent proceeded to the house of [De Jesus] in the guise of buying sachets of shabu.&nbsp; Upon arrival thereat, the confidential agent introduced PO2 Carlito Bernardo to [De Jesus].&nbsp; [De Jesus] then asked about the money.&nbsp; PO2 Carlito Bernardo handed the money to [De Jesus] consisting of two (2) pieces of marked one hundred peso bills.&nbsp; [De Jesus], in turn, received the money and took out a white colored cylindrical plastic film case.&nbsp; From the film case, [De Jesus] took out a medium sized transparent plastic sachet and gave it to PO2 Carlito Bernardo.&nbsp; After receiving the sachet, the latter held [De Jesus] and introduced himself as a police officer.&nbsp; PO2 Carlito Bernardo recovered the film case from the right hand of [De Jesus].&nbsp; The film case contained two (2) medium sized and six (6) small sized transparent plastic sachets.&nbsp; The marked money was recovered from the pocket of [De Jesus].&nbsp; After asking [De Jesus] to bring out the contents of his pocket, a sachet of marijuana was likewise recovered.&nbsp; [De Jesus] was then informed of his constitutional rights.<br><br>While still at the scene of the incident, PO2 Carlito Bernardo marked the medium sized transparent plastic sachet handed by [De Jesus] to him as A-BB and CB.&nbsp; The other sachets found inside the film case [were] marked and initialed as follows: two (2) medium sized sachets were marked as B-P1-CB and B-P8-CB[,] while the six (6) small sachets were marked BP2-CB to BP7-CB.&nbsp; The sachet of marijuana recovered from [De Jesus’] pocket was marked as C-P9-CB.<br><br>[De Jesus] was immediately taken to the police station for proper investigation.&nbsp; The incident was logged and the evidence were turned over to the station’s investigator, PO2 Tomas Nachor.&nbsp; PO2 Tomas Nachor, in turn prepared the request for the laboratory examination of the recovered specimen and personally submitted the same to the crime laboratory office, which were later found positive for shabu and marijuana.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> (Citations omitted.)</blockquote><br>On the other hand, De Jesus, in his brief,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> denied the charges and claimed that he was framed by the confidential agent for personal reasons, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>On 28 March 2003, at around 12:00 o’clock in the afternoon, VICTOR DE JESUS was sleeping inside his house, while his children were watching television, when seven (7) persons suddenly entered and woke him up.&nbsp; The trespassers were a police asset named Marvin Crisostomo, police officers Quizon, Bernardo, Magona, Jacinto, and Chan.&nbsp; He knew the police officers because Crisostomo, a police asset, used to stay in his house.&nbsp; Whenever there would be a police operation, the group [would] usually gather inside his house.&nbsp; Crisostomo was formerly his friend but their relationship turned sour, because of the former’s illicit relationship with his sister-in-law, Sweet.&nbsp; Since then, Crisostomo held a grudge against him.&nbsp; When the group entered his house, they searched his room and his person but nothing illegal was found.&nbsp; The police officers merely planted the evidence against him and no buy-bust operation took place.<br><br>VICTORIA ANGELICA DE JESUS corroborated her father’s account.&nbsp; She was watching television when [the] police officers suddenly barged inside their house.&nbsp; The police officers were with Marvin Crisostomo, a police asset.&nbsp; [Her] father was handcuffed and they conducted a search in his room.&nbsp; The police officers then brought her father to the comfort room where he was bodily searched.&nbsp; When the police officers entered the children’s room, they suddenly declared that they have found something.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> (Citations omitted.)</blockquote><br>On November 4, 2008, the RTC convicted De Jesus in a Joint Judgment on Criminal Case Nos. 1091-M-2003 and 1092-M-2003, the <i>fallo</i> of which reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, finding the accused <b>GUILTY</b> beyond reasonable doubt, accused <b>VICTOR DE JESUS y GARCIA @ Vic</b> is hereby <b>CONVICTED</b>:<br><br><b>[A]</b> in Criminal Case No. 1091-M-2003, which charges accused with sale of dangerous drug consisting of one (1) heat sealed transparent plastic sachet of methylamphetamine hydrochloride commonly known as <i>shabu</i>, weighing 0.022 gram and a dangerous drug, in violation of Section 5, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165, otherwise known as the “Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002”, and is <b>SENTENCED</b> to suffer <b>LIFE IMPRISONMENT</b>, and to pay the FINE of Five Hundred Thousand Pesos (P500,000.00);<br><br><b>[B]</b> in Criminal Case No. 1092-M-2003, which charges accused for possession and control of dangerous drug consisting of eight (8) heat sealed transparent plastic sachets of methamphetamine hydrochloride commonly known as <i>shabu</i>, weighing 0.027, 0.019, 0.020, 0.017, 0.021, 0.018, 0.020, and 0.146 gram and are all dangerous drugs, in violation of Section 11, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165, otherwise known as the “Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002”, and is <b>SENTENCED</b> to suffer the imprisonment of, applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law,<b> TWELVE (12) YEARS AND ONE DAY, AS THE MINIMUM TERM, TO THIRTEEN (13) YEARS, AS THE MAXIMUM TERM</b>, and to pay the <b>FINE</b> of Three Hundred Thousand Pesos (P300,000.00);<br><br>As to the specimen subject of these cases and which are listed in Chemistry Report No. D-241-2003, the same are hereby confiscated in favor of the government.&nbsp;

The Joint Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Malolos City, Branch 76 dated 4 November 2008 finding accused-appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Sections 5 and 11, Article II of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9165, otherwise known as the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002, is <b><i>AFFIRMED</i></b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></blockquote><br>The Court of Appeals ruled that the prosecution was able to establish the chain of custody and preserve the integrity and identity of the confiscated drugs.&nbsp; It found De Jesus’ testimony as self-serving, and his daughter’s as biased, since there was no evidence presented to substantiate their claims.&nbsp; Moreover, the Court of Appeals noted that the improper motive imputed by De Jesus was against the confidential informant and not the police officers who apprehended him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Anent the discrepancy on the date the buy-bust operation took place, the Court of Appeals held that there was no discrepancy as March 29, 2003 was the date the operation was “supposed” to be carried out as opposed to the categorical statement from PO2 Bernardo that the actual buy-bust operation occurred on March 31, 2003.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Aggrieved, De Jesus appealed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> the above ruling to this Court, assigning the same errors he assigned before the Court of Appeals,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> viz:<br><br><blockquote><b><center>I</center><br>THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT DESPITE THE APPREHENDING OFFICERS’ FAILURE TO PRESERVE THE INTEGRITY AND IDENTITY OF THE SEIZED SHABU.<br><br><center>II</center><br>THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT OF THE CRIME CHARGED DESPITE THE PROSECUTION’S FAILURE TO PROVE HIS GUILT BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></blockquote><br>Discussing the two errors jointly, De Jesus claims that the prosecution failed to ensure that unnecessary doubts concerning the identity of the evidence were removed, as the police officers did not observe the proper procedure in the handling of seized articles.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>&nbsp; De Jesus states:<br><br><blockquote>[T]he mere fact of unauthorized sale or possession will not suffice to create in a reasonable mind the moral certainty required to sustain a finding of guilt.&nbsp; The fact that the substance illegally sold and possessed in the first place is the same substance offered in court as exhibit must also be established with the same unwavering exactitude as that requisite to make a finding of guilt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></blockquote><br>De Jesus also questions the discrepancy on the date of the buy-bust operation made by the prosecution’s lone witness, PO2 Bernardo.&nbsp; In his May 19, 2005 testimony, PO2 Bernardo declared that the buy-bust operation was conducted on March 29, 2003, which was two days earlier than the March 31, 2003 date he stated in his joint affidavit and the date in the Informations filed against De Jesus.<br><br><center><b><i>This Court’s Ruling</i></b></center><br>This Court would like to state at the outset that it is a settled rule that the trial court’s assessment of the credibility of the witnesses and their testimonies is entitled to great weight and will not be disturbed on appeal.&nbsp; Such rule will not apply only when it appears that a fact of weight and substance has been overlooked, misapprehended, or misapplied by the Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>&nbsp; After an exhaustive review and examination of the records of this case,&nbsp; the Court finds no cogent reason to reverse the consistent ruling of the RTC and the Court of Appeals.<br><br>De Jesus was charged and convicted for the sale and possession of dangerous drugs in violation of Sections 5 and 11, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165 or the Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002.&nbsp;
