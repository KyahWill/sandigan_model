Respondent has been Branch Clerk of Court for about ten (10) years and this is her first administrative complaint. The OCA recommended that respondent be suspended from the service for one (1) year without pay, with a warning that a repetition of the same or similar act will be dealt with more severely.</blockquote><br>Considering that the circumstances in Bacani’s earlier case are no longer present in this case, we impose the extreme administrative penalty of dismissal on Bacani. As for Villafuerte, he immediately complied with the OCA audit team’s directive to deposit the amount covering the shortages after being apprised of the shortages. Since this is Villafuerte’s first administrative case and he carried the responsibility of Officer-in-Charge and Cashier at the same time while Bacani was on leave, we adopt the OCA’s recommendation as to him.<br><br>Time and again, this Court has stressed that the behavior of those charged with the administration of justice, from the judge to the most junior clerk, is circumscribed with a heavy responsibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Their conduct must be guided by utmost propriety and decorum at all times, in order to merit and maintain the public’s respect for and trust in the Judiciary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> The Court will not tolerate any conduct, act or omission on the part of those who will violate the norm of public accountability and diminish or tend to diminish the faith of the people in the Judiciary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court finds Larriza P.
