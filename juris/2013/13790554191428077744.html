Its purposes include providing telecommunications services through space relay and repeater stations throughout the Philippines.<br><br>PHC is likewise a domestic corporation, previously known as Liberty Mines, Inc., and is engaged in the discovery, exploitation, development and exploration of oil. In 1997, Liberty Mines, Inc. changed its name to PHC, declassified its shares, and amended its primary purpose to become a holding company.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>The ownership structure of these corporations implies that whoever had control of POTC necessarily held 100% control of PHILCOMSAT, and in turn whoever controlled PHILCOMSAT wielded 81% majority control of PHC. Records reveal that POTC has been owned by seven families through their individual members or their corporations, namely: (<i>a</i>) the Ilusorio Family; (<i>b</i>) the Nieto Family; (<i>c</i>) the Poblador Family; (<i>d</i>) the Africa Family; (<i>e</i>) the Benedicto Family; (<i>f</i>) the Ponce Enrile Family; and (<i>g</i>) the Elizalde Family.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>Atty. Potenciano Ilusorio, the patriarch of the Ilusorio Family, owned shares of stock in POTC. A block consisting of 5,400 POTC shares of stock has become the bone of contention in a prolonged controversy among the parties. Atty. Ilusorio claimed that he had incurred the ire of Imelda Marcos during the regime of President Marcos, leading to the Marcos spouses’ grabbing from him the POTC shares of stock through threats and intimidation and without any valuable consideration, and placing such shares under the names of their <i><i>alter egos</i></i>, namely: 3,644 shares in the name of Independent Realty Corporation (IRC); 1,755 shares in the name of Mid-Pasig Land Development (Mid-Pasig); and one share in the name of Ferdinand Marcos, Jr.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>On February 25, 1986, the EDSA People Power Revolution deposed President Marcos from power and forced him and his family to flee the country. On February 28, 1986, newly-installed President Corazon C. Aquino issued Executive Order No. 1 to create the PCGG whose task was to assist the President in the recovery of all ill-gotten wealth amassed by President Marcos, his immediate family, relatives, subordinates and close associates, whether located in the Philippines or abroad, through the takeover or sequestration of all business enterprises and entities owned or controlled by them during President Marcos’ administration, directly or through nominees, by taking undue advantage of their public office and/or using their powers, authority, influence, connections or relationships.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Subsequently, Jose Y. Campos, a self-confessed crony of President Marcos, voluntarily surrendered to the PCGG the properties, assets, and corporations he had held in trust for the deposed President. Among the corporations surrendered were IRC (which, in the books of POTC, held 3,644 POTC shares) and Mid-Pasig (which, in the books of POTC, owned 1,755 POTC shares). Also turned over was one POTC share in the name of Ferdinand Marcos, Jr.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>With Campos’ surrender of IRC and Mid-Pasig to the PCGG, the ownership structure of POTC became as follows:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="40%"><div align="center">Owner</div></td><td width="20%"><div align="center">% of Shareholdings</div></td><td width="40%">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Ilusorio, Africa, Poblador, Benedicto and Ponce Enrile Families</td><td><div align="center">46.39%</div></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>PCGG (IRC and Mid-Pasig)</td><td><div align="center">39.92%</div></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Nieto Family</td><td><div align="center">13.12%</div></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Elizalde Family</td><td><div align="center">0.57%</div></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td><div align="center">100.00%</div></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>With 39.92% of the POTC shareholdings under its control, the PCGG obtained three out of the seven seats in the POTC Board of Directors. At the time, Manuel Nieto, Jr. was the President of both POTC and PHILCOMSAT. However, Nieto, Jr. had a falling out with other stockholders. To keep control of the POTC and PHILCOMSAT, Nieto, Jr. aligned with the PCGG nominees to enable him to wrest four out of seven seats in the POTC Board of Directors and five out of the nine seats in the PHILCOMSAT Board of Directors. Thus, Nieto, Jr. remained as the President of POTC and PHILCOMSAT.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>On July 22, 1987, the Government, represented by the PCGG, filed in the Sandiganbayan a Complaint for reconveyance, reversion, accounting, restitution and damages against Jose L. Africa, Manuel H. Nieto, Jr., President Marcos, Imelda R. Marcos, Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr., Roberto S. Benedicto, Juan Ponce Enrile and Atty. Potenciano Ilusorio.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8] </sup>The Complaint, docketed as SB Civil Case No. 009, alleged that the defendants “acted in collaboration with each other as dummies, nominees and/or agents of defendants Ferdinand E. Marcos, Imelda R. Marcos and Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr. in several corporations, such as the Mid-Pasig Land Development Corporation and the Independent Realty Corporation which, through manipulations by said defendants, appropriated a substantial portion of the shareholdings in Philippine Overseas Telecommunications Corporation and Philippine Communications Satellite Corporation held by the late Honorio Poblador, Jr., Jose Valdez and Francisco Reyes, thereby further advancing defendants’ scheme to monopolize the telecommunications industry;” that through their illegal acts, they acquired ill-gotten wealth; that their acts constituted “breach of public trust and the law, abuse of rights and power, and unjust enrichment;” and that their ill-gotten wealth, real and personal, “are deemed to have been acquired (by them) for the benefit of the plaintiff (Republic) and are, therefore, impressed with constructive trust in favor of (the latter) and the Filipino people.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>The Complaint prayed that all the funds, properties and assets illegally acquired by the defendants, or their equivalent value, be reconveyed or reverted to the Government; and that the defendants be ordered to render an accounting and to pay damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>In his Amended Answer with Cross-Claim (against the Marcoses) and Third-Party Complaint against Mid-Pasig and IRC, Atty. Ilusorio denied having acquired ill-gotten wealth and having unjustly enriched himself by conspiring with any of the defendants in committing a breach of public trust or abuse of right or of power, stating that “he has never held any public office nor has he been a government employee;” and that he was never a dummy or agent of the Marcoses. He interposed the affirmative defense that he owned 5,400 POTC shares of stock, having acquired them through his honest toil, but the Marcoses had taken the shares from him through threats and intimidation and without valuable consideration and then placed the shares in the names of their <i>alter egos</i>; and that he thus became “the hapless victim of injustice,” with the right to recover the shares and their corresponding dividends.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>On June 28, 1996, after a decade of litigation, the Republic, IRC and Mid-Pasig, and the PCGG (acting through PCGG Commissioner Hermilo Rosal) entered into a compromise agreement with Atty. Ilusorio, whereby Atty. Ilusorio recognized the ownership of the Republic over 4,727 of the POTC shares of stock in the names of IRC and Mid-Pasig, and, in turn, the Republic acknowledged his ownership of 673 of the POTC shares of stock and undertook to dismiss Civil Case No. 009 as against him.<br><br>The compromise agreement relevantly stated:<br><blockquote>WHEREAS, this Compromise Agreement covers the full, comprehensive and final settlement of the claims of the GOVERNMENT against ILUSORIO in Civil Case No. SB-009, pending before the Third Division of the Sandiganbayan; the Cross-Claim involving several properties located in Parañaque, Metro Manila; and the Third-Party Complaint filed by ILUSORIO, in the same case, involving the Five Thousand Four Hundred (5,400) shares of stocks registered in the names of Mid-Pasig Land Development Corporation (MLDC) and Independent Realty Corporation (IRC), respectively, in the Philippine Overseas Telecommunications Corporation (POTC);<br><br>x x x x<br></blockquote>President Ramos approved the compromise agreement, and directed its submission to the Sandiganbayan for approval through his marginal note dated October 5, 1996.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>It was not until June 8, 1998, or nearly two years from its execution, however, that the Sandiganbayan approved the compromise agreement, the resolution for which reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, and as prayed for in the Motion dated June 3, 1998, which is hereby granted.<br><br>1. The foregoing Compromise Agreement dated June 28, 1996 executed by and between the plaintiff and defendant Potenciano T. Ilusorio is hereby approved, the same not being contrary to law, good morals and public policy. The parties thereto are hereby enjoined to strictly abide by and comply with the terms and conditions of the said Compromise Agreement.<br><br>2. The complaint as against defendant Potenciano T. Ilusorio only in the above-entitled case No. 0009 is hereby dismissed.<br><br>3. The Motions for Injunction and Contempt, respectively, filed by defendant Potenciano T. Ilusorio against the Government/PCGG, its officers and agents, in Civil Case No. 0009 are hereby withdrawn;<br><br>4. The Third-Party Complaint and the Cross-Claim of defendant Potenciano T. Ilusorio are hereby dismissed; and<br><br>5. The Board of Directors, President and Corporate Secretary of the Philippine Overseas Telecommunications Corporation are hereby ordered to issue the corresponding stock certificates to, and in the names of Potenciano T. Ilusorio, Mid-Pasig Land Development Corporation, and Independent Realty Corporation, respectively.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br></blockquote>The result was the redistribution of the POTC shareholdings as follows:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="50%"><div align="center">Owner</div></td><td width="20%"><div align="center">% of Shareholdings</div></td><td width="30%">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Ilusorio, Africa, Poblador, Benedicto and Ponce Enrile Families</td><td><div align="center">51.37%</div></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>PCGG (IRC and Mid-Pasig)</td><td><div align="center">34.94%</div></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Nieto Family</td><td><div align="center">13.12%</div></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Elizalde Family</td><td><div align="center">0.57%</div></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><div align="center">Total</div></td><td><div align="center">100.00%</div></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>The Ilusorio Family’s shareholding became 18.12%, while that of the PCGG (through IRC and Mid-Pasig) was reduced to 34.94%. With its reduced shareholdings, the PCGG’s number of seats in the POTC Board settled at only two. The Ilusorio Family continued its alliance with the Africa, Poblador, Benedicto and Ponce Enrile Families. In effect, the compromise agreement tilted the control in POTC, PHILCOMSAT and PHC, such that the alliance between the Nieto Family and the PCGG, theretofore dominant, became the minority.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>After assuming the Presidency in mid-1998, President Estrada nominated through the PCGG Ronaldo Salonga and Benito Araneta, the latter a nephew of Nieto, Jr., to the POTC Board of Directors to represent the IRC and Mid-Pasig shareholdings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>As to the PHILCOMSAT Board of Directors, however, President Estrada through the PCGG nominated four nominees, namely: Salonga, Araneta, Carmelo Africa and Edgardo Villanueva. The nomination of the four ignored the reduction of the IRC and Mid-Pasig shareholdings in POTC that should have correspondingly reduced the board seats in PHILCOMSAT that the PCGG was entitled to from four to only three.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>On August 16, 1998, Mid-Pasig, represented by Salonga, filed in the Sandiganbayan in Civil Case No. 009 a Motion to Vacate the order dated June 8, 1998 approving the compromise agreement. On October 2, 1998, IRC, also represented by Salonga, filed a similar motion. Both motions insisted that the compromise agreement did not bind Mid-Pasig and IRC for not being parties thereto, although they held substantial interests in the POTC shareholdings subject of the compromise agreement; and that the compromise agreement was void because its terms were contrary to law, good morals and public policy for being grossly and manifestly disadvantageous to the Government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Aside from supporting the position taken by Mid-Pasig and IRC, PCGG added that the compromise agreement was fatally defective for lack of any PCGG resolution authorizing Commissioner Rosal to enter into the compromise agreement in behalf of the Government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>On his part, Atty. Ilusorio vigorously opposed the motions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>On August 28, 1998, PHILCOMSAT stockholders held an informal gathering at the Manila Golf Club for the apparent purpose of introducing the new PCGG nominees to the stockholders. During the proceedings, however, Atty. Luis Lokin, Jr. announced that the gathering was being considered as a Special PHILCOMSAT Stockholders’ Meeting. Those in attendance then proceeded to elect as Directors and Officers of PHILCOMSAT Nieto, Jr., Lourdes Africa, Honorio Poblador III, Salvador Hizon, Salonga, Araneta, Carmelo Africa, and Edgardo Villanueva (Nieto Group-PCGG).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>As a consequence, other PHILCOMSAT stockholders (namely, Ilusorio, Katrina Ponce Enrile, Fidelity Farms, Inc., Great Asia Enterprises and JAKA Investments Corporation) instituted a Complaint with application for the issuance of temporary restraining order (TRO) and writ of preliminary injunction (WPI) in the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) assailing the election of the Directors and Officers on several grounds, such as the lack of sufficient notice of the meeting, the lack of quorum, and the lack of qualifying shares of those who were elected. They maintained that by reason of POTC’s 100% beneficial ownership of PHILCOMSAT, there should have been a notice to POTC, which, upon a proper board meeting, should have appointed proxies to attend the PHILCOMSAT Stockholders’ Meeting. The case was docketed as SEC Case No. 09-98-6086.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>The SEC issued a TRO, and, later on, a WPI enjoining the Nieto Group-PCGG from acting as Directors and Officers of PHILCOMSAT and from representing themselves as such.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Salonga, Araneta, Africa and Villanueva commenced in the CA a special civil action for <i>certiorari</i> to nullify the WPI issued by the SEC (C.A.-G.R. SP NO. 49205). On October 15, 1998, however, the CA dismissed the petition for <i>certiorari</i> because of the petitioners’ failure to furnish a copy of the petition to the SEC. The dismissal became final and executory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Still, Salonga, Araneta, Africa and Villanueva brought in the CA another petition assailing the WPI issued by the SEC (C.A.-G.R. SP No. 49328). The CA also dismissed their petition on October 26, 1999.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>For their part, Nieto, Jr. and Lourdes Africa likewise went to the CA to assail the WPI issued by the SEC (C.A.-G.R. SP No. 49770), but on April 19, 2001, the CA dismissed the petition. Nieto, Jr. initially intended to appeal the dismissal, but the Court denied his motion for extension of time to file petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Following the enactment of Republic Act No. 8799 (<i>Securities Regulation Code</i>),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> SEC Case No. 09-98-6086 was transferred to the RTC in Makati City, which re-docketed it as Civil Case No. 01-840 and raffled it to Branch 138.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Meanwhile, on January 18, 1999, POTC held a Special Stockholders’ Meeting, at which the following were elected as Directors of POTC, namely: Roberto S. Benedicto, Atty. Victor Africa, Syl<i>via</i> Ilusorio, Honorio Poblador III, Cristina Agcaoili, Katrina Ponce Enrile, and Nieto, Jr. The elected Directors, except Nieto, Jr., eventually formed the Africa-Ilusorio Group. Thereafter, the Board of Directors held an organizational meeting during which they elected the following as the Officers of POTC, namely: Roberto S. Benedicto (Chairman); Atty. Victor Africa (Vice-Chairman); Syl<i>via</i> Ilusorio (President); Katrina Ponce Enrile (Vice President); Rafael Poblador (Treasurer); Kitchie Benedicto (Assistant Treasurer); and Atty. Victoria de los Reyes (Corporate Secretary).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>On December 20, 1999, the Sandiganbayan promulgated a resolution in SB Civil Case No. 009 denying IRC and Mid-Pasig’s motions to vacate the order approving the compromise agreement, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, third-party defendant Mid-Pasig’s Motion to Vacate Resolution Approving Compromise Agreement dated August 16, 1998 and third party defendant Independent Realty Corporation's Manifestation and Motion dated October 2, 1998 and the redundant and inappropriate concurrence of the PCGG and the OSG are hereby denied for lack of merit.<br><br>The Court also declares all POTC shares in the name of Mid-Pasig and IRC as null and void. Accordingly, out of the 5,400 POTC shares, six hundred seventy three (673) is hereby directed to be issued in the name of Potenciano Ilusorio and four thousand seven hundred twenty seven (4,727) in the name of the Republic of the Philippines. The Board of Directors, President and Corporate Secretary of the POTC are hereby ordered to comply with this requirement within ten (10) days from receipt of this Resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br></blockquote>In compliance with the resolution, POTC Corporate Secretary Victoria de los Reyes effected the cancellation of the shares registered in the names of IRC and Mid-Pasig and issued Certificate of Stocks No. 131 covering the 4,727 POTC shares in the name of the Republic. Thereafter, Certificate of Stocks No. 131 was transmitted to then Chief Presidential Legal Counsel and PCGG Chairman Magdangal Elma, who acknowledged receipt. Through its resolution dated January 12, 2000, the Sandiganbayan noted the POTC Corporate Secretary’s compliance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>As earlier mentioned, the implementation of the Sandiganbayan’s resolution dated December 20, 1999 resulted in the re-distribution of the shareholdings in POTC in the manner earlier shown.<br><br>On March 16, 2000, the PCGG filed in this Court its petition assailing the resolution of the Sandiganbayan dated December 20, 1999 (G.R. No. 141796 entitled <i>Republic of the Philippines, represented by the Presidential Commission on Good Government v. Sandiganbayan and Potenciano T. Ilusorio, substituted by Ma. Erlinda Ilusorio Bildner</i>).<br><br>IRC and Mid-Pasig also filed in this Court their own petition to assail the resolution dated December 20, 1999 (G.R. No. 141804 entitled <i>Independent Realty Corporation and Mid-Pasig Land Development Corporation v. Sandiganbayan and Potenciano T. Ilusorio, substituted by Ma. Erlinda Ilusorio Bildner</i>).<br><br>On March 29, 2000, this Court issued a TRO to enjoin the Sandiganbayan from executing its assailed resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>On September 6, 2000, President Estrada nominated another set to the PHILCOMSAT Board of Directors, namely: Carmelo Africa, Federico Agcaoili, Pacifico Marcelo and Edgardo Villanueva. Thereby, Africa and Villanueva were retained as PHILCOMSAT Directors, while Agcaoili and Marcelo replaced Araneta and Salonga.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Subsequently, POTC, through the Africa-Bildner Group, decided to hold a Special Stockholders’ Meeting on September 22, 2000. POTC Corporate Secretary de los Reyes issued a Notice of Meeting. Attempting to stop the Stockholders’ Meeting, Nieto, Jr., Araneta and Salonga filed in this Court in G.R. No. 141796 and G.R. No.141804 a Motion for Leave to Intervene with urgent manifestation for contempt of court, praying, among others, that POTC Corporate Secretary de los Reyes be cited in contempt and/or disbarred for issuing the Notice of Meeting.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>The Special Stockholders’ Meeting on September 22, 2000 was attended by stockholders representing 81.32% of the outstanding capital stock of POTC (including PCGG). During the meeting, a new set of POTC Board of Directors were elected, namely: Nieto, Jr., Katrina Ponce Enrile, Victor V. Africa, Syl<i>via</i> K. Ilusorio, Honorio A. Poblador III, Carmelo Africa and PCGG Commissioner Jorge Sarmiento (the latter two being nominated by PCGG).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>POTC then convened a Special Stockholders’ Meeting of PHILCOMSAT, at which the following were elected as Directors: Nieto, Jr., Francisca Benedicto, Katrina Ponce Enrile, Syl<i>via</i> Ilusorio, Honorio Poblador III, and government representatives Africa, Marcelo, Villanueva and Agcaoili (the latter four being nominated by PCGG).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>In line with existing corporate policy requiring the elected Directors to accept their election before assuming their positions, all the elected Directors (including Nieto, Jr.) were requested to sign acceptance letters to be submitted to POTC Corporate Secretary de los Reyes. A few days later, however, Nieto, Jr. refused to accept and instead opted to assail the validity of the September 22, 2000 POTC Special Stockholders’ Meeting.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>By virtue of the September 22, 2000 elections, the Africa-Bildner Group, together with the PCGG nominees, took control of the management and operations of POTC and PHILCOMSAT.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>In March 2002, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo named Enrique L. Locsin and Manuel D. Andal as new PCGG nominees to sit in the POTC and PHILCOMSAT Boards of Directors. Julio Jalandoni was named as the third new PCGG nominee to the PHILCOMSAT Board of Directors.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>On April 29, 2002, POTC, through the Africa-Ilusorio Group, decided to hold a stockholders’ meeting. Notices for the meeting were dispatched to all stockholders of record, including the Republic. However, the meeting was adjourned for failure to obtain a quorum because of the absence of several stockholders, including the proxy for the Republic.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>On December 3, 2003, Atty. Jose Ma. Ozamiz, a stockholder of PHC, sent a letter-complaint informing the SEC that PHC had not conducted its annual stockholders’ meetings since 2001. His letter-complaint was docketed as SEC Case No. 12-03-03.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>On December 29, 2003, the SEC issued the following Order in SEC Case No. 12-03-03, to wit:<br><blockquote>PREMISES CONSIDERED, the Commission in the exercise of its regulatory authority over corporations and associations registered with it hereby issues the following directives:<br><br>1.

PHC's inability to hold its annual stockholders’ meeting in the past years can be attributed to the following: previous attempts of the group of Mesdames Cristina Ilusorio and Syl<i>via</i> Ilusorio and Mr. Carmelo Africa (for brevity the “Ilusorio Group”) to control PHC without legal basis; delay in the completion of PHC's audited financial statements for the years 2001, 2002 and 2003 was caused by the Ilusorio Group and the pending dispute as to who between the Ilusorio Group, on one hand, and the group of Ambassador Manuel Nieto, Jr. Philippine Government, on the other, properly constitutes the governing board of directors and officers of the parent companies of PHC's, namely the Philcomsat and POTC;<br><br>Considering the aforesaid pending dispute as to who really controls the mother companies of PHC, it would be advisable and practicable that the annual meetings of the stockholders and the election of the directors and officers of Philcomsat and POTC should precede those of PHC. In view thereof, and for practical reasons and good order's sake, it was suggested that perhaps the Commission should direct the holding of the annual stockholders' meetings and election of directors and officers of both Philcomsat and POTC at a date or dates prior to those of PHC.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>4. x x x. Considering the foregoing, it is believed and humbly submitted that the 'COMELEC' directed to be organized under the Order is unnecessary considering that its would-be functions (we note that the Order did not state what are the functions of said COMELEC) can and will be performed by the Nomination Committee and the special committee of inspectors.<br><br>Considering the foregoing, it is respectfully requested and prayed that the said Order dated 5 January 2004 of the Commission be reconsidered and set aside. To enable PHC to hold an orderly and controversy-free meeting of its stockholders and election of directors this year, it is likewise requested that the Commission first direct and cause PHC's parent companies, namely Philcomsat and POTC, to hold their respective stockholders' meeting and election and directors and officers prior to those of PHC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br></blockquote>On May 6, 2004, the SEC ruled as follows:<br><br>Based on the foregoing premises, the Commission, in the exercise of its regulatory authority as well as supervision corporations and pursuant to its power under Section 5 (k) of the Securities Regulation Code (SRC) which states: “<i>Compel the officers of any registered corporation or association to call meetings of stockholders or members thereof under its supervision</i>,” hereby orders the following:<br><blockquote>1.

Locsin and Manuel Andal are nominee-directors representing the Republic of the Philippines, through the PCGG, in the board of directors of the Philippine Overseas Telecommunications Corporation (“POTC”) and the board of directors of Philippine Communications Satellite Corporation (“Philcomsat”), but not of Philcomsat Holdings Corporation (“PHC”). The third government nominee-director in Philcomsat is Mr. Julio Jalandoni. In February of 2004, Mr. Guy de Leon was nominated by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo as a third director for POTC in the event elections.<br><br>2. Based on the records of PCGG, it is true and correct that POTC has not held an uncontested annual meeting since its last uncontested stockholders' meeting in the year 1999.<br><br>3. Based on records of PCGG, it is true and correct that Philcomsat has not had an uncontested annual meeting since its special stockholders' meeting in the year 2000.<br><br>4. The Republic owns forty percent (40%) of the outstanding capital stock of POTC; Philcomsat is a wholly-owned subsidiary of POTC; and Philcomsat owns approximately eighty-five percent (85%) of the outstanding capital stock of PHC.<br><br>5. Because of the non-holding of elections for the board of directors of POTC, Philcomsat and PHC, the incumbent respective boards thereof have been holding office as “hold-over” directors, and opposing stockholders have contested their legitimacy.<br><br>6. The incumbent board of directors having actual corporate control of POTC and Philcomsat have invited government nominee-directors Messrs. Locsin and Andal, and Mr. Julio Jalandoni in respect of Philcomsat, to respectively occupy seats in said boards rendered vacant by resignations.<br><br>7. However, Messrs. Locsin, Andal and Jalandoni have not physically and actually assumed said positions, because of their request for assumption thereof on the basis of election for the board of directors through stockholders' meetings for the purpose.<br><br>8. In view of the ownership structure of POTC, Philcomsat and PHC and the rump boards that have resulted over the years, the more judicious mode towards a truly fair election of directors based on an accurate identification of stockholder representation in PHC (including in respect of government shares) would be to determine issues of representation in Philcomsat and POTC.<br><br>9.

Furthermore, not only does Africa lack any authority to file the instant action, the complaint itself is devoid of any meritorious legal basis.<br><br>53.

Hearings were conducted wherein the officers and directors of POTC and Philcomsat were required to be present and to file their comments. Victor Africa actively participated in the proceedings before the SEC, in his alleged capacity as officer of POTC, Philcomsat and PHC.<br><br>54. In view of the government interest in POTC which is the sole beneficial owner of Philcomsat, which in turn, is the 80% stockholder of PHC, and the fact that POTC and Philcomsat are under sequestration, the PCGG was likewise directed to file their comments on the matters raised by the parties. PCGG, through then Commissioner Victoria Avena, asserted that the government holds 40% interest in POTC. x x x.<br><br>55. Thereafter, the SEC issued the aforestated Order on 08 July 2004, directing the officers of POTC and Philcomsat to conduct their respective stockholders' meetings. Before the rendition of the 08 July 2004 Order, the Africa group did not conduct any stockholders' meeting of POTC or Philcomsat, but they would later claim that they had agreed, as early as 02 July 2004, to hold the meetings on 08 July 2004. Given the timing of the meeting, however, which was held after the 08 July 2004 SEC Order, no credence could be given to such self-serving claim. The timing and dates are more than mere convenient coincidences.<br><br>56. After POTC and Philcomsat duly held their respective stockholders' meetings on 05 August 2004 and 09 August 2004, the SEC upheld the validity of their meetings in its Order dated 20 August 2004.<br><br>57.

This Resolution (1) denied petitioners' separate motions to vacate the Sandiganbayan Order dated June 8, 1998 approving the Compromise Agreement; (2) declared the 5,400 POTC shares registered in the names of petitioners IRC and MLDC null and void as they categorically admitted that such shares are ill-gotten wealth of deposed President Marcos and his Family, and that the same were surrendered to the Government which now owns the same; and (3) ordered the Corporate Secretary of POTC, within 10 days from receipt of the Resolution, to issue 4,727 POTC shares in the name of the Republic, and 673 POTC shares in the name of Potenciano Ilusorio, pursuant to the approved Compromise Agreement.

SP No. 98097, raising exactly the same issues and seeking identical reliefs as they are now pending in the case at bar.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(5) The difficulty in resolving the present controversy lodged before this Honorable Court stems from the fact that even the legitimate POTC and PHILCOMSAT representatives become apparently undeterminable.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(9) Nonetheless, the conflicting claims over POTC and PHILCOMSAT have finally come to resolution with the recent developments.<br><br>(10) On 13 November 2007, the government appointed its new nominees to POTC and PHILCOMSAT. For POTC, the government, through Undersecretary Enrique D. Perez with the directive of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, appointed Atty. Daniel C. Gutierrez, Atty. Allan S. Montaño and Justice Santiago J. Ranada (Ret.) to the POTC board and represent the government's 34.9% shareholdings in the board of directors of POTC. In the same manner and for an akin purpose, the government appointed Mr. Ramon P. Jacinto, Mr. Rodolfo G. Serrano, Jr. and Radm. Abraham R. Abesamis (Ret.) to represent the government's 34.9% shareholdings on the board of directors of PHILCOMSAT. Although this Honorable Court may take judicial notice of these appointments, to evidence such new appointments, copies of the proxy issued by the Republic of the Philippines to Undersecretary Perez and the “I desire” letter of the Office of the President for the government's nominees to PHILCOMSAT, both dated 13 November 2007, and the list of nominees of Undersecretary Perez for POTC and his letter to PCGG Chairman Camilo Sabio, both dated 19 November 2007, are attached and made integral parts hereof as Annexes “B”, “B”, “C” and “D”, respectively.<br><br>(11) Needless to state, with the designation and their selection of the new government nominees to POTC and PHILCOMSAT, the old nominees, namely: Mr. Locsin, Mr. Manuel Andal, Mr. Julio Jalandoni and Mr. Guy de Leon are automatically replaced. This is an undeniable fact and had always been the procedure in the appointment and replacement of government nominees to the board of companies where the government has a substantial interest.<br><br>(12) Following the said appointment of new nominees, necessarily, annual stockholders meetings of both POTC and PHILCOMSAT were conducted and held on 19 November 2007 in order to elect the new directors of the respective boards of the two companies. During the said meetings, where over 90% of the shareholders were present and/or duly represented, the stockholders elected the new board of directors of POTC and PHILCOMSAT. These elections are evidenced by the Secretary's Certificates duly executed by the Corporate Secretaries of POTC and PHILCOMSAT, copies of which are attached and made integral parts hereof as Annexes “E” and “F”, respectively.<br><br>(13) Thus, the new government nominees, together with the private shareholders of POTC and Philcomsat are joined together in a unified board of directors for the two companies. In fact, after the new sets of directors had been elected, both companies conducted their respective organizational and board meetings.<br><br>(14) At the board meetings of POTC and Philcomsat held on 4 December 2007, POTC and PHILCOMSAT have decided, as the new, unassailably legitimate and only board of directors of POTC and PHILCOMSAT, to authorize the withdrawal of the instant petition filed in the name of POTC and PHILCOMSAT. The boards likewise in their resolutions, disallowed other persons to represent their companies. Copies of these resolutions issued by POTC and PHILCOMSAT are attached and made integral parts hereof as Annexes “G” and “H”, respectively.<br><br>(15) Thus, based on the foregoing, POTC and PHILCOMSAT, who are supposedly the petitioners in this case, move for the immediate withdrawal of the petition dated 14 March 2007 and the immediate lifting of the Writ of Preliminary Injunction dated 25 June 2007.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup><br></blockquote>The Urgent Motion to Withdraw Petition was opposed in a Comment and Opposition filed on February 13, 2008 that averred as follows:<br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br>4.

In fact, there is already a pending complaint before the Sandiganbayan that assails the supposed November 19, 2007 meetings stated in the motion to withdraw.<br><br>6. The Sandiganbayan, acting through the Fifth Division, granted the issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order on December 21, 2007, to prevent and prohibit any recognition of these November 19, 2007 meetings. x x x.<br><br>12. Petitioners, however, are compelled to address the misleading allegations and conclusions in the motion to withdraw. It is respectfully manifested that these alleged November 19, 2007 meetings were not called by the legitimate boards of petitioners POTC and Philcomsat. Only the legitimate boards, here represented by Mr. Locsin, can properly act upon any change in the government nominees, and it is only the legitimate boards that can install them. As manifested by petitioners to this Honorable Court, since there are no more legal challenges to the respective Boards of Directors of petitioners originally led by Ronaldo Salonga and Manuel Nieto, Jr., since 1998, only the successors of these boards, here represented by Mr. Locsin, can properly represent petitioners POTC and PHILCOMSAT.<br><blockquote>12.1. The issue was settled with the dismissal of the appeal in CA G.R. CV No. 88360, which stemmed from the original petition filed in 1998 by Potenciano Ilusorio, Katrina Ponce-Enrile, and their family owned corporations, to question the election of the Nieto-Salonga board. The appeal was dismissed by the Honorable Court of Appeals in its Resolution dated June 8, 2007, a copy of which is hereto attached as Annex B.<br></blockquote>13. It is significant that the manifestation and motion to withdraw made admissions that recognize the validity of the boards represented by Mr. Locsin.

(bold underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Conformably with Republic Act No. 8799, and with the ensuing resolutions of the Court on the implementation of the transfer of jurisdiction to the Regional Trial Court, the RTC (Branch 138) in Makati had the authority to hear and decide the election contest between the parties herein. There should be no disagreement that jurisdiction over the subject matter of an action, being conferred by law, could neither be altered nor conveniently set aside by the courts and the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[137]</sup><br><br>To buttress its position, however, the Nieto-Locsin Group relied on Section 2 of Executive Order No. 14,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[138]</sup> which expressly mandated that the PCGG “shall file all such cases, whether civil or criminal, with the Sandiganbayan, which shall have exclusive and original jurisdiction thereof.”<br><br>The reliance was unwarranted.<br><br>Section 2 of Executive Order No. 14 had no application herein simply because the subject matter involved was an intra-corporate controversy, not any incidents arising from, incidental to, or related to any case involving assets whose nature as ill-gotten wealth was yet to be determined. In <i>San Miguel Corporation v. Kahn</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[139]</sup> the Court held that:<br><blockquote>The subject matter of his complaint in the SEC does not therefore fall within the ambit of this Court’s Resolution of August 10, 1988 on the cases just mentioned, to the effect that, citing PCGG v. Pena, et al., all cases of the Commission regarding ‘the funds, moneys, assets, and properties illegally acquired or misappropriated by former President Ferdinand Marcos, Mrs. Imelda Romualdez Marcos, their close relatives, Subordinates, Business Associates, Dummies, Agents, or Nominees, whether civil or criminal, are lodged within the exclusive and original jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan,’ and all incidents arising from, incidental to, or related to, such cases necessarily fall likewise under the Sandiganbayan's exclusive and original jurisdiction, subject to review on <i>certiorari</i> exclusively by the Supreme Court.” <b>His complaint does not involve any property illegally acquired or misappropriated by Marcos, et al., or "any incidents arising from, incidental to, or related to" any case involving such property</b>, but assets indisputably belonging to San Miguel Corporation which were, in his (de los Angeles') view, being illicitly committed by a majority of its board of directors to answer for loans assumed by a sister corporation, Neptunia Co., Ltd.<br><br>De los Angeles’ complaint, in fine, is confined to the issue of the validity of the assumption by the corporation of the indebtedness of Neptunia Co., Ltd., allegedly for the benefit of certain of its officers and stockholders, an issue evidently distinct from, and not even remotely requiring inquiry into the matter of whether or not the 33,133,266 SMC shares sequestered by the PCGG belong to Marcos and his cronies or dummies (on which, issue, as already pointed out, de los Angeles, in common with the PCGG, had in fact espoused the affirmative). <b>De los Angeles’ dispute</b>, as stockholder and director of SMC, with other SMC directors, <b>an intra-corporate one, to be sure, is of no concern to the Sandiganbayan, having no relevance whatever to the ownership of the sequestered stock. The contention, therefore, that in view of this Court's ruling as regards the sequestered SMC stock above adverted to, the SEC has no jurisdiction over the de los Angeles complaint, cannot be sustained and must be rejected. The dispute </b>concerns acts of the board of directors claimed to amount to fraud and misrepresentation which may be detrimental to the interest of the stockholders, or <b>is one arising out of intra-corporate relations between and among stockholders, or between any or all of them and the corporation of which they are stockholders</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[140]</sup><br></blockquote>Moreover, the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan has been held not to extend even to a case involving a sequestered company notwithstanding that the majority of the members of the board of directors were PCGG nominees. The Court marked this distinction clearly in <i>Holiday Inn (Phils.), Inc. v. Sandiganbayan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[141]</sup> holding thusly:<br><blockquote>The subject-matter of petitioner’s proposed complaint-in-intervention involves basically, an interpretation of contract, i.e., whether or not the right of first refusal could and/or should have been observed, based on the Addendum/Agreement of July 14, 1988, which extended the terms and conditions of the original agreement of January 1, 1976. <b>The question of whether or not the sequestered property was lawfully acquired by Roberto S. Benedicto has no bearing on the legality of the termination of the management contract by NRHDC’s Board of Directors. The two are independent and unrelated issues and resolution of either may proceed independently of each other.</b> Upholding the legality of Benedicto’s acquisition of the sequestered property is not a guarantee that HIP's management contract would be upheld, for only the Board of Directors of NRHDC is qualified to make such a determination.<br><br><b>Likewise, the Sandiganbayan correctly denied jurisdiction over the proposed complaint-in-intervention. The original and exclusive jurisdiction given to the Sandiganbayan over PCGG cases pertains to (a) cases <i>filed by the PCGG</i>, pursuant to the exercise of its powers under Executive Order Nos. 1, 2 and 14. as amended by the Office of the President, and Article XVIII, Section 26 of the Constitution, i.e., where the principal cause of action is the recovery of ill-gotten wealth, as well as all incidents arising from, incidental to, or <i>related to such cases</i> and (b) <i>cases filed by those who wish to question or challenge the commission’s acts or orders in such cases</i>.<br><br>Evidently, petitioner’s proposed complaint-in-intervention is an ordinary civil case that does not pertain to the Sandiganbayan. As the Solicitor General stated, the complaint is not directed against PCGG as an entity, but against a private corporation, in which case it is not <i>per se</i>, a PCGG case.</b><br></blockquote>In the cases now before the Court, what are sought to be determined are the propriety of the election of a party as a Director, and his authority to act in that capacity. Such issues should be exclusively determined only by the RTC pursuant to the pertinent law on jurisdiction because they did not concern the recovery of ill-gotten wealth.<br><br><center><b>2.<br>Lack of pre-trial was not fatal<br>in intra-corporate election contests</b><br></center><br>Under Section 4 of Rule 6 (<i>Election Contests</i>) of the <i>Interim Rules of Procedure for Intra-Corporate Controversies</i>, which took effect on April 1, 2001 (A.M. No. 01-2-04-SC), issued pursuant to Republic Act No. 8799, the trial court, within two days from the filing of the complaint, may outrightly dismiss the complaint upon a consideration of the allegations thereof if the complaint is not sufficient in form and substance, or, if the complaint is sufficient, may order the issuance of summons which shall be served, together with a copy of the complaint, on the defendant within two days from its issuance. Should it find the need to hold a hearing to clarify specific factual matters, the trial court shall set the case for hearing, and the hearing shall be completed not later than 15 days from the date of the first hearing. The trial court is mandated to render a decision within 15 days from receipt of the last pleading, or from the date of the last hearing, as the case may be.<br><br>The CA correctly pointed out that Rule 6 nowhere required that the RTC acting as a special commercial court should first conduct a pre-trial conference before it could render its judgment in a corporate election contest. Hence, the RTC (Branch 138) in Makati properly heard the case of annulment of the election with dispatch in accordance with the guidelines set in the resolution in A.M. No. 01-2-04-SC. With the requirements of due process having been served, no defect infirmed the RTC’s ruling to set aside the election, and to oust those illegally elected.<br><br><center><b>3.<br>RTC (Branch 138) retained its jurisdiction<br>over the case that was ripe for adjudication</b><br></center><br>While it is true that this Court meanwhile revoked on June 27, 2006 the designation of the RTC (Branch 138) to act as a special commercial court, through the resolution in A.M. No. 03-3-03-SC, the RTC (Branch 138) did not thereafter become bereft of the jurisdiction to decide the controversy because of the exception expressly stated in the resolution in A.M. No. 03-3-03-SC itself, to wit:<br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br>Upon the effectivity of this designation, all commercial cases pending before Branches 138 and 61 shall be transferred to RTC, Branch 149, Makati City, <b>except those which are already submitted for decision, which cases shall be decided by the acting presiding judges thereat</b>. x x x.<br></blockquote>Contrary to the assertion of the Nieto-PCGG group, the foregoing provision did not require the issuance of any special order stating that the case was already submitted for decision. It was sufficient, given the summary nature of intra-corporate controversies, especially election contests, that the trial court was done collating all the evidence from the pleadings (<i>i.e.</i>, pleadings, affidavits, documentary and other evidence attached thereto, and the answers of the witnesses to the clarificatory questions of the court given during the hearings), if deemed sufficient, or from the clarificatory hearings, if conducted. The purpose of the exception is to ob<i>via</i>te the repetition of the gathering of evidence. It is clear from Section 9 of Rule 6 that after the collation of evidence, the only thing that remains is for the RTC to render its decision without issuing a special order declaring the case submitted for decision, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>Section 9. <i>Decision</i>. – The Court shall render a decision within fifteen (15) days from receipt of the last pleading, or from the date of the last hearing, as the case may be. The decision shall be based on the pleadings, affidavits, documentary and other evidence attached thereto and the answers of the witnesses to the clarificatory questions of the court given during the hearings.<br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">4.</span><br></div><center><b>Ruling in G.R.

No. 141804 invalidating the PHC elections conducted by the Nieto-PCGG Group, but rather the doctrine of <i>stare decisis et non quieta movere</i>, which means “to adhere to precedents, and not to unsettle things which are established.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[142]</sup><br><br>Under the doctrine of <i>stare decisis</i>, when the Court has once laid down a principle of law as applicable to a certain state of facts, the courts will adhere to that principle, and apply it to all future cases in which the facts are substantially similar, regardless of whether the parties and property involved are the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[143]</sup> The doctrine of <i>stare decisis</i> is based upon the legal principle or rule involved, not upon the judgment that results therefrom. It is in this particular sense that <i>stare decisis</i> differs from <i>res judicata</i>, because <i>res judicata</i> is based upon the judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[144]</sup><br><br>The doctrine of <i>stare decisis</i> is grounded on the necessity for securing certainty and stability in judicial decisions, thus:<br><blockquote>Time and again, the Court has held that it is a very desirable and necessary judicial practice that when a court has laid down a principle of law as applicable to a certain state of facts, it will adhere to that principle and apply it to all future cases in which the facts are substantially the same. <i>Stare decisis et non quieta movere</i>. Stand by the decisions and disturb not what is settled. <i>Stare decisis</i> simply means that for the sake of certainty, a conclusion reached in one case should be applied to those that follow if the facts are substantially the same, even though the parties may be different. It proceeds from the first principle of justice that, absent any powerful countervailing considerations, like cases ought to be decided alike. Thus, where the same questions relating to the same event have been put forward by the parties similarly situated as in a previous case litigated and decided by a competent court, the rule of <i>stare decisis</i> is a bar to any attempt to relitigate the same issue.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[145]</sup><br></blockquote>The question of who held the majority shareholdings in POTC and PHILCOMSAT was definitively laid to rest in G.R. No. 141796 and G.R. No. 141804, whereby the Court upheld the validity of the compromise agreement the Government had concluded with Atty. Ilusorio. Said the Court:–<br><blockquote>With the imprimatur of no less than the former President Fidel V. Ramos and the approval of the Sandiganbayan, the Compromise Agreement must be accorded utmost respect. <b>Such amicable settlement is not only allowed but even encouraged.</b> Thus, in <i>Republic vs. Sandiganbayan</i>, we held:<br><blockquote>‘It is advocated by the PCGG that respondent Benedicto retaining a portion of the assets is anathema to, and incongruous with, the zero-retention policy of the government in the pursuit for the recovery of <i>all</i> ill-gotten wealth pursuant to Section 2(a) of Executive Order No. 1. <b>While full recovery is ideal, the PCGG is not precluded from entering into a Compromise</b> <b>Agreement which entails reciprocal concessions if only to expedite recovery so that the remaining ‘funds, assets and other properties may be used to hasten national economic recovery</b>’ (3rd WHEREAS clause, Executive Order No. 14-A). <b>To be sure, the so-called zero retention mentioned in Section 2(a) of Executive Order No. 1 had been modified to read:</b><br><blockquote><b>‘WHEREAS, the Presidential Commission on Good Government was created on February 28, 1986 by Executive Order No. 1 to assist the President in the recovery of <i>ill-gotten wealth</i> accumulated by former President Ferdinand E. Marcos, his immediate family, relatives, subordinates and close associates’;</b><br></blockquote><b>which undoubtedly suggests a departure from the former goal of total restitution.</b><br><br>x x x x<br><br><b>The authority of the PCGG to enter into Compromise Agreements in civil cases and to grant immunity, under certain circumstances, in criminal cases is now settled and established.</b> In <i>Republic of the Philippines and Jose O. Campos, Jr. vs. Sandiganbayan, et al.</i> (173 SCRA 72 [1989]), <b>this Court categorically stated that amicable settlements and compromises are not only allowed but actually encouraged in civil cases. A specific grant of immunity from criminal prosecutions was also sustained</b>. In <i>Benedicto vs. Board of Administrators of Television Stations RPN, BBC, and IBC</i> (207 SCRA 659 [1992]), <b>the Court ruled that the authority of the PCGG to validly enter into Compromise Agreement for the purpose of avoiding litigation or putting an end to one already commenced was indisputable</b>. x x x (italics supplied)<br></blockquote>Having been sealed with court approval, the Compromise Agreement has the force of <i>res judicata</i> between the parties and should be complied with in accordance with its terms. Pursuant thereto, Victoria C. de los Reyes, Corporate Secretary of the POTC, transmitted to Mr. Magdangal B. Elma, then Chief Presidential Legal Counsel and Chairman of PCGG, Stock Certificate No. 131 dated January 10, 2000, issued in the name of the Republic of the Philippines, for 4,727 POTC shares. Thus, the Compromise Agreement was partly implemented.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[146]</sup><br></blockquote>As a result of the Government having expressly recognized that 673 POTC shares belonged to Atty. Ilusorio, Atty. Ilusorio and his group gained the majority control of POTC.<br><br>Applying the ruling in G.R. No. 141796 and G.R. No. 141804 to Civil Case No. 04-1049, the RTC (Branch 138) correctly concluded that the Nieto-PCGG Group, because it did not have the majority control of POTC, could not have validly convened and held the stockholders’ meeting and election of POTC officers on August 5, 2004 during which Nieto, Jr. and PCGG representative Guy De Leon were respectively elected as President and Chairman; and that there could not be a valid authority for Nieto, Jr. and/or Locsin to vote the proxies of the group in the PHILCOMSAT meeting.<br><br>For the same reason, the POTC proxies used by Nieto, Jr. and Locsin to elect themselves respectively as Chairman and President of PHILCOMSAT; and the PHILCOMSAT proxies used by Nieto, Jr. and Locsin in the August 31, 2004 PHC elections to elect themselves respectively as President and Acting Chairman of PHC, were all invalid for not having the support of the majority shareholders of said corporations.<br><br>While it is true that judicial decisions should be given a prospective effect, such prospectivity did not apply to the June 15, 2005 ruling in G.R. No. 141796 and G.R. No. 141804 because the ruling did not enunciate a new legal doctrine or change the interpretation of the law as to prejudice the parties and undo their situations established under an old doctrine or prior interpretation. Indeed, the ruling only affirmed the compromise agreement consummated on June 28, 1996 and approved by the Sandiganbayan on June 8, 1998, and accordingly implemented through the cancellation of the shares in the names of IRC and MLDC and their registration in the names of Atty. Ilusorio to the extent of 673 shares, and of the Republic to the extent of 4,727 shares. In a manner of speaking, the decision of the Court in G.R. No. 141796 and G.R. No. 141804 promulgated on June 15, 2005 declared the compromise agreement valid, and such validation properly retroacted to the date of the judicial approval of the compromise agreement on June 8, 1998.<br><br>Consequently, although the assailed elections were conducted by the Nieto-PCGG group on August 31, 2004 but the ruling in G.R. No. 141796 and G.R. No. 141804 was promulgated only on June 15, 2005, the ruling was the legal standard by which the issues raised in Civil Case No. 04-1049 should be resolved.<br><br><center><b>5.<br>Proper mode of appeal in intra-corporate cases<br>is by petition for review under Rule 43</b><br></center><br>In <i>Dee Ping Wee v. Lee Hiong Wee</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[147]</sup> the Court has expounded that the appropriate mode of appeal for an aggrieved party in an intra-corporate dispute is a petition for review under Rule 43 of the <i>Rules of Court</i>, to wit:<br><blockquote>Verily, the first part of Section 4, Rule 1 of the Interim Rules is categorical. Save for the exceptions clearly stated therein, the provision enunciates that a decision and order issued under the Interim Rules shall be enforceable immediately after the rendition thereof. In order to assail the decision or order, however, the second part of the provision speaks of an appeal or petition that needs to be filed by the party concerned. In this appeal or petition, a restraining order must be sought from the appellate court to enjoin the enforcement or implementation of the decision or order. Unless a restraining order is so issued, the decision or order rendered under the Interim Rules shall remain to be immediately executory.<br><br>On September 14, 2004, the Court issued a Resolution in A.M. No. 04-9-07-SC to rectify the situation wherein “lawyers and litigants are in a quandary on how to prevent under appropriate circumstances the execution of decisions and orders in cases involving corporate rehabilitation and intra-corporate controversies.” To address the “need to clarify the proper mode of appeal in [cases involving corporate rehabilitation and intra-corporate controversies] in order to prevent cluttering the dockets of the courts with appeals and/or petitions for <i>certiorari</i>,” the Court thereby resolved that:<br><blockquote>1. All decisions and final orders in cases falling under the <b>Interim Rules of Corporate Rehabilitation and the Interim Rules of Procedure Governing Intra-Corporate Controversies</b> under Republic Act No. 8799 shall be appealable to the Court of Appeals through a <b>petition for review under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court</b>.<br><br>2. <b>The petition for review shall be taken within fifteen (15) days from notice of the decision or final order of the Regional Trial Court.</b> Upon proper motion and the payment of the full amount of the legal fee prescribed in Rule 141 as amended before the expiration of the reglementary period, the Court of Appeals may grant an additional period of fifteen (15) days within which to file the petition for review. No further extension shall be granted except for the most compelling reasons and in no case to exceed fifteen (15) days. (Emphases ours.)<br></blockquote>x x x x<br><br>The issue that needs to be resolved at this point is whether or not petitioners pursued the correct remedy in questioning the RTC Decisions in Civil Case Nos. Q-04-091, Q-04-092 and Q-04-093. Corollary to this is whether or not the petitions for <i>certiorari</i> filed by petitioners could have been treated as petitions for review under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court, in accordance with the provisions of the Resolution in A.M. No. 04-9-07-SC, such that petitioners can be considered to have availed themselves of the proper remedy in assailing the rulings of the RTC.<br><br>We answer in the negative.<br><br>The term “petition” in the third and fourth paragraphs of A.M. No. 04-9-07-SC, cannot be construed as to include a petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court. The rationale for this lies in the essential difference between a petition for review under Rule 43 and a petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The RTC Decisions in Civil Case Nos. Q-04-091, Q-04-092 and Q-04-093 are final orders that disposed of the whole subject matter or terminated the particular proceedings or action, leaving nothing to be done but to enforce by execution what has been determined. As the RTC was unquestionably acting within its jurisdiction, all errors that it might have committed in the exercise of such jurisdiction are errors of judgment, which are reviewable by a timely appeal.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The Court of Appeals (12<sup>th</sup> Division) was, therefore, correct in dismissing the petition for <i>certiorari</i> in CA-G.R. SP No. 85878, which assailed the RTC Decision in Civil Case No. Q-04-091. x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[148]</sup><br></blockquote>The rule providing that a petition for review under Rule 43 of the <i>Rules of Court</i> is the proper mode of appeal in intra-corporate controversies, as embodied in A. M. No. 04-9-07-SC, has been in effect since October 15, 2004. Hence, the filing by POTC and PHC (Nieto Group) of the petition for <i>certiorari</i> on March 21, 2007 (C.A.-G.R. SP No. 98399) was inexcusably improper and ineffectual. By virtue of its being an extraordinary remedy, <i>certiorari</i> could neither replace nor substitute an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, like appeal in due course.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[149]</sup> Indeed, the appeal under Rule 43 of the <i>Rules of Court</i> would have been adequate to review and correct even the grave abuse of discretion imputed to the RTC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[150]</sup><br><br>As a consequence of the impropriety and ineffectuality of the remedy chosen by POTC and PHC (Nieto Group), the TRO and the WPI initially issued by the CA in C.A.-G.R.

Manzanal of the complaint for perjury against Locsin and his counsel Atty. Labastilla in the Office of the City Prosecutor of Manila did not amount to unlawful interference with the processes of the CA. There is no denying that Bildner was within her right as a party in interest in the proceedings then pending in the CA to bring the perjury charge against Locsin and his counsel for their failure to aver in the certification against forum shopping attached to the petition for <i>certiorari</i> in C.A.-G.R. SP No. 98399 of the pendency of another petition in C.A.-G.R. SP No. 98087 despite their knowledge thereof. Her complaint for perjury could really be dealt with by the Office of the City Prosecutor of Manila independently from any action the CA would take on the issue of forum shopping. As such, the filing of the complaint did not interfere with the CA’s authority over the petition in C.A.-G.R. SP No. 98399.<br><br>In this regard, we deem to be appropriate to reiterate what the Court said on the nature of contempt of court in <i>Lorenzo Shipping Corporation v. Distribution Management Association of the Philippines</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[151]</sup><i> viz</i>:<br><blockquote>Misbehavior means something more than adverse comment or disrespect. There is no question that in contempt the intent goes to the gravamen of the offense. Thus, the good faith, or lack of it, of the alleged contemnor should be considered. Where the act complained of is ambiguous or does not clearly show on its face that it is contempt, and is one which, if the party is acting in good faith, is within his rights, the presence or absence of a contumacious intent is, in some instances, held to be determinative of its character. A person should not be condemned for contempt where he contends for what he believes to be right and in good faith institutes proceedings for the purpose, however erroneous may be his conclusion as to his rights. To constitute contempt, the act must be done willfully and for an illegitimate or improper purpose.<br></blockquote>Nonetheless, the Court states that the power to punish for contempt is inherent in all courts, and is essential to the preservation of order in judicial proceedings and to the enforcement of judgments, orders, and mandates of the court, and ultimately, to the due administration of justice. But such power should be exercised on the preservative, not on the vindictive, principle. Only in cases of clear and contumacious refusal to obey should the power be exercised. Such power, being drastic and extraordinary in its nature, should not be resorted to unless necessary in the interest of justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[152]</sup><br><br><center><b>7.<br>Bildner Group entitled to injunctive relief<br></b></center><br>Concerning the propriety of the issuance of the WPI to enjoin BPI from letting the Locsin Group withdraw funds or transact with BPI on PHC’s deposits, the Court finds that the Bildner Group as the applicant had a right <i>in esse</i> to be protected by the injunctive relief. A right that is <i>in esse</i> is a clear and unmistakable right to be protected, and is one founded on or granted by law or is enforceable as a matter of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[153]</sup> The Bildner Group, because of the indubitability of its standing as a party in interest, showed a clear and unmistakable right to be protected.<br><br>In granting the Bildner Group’s application for the WPI, the RTC (Branch 62) emphasized the peculiarities of the case. Apparently, the Bildner Group relied on the fact that their election to the PHC Board of Directors was implemented and executed even prior to the WPI issued by the CA to stop the RTC (Branch 138) from implementing its decision in Civil Case No. 04-1049. The right that the Bildner Group relied on in seeking the execution of the decision was enforceable as a matter of law, for it emanated from the validly issued decision that was immediately executory under the pertinent rule. On the other hand, the TRO and WPI the CA issued in C.A.-G. R. SP No. 98399 could not and did not have any restraining effect on the immediately executory nature of the decision rendered in Civil Case No. 04-1049, because the matter had been brought to the CA through the wrong remedy.<br><br>Considering that the Bildner Group’s clear right to an injunctive relief was established, coupled with the affirmance of the consolidated decision of the CA upholding the validity of the July 28, 2004 election of the Bildner Group as Directors and Officers of PHC, the decision promulgated in C.A.-G.R. SP No. 102437 to the effect that Bildner’s standing as a party-in-interest was unclear, and that she failed to show a clear and unmistakable right to be protected by the writ of injunction, lost its ground.<br><br>Accordingly, the reversal of the decision promulgated in C.A.-G.R. SP No. 102437, and the reinstatement of the WPI issued against BPI by the RTC (Branch 62) in Civil Case No. 07-840 are in order.<br><br><center><b>8.<br>Supreme Court, not being a trier of facts,<br>will not reexamine the evidence</b><br></center><br>The insistence by POTC and PHC (Nieto Group) that the RTC’s decision in Civil Case No. 04-1049 was contrary to the facts and the evidence lacks merit.<br><br>The Court is not a trier of facts, and thus should not reexamine the evidence in order to determine whether the facts were as POTC and PHC (Nieto Group) now insist they were. The Court must respect the findings of the CA sustaining the factual findings of the RTC in Civil Case No. 04-1049. As a rule, the findings of fact by the CA are not reviewed on appeal, but are binding and conclusive.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[154]</sup> The reason for this has been well stated in <i>J.R. Blanco v. Quasha</i>: <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[155]</sup><br><blockquote>To begin with, this Court is not a trier of facts. It is not its function to examine and determine the weight of the evidence supporting the assailed decision. In <i>Philippine Airlines, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals</i> (275 SCRA 621 [1997]), the Court held that factual findings of the Court of Appeals which are supported by substantial evidence are binding, final and conclusive upon the Supreme Court. So also, well-established is the rule that “factual findings of the Court of Appeals are conclusive on the parties and carry even more weight when the said court affirms the factual findings of the trial court.” Moreover, well entrenched is the prevailing jurisprudence that only errors of law and not of facts are reviewable by this Court in a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Court, which applies with greater force to the Petition under consideration because the factual findings by the Court of Appeals are in full agreement with what the trial court found.<br></blockquote>We affirm, therefore, the appealed consolidated decision promulgated in C.A.-G.R.
