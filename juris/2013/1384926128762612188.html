				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Before the Court are three consolidated administrative complaints against respondent George E. Omelio, presiding Judge of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Davao City, Branch 14, for gross ignorance of the law, grave misconduct, oppression, bias and partiality.<br><br><center><b><u>The Facts</u></b></center><br><b><i>A.M. No. RTJ-11-2259</i></b><br><br>Complainant Ma. Regina S. Peralta is one of the plaintiffs in Civil Case No. 32,302-08 entitled “Bentley House Furniture Company, et al. vs. Jonathon Bentley Stevens, et al.” for Declaration of Nullity of Deed of Assignment, pending before the RTC of Davao City, Branch 11.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>On March 19, 2010, Jonathon Bentley Stevens, on behalf of the same company, and “Bentley House International Corp.” represented by its Attorney-in-Fact Atty. Michael Castaños,&nbsp; instituted Civil Case No. 33,291-10 against Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) for Easement of Right of Way with application for temporary restraining order (TRO), writ of preliminary injunction, damages and attorney’s fees.&nbsp; The case was raffled off to respondent who immediately issued a TRO effective for 20 days enjoining LBP from blocking the road leading to the company-owned factory.&nbsp; On the strength of this TRO, Stevens accompanied by his counsels and Sheriff Hipolito Belangal of RTC Branch 13, allegedly went to the said premises taking corporate properties along with those of Peralta and her family’s belongings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>Contending that the TRO was in direct contravention of orders issued by RTC Branch 11 in Civil Case No. 32,302-08, Peralta filed an administrative complaint against respondent.&nbsp; She argued that respondent’s <span style="font-style: italic;">ex parte</span> issuance of the TRO violates the basic procedure laid down in Section 4 (b), (c) and (d), Rule 58 of the Rules of Court.&nbsp; Had respondent conducted the requisite hearing, he would have been apprised of the following: (a) The complaint filed by Stevens and Atty. Castaños was previously the subject of an “Urgent Motion to Issue Order for Road Right of Way and/or Status Quo Pending Final Resolution” dated January 27, 2010, asking for the same relief, filed with the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 0115-MIN; (b) “Bentley House International Inc.” mentioned in the TRO does not exist and has no premises in the area where the right of way was sought; (c) LBP has in its favor a writ of possession on the property as early as March 2, 2000, which was reaffirmed by Judge Emmanuel C. Carpio in his Order dated December 3, 2004 in Civil Case No. 28,630-2001; and (d) LBP has not prevented Stevens or his agents from gaining access to the property, but sees them daily as they walk past the LBP guardhouse to the factory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>Peralta averred that the undue haste in the <i>ex parte</i> issuance of the TRO caused her great emotional and mental anguish as she had to deal with Stevens’ attempt to dispose and remove from company premises personal and corporate properties, thus preventing her from spending time with her family during the Holy Week.&nbsp; She further alleged incurring additional expenses in employing 24-hour security personnel to watch over the factory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br><b><i>A.M. No. RTJ-11-2264</i></b><br><br>Complainant Romualdo G. Mendoza is one of the defendants in Civil Case No. 32,245-08 entitled “Neighborhood Assn. of Sto. Rosario Old Airport Sasa, Inc. vs. Hon. Jose Emmanuel M. Castillo, MTCC Branch 1, 11th Judicial Region, Davao City, Romualdo G. Mendoza and Elaine Matas,” for Annulment of Judgment with prayer for preliminary injunction, TRO and attorney’s fees, initially assigned to the RTC of Davao City, Branch 11 presided by Judge Virginia Hofileña-Europa.&nbsp; On November 7, 2008, Judge Europa denied the plaintiff’s association’s application for a writ of preliminary injunction to restrain the execution of the decision rendered by Judge Castillo in Civil Case No. 20,001-A-07 of the Municipal Trial Court in Cities (MTCC), Branch 1 for unlawful detainer filed by Mendoza against the association.&nbsp; The latter’s motion for reconsideration was likewise denied under Judge Europa’s Order dated June 22, 2009 and the case was set for pre-trial conference on July 16, 2009.&nbsp; However, on July 16, 2009, the association filed a motion for voluntary inhibition of Judge Europa who thereupon issued an Order dated July 16, 2009 cancelling the scheduled pre-trial conference and setting the motion for hearing on July 24, 2009.&nbsp; After Judge Europa inhibited herself, the case was re-raffled off and later assigned to RTC Branch 14 presided by respondent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Seven months later, the association filed another motion to reconsider and set aside the July 16, 2009 Order of Judge Europa.&nbsp; After due hearing,&nbsp; respondent issued an Order dated February 2, 2010 setting aside the July 16, 2009 Order of Judge Europa and granting the association’s application for a writ of preliminary injunction. The writ of preliminary injunction was accordingly issued in favor of the association.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Mendoza filed an administrative complaint against respondent charging him with gross ignorance of the law and procedure, gross inefficiency and negligence, and violations of the <u>New Code of Judicial Conduct</u>, considering that: (1) The Motion for Reconsideration dated January 29, 2010 filed by the association was a second motion for reconsideration prohibited under Section 2, Rule 52 of the <u>Rules of Court</u>, and was filed seven months and five days after the denial of the association’s motion for reconsideration by Judge Europa on June 22, 2009;&nbsp; (2) The application for preliminary injunction was not accompanied by an affidavit of merit; (3) Respondent had not even read the records of the case when he issued the writ of preliminary injunction as he fondly called the association’s counsel,&nbsp; Atty. Mahipus (Davao City Councilor who was running for Congress) as “Congressman Mahipus” thus allowing his friendship with opposing counsel to inflict an injustice by being ignorant of what he was setting aside, at one time even arguing in said counsel’s behalf as if respondent was actually lawyering for plaintiff association; and (4) Respondent did not even indicate in his order granting the writ the reasons for setting aside the previous denial of Judge Europa.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br><b><i>A.M. No. RTJ-11-2273</i></b><br><br>Complainant Atty. Asteria E. Cruzabra is the Acting Registrar of Deeds of Davao City who had testified during the proceedings in Sp. Proc. No. 7527-2004 entitled “In Re: Petition for Judicial Reconstitution of Original and Owner’s Duplicate of Original Certificate of Title of the Registry of Deeds for Davao City and the Inscription of the Technical Descriptions Thereto” of the RTC of Davao City, Branch 14.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Helen P. Denila, petitioner in Sp. Proc. No. 7527-2004, sought the reconstitution of Original Certificate of Title (OCT) Nos. 67, 164, 219, 220, 301, 337 and 514 registered in the names of deceased spouses Constancio S. Guzman and Isabel Luna.&nbsp; Denila claimed to have authority, under a special power of attorney (SPA), from Bellie S. Artigas, the alleged “Administrator of Emilio Alvarez Guzman Estate, sole Heir of Constancio Guzman and Isabel Luna” who was granted 40% share in the estate of Don Constancio Guzman by virtue of an Agreement with Emilio Alvarez Guzman, which interest she had already sold to Denila.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>The Republic of the Philippines through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) filed its Opposition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> arguing that the documents attached to the amended petition are not sufficient sources for reconstitution of original certificates of title under Republic Act (R.A.) No. 26. At the trial, Cruzabra was called to testify on the certification she issued stating that the original titles in their custody are “mutilated and/or destroyed,” and was also presented as a witness for the State on the latter’s exhibits showing that the OCTs sought to be reconstituted contained markings/typewritten words indicating that said titles were already cancelled.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>On March 4, 2008, respondent rendered his Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> in favor of Denila, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, finding the instant petition well founded, the same is hereby granted.<br><br>The Registrar Register of Deeds of Davao City is hereby ordered to reconstitute the owners Original Duplicate copy of Original Certificate of Titles No. OCT No. 164, <b>OCT No. 219, OCT No. 220, OCT No. 301, OCT No. 337, OCT No. 514 and OCT No. 67</b> with the approved Technical Description of said parcels of land attached with this petition be respectively inscribed thereto and that the titles to the said mentioned parcels of land be duly registered in the name of the original owner Constancio Guzman, and considering that the latter through his attorney-in-fact Bellie S. Artigas sold the same to herein petitioner (Exhs. “G” to “M”), the Register of Deeds, Davao City is further ordered to correspondingly issue Transfer Certificate of Titles over the subject parcels of land in the name of herein petitioner.<br><br>Cost against the petitioner.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Cruzabra elevated the matter to the Land Registration Authority (LRA) by way of <i>consulta</i> pursuant to Section 117 of Presidential Decree No. 1529.&nbsp; Meanwhile, on May 26, 2008, the OSG filed a petition for relief from judgment with prayer for injunction assailing the validity of the March 4, 2008 Decision on the ground that reconstitution of OCT Nos. 219, 337, 67 and 164 was previously denied by this Court while OCT Nos. 514, 220 and 301 were cancelled on account of various conveyances and hence could not likewise be reconstituted.&nbsp; The OSG thus prayed that the March 4, 2008 Decision be set aside, the case be reopened and the Republic be allowed to present its evidence, and thereafter another decision be rendered by the court dismissing Denila’s petition for reconstitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>On September 3, 2008, respondent voluntarily inhibited himself from the reconstitution case (Sp. Proc. No. 7527-2004), apparently in reaction to insinuations that he was impelled by improper considerations in rendering the March 4, 2008&nbsp; Decision with “lightning speed” despite having just assumed office at Branch 14 after the former presiding judge returned to her permanent station.&nbsp; In his Order,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> respondent admitted he just copied the draft already written by the former presiding judge and signed the same, and thereupon stated:<br><br><blockquote>As there is already a doubt cast by these concerned sectors against the sense of impartiality and independence of the undersigned Presiding Judge he is therefore, voluntarily INHIBITING himself from further sitting in this case.<br><br>Let the record of this case be transmitted to the Office of the Executive Judge of this Court for re-raffling with the exception of Branch 14.&nbsp; SO ORDERED.</blockquote><br>The case was re-raffled off to Branch 15, but the presiding judge thereof, after setting the OSG’s petition for relief from judgment for hearing and directing Denila to file her answer, eventually inhibited himself upon motion filed by Denila.&nbsp; The case was thus sent back to Branch 14.<br><br>On June 10, 2008, Denila filed a verified petition to declare Cruzabra in contempt of court (Civil Case No. 32,387-08 for Indirect Contempt) which was raffled off to Branch 14.&nbsp; Cruzabra had refused to comply with the writ of execution served upon her to implement the March 4, 2008 Decision in the reconstitution case.&nbsp; Cruzabra moved to suspend the indirect contempt proceedings, citing the pendency of the OSG’s petition for relief from judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Meanwhile, on June 29, 2009, LRA Administrator Benedicto B. Ulep issued a Resolution in <i>Consulta</i> No. 4581 holding that based on the records, the certificates of title sought to be reconstituted in Sp. Proc. No. 7527-2004 are previously cancelled titles.&nbsp; The LRA thus opined that the March 4, 2008 decision is not registrable and hence the Registrar of Deeds may not be compelled to register the same despite its finality.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>On September 3, 2009, respondent issued an order denying the petition for relief stating that: (1) Neither the OSG nor the City Prosecutor who received a copy of the decision on March 10, 2008 filed an appeal or a motion for reconsideration; (2) Cruzabra made a wrong interpretation of the Rules by filing a <i>consulta</i> with the LRA; (3) Such gross negligence on their part resulted in the expiration of the period to appeal and the consequent issuance of a writ of execution.&nbsp; Prosecutor Samuel T. Atencia filed a motion for reconsideration on behalf of the Republic but respondent denied it in his Order dated October 1, 2009, on the ground that the notice of hearing was addressed to the Clerk of Court and not to the parties. In the Order dated December 8, 2009, Cruzabra was declared in contempt of court and ordered imprisoned until she complies with the March 4, 2008 Decision.&nbsp; On October 22, 2009, the OSG filed in the CA a petition for certiorari with urgent prayer for TRO and writ of preliminary injunction. On December 9, 2009, respondent issued a warrant of arrest against Cruzabra.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Cruzabra filed a motion for reconsideration of the December 8, 2009 Order but on December 17, 2009, respondent inhibited himself from further sitting on Civil Case No. 32,387-08 (Indirect Contempt) stating in his order that he was shown a pleading he had signed almost 30 years ago involving a big tract of land, a portion of which was involved in the reconstitution case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Civil Case No. 32,387-08 (Indirect Contempt) was eventually re-raffled off to Branch 16 presided by Judge Emmanuel C. Carpio.&nbsp; After due hearing, Judge Carpio issued an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> dated February 11, 2010 holding that Cruzabra’s refusal to comply with the March 4, 2008 decision was not contumacious, thus:<br><br><b></b><blockquote><b>GIVEN THE REASONS</b>, the Court finds merit on the Motion For Reconsideration filed by respondent Cruzabra. <b>CONSEQUENTLY</b>:<br><ol><li> THE Motion For Reconsideration is <b>GRANTED</b>;<br></li><li> Court Order dated December 8, 2009 is <b>SET ASIDE</b>;<br></li><li> The warrant for her arrest is <b>RECALLED</b>;<br></li><li>The instant petition is <b>DISMISSED</b>.</li></ol><b>SO ORDERED</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><b></b></blockquote><br>On February 17, 2010, the LRA denied the motion for reconsideration of the Resolution dated June 29, 2009 filed by Denila.&nbsp; Subsequently, she filed in Sp. Proc. No. 7527-2004 (reconstitution case) a motion to declare Cruzabra, Acting Registrar of Deeds Jorlyn B. Paralisan and LRA Administrator Ulep in contempt of court “for NOT performing and openly defying their ministerial functions” to implement the March 4, 2008 decision. On February 25, 2010, she also filed a motion for reconsideration of the February 11, 2010 Order of Judge Carpio dismissing Civil Case No. 32,387-08 (Indirect Contempt).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>At the hearing of the motion for contempt, Prosecutor Atencia opposed the conduct of the hearing, pointing out that pursuant to Section 4, Rule 71 of the <u>1997 Rules of Civil Procedure</u>, as amended, there must be an independent petition or action for indirect contempt which must be filed and docketed apart from the main case.&nbsp; In his Order dated March 4, 2010, respondent rejected the prosecutor’s stance, stating that there is no more interest left to be represented by the State as the main case had long been decided and had become final and executory two years ago.&nbsp; Respondent also disagreed with the contention that since the petition for indirect contempt was dismissed by Branch 16, Denila’s motion for contempt in the reconstitution case should likewise be dismissed, holding that <i>res judicata </i>does not obtain in the two cases, and further faulted the Register of Deeds for issuing the derivative titles despite the existence of the subject OCTs in the files of the LRA.&nbsp; Thus, respondent cited Cruzabra and Paralisan in contempt of court, while&nbsp; the motion for contempt with respect to Administrator Ulep for issuing a resolution tending to obstruct the administration of justice, will be dealt with in due time.&nbsp; A warrant of arrest was thereupon issued by respondent against Cruzabra and Paralisan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>On March 17, 2010, the Twenty-Second Division of&nbsp; CA-Mindanao Station granted in CA-G.R. SP No. 03270-MIN the Republic’s prayer for a TRO which was issued effective for 60 days.&nbsp; On the other hand, Judge Carpio in his Order dated March 18, 2010 denied the motion for reconsideration of Denila from the order dismissing her petition for indirect contempt (Civil Case No. 32,387-08). On May 17, 2010, the appellate court also granted the Republic’s application for a writ of preliminary injunction and the writ was issued “specifically enjoining the public respondent Judge George E. Omelio, his agents or deputies and all other persons acting for and [in] his behalf and under his authority, to forthwith CEASE and DESIST from enforcing, implementing, and executing the Decision of March 4, 2008, the Order of September 3, 2009, and the Order of October 1, 2009, as well as the Order of March 4, 2010 - during the pendency of this case and until final determination and judgment shall have been rendered x x x.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>On May 25, 2010, respondent granted Denila’s motion to require the City Engineer’s Office of Davao City to issue a fencing permit over the properties covered by OCT Nos. 164, 219, 220, 301, 337, 514 and 67.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Under Resolution dated October 5, 2010, the CA-MIN upon motion for clarification filed by Denila, assented to the said order for issuance of a fencing permit as well as a writ of demolition.&nbsp; Subsequently, motions to intervene with attached joint petitions for intervention were filed by third parties (Lolita P. Tano, et al. and Alejandro Alonzo, et al.) claiming to be possessors and actual occupants of lots previously covered by the OCTs sought to be reconstituted.&nbsp; They contended that Denila had speciously asked for the issuance of a fencing permit without disclosing that there were actual occupants and possessors of the subject properties.&nbsp; The City of Davao later joined the intervenors.&nbsp; On April 28, 2011, the CA-MIN (1) granted the motions to intervene filed by Tano, et al., Alonzo, et al. and the City of Davao and direct movants Tano, et al. and Alonzo, et al. to pay the required docket fees, and (2) recalled its October 5, 2010 Resolution insofar as the CA’s assent to the issuance of a fencing permit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Cruzabra charges respondent with ignorance of law and procedure, misconduct, bias, partiality and oppression in granting Denila’s petition for reconstitution despite the previous ruling of this Court in<i> Heirs of Don Constancio Guzman, Inc. v. Hon. Judge Emmanuel Carpio</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> against the reconstitution of OCT Nos. 219, 337, 67 and 164, and the failure of Denila to comply with the jurisdictional requirements under R.A. No. 26 (indicating (1) the nature and description of the buildings and improvements not belonging to the owner of the land; and (2) the names and addresses of occupants or persons in possession of the property).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Cruzabra likewise assails respondent for revoking his previous inhibition and denying the Republic’s petition for relief from judgment without conducting a hearing as required by Section 6, Rule 38 of the Rules of Court.&nbsp; The reason for similar denial of the motion for reconsideration filed by the OSG was also flimsy: the notice of hearing was addressed only to the Clerk of Court, even as the parties were all furnished with copies of the motion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>As to Civil Case No. 32,387-08 (Indirect Contempt), Cruzabra stresses that she was cited in contempt and ordered arrested by the respondent without any hearing.&nbsp; Respondent simply ignored the various motions filed by Cruzabra but did not require Denila to present evidence. And after respondent inhibited himself from the case, it was re-raffled off to Judge Carpio who eventually dismissed Denila’s petition and revoked the warrant of arrest earlier issued by respondent against Cruzabra. But despite Judge Carpio’s ruling that Cruzabra’s failure to obey the March 4, 2008 decision was not contumacious, respondent revoked his previous inhibition and proceeded to give due course to Denila’s <i>motion</i> to cite Cruzabra in contempt of court in the reconstitution case.&nbsp; Thus, not only did respondent fail to adhere to the requirement that contempt proceedings be initiated through a verified petition, his act of taking cognizance of a mere motion to cite Cruzabra in contempt of court and ordering her incarceration in jail until she complies with the March 4, 2008 Decision, had the effect of placing Cruzabra in double jeopardy.&nbsp; Additionally, Cruzabra cites the petition for certiorari filed in the CA by the OSG describing respondent’s acts which denied due process to the Republic as indicative of bias and partiality on his part.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Lastly, Cruzabra contends that respondent’s precipitous issuance of a warrant of arrest was oppressive. Respondent was overzealous in putting her to jail knowing that she cannot comply with the directive to reconstitute the owner’s original duplicate copies of OCT Nos. 164, 219, 220, 301, 337, 514 and 67 because the LRA ruled against their registrability.&nbsp; And after learning of the dismissal by Judge Carpio of the indirect contempt case, respondent immediately revoked his previous inhibition in Sp. Proc. No. 7527-2004 (reconstitution case) and took cognizance of Denila’s motion to cite in contempt Cruzabra along with Paralisan and Administrator Ulep.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br><b style="font-style: italic;">Respondent’s Answer</b><br style="font-style: italic;"><br>In A.M. No. RTJ-11-2259, respondent claims it was filed by Peralta merely to harass him so that he would dismiss a criminal case for estafa filed against Peralta involving the sum of P4 million now pending before Branch 14 (Crim. Case No. 65,463-2009), as in fact Peralta filed a motion for his recusal in the said case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>As to the TRO he had issued in favor of Stevens, respondent contends that the Chambers conference held at 9:00 in the morning substantially complies with the requirement of summary hearing under the Rules.&nbsp; Moreover, Peralta failed to exhaust her administrative remedies against the TRO before filing the present administrative complaint, such as a motion for reconsideration and petition for certiorari with the CA. Peralta also could have intervened in Civil Case No. 33,291-2010 (Easement of Road Right-of-Way).&nbsp; Respondent further points out that Peralta herself admitted it was LBP which allowed Stevens to freely access the subject property and hence she had no reason to complain on the TRO issued.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>In A.M. No. RTJ-11-2264, respondent asserts that Mendoza had no moral standing to file this administrative complaint considering that he had been indicted for Falsification under Article 172 of the <u>Revised Penal Code</u>, as amended, by the City Prosecutor’s Office of Davao City. He alleges that Mendoza was selling properties no longer owned by him, including the property subject of the unlawful detainer case (Civil Case No. 20,001-A-2007).&nbsp; In its entirety, the administrative complaint narrates errors allegedly committed by respondent, for which the appropriate remedy is the filing of a motion for reconsideration. The administrative complaint was therefore prematurely filed, aside from being a mere harassment suit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>In A.M. No. RTJ-11-2273, respondent vehemently denies the accusations of bias, partiality, misconduct and ignorance of the law and procedure.&nbsp; Cruzabra’s reliance on the LRA ruling is misplaced because the LRA had no authority and jurisdiction by mere <i>consulta</i> to interfere with, review, revoke and/or override a decision of the RTC which had already become final and executory.&nbsp; As to the previous ruling of this Court in <i>Heirs of Don Constancio Guzman, Inc. v. Hon. Judge Emmanuel Carpio</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> what petitioners therein failed to prove, petitioner Denila in Sp. Proc. No. 7527-2004 “overwhelmingly introduced evidence and proved [her] petition by complying with the mandate of the provisions of Section 2, R.A. 26 x x x.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Respondent contends that Cruzabra defiantly and deliberately refuses to perform her ministerial duty of complying with the March 4, 2008 decision, which resulted to her being cited in contempt of court.&nbsp; As for the denial of the OSG’s petition for relief from judgment, respondent faults Cruzabra for “wrongly elevating” the March 4, 2008 Decision to the LRA Administrator - by way of <i>consulta</i>, instead of appealing the same to the CA or filing a petition for certiorari in the Supreme Court -&nbsp; thereby allowing the said decision to become final and executory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>On the alleged denial of due process in the indirect contempt case, respondent vigorously denies it for being false and concocted, insisting that Cruzabra was formally charged but she did not bother to attend several hearings set by respondent.&nbsp; Contrary to the claims of Cruzabra, it is she, Paralisan and Administrator Ulep who connived and conspired with one another in “making a mockery of justice by avoiding the execution of the final decision” of respondent.&nbsp; Respondent believes that the present administrative complaint was filed to destroy his good name and reputation after deciding the reconstitution case in good faith, based on the proof and evidence presented during the trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br><center><b><u>Report of the Investigating Justice<br>Of the Court of Appeals</u></b></center><br>On March 28, 2012, Justice Zenaida T.

No. RTJ-11-2259, upon receiving the complaint on March 26, 2010,&nbsp; respondent granted the prayer for TRO after holding at his chambers a conference with the parties’ respective counsels who conformed to the issuance of a TRO. Peralta and her counsel thus had notice and the requirement of a summary hearing was substantially complied with.&nbsp; In any case, under Section 5,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Rule 58 of the Rules of Court, respondent was allowed to issue <i>ex parte</i> a TRO of limited effectivity and, in that time, conduct a hearing to determine the propriety of extending the TRO or issuing a writ of preliminary injunction.<br><br>Even assuming that respondent committed errors in issuing the TRO, Peralta could have pursued the appropriate remedy to challenge its validity. But nowhere in her complaint was it mentioned that she filed a motion for reconsideration or a petition for certiorari in the CA assailing the TRO. We have previously held that where sufficient judicial remedies exist, the filing of an administrative complaint is not the proper recourse to correct a judge’s allegedly erroneous act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Indeed, as a matter of public policy, not every error or mistake committed by judges in the performance of their official duties renders them administratively liable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>&nbsp; Only errors that are tainted with fraud, corruption or malice may be the subject of disciplinary actions.&nbsp; For administrative liability to attach, respondent must be shown to have been moved by bad faith, dishonesty, hatred or some other similar motive.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>&nbsp; Peralta failed to allege and prove any improper motive or bad faith on the part of respondent.&nbsp; She merely averred having suffered “undue emotional and financial hardships” because of respondent’s act. For this reason, her complaint against the respondent must be dismissed.<br><br>As to the charges of gross ignorance of the law, partiality and prejudgment in A.M. No. RTJ-11-2264, the complaint focuses on respondent’s Order dated February 2, 2010 in Civil Case No. 32,245-2008 (for “Annulment of Judgment”) which granted the association’s (defendant in the unlawful detainer case decided by the MCTC) motion for reconsideration of the July 16, 2009 Order issued by Judge Europa to whom the case was initially assigned.&nbsp; Aside from the fact that said motion was filed after the lapse of 7 months and 5 days from June 22, 2009 when Judge Europa denied the association’s motion for reconsideration of the November 7, 2008 Order denying the association’s application for a writ of preliminary injunction, the Order sought to be reconsidered – the July 16, 2009 Order – was, in fact, irrelevant because it merely cancelled the scheduled pre-trial conference as Judge Europa, upon motion filed by the association, inhibited herself from further handling the case.&nbsp; Mendoza stresses that the February 2, 2010 Order issued by respondent <i>granted</i> the association’s application for a writ of preliminary injunction, which was already denied under Judge Europa’s November 7, 2008 Order.&nbsp; He thus accuses respondent of committing patently erroneous acts in abuse of his authority when he entertained the association’s Motion for Reconsideration dated January 29, 2010 despite&nbsp; being a second motion for reconsideration proscribed by the Rules of Court which was filed only months after the application for a writ of preliminary injunction was denied by Judge Europa, and notwithstanding that the July 16, 2009 Order refers to the cancellation of the pre-trial hearing and not the denial of the application for a writ of preliminary injunction. These acts, coupled with respondent’s “arguing in behalf” of the association’s counsel whom he even called “Congressman Mahipus,” strongly indicate respondent’s partiality to the association.<br><br>We agree with the OCA that while the association’s motion dated January 29, 2010 was a second motion for reconsideration, said motion did not violate the rule prohibiting the filing of a second motion for reconsideration.<br><br>As Section 5, Rule 37 of the Rules of Court clearly provides, the proscription against a second motion for reconsideration is directed against “a judgment or <i>final</i> order.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, we held in<i> Philgreen Trading Construction Corporation v.

No. 26, and disregarding adverse findings or evidence of high officials of LRA that militates against the reconstitution of titles, to be of serious character warranting his dismissal from the service.&nbsp; We also charged Judge Velasco with knowledge of this Court’s pronouncement in <i>Alabang Development Corporation v. Valenzuela</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> and other precedents admonishing courts to exercise the “greatest caution” in entertaining petitions for reconstitution of allegedly lost certificates of title and taking judicial&nbsp; notice of innumerable litigations and controversies that have been spawned by the reckless and hasty grant of such reconstitution of allegedly lost or destroyed titles as well as of the numerous purchasers who have been victimized by forged or fake titles or whose areas simply expanded through table surveys with the cooperation of unscrupulous officials.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br>Here, respondent’s bad faith in disregarding the jurisdictional requirements in reconstitution proceedings is evident in his order for the issuance of a fencing permit and writ of demolition in favor of Denila.&nbsp; Respondent should have been alerted by the presence of actual occupants and possessors when, after the finality of the March 4, 2008 Decision which ordered the reconstitution of the subject OCTs, Denila moved for the issuance of a writ of demolition for such belied her allegation in the amended petition that “[T]here are no buildings or other structures of strong materials on the above-mentioned pieces of land, which do not belong to the herein petitioner”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> and the absence of any name and address of any occupant, possessor or person who may have an interest in the properties.<br><br>With the failure to serve actual notice on these occupants and possessors, Branch 14 had not acquired jurisdiction over Sp. Proc. No. 7527-2004, and therefore the March 4, 2008 Decision rendered by respondent is null and void.&nbsp; A decision of the court without jurisdiction is null and void; hence, it can never logically become final and executory.&nbsp; Such a judgment may be attacked directly or collaterally.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><br>But respondent’s bad faith is most evident in his reversal of his inhibition in Sp. Proc. No. 7527-2004 to act upon the petition for relief from judgment.&nbsp; Respondent voluntarily inhibited himself after rendition of the decision, only to resume handling the case and immediately denied the said petition for relief despite the previous order of Judge Tanjili setting the petition for hearing, and completely ignoring the jurisdictional defects of the decision raised by the OSG and Cruzabra.<br><br>It must be borne in mind that the inhibition of judges is rooted in the Constitution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> which recognizes the right to due process of every person.&nbsp; Due process necessarily requires that a hearing be conducted before an impartial and disinterested tribunal because unquestionably, every litigant is entitled to nothing less than the cold neutrality of an impartial judge. All the other elements of due process, like notice and hearing, would be meaningless if the ultimate decision would come from a partial and biased judge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br><br>The rule on disqualification of judges is laid down in Rule 137, Section 1 of the <u>Rules of Court</u>, which reads:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 1.&nbsp; <i>Disqualification of judges.</i> — No judge or judicial officer shall sit in any case in which he, or his wife or child, is pecuniarily interested as heir, legatee, creditor or otherwise, or in which he is related to either party within the sixth degree of consanguinity or affinity, or to counsel within the fourth degree, computed according to the rules of the civil law, or in which he has been executor, administrator, guardian, trustee or counsel, or in which he has presided in any inferior court when his ruling or decision is the subject of review, without the written consent of all parties in interest, signed by them and entered upon the record.<br><br>A judge may, in the exercise of his sound discretion, disqualify himself from sitting in a case, for just or valid reasons other than those mentioned above.</blockquote><br>The second paragraph governs voluntary inhibition. Based on this provision, judges have been given the exclusive prerogative to recuse themselves from hearing cases for reasons other than those pertaining to their pecuniary interest, relation, previous connection, or previous rulings or decisions. The issue of voluntary inhibition in this instance becomes primarily a matter of conscience and sound discretion on the part of the judge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br>In his September 3, 2008 Order, respondent after accepting the criticism of concerned sectors particularly on his speedy rendition of judgment in Sp. Proc. No. 7527-2004 even if he had just taken over Branch 14, and acknowledging that he merely copied the draft decision of the former presiding judge, voluntarily inhibited himself from further acting on the case for the reason that “there is already a doubt cast” on his sense of impartiality and independence.&nbsp; Notwithstanding this perceived bias and partiality on his part, respondent readily reassumed jurisdiction over the case when Judge Tanjili, to whom the case was re-raffled off, inhibited himself upon motion filed by Denila, and subsequently denied the petition for relief.<br><br>In <i>Garcia v. Burgos</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> we found respondent judge’s reversal of his previous inhibition as improper and the supposed bare allegation of prejudgment by a party litigant as insufficient and flimsy reason for revoking his voluntary inhibition. Thus:<br><br><blockquote>However, respondent judge reversed his voluntary inhibition, meekly stating in his Order dated March 12, 1996 that “[t]he allegation of prejudgment and partiality is so bare and empty as movant Osmeña failed to present sufficient ground or proof for the Presiding Judge to disqualify himself.&nbsp; The Judge realized the mistake in granting the motion for inhibition when defendant Osmeña misled the Court in asserting that on the same day February 26, 1996, he would be filing an administrative case against the Judge for violation of PD 1818 and Supreme Court Circulars&nbsp; issued in relation to said decree x x x.&nbsp; In that eventuality, Osmeña said, the Judge would be bias[ed] and partial to him because he [was] the complainant in the pending administrative case.”<br><br>We find merit in petitioners’ contention.&nbsp; Judge Burgos inhibited himself on the basis of Petitioner Osmeña’s allegation of prejudgment.&nbsp; <b>In reversing his voluntary inhibition, respondent judge nebulously branded Osmeña’s allegations as “so bare and empty.”</b>&nbsp; Judge Burgos’ claim that he was misled by Osmeña’s threat of an administrative case is obviously a mere afterthought that does not inspire belief.&nbsp; <b>Although inhibition is truly discretionary on the part of the judge, the flimsy reasons proffered above are insufficient to justify reversal of his previous voluntary inhibition</b>.&nbsp; As aptly pointed out by petitioners in their Memorandum,<br><blockquote><b>“‘x x x a judge may not rescind his action and reassume jurisdiction where good cause exists for the disqualification.</b>&nbsp; Furthermore, because a presumption arises, by reason of the judge’s prior order of disqualification, of the existence of the factual reason for such disqualification, where the regular judge who has been disqualified revokes the order of disqualification, and objection is made to such revocation, it is not sufficient for the judge to enter an order merely saying that he or she is not disqualified; the record should clearly reveal the facts upon which the revocation is made.’&nbsp; (46 Am Jur 2d § 234, p. 321)”</blockquote>We deem it important to point out that <b>a judge must preserve the trust and faith reposed in him by the parties as an impartial and objective administrator of justice</b>.&nbsp; When he exhibits actions that give rise, fairly or unfairly, to perceptions of bias, such faith and confidence are eroded, and he has no choice but to inhibit himself voluntarily.&nbsp; It is basic that “[a] judge may not be legally prohibited from sitting in a litigation, but when circumstances appear that will induce doubt [on] his honest actuations and probity in favor of either party, or incite such state of mind, he should conduct a careful self-examination.&nbsp; He should exercise his discretion in a way that the people’s faith in the courts of justice is not impaired.&nbsp; The better course for the judge is to disqualify himself.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> (Emphasis supplied; citations omitted.)</blockquote><br>Respondent gave no reason at all for revoking his previous inhibition save for the fact that it was re-raffled off back to Branch 14 when Judge Tanjili likewise inhibited himself. Thenceforth, he continued handling the case and issued various orders for the immediate implementation of his March 4, 2008 Decision.&nbsp; Having acknowledged that there were already doubts cast on his impartiality, respondent should not have resumed handling the case when it was re-raffled off to him following Judge Tanjili’s voluntary inhibition. Respondent by his acts transgressed Canon 3 of the <u>New Code of Judicial Conduct</u> on the judge’s duty to perform his official duties with impartiality. Thus, we underscored in one case that:<br><br><blockquote>x x x a presiding judge must maintain and preserve the trust and faith of the parties-litigants. He must hold himself above reproach and suspicion. <b>At the very first sign of lack of faith and trust in his actions, whether well-grounded or not, the judge has no other alternative but to inhibit himself from the case.</b> The better course for the judge under such circumstances is to disqualify himself. That way, he avoids being misunderstood; his reputation for probity and objectivity is preserved. What is more important, the ideal of impartial administration of justice is lived up to. x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>Further reinforcing his perceived lack of impartiality are respondent’s actuations in the indirect contempt proceedings lodged by Denila against Cruzabra who persistently refused to implement the said decision.<br><br>Section 4, Rule 71, of the <u>1997 Rules of Civil Procedure</u>, as amended, provides:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 4. <i>How proceedings commenced.</i> — Proceedings for indirect contempt may be initiated motu proprio by the court against which the contempt was committed by an order or any other formal charge requiring the respondent to show cause why he should not be punished for contempt.<br><br><b>In all other cases, charges for indirect contempt shall be commenced by a verified petition with supporting particulars and certified true copies of documents or papers involved therein, and upon full compliance with the requirements for filing initiatory pleadings for civil actions in the court concerned</b>. If the contempt charges arose out of or are related to a principal action pending in the court, the petition for contempt shall allege that fact but said petition <b>shall be docketed, heard and decided separately</b>, unless the court in its discretion orders the consolidation of the contempt charge and the principal action for joint hearing and decision. (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote><br>Thus, a person may be charged with indirect contempt only by either of two alternative ways, namely: (1) by a verified petition, if initiated by a party; or (2) by an order or any other formal charge requiring the respondent to show cause why he should not be punished for contempt, if made by a court against which the contempt is committed.&nbsp; In short, a charge of indirect contempt must be initiated through a <i>verified petition</i>, unless the charge is directly made by the court against which the contemptuous act is committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup><br><br>While the first contempt proceeding against Cruzabra was initiated by Denila in a verified motion and was separately docketed and heard (Civil Case No. 32,387-08), a second charge of contempt was later filed by Denila in the reconstitution case (Sp. Proc. No. 7527-2004) by way of a motion. Respondent after declaring Cruzabra in contempt of court in Civil Case No. 32,387-08 and ordering her arrest, inhibited himself upon the ground that he was apprised of a previous pleading he had signed relating to one of the properties involved in the reconstitution case. But when Civil Case No. 32,387-08 was dismissed by Judge Carpio, to whom the case was re-raffled off and who heard Cruzabra’s motion for reconsideration, Denila filed a motion to declare Cruzabra, Paralisan and Administrator Ulep in contempt of court in the reconstitution case.&nbsp; This time, unmindful of his previous inhibition in Civil Case No. 32,387-08 (December 17, 2009 Order), respondent took cognizance of the motion for contempt.&nbsp; After hearing, respondent declared Cruzabra and Paralisan in contempt of court and immediately issued warrants of arrest against them (the previous warrant of arrest against Cruzabra was recalled by Judge Carpio).<br><br>Respondent once again displayed an utter disregard of the duty to apply settled laws and rules of procedure when he entertained the second contempt charge under a mere motion, which is not permitted by the Rules.&nbsp; Worse, it was done notwithstanding respondent’s earlier voluntary inhibition in the indirect contempt case (Civil Case No. 32,387-08), which only raised suspicion of respondent’s unusual interest in the immediate execution of the March 4, 2008 Decision despite its jurisdictional defects.&nbsp; The two cases being so closely related, it did not matter that respondent’s previous inhibition on the matter of contempt was in the separate case (Civil Case No. 32,387-08) and not in Sp. Proc. No. 7527-2004. Notably, respondent inhibited himself from the indirect contempt case only after adjudging Cruzabra in contempt of court and issuing a warrant of arrest against her and, the motion for contempt in the reconstitution case involved the very same act of Cruzabra’s refusal to comply with the March 4, 2008 Decision and was filed only after Judge Carpio had dismissed the indirect contempt case and ruled that Cruzabra’s refusal to comply with the March 4, 2008 Decision was not contumacious.<br><br>All the foregoing considered, we find respondent guilty of gross ignorance of law and procedure and violation of Canon 3 of the <u>New Code of Judicial Conduct</u>, which merit administrative sanction.<br><br>Section 8 of Rule 140 on the Discipline of Judges and Justices, as amended by A.M. No. 01-8-10-SC,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> classifies gross ignorance of the law and gross misconduct constituting violations of the <u>Code of Judicial Conduc</u>t as serious charges, with the following imposable penalties:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 11. <i>Sanctions</i>. – A.

Dismissal from the service, forfeiture of all or part of the benefits as the Court may determine, and disqualification from reinstatement or appointment to any public office, including government-owned or controlled corporations. <i>Provided, however</i>, That the forfeiture of benefits shall in no case include accrued leave credits;<br><br>2. Suspension from office without salary and other benefits for more than three (3) but not exceeding six (6) months; or<br><br>3. A fine of more than P20,000.00 but not exceeding P40,000.00</blockquote><br>As pointed out by the OCA, this is not the first time respondent was found administratively liable.&nbsp; In A.M. No. MTJ-08-1701 (OCA IPI No. 08-1964-MTJ) entitled <i>“Milagros Villa Abrille versus Judge George Omelio, Municipal Trial Court in Cities, Branch 4, Davao City and Deputy Sheriff Philip N.

No. RT J-12-2321<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> decided just last year, respondent was found guilty of four counts of gross ignorance of the law for the following acts: (a) refusal to recognize spouses Crisologo as indispensable parties; (b) granting a contentious motion in violation of the three-day notice rule; (c) non-compliance with the rules on summons; and (d) rendering a decision in an indirect contempt case that cancels an annotation of a Sheriff’s Certificate of Sale on two titles without notifying the buyers, in violation of the latter’s right to due process. For the said infractions, respondent was penalized with fine of P40,000.00.<br><br>Respondent was sternly warned in both cases that repetition of the same or similar acts shall be dealt with more severely.&nbsp; Yet, from the facts on record, it is clear that respondent continued transgressing the norms of judicial conduct.&nbsp; All his past and present violations raise a serious question on his competence and integrity in the performance of his functions as a magistrate.&nbsp; With these in mind, we therefore adopt the recommendation of the OCA that the supreme penalty of dismissal is the proper penalty to be imposed on respondent in this case being the third time he is found administratively liable.&nbsp; Indeed, the Court can no longer afford to be lenient in this case, lest it give the public the impression that incompetence and repeated offenders are tolerated in the judiciary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, Judge George E.
