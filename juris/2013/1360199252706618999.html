It includes official recognizances, stipulations, bonds or undertakings issued by any company by virtue of and under the provisions of Act No. 536, as amended by Act No. 2206.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> We have consistently held that a surety’s liability is joint and several, limited to the amount of the bond, and determined strictly by the terms of contract of suretyship in relation to the principal contract between the obligor and the obligee.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> It bears stressing, however, that although the contract of suretyship is secondary to the principal contract, the surety’s liability to the obligee is nevertheless direct, primary, and absolute.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>In this case, respondent-spouses (obligee) filed with the RTC a Complaint against petitioner (surety) to collect on the performance bond it issued. Petitioner, however, seeks the dismissal of the Complaint on the grounds of lack of cause of action and lack of jurisdiction.<br><br><b><i>The respondent-spouses have cause of action <br>against the petitioner; the performance bond <br>is coterminous with the CCA</i></b><br><br>Petitioner claims that respondent-spouses have no cause of action against it because at the time it issued the performance bond, the CCA was not yet signed by respondent-spouses and Aegean.<br><br>We do not agree.<br><br>A careful reading of the Performance Bond reveals that the “bond is coterminous with the final acceptance of the project.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Thus, the fact that it was issued prior to the execution of the CCA does not affect its validity or effectivity.<br><br>But while there is a cause of action against petitioner, the complaint must still be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.<br><br><b><i>The CIAC has jurisdiction over the case </i></b><br><br>Section 4 of E.O. No. 1008 provides that:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 4. <i>Jurisdiction</i>. – The CIAC shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction over disputes arising from, or connected with, contracts entered into by parties involved in construction in the Philippines, whether the dispute arises before or after the completion of the contract, or after the abandonment or breach thereof. These disputes may involve government or private contracts. For the Board to acquire jurisdiction, the parties to a dispute must agree to submit the same to voluntary arbitration.<br><br>The jurisdiction of the CIAC may include but is not limited to violation of specifications for materials and workmanship, violation of the terms of agreement, interpretation and/or application of contractual time and delays, maintenance and defects, payment, default of employer or contractor, and changes in contract cost.<br><br>Excluded from the coverage of the law are disputes arising from employer-employee relationships which shall continue to be covered by the Labor Code of the Philippines.</blockquote><br>Based on the foregoing, in order for the CIAC to acquire jurisdiction two requisites must concur: “first, the dispute must be somehow connected to a construction contract; and second, the parties must have agreed to submit the dispute to arbitration proceedings.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>In this case, both requisites are present.<br><br>The parties agreed to submit to arbitration proceedings “[a]ny dispute arising in the course of the execution and performance of [the CCA] by reason of difference in interpretation of the Contract Documents x x x which [the parties] are unable to resolve amicably between themselves.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Article XVII of the CCA reads:<br><br><blockquote>ARTICLE XVII – ARBITRATION<br><br>17.1 Any dispute arising in the course of the execution and performance of this Agreement by reason of difference in interpretation of the Contract Documents set forth in Article I which the OWNER and the CONTRACTOR are unable to resolve amicably between themselves shall be submitted by either party to a board of arbitrators composed of Three (3) members chosen as follows: One (1) member shall be chosen by the CONTRACTOR AND One (1) member shall be chosen by the OWNER. The said Two (2) members, in turn, shall select a third member acceptable to both of them. The decision of the Board of Arbitrators shall be rendered within Ten (10) days from the first meeting of the board, which decision when reached through the affirmative vote of at least Two (2) members of the board shall be final and binding upon the OWNER and CONTRACTOR.<br><br>17.2 Matters not otherwise provided for in this Contract or by Special Agreement of the parties shall be governed by the provisions of the Arbitration Law, Executive Order No. 1008.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup></blockquote><br>In <i>William Golangco Construction Corporation v. Ray Burton Development Corporation</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> we declared that monetary claims under a construction contract are disputes arising from “differences in interpretation of the contract” because “the matter of ascertaining the duties and obligations of the parties under their contract all involve interpretation of the provisions of the contract.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Following our reasoning in that case, we find that the issue of whether respondent-spouses are entitled to collect on the performance bond issued by petitioner is a “dispute arising in the course of the execution and performance of [the CCA] by reason of difference in the interpretation of the contract documents.”<br><br>The fact that petitioner is not a party to the CCA cannot remove the dispute from the jurisdiction of the CIAC because the issue of whether respondent- spouses are entitled to collect on the performance bond, as we have said, is a dispute arising from or connected to the CCA.<br><br>In fact, in <i>Prudential Guarantee and Assurance, Inc. v. Anscor Land, lnc</i>.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> we rejected the argument that the jurisdiction of CIAC is limited to the construction industry, and thus, cannot extend to surety contracts. In that case, we declared that "[a]lthough not the construction contract itself, the performance bond is deemed as an associate of the main construction contract that it cannot be separated or severed fi·om its principal. The Performance Bond is significantly and substantially connected to the construction contract that there can be no doubt it is the CIAC, under Section 4 of E.O. No. 1008, which has jurisdiction over any dispute arising from or connected with it."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>In view of the foregoing, we agree with the petitioner that jurisdiction over the instant case lies with the CIAC, and not with the RTC. Thus, the Complaint filed by respondent-spouses with the RTC must be dismissed.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is hereby <b>GRANTED</b>.
