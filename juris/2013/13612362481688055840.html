He saw the appellants place their arms on Pablo’s shoulder, after which they struck Pablo with stones each of which was as big as the size of a fist.&nbsp; Pablo pleaded the appellants to stop but they did not.&nbsp; When Pablo fell to the ground, Benjamin smashed his head with a stone as big as Pablo’s head.&nbsp; Afterwards, appellants dragged him downhill towards the farm of one Efren Torion (Efren) in Sitio Liki.&nbsp; Romeo did not know what happened next because he ran to seek help.&nbsp; He went to the house of Espiridion Presbitero (Pideon), the <i>barangay</i> captain of Mayana.&nbsp; Pideon, in turn, coordinated with a certain Simo, the <i>barangay</i> captain of Bagacay.&nbsp; Romeo escorted Pideon and Simo to the place where the incident took place but Pablo was no longer there.&nbsp; They went to the house of appellant Abundio at Barangay Cangundo but the appellant was not there.&nbsp; The two captains then proceeded to the house of appellant Benjamin, who accompanied them to the farm of Efren.&nbsp; There they found the body of Pablo, which Dr. Aguilar later examined.<br><br>Before the court, Dr. Aguilar testified that Pablo sustained eleven (11) wounds<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> caused by blunt instrument(s) like stone(s).&nbsp; There were blood clots in the cranium and meninges.&nbsp; The death, according to her autopsy report, which she identified in court to have been prepared and signed by her, was caused by “cerebral hemorrhage due to laceration and contusion of the head.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>The defense, on the other hand, presented different versions for each of the appellants.<br><br>Appellant Benjamin, testified on his behalf.&nbsp; While he admitted of having been in the hilly portion of the road at Sitio Liki at around 2:30 in the afternoon of 30 April 1996, he denied any participation in the commission of the crime.&nbsp; Instead, he alleged that on his way home from the <i>fiesta</i>, he saw Pablo and appellant Abundio boxing each other beside the road fifteen (15) fathoms away from him.&nbsp; Appellant Benjamin did not see how the fight ended because he proceeded home.&nbsp; It was around 4:00 o’clock in the afternoon when he got to his house.&nbsp; Fifteen (15) minutes later, appellant Abundio came and told him that it was Pablo who boxed him first and that he should not tell anyone about the incident.&nbsp; The appellants spent the night at the Abundios. The following morning, the <i>barangay</i> officials were there looking for Pablo.&nbsp; Appellant Benjamin, who was still in the house, told the <i>barangay</i> captain that he witnessed the fight between appellant Abundio and Pablo.&nbsp; Appellant Abundio fled but was nevertheless apprehended in the afternoon of the same day.<br><br>On the other hand, appellant Abundio raised the defense of alibi. His father Teofilo testified to the effect that appellant Abundio and his other children were in the farm of one Tonying Paras at the time the crime was committed. They had breakfast in their house, which is approximately one kilometer away from the farm.&nbsp; Then they went back to the farm and stayed there until 6:00 o’clock in the afternoon.&nbsp; By 8:00 o’clock in the evening, they retired for the night.&nbsp; It was only the following morning that he learned of the death of Pablo whose body was found in the creek around two kilometers from his house, and that his son appellant Abundio was identified as one of the suspects.<br><br>Appellant Abundio corroborated his father’s testimony stating that he was helping out in the farm at the time the crime was committed.&nbsp; He only learned that Pablo had been killed the day after the incident.<br><br>After trial, both appellants were convicted of murder.&nbsp; The dispositive portion of the decision of the trial court reads:<br><br><blockquote>JUDGMENT is therefore rendered declaring the two (2) accused, Benjamin Peteluna and Abundio Binondo, GUILTY of the crime of MURDER and they are sentenced to suffer the penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA and to pay the heirs of the victim the sum of One Hundred Thousand Pesos (P100,000.00) as indemnity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></blockquote><br>On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed with modification the assailed decision in this wise:<br><br><blockquote><b><i>IN LIGHT OF ALL THE FOREGOING</i></b>, the Decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 60, Barili, Cebu in Criminal Case No. CEB-BRL-050, [finding] appellants guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Murder is hereby <b>AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION </b>only in the award of damages.&nbsp; The penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> is affirmed.&nbsp; Appellants are ordered to pay solidarily the heirs of the victim Php50,000.00 as civil indemnity and Php25,000.00 as exemplary damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></blockquote><br>Before this Court, appellants Benjamin and Abundio argued that the crime committed was only homicide because of the absence of the circumstances of treachery and evident premeditation, which would have qualified the killing to murder, and that their respective defenses of denial and alibi were meritorious.&nbsp; They likewise pointed out that the testimony of the prosecution’s witness Romeo is not credible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br><center><b><i>Our Ruling</i></b><br></center><br>We sustain the conviction of both appellants.<br><br><i>The crime committed was murder.</i><br><br>To be convicted of murder, the following must be established: (1) a person was killed; (2) the accused killed him; (3) the killing was with the attendance of any of the qualifying circumstances under Article 248<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> of the Revised Penal Code; and (4) the killing neither constitutes parricide nor infanticide.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Appellants maintain that the qualifying circumstance of treachery was not attendant in the commission of the crime considering that there was no element of surprise when Pablo was attacked.&nbsp; Pablo had the opportunity to defend himself.&nbsp; Appellant Benjamin, in his Supplemental Brief, further argued that even if there was suddenness of the attack, Pablo could have chosen to retreat.<br><br>We are not convinced.<br><br>We have time and again declared that “[t]he essence of treachery is a deliberate and sudden attack, affording the hapless, unarmed and unsuspecting victim no chance to resist or to escape,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> and that it may still exist even if the attack is frontal so long as the same is sudden and unexpected.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>In this case, it was clear that the elderly victim had no inkling of the impending danger against him.&nbsp; The attack was sudden notwithstanding the prior act of placing the assailants’ arms on the shoulder of the victim because such was done in a friendly manner.&nbsp; As the young Romeo, on cross examination, testified:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">You said that they then put their arms on the shoulder of Pablo Estomo, how did they do it?

Sinda</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> the Court had the occasion to further illustrate the attendance of treachery in a situation where the defenseless victims had already fallen to the ground and there was no risk to the assailant against any attack from the victims thereby facilitating the execution of the commission of the crime.&nbsp; Thus:<br><br><blockquote>The appellants, in waylaying the victims, obviously employed a mode of attack which was deliberately designed to insure the death of their victims without any risk they could have made against them.&nbsp; <b>Felix and Rogelio were both unarmed at the time the appellants pelted the two with stones.&nbsp; It must be stressed that when the victims fell on the ground after the appellants threw stones at them, there was no danger on the part of the appellants of any attack from the victims.&nbsp; The victims were not in a position to defend themselves at the time appellant Gaspar hacked them on their necks</b>.&nbsp; In other words, the method employed by the accused insured his safety from any defensive or retaliatory act on the part of the victims.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> (<i>Emphasis supplied</i>)<br></blockquote><br>Like the victims in <i>Sinda</i>, Pablo fell to the ground unarmed and defenseless, except that, in the present case, after the victim had fallen to the ground, the appellants used a big stone the size of a head of a man instead of a bladed weapon.&nbsp; Romeo described how the two appellants attacked Pablo, to wit:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">What happened to Pablo Estomo when he was struck with stones by Abundio Binondo and B[e]njamin Peteluna?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Pablo Estomo was still standing at that time and said “don’t harm me because I have no grudge against you.”</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">What did the accused do when they heard that statement from Pablo Estomo?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">They still struck stones towards Pablo Estomo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">x x x x</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br></blockquote>He detailed cross examination:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="JUSTIFY">A: </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">When the victim was struck and he was hit for the first time at the left side of the head the victim was still standing.

Then Benjamin Peteluna picked up a stone and smashed the victim who was on the ground.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br></blockquote>We agree with the appellants, however, that the prosecution failed to establish the presence of the qualifying circumstance of evident premeditation. Such could only be appreciated if there was evidence to show the following:<br><br><blockquote>(1) the time when the offender [was] determined to commit the crime; (2) an act manifestly indicating that the accused clung to his determination; and (3) a sufficient lapse of time between determination and execution to allow himself time to reflect upon the consequences of his act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></blockquote><br>None, for any such circumstance, was offered in the instant case.&nbsp; The testimony of Romeo, save from the statement that the appellants were whispering to each other before they placed their arms on Pablo’s shoulder, was confined to the acts that caused the death of the victim.<br><br><b><i>Denial and alibi cannot prevail over the positive<br> identification of the assailants by the witness;<br>Denial is inherently weak if uncorroborated;<br>For alibi to prosper, it must be established that <br>it was physically impossible for the appellant to<br> have been at the locus criminis</i></b><br><br>It is a time-honored principle that the positive identification of the appellant by a witness destroys the defense of <i>alibi</i> and denial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Thus:<br><br><blockquote>x x x It is well-entrenched that <i>alibi</i> and denial are inherently weak and have always been viewed with disfavor by the courts due to the facility with which they can be concocted.&nbsp; They warrant the least credibility or none at all and cannot prevail over the positive identification of the appellant by the prosecution witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>&nbsp; For <i>alibi</i> to prosper, it is not enough to prove that appellant was somewhere else when the crime was committed; he must also demonstrate that it was physically impossible for him to have been at the scene of the crime at the time of its commission.&nbsp; Unless substantiated by clear and convincing proof, such defense is negative, self-serving, and undeserving of any weight in law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>&nbsp; Denial, like alibi, as an exonerating justification[,] is inherently weak and if uncorroborated regresses to blatant impotence.&nbsp; Like <i>alibi</i>, it also constitutes self-serving negative evidence which cannot be accorded greater evidentiary weight than the declaration of credible witnesses who testify on affirmative matters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></blockquote>In this case, Romeo positively identified the appellants, whom he both knew since he was a child,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> thereby rendering the defenses of alibi and denial weak.&nbsp; Certainly, it was not physically impossible for appellant Abundio to be at the hilly portion of Sitio Liki where Pablo was attacked, the same being only a kilometer away from his own house and two (2) kilometers away from the farm where he and his father allegedly were on that fateful day. Appellant Benjamin’s bare denial, on the other hand, is definitely self-serving.&nbsp; It cannot stand against the positive identification of an unbiased and credible witness.<br><br><b><i>Credibility of the testimony is not affected<br>by inconsistencies on points not relevant<br>to the elements of the crime</i></b><br><br>Appellant Benjamin faulted the witness for being able to give a complete account of the incident even during the time that he was supposed to have been scampering away for safety.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Romeo, on cross-examination, clarified that when he decided to take cover, he did not turn his back from his companion.&nbsp; He just stepped back and accidentally found the bushes from where he hid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> This, he said, gave him the opportunity to witness the entire incident.&nbsp; He nonetheless testified during the continuation of the cross-examination that he was not able to look at the direction of Pablo all the time for he had to look for where he was going.&nbsp; This notwithstanding, appellant Benjamin cannot conclude that Romeo was not telling the truth when he said that Pablo was attacked by the appellants using the stones on the ground.&nbsp; The autopsy report supported his testimony.&nbsp; If at all, Pablo could have actually been hit more than the number of times Romeo claimed it to be.<br><br>Be that as it may, we see this inconsistency trivial.&nbsp; It is not relevant to the elements of the crime as to affect the credibility of Romeo’s testimony.&nbsp; So with the inconsistencies primarily on the same points separately raised by appellant Abundio.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Settled is the rule on the matter that:<br><br><blockquote>x x x [O]ur scrutiny of the so-called inconsistencies relied upon by Asilan showed that they only referred to minor details, which did not affect the credibility of the prosecution witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>&nbsp; In <i>People v. Albarido</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> this Court said:<br><br><blockquote>It is elementary in the rule of evidence that inconsistencies in the testimonies of prosecution witnesses with respect to minor details and collateral matters do not affect the substance of their declaration nor the veracity or weight of their testimony.&nbsp; In fact, these minor inconsistencies enhance the credibility of the witnesses, for they remove any suspicion that their testimonies were contrived or rehearsed.&nbsp; In <i>People vs. Maglente</i>, this Court ruled that inconsistencies in details which are irrelevant to the elements of the crime are not grounds for acquittal. x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></blockquote></blockquote><br>As to the rest of the testimony of Romeo, a reading of the transcript of stenographic notes would show that he rendered a straightforward and consistent testimony even on cross examination.&nbsp; There is, therefore, no reason for us to depart from the well-entrenched principle that:<br><br><blockquote>x x x [T]he task of assigning values to the testimonies of witnesses and weighing their credibility is best left to the trial court which forms first-hand impressions as witnesses testify before it.&nbsp; It is thus no surprise that findings and conclusions of trial courts on the credibility of witnesses enjoy, as a rule, a badge of respect, for trial courts have the advantage of observing the demeanor of witnesses as they testify.&nbsp; x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></blockquote><br>All considered, we are convinced that the guilt of appellants had been sufficiently established with moral certainty.<br><br><b><i>The imposable penalty is reclusion perpetua<br>in the absence of aggravating and mitigating<br>circumstances</i></b><br><br>Under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, the penalty attached to the commission of the crime of murder is <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua </span>to death.&nbsp; Since neither aggravating nor mitigating circumstances attended the commission of the crime, the proper imposable penalty on the appellant is <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br><b><i>Appellant is liable for civil indemnity,<br>moral damages, exemplary damages<br>and 6% interest on all damages</i></b><br><br>The civil indemnity in the amount of P50,000.00 awarded by the Court of Appeals is in order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>&nbsp; There is, however, a need to increase the award of exemplary damages from P25,000.00 to P30,000.00 to conform to existing jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>&nbsp; In addition, the victim’s heirs shall be entitled to moral damages even in the absence of proof that they suffered mentally and emotionally<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> considering that “[a] violent death invariably and necessarily brings about emotional pain and anguish on the part of the victim’s family.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>&nbsp; A 6% interest on all the monetary awards for damages to be reckoned from the date of finality of this decision until fully paid shall likewise be imposed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Decision dated 11 July 2007 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
