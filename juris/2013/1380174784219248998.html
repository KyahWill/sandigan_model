				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">One of the Heirs of Reverend Father Vicente Rallos (Heirs of Fr. Rallos), Lucena B. Rallos<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> (Lucena), is now before this Court with a petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> praying for the citation for indirect contempt of the City of Cebu, Mayor Michael Rama (Mayor Rama), the presiding officer and members of the <i>Sangguniang Panlungsod</i>, and lawyers from the Office of the City Attorney (respondents). The instant petition is anchored on Lucena’s allegation that the respondents impede the execution of final and executory judgments rendered by this Court in G.R. Nos. 179662<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> and 194111<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>. G.R. Nos. 179662 and 194111 were among a string of suits which originated from a Complaint for Forfeiture of Improvements or Payment of Fair Market Value with Moral and Exemplary Damages<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> filed in 1997 by the Heirs of Fr. Rallos before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Cebu City, Branch 9, against the City of Cebu relative to two parcels of land<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> with a total area of 4,654 square meters located in <i>Barangay</i> Sambag I which were expropriated in 1963 for road construction purposes.<br><br><center><b>Antecedent Facts</b><br></center><br>At the root of the controversy are Lots 485-D and 485-E of the Banilad Estate, Sambag I, Cebu City, which were expropriated to be used as a public road in 1963. The Heirs of Fr. Rallos alleged that the City of Cebu occupied the lots in bad faith <i>sans</i> the authority of the former’s predecessors-in-interest, who were the registered owners of the subject parcels of land.<br><br>On June 11, 1997, the Heirs of Fr. Rallos filed before the RTC a Complaint for Forfeiture of Improvements or Payment of Fair Market Value with Moral and Exemplary Damages against the City of Cebu.<br><br>In its Answer filed on October 6, 1997, the City of Cebu contended that the subject parcels of land are road lots and are not residential in character. They have been withdrawn from the commerce of men and were occupied by the City of Cebu without expropriation proceedings pursuant to Ordinance No. 416 which was enacted in 1963 or more than 35 years before the Heirs of Fr. Rallos instituted their complaint.<br><br>On January 14, 2000, the RTC rendered a Decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> which found the City of Cebu liable to pay the Heirs of Fr. Rallos just compensation in the amount still to be determined by a board of three commissioners, one each to be designated by the contending parties and the court.<br><br>To assail the Decision rendered on January 14, 2000, the City of Cebu filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which was however denied by the RTC on February 5, 2001.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>The members of the Board of Commissioners thereafter submitted their respective appraisal reports. On July 24, 2001, the RTC rendered a Decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> the dispositive portion of which, in part, reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the [RTC] hereby renders judgment, ordering [the City of Cebu] to pay [the Heirs of Fr. Rallos] as just compensation for Lots 485-D and 485-E the amount of Php34,905,000.00 plus interest at 12% per annum to start 40 days from [the] date of this decision and to continue until the whole amount shall have been fully paid. [The City of Cebu] is further ordered to pay [the Heirs of Fr. Rallos] the following amounts:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; Php50,000.00 as reimbursement for attorney’s fees;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; Php50,000.00 as reimbursement for litigation expenses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br></blockquote>The contending parties both moved for the reconsideration of the Decision rendered on July 24, 2001. The City of Cebu argued that the reckoning period for the computation of just compensation should be at least not later than 1963 when the said lots were initially occupied. On the other hand, the Heirs of Fr. Rallos insisted that the amount of just compensation payable by the City of Cebu should be increased from Php 7,500.00 to Php 12,500.00 per sq m, the latter being the fair market value of the subject lots. They also prayed for the award of damages in the amount of Php 16,186,520.00, which was allegedly the value of the loss of usage of the properties involved from 1963 to 1997 as computed by Atty. Fidel Kwan, the commissioner appointed by the RTC.<br><br>On March 21, 2002, the RTC issued a Consolidated Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> denying the Motion for Reconsideration filed by the City of Cebu, but modifying the Decision rendered on July 24, 2001. Through the said order, the RTC increased the amount of just compensation payable to the Heirs of Fr. Rallos from Php 7,500.00 to Php 9,500.00 per sq m.<br><br>The City of Cebu filed with the RTC a Notice of Appeal, which was opposed by the Heirs of Fr. Rallos.<br><br>In the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> rendered on May 29, 2007, which resolved the appeal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> filed by the City of Cebu, the CA opined that the RTC erred in holding that the reckoning point for the determination of the amount of just compensation should be from 1997, the time the complaint for just compensation was filed by the Heirs of Fr. Rallos. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the CA still dismissed on procedural grounds the appeal filed by the City of Cebu. The CA pointed out that pursuant to Sections 2<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> and 9,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Rule 41 and Section 1,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Rule 50 of the Rules of Court, a record on appeal and not a notice of appeal should have been filed before it by the City of Cebu to assail the RTC’s Decisions rendered on January 14, 2000 and July 24, 2001 and the Orders issued on February 5, 2001 and March 21, 2002.<br><br>The City of Cebu filed before this Court a Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> to assail the Decision rendered by the CA on May 29, 2007. This Court denied the same through a Minute Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> issued on December 5, 2007. The said Minute Resolution was recorded in the Book of Entries of Judgments on April 21, 2008.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>The Heirs of Fr. Rallos thereafter filed before the RTC a Motion for Execution relative to the Decision rendered on July 24, 2001. They claimed that in 2001, the City of Cebu paid them Php 34,905,000.00, but there remained a balance of Php 46,546,920.00 left to be paid, computed as of September 2, 2008. On its part, the City of Cebu admitted still owing the Heirs of Fr. Rallos but only in the amount of Php 16,893,162.08.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>On December 4, 2008, the RTC issued a writ of execution in favor of the Heirs of Fr. Rallos, which in part, reads:<br><blockquote>NOW, THEREFORE, you are hereby commanded to serve a copy hereof to judgment obligor City of Cebu and demand for the immediate payment of Php 44,213,000.00, less the partial payment of Php 34,905,000.00 plus interest at 12% per annum to start 40 days from date of the July 24, 2001 Decision and to continue until the whole amount has been fully paid; Php 50,000.00 as attorney’s fees; and Php 50,000.00 as litigation expenses. x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br></blockquote>Sheriff Antonio Bellones (Sheriff Bellones) then served upon the City of Cebu a demand letter, dated December 4, 2008, and which was amended on January 26, 2009, indicating that:<br><blockquote>DEMAND is hereby made for the judgment obligor City of Cebu x x x to facilitate the prompt payment of the following: (a) just compensation of Lots 485-D and 485-E in the amount of Php 44,213,000.00 plus interest of 12% per annum starting 40 days from the July 24, 2001 Decision and to continue until the whole amount has been duly paid less partial payment of Php 34,905,000.00 x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br></blockquote>The City of Cebu sought the reiteration of the directives stated in the Writ of Execution issued on December 4, 2008 and the setting aside of the amended demand letter served upon it by Sheriff Bellones.<br><br>On March 16, 2009, the RTC issued an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> denying the City of Cebu’s motion for the reiteration of the writ of execution. The RTC, however, set aside the demand letter served upon the City of Cebu by Sheriff Bellones and interpreted the directives of the writ of execution issued on December 4, 2008 as:<br><blockquote>[T]he entire amount of Php 44,213,000.00 shall be subjected to a 12% interest per annum to start 40 days from the date the decision on July 24, 2001 [was rendered] until the amount of Php 34,905,000.00 was partially paid by the City of Cebu. After the payment by the City of Cebu of a partial amount, the balance shall again be subjected to 12% interest until the same shall have been fully paid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br></blockquote>The Heirs of Fr. Rallos assailed the abovementioned order on the ground that it effectively modified the final and executory Decision rendered on July 24, 2001. They likewise sought the application of Article 2212<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> of the New Civil Code and jurisprudence so as to entitle them to legal interest on the interest due to them pursuant to the Decision rendered on July 24, 2001. In the Order issued on May 20, 2009, the RTC did not favorably consider the preceding claims.<br><br>A Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> and <i>Mandamus</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> was then filed by the Heirs of Fr. Rallos before the CA to challenge the Orders issued by the RTC on March 16, 2009 and May 20, 2009. The CA granted the petition after finding that the two assailed orders effectively modified the final and executory disposition made by the RTC on March 21, 2002. The CA likewise ruled that the case calls for the application of Article 2212 of the New Civil Code, hence, it directed the City of Cebu to pay interest at the rate of 12% <i>per annum</i> upon the interest due, to be computed from the date of the filing of the complaint until full satisfaction of the obligation. The CA stated:<br><blockquote>Note that the final and executory consolidated decision of July 24, 2001 as modified by the final and executory order of March 21, 2002, clearly directed herein respondent Cebu City to pay interest at the rate of 12% per annum based on the amount of [Php]9,500.00 per square meter starting 40 days from the date of the decision and to continue until the entire amount shall have been fully paid. Yet, the assailed orders x x x, now directed that the 12% interest per annum be paid on the declining balance contrary to the directive in the final and executory judgment x x x.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>x x x [The Heirs of Fr. Rallos] are without a doubt entitled to 12% interest per annum on the interest due from finality until its satisfaction x x x. The same is proper even if not expressly stated in the final and executory judgment x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br></blockquote>The City of Cebu assailed the Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 04418 by way of a Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> filed before this Court. The same was denied through a Minute Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> issued on December 6, 2010. The said resolution was recorded in this Court’s Book of Entries of Judgments on June 16, 2011.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>The Heirs of Fr. Rallos then moved for execution relative to Civil Case No. CEB-20388. The RTC granted the motion through the Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> issued on September 23, 2011.<br><br>The City of Cebu thereafter filed the following: (1) Urgent Omnibus Motions to Quash the Writ of Execution, and to Set Aside the Notice of Garnishment; (2) Supplemental Urgent Omnibus Motions to Quash the Writ of Execution, and to Set Aside the Notice of Garnishment; (3) Motion for Issuance of <i>Status Quo</i> Order Pending Resolution of [the City of Cebu’s] Urgent Omnibus Motions to Quash the Writ of Execution and to Set Aside the Notice of Garnishment;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> and (4) Motion to Strike out or Expunge Urgent Omnibus Motion and Supplemental Urgent Omnibus Motion with Manifestation and Reservation. The RTC denied the four motions in the Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> issued on October 26, 2011. The RTC’s Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> issued on January 26, 2012 likewise did not favorably consider the motion for reconsideration filed by the City of Cebu. The RTC emphasized that the <i>Convenio</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> already existed way back in 1940, hence, it cannot be considered as a supervening event which transpired after the judgment in Civil Case No. CEB-20388 had become final and executory. The City of Cebu no longer filed any motion or action to assail the RTC Orders issued on October 26, 2011 and January 26, 2012.<br><br>Meanwhile, in response to Mayor Rama’s query, the Commission on Audit’s (COA) Regional Director Delfin P. Aguilar wrote the former a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> dated October 27, 2011 opining that:<br><blockquote>Under Administrative Circular No. 10-2000<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> issued by the Supreme Court, it was clearly stated that the prosecution, enforcement or satisfaction of state liability <b>must</b> be pursued in accordance with the rules and procedures laid down in Presidential Decree No. 1445, otherwise known as the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines, wherein it is provided that all money claims against the government must first be filed with the [COA]. x x x.<br><br>Clearly, based on the aforementioned Supreme Court issuance and in the line with the rulings of the Supreme Court in various cases against garnishment of public funds or property to satisfy money judgment against the government, we are of the view that the issuance of the writ of execution for the satisfaction of the money judgment against the City of Cebu may be considered beyond the powers of the court.<br><br>On the other hand, Section 1, Rule VIII of the 2009 Revised Rules of Procedure of the COA provides that a money judgment is considered as a money claim which is within the original jurisdiction of the Commission Proper (CP) of the COA and which shall be filed directly with the Commission Secretary x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br></blockquote>On February 27, 2012, the RTC issued another Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> directing under pain of contempt the Cebu branches of Philippine Veterans Bank and Postal Savings Bank to release to the concerned RTC sheriff certifications indicating the correct account names and numbers maintained by the City of Cebu in the said banks. The Order also directed the <i>Sangguniang Panlungsod</i> to enact an appropriation ordinance relative to the money judgment. Upon presentment of the ordinance, the above-mentioned banks were expected to release the amounts stated therein to satisfy the judgment rendered in favor of the Heirs of Fr. Rallos. The City of Cebu filed a Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> against the Order dated February 27, 2012.<br><br>Even before the Motion for Reconsideration to the Order dated February 27, 2012 can be resolved by the RTC, the City of Cebu filed before the CA a Petition for Annulment of Final Decision/s and Order/s with prayer for the issuance of injunctive reliefs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> The City of Cebu claimed that the act of the Heirs of Fr. Rallos of suppressing the existence of the <i>Convenio</i> amounted to extrinsic fraud which would justify the annulment of the RTC’s decisions and orders relative to Civil Case No. CEB-20388. In praying for the issuance of injunctive reliefs, the City of Cebu stressed that it had already paid the Heirs of Fr. Rallos Php 56,196,369.42 for a 4,654 sq m property or at a price of Php 12,074.85 per sq m. Further, the procedures prescribed in Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445, this Court’s Administrative Circular (Admin. Circular) No. 10-2000 and Rule VIII of the COA’s Revised Rules of Procedure were not yet complied with, hence, public funds cannot be released notwithstanding the rendition of the decisions and issuance of the orders by the RTC relative to Civil Case No. CEB-20388.<br><br>On April 13, 2012, the CA, through a Resolution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> granted the City of Cebu’s application for the issuance of a temporary restraining order (TRO) relative to CA-G.R. SP No. 06676. Subsequently, a writ of preliminary injunction was likewise issued through the Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> dated June 26, 2012.<br><br>Lucena then filed the following petitions for indirect contempt, all of which in relation with Civil Case No. CEB-20388:<br><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td width="25%"><div align="center"><strong>Title</strong></div></td> <td width="5%"><div align="center"></div></td> <td width="15%"><div align="center"><strong>Docket Number</strong></div></td> <td width="15%"><div align="center"><strong>Date Filed</strong></div></td> <td width="20%"><div align="center"><strong>Forum</strong></div></td> <td width="25%">&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td><div align="justify"><em>Lucina B.

There is a confluence of these requisites relative to the instant petition and SCA No. CEB-38292.<br><br><i>Litis pendentia</i> does not require the exact identity of parties involved in the actions. Although the lawyers from the Office of the City Attorney are parties herein but are not made respondents in SCA No. CEB-38292, they do not in any way represent any interest distinct or separate from that of the City of Cebu and the public officers involved. Further, the instant petition superficially makes reference to the Minute Resolutions rendered by this Court in G.R. Nos. 179662 and 194111 which Lucena claims had lapsed into finality and should thus be executed. However, stripped of the unnecessary details, the reliefs saliently sought in both the instant petition and SCA No. CEB-38292 are founded on the same set of facts, to wit, the alleged non compliance by the respondents with the directives contained in the dispositive portion of the Consolidated Order issued by the RTC on March 21, 2002 relative to Civil Case No. CEB-20388. Finally, citation for indirect contempt in either the instant petition or SCA No. CEB-38292 would amount to <i>res judicata</i> in the other considering the identities of the parties and issues involved.<br><br>Since the elements of <i>litis pendentia</i> concur in the instant petition and SCA No. CEB-38292, this Court so holds Lucena guilty of forum shopping.<br><br>“[T]he grave evil sought to be avoided by the rule against forum shopping is the rendition by two competent tribunals of two separate and contradictory decisions. To avoid any confusion, this Court adheres strictly to the rules against forum shopping, and any violation of these rules results in the dismissal of a case.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>Further, “once there is a finding of forum shopping, the penalty is summary dismissal not only of the petition pending before this Court, but also of the other case that is pending in a lower court. This is so because twin dismissal is a punitive measure to those who trifle with the orderly administration of justice.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br><b>Even if in the higher interest of justice, this Court were to be exceptionally liberal and gloss over Lucena’s act of forum shopping, the instant petition would still be susceptible to dismissal.<br></b><br>While this Court does not intend to downplay the rights accruing to the owners of properties expropriated by the government, it bears stressing that the exercise and enforcement of those rights are subject to compliance with the requirements provided for by law to protect public funds.<br><br>Lucena avers that the respondents willfully and maliciously defy the execution of final and executory decisions and orders rendered or issued relative to Civil Case No. CEB-20388.<br><br>Such averment is untenable.<br><br>The respondents allege and Lucena does not refute, that the City of Cebu had already paid the Heirs of Fr. Rallos Php 56,196,369.42 for a 4,654 sq m property or at a price of Php 12,074.85 per sq m. The controversy remains and the parties resort to all legal maneuverings because the Heirs of Fr. Rallos obdurately insist that they are still entitled to collect from the City of Cebu a balance of Php 133,469,962.55.<br><br>The Heirs of Fr. Rallos are bent on collecting the amount allegedly still unpaid by the City of Cebu in accordance with the computations stated in the decisions and orders in Civil Case No. CEB-20388. <i>However, the Heirs of Fr. Rallos are impervious to the requisites laid down by law in enforcing their claims</i>. The requisites are two-fold as discussed below.<br><br><b>An appropriation ordinance should be passed prior to the disbursement of public funds.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b><br><br>“Even though the rule as to immunity of a state from suit is relaxed, the power of the courts ends when the judgment is rendered. Although the liability of the state has been judicially ascertained, the state is at liberty to determine for itself whether to pay the judgment or not, and execution cannot issue on a judgment against the state. Such statutes do not authorize a seizure of state property to satisfy judgments recovered, and only convey an implication that the legislature will recognize such judgment as final and make provision for the satisfaction thereof.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>Section 4(1) of P.D. No. 1445 and Section 305(a) of the Local Government Code both categorically state that no money shall be paid out of any public treasury or depository except in pursuance of an appropriation law or other specific statutory authority. Based on considerations of public policy, government funds and properties may not be seized under writs of execution or garnishment to satisfy judgments rendered by the courts and disbursements of public funds must be covered by the corresponding appropriation as required by law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, no appropriation ordinance had yet been passed relative to the claims of the Heirs of Fr. Rallos. Such being the case, the respondents, as public officers, are acting within lawful bounds in refusing the execution of the decisions and orders in Civil Case No. CEB-20388.<br><br><b>Despite the rendition of a final and executory judgment validating a money claim against an agency or instrumentality of the Government, its filing with the COA is a <i>sine qua non</i> condition before payment can be effected.<br></b><br>Section 26 of P.D. No. 1445 states that the COA has jurisdiction to examine, audit and <i>settle</i> all debts and claims of any sort due from or owing to the Government or any of its subdivisions, agencies and instrumentalities. Under Section 5(b), Rule II of COA’s Revised Rules of Procedure, local government units are expressly included as among the entities within the COA’s jurisdiction. Section 2,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> Rule VIII lays down the procedure in filing money claims against the Government. Section 4, Rule X provides that any case brought to the COA shall be decided within 60 days from the date it is submitted for decision or resolution. Section 1, Rule XII allows the aggrieved party to file a petition for <i>certiorari</i> before this Court to assail any decision, order or resolution of the COA within 30 days from receipt of a copy thereof.<br><br>This Court, in the case of <i>University of the Philippines v.
