				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Before us is a Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i> filed under Rule 45. This Petition prays for the reversal and setting aside of the Court of Appeals' (1) Resolution dated March 21, 2007 that dismissed the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> under Rule 65 filed by petitioner for failure to resort to a Motion for Reconsideration of the assailed trial court Order dated October 9, 2006 and (2) Resolution dated August 16, 2007 denying petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration.<br><br>Petitioner Department of Agriculture—Regional Field Unit XII (DA-RFU XII) is a government office mandated to implement the laws, policies, plans, programs, rules, and regulations of the Department of Agriculture in its regional area, while respondents are officials and employees of DA-RFU XII.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>On March 30, 2004, Executive Order (E.O.) No. 304 was passed designating Koronadal City as the regional center and seat of SOCCSKSARGEN Region.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> It provides that all departments, bureaus, and offices of the national government in the SOCCSKSARGEN Region shall transfer their regional seat of operations to Koronadal City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>In an April 1, 2005 Memorandum, the Department of Agriculture (DA) Undersecretary for Operations Edmund J. Sana directed Officer-in- Charge (OIC) and Regional Executive Director of DA-RFU XII Abusama M. Alid as follows:<br><br><blockquote>In compliance with Executive Order No. 304 of which Section 2 states "<u>Transfer of Regional Offices</u>. All departments, bureaus and offices of the National Government on the SOCCSKSARGEN Region shall transfer their regional seat of operations to Koronadal City," you are hereby directed to immediately effect the transfer of the administrative, finance and operations base of RFU XII from Cotabato City to Koronadal City. On the interim, part of the staff can temporarily hold office at either or both the ATI building in Tantangan and Tupi Seed Farm, but the main office shall be within Koronadal City.<br><br>The action plan for transfer should be submitted to my office not later than 6 April 2005 so that appropriate funding can be processed soonest. Further, execution of the plan should commence by 16 April 2005 or earlier so that concerned personnel can benefit from the summer break to make personal arrangements for the transfer of their work base.<br><br>For strict compliance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></blockquote><br>In a Memorandum dated April 22, 2005 addressed to DA Secretary Arthur Yap, private respondents opposed the implementation of the April 1, 2005 Memorandum.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>They alleged that in 2004, former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo made a pronouncement during one of her visits in Cotabato City that the regional seat of Region 12 shall remain in Cotabato City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Only three departments were not covered by the suspension of E.O. No. 304, namely, the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), Department of Tourism (DOT), and Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Respondents alleged further in their Memorandum to the DA Secretary that on March 7, 2005, they appealed to the Secretary of Agriculture that the implementation of E.O. No. 304 be held in abeyance. A copy of the Petition was attached to the Memorandum. It cited reasons such as the huge costs the physical transfer will entail and the plight of employees who have already settled and established their homes in Cotabato City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>On March 8, 2005, their Petition was endorsed by Department of Agriculture Employees Association-12 (DAEAS-12) President Osmeña I. Motañer to then President Macapagal-Arroyo, and on April 12, 2005, this was referred to DA Secretary Yap for his information and appropriate action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Respondents justified their appeal saying that a building was constructed in Cotabato City that can accommodate the whole staff of DA- RFU XII. On the other hand, there is no building yet in Koronadal City where rent is very expensive.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Moreover, if the regional office remains in Cotabato City, the government need not spend over P7,200,000.00 as dislocation pay as well as other expenses for equipment hauling and construction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Finally, respondents alleged that the proposed third floor of the ATI Building in Tantangan has a sub-standard foundation and will not be issued a certificate of occupancy by the City Engineering Office of Koronadal City as per information from an auditor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>On May 17, 2005, OIC Abusama M. Alid held a meeting and ordered the transfer of the regional office to ATI Building in Tantangan and Tupi Seed Farm in Tupi, both located in South Cotabato and Uptown, Koronadal City, to be carried out on May 21, 2005.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>This prompted respondents to file on May 18, 2005 a Complaint for Injunction with Prayer for Issuance of Writ of Preliminary Injunction and/or Temporary Restraining Order with the Regional Trial Court, Branch 14 of Cotabato City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>By Order dated October 9, 2006, the trial court granted respondents' Prayer for a Writ of Preliminary Injunction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>In a petition dated December 17, 2006,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> petitioner went to the Court of Appeals via Rule 65 on the ground that the assailed Order of the trial court is contrary to the pronouncement of this Court in <i>DENR v. DENR Region 12 Employees</i>.<br><br>Through the March 21, 2007 Resolution, the Court of Appeals dismissed the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> for failure of petitioner to resort to a Motion for Reconsideration of the assailed trial court Order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Hence, the present Petition under Rule 45.<br><br>Petitioner argues that (1) this case falls under the exceptions for filing a Motion for Reconsideration prior to filing a Petition under Rule 65; (2) the trial court Order enjoining the transfer is contrary to <i>DENR v. DENR Region 12 Employees</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> that upheld the separation of powers between the executive and judiciary on the wisdom of transfer of regional offices; (3) the trial court interfered into this wisdom of the executive in the management of its affairs; and (4) the trial court disregarded basic rules on amendment and revocation of administrative issuances and the propriety of injunction as a remedy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>In their Comment, respondents counter that a Petition via Rule 45 is not the proper remedy to assail the disputed Resolutions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> They allege that the assailed Court of Appeals Resolution dismissing the Petition for <span style="font-style: italic;">Certiorari </span>for failure of the petitioners to file a Motion for Reconsideration is not a "final order or resolution" contemplated by Rule 45.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> It is not an adjudication on the merits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> In fact, the Court of Appeals did not even attempt to resolve the propriety of the issuance of the assailed trial court Order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> In any case, respondents argue that petitioner's failure to file a Motion for Reconsideration is fatal. They contend that this is a condition <i>sine qua non</i> for a Petition under Rule 65, and none of the exceptions are present in this case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Based on both parties' contentions, the issues involved in this case may be summarized as follows:<br><br><ol type="I"><li>Whether a Petition via Rule 45 is the proper remedy to assail the disputed Resolutions<br><br></li><li>Whether the present case falls within the exceptions on the requisite for filing a Motion for Reconsideration prior to filing a Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> under Rule 65<br><br></li><li>Whether petitioner can raise other issues not addressed in the assailed Resolutions<br><br></li><li>Whether the issuance by the RTC of a preliminary injunction against the transfer of the DA Regional Office to Koronadal City violates the separation of powers between the executive department and the judiciary as to the wisdom behind the transfer</li></ol><br>First, we discuss the procedural issues.<br><br>Respondents contend that a Petition via Rule 45 is not the proper remedy to assail the disputed Resolutions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> They allege that the assailed Court of Appeals Resolution dismissing the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> for failure of the petitioners to file a Motion for Reconsideration is not a "final order or resolution" contemplated by Rule 45.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, petitioner argues that if the assailed Resolutions are not elevated via Rule 45, they would attain finality and consequently, the trial court Order dated October 9, 2006 would become unassailable as well.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>A dismissal by the Court of Appeals of a Petition via Rule 65 for failure to file a Motion for Reconsideration may be assailed via Rule 45.<br><br>Unlike a Petition via Rule 45 that is a continuation of the appellate process over the original case, a special civil action for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 is an original or independent action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Consequently, the March 21, 2007 Resolution of the Court of Appeals dismissing the Petition via Rule 65 as well as its August 16, 2007 Resolution denying reconsideration are the final Resolutions contemplated under Rule 45. As correctly pointed out by petitioner, these Resolutions would attain finality if these are not elevated on appeal via Rule 45. As a result, the trial court Order dated October 9, 2006 would also become unassailable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Respondents also argue that petitioner's failure to file a Motion for Reconsideration of the assailed Regional Trial Court Order dated October 9, 2006 is fatal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> They contend that the reasons raised by petitioner do not justify dispensing with the prerequisite of filing&nbsp; a Motion for Reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>For its part, petitioner argues that its Petition for Certiorari filed before the Court of Appeals falls under the exceptions to the necessity of filing a Motion for Reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> In its Petition with the Court of Appeals, petitioners explained its reasons for no longer filing a Motion for Reconsideration of the assailed order in that (a) the questions to be raised in the motion have already been duly raised and passed upon by the lower court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> and (b) there is urgent necessity for the resolution of the questions or issues raised.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Petitioners allege that the trial court presiding judge was not acting on the disposition of the case with dispatch and that any further delay would unduly prejudice the interests of the government in pursuing its economic development strategies in the region.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>The settled rule is that a Motion for Reconsideration is a condition sine qua non for the filing of a Petition for <i>Certiorari</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Its purpose is to grant an opportunity for the court to correct any actual or perceived error attributed to it by re-examination of the legal and factual circumstances of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>This rule admits well-defined exceptions as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Concededly, the settled rule is that a motion for reconsideration is a condition <i>sine qua non</i> for the filing of a petition for <i>certiorari</i>.<br><br>Its purpose is to grant an opportunity for the court to correct any actual or perceived error attributed to it by the re-examination of the legal and factual circumstances of the case. The rule is, however, circumscribed by well-defined exceptions, such as (a) where the order is a patent nullity, as where the court <i>a quo</i> has no jurisdiction; (b) <b>where the questions raised in the <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari</span> proceedings</b> have been duly raised and passed upon by the lower court, or are the same as those raised and passed upon in the lower court; (c) where there is an urgent necessity for the resolution of the question and any further delay would prejudice the interests of the Government or of the petitioner or the subject matter of the action is perishable; (d) where, under the circumstances, a motion for reconsideration would be useless; (e) where petitioner was deprived of due process and there is extreme urgency for relief; (f) where, in a criminal case, relief from an order of arrest is urgent and the granting of such relief by the trial court is improbable; (g) where the proceedings in the lower court are a nullity for lack of due process; (h) where the proceeding were <i>ex parte</i> or in which the petitioner had no opportunity to object; and (i) where the issue raised is one purely of law or where public interest is involved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> (Emphasis provided)</blockquote><br>The second exception is present in this case.<br><br>In <i>Siok Ping Tang v. Subic Bay Distribution, Inc.,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> this Court found that the non-filing of a Motion for Reconsideration in the case was not fatal since the questions raised in the <i>certiorari</i> proceedings have already been duly raised and passed upon by the lower court, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>Respondent explained their omission of filing a motion for reconsideration before resorting to a petition for <i>certiorari</i> based on exceptions (b), (c) and (i). The CA brushed aside the filing of the motion for reconsideration based on the ground that the questions raised in the <i>certiorari</i> proceedings have been duly raised and passed upon by the lower court, or are the same as those raised and passed upon in the lower court. We agree.<br><br>Respondent had filed its position paper in the RTC stating the reasons why the injunction prayed for by petitioner should not be granted. However, the RTC granted the injunction. Respondent filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i> with the CA and presented the same arguments which were already passed upon by the RTC. The RTC already had the opportunity to consider and rule on the question of the propriety or impropriety of the issuance of the injunction. We found no reversible error committed by the CA for relaxing the rule since respondent's case falls within the exceptions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></blockquote><br>Similarly, the various issues raised in the Petition with the Court of Appeals have already been raised by petitioner on several occasions through its pleadings with the trial court. The lower court, therefore, passed upon them prior to its issuance of its Order dated October 9, 2006. Specifically, the table below summarizes the issues and arguments raised by petitioner before the trial court vis a vis those raised in the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> filed with the Court of Appeals:<br><br><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td style="font-weight: bold;" colspan="3"><div align="CENTER">TRIAL COURT</div></td> <td style="font-weight: bold;" width="25%"><div align="CENTER">COURT OF APPEALS</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td width="25%"><p align="CENTER"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Motion to Dismiss</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></p> <p align="CENTER">dated June 27, 2005</p></td> <td width="25%"><p align="CENTER"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Memorandum</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></p> <p align="CENTER">dated September 1, 2006</p></td> <td width="25%"><p align="CENTER"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Manifestation and Reply</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></p> <p align="CENTER">dated September 5, 2006</p></td> <td><p align="CENTER"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Petition for Certiorari</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></p> <p align="CENTER">dated December 17, 2006</p></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">The Honorable Supreme Court had already ruled that the propriety or wisdom of the transfer of government agencies or offices from Cotabato City to Koronadal, South Cotabato is beyond judicial inquiry.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></div></td> <td><p align="JUSTIFY">The instant complaint filed by plaintiffs for injunction is an indirect way of preventing the transfer of the regional seat of DA-RFU XII which has been upheld by the Supreme Court in <i>DENR v.

Orbos,</i> we held further that the power of the President to reorganize administrative regions carries with it the power to determine the regional center.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br>The case of <i>DENR v. DENR Region 12 Employees</i> is in point. This Court held that the DENR Secretary can reorganize validly the DENR by ordering the transfer of the DENR XII Regional Offices from Cotabato City to Koronadal, South Cotabato.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> We also found as follows:<br><br><blockquote>It may be true that the transfer of the offices may not be timely considering that: (1) there are no buildings yet to house the regional offices in Koronadal, (2) the transfer falls on the month of Ramadan, (3) the children of the affected employees are already enrolled in schools in Cotabato City, (4) the Regional Development Council was not consulted, and (5) the Sangguniang Panglungsod, through a resolution, requested the DENR Secretary to reconsider the orders. However, <b>these concern issues addressed to the wisdom of the transfer rather than to its legality. It is basic in our form of government that the judiciary cannot inquire into the wisdom or expediency of the acts of the executive</b> or the legislative department, for each department is supreme and independent of the others, and each is devoid of authority not only to encroach upon the powers or field of action assigned to any of the other department, but also to inquire into or pass upon the advisability or wisdom of the acts performed, measures taken or decisions made by the other departments.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> (Emphasis provided)</blockquote><br>The transfer of the regional center of the SOCCSKSARGEN region to Koronadal City is an executive function.<br><br>Similar to <i>DENR v. DENR Region 12 Employees</i>, the issues in the present case are addressed to the wisdom of the transfer rather than to its legality. Some of these concerns are the lack of a proper and suitable building in Koronadal to house the DA regional office, the inconvenience of the transfer considering that the children of respondent-employees are already enrolled in Cotabato City schools, and other similar reasons.<br><br>The judiciary cannot inquire into the wisdom or expediency of the acts of the executive.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> When the trial court issued its October 9, 2006 Order granting preliminary injunction on the transfer of the regional center to Koronadal City when such transfer was mandated by E.O. No. 304, the lower court did precisely that.<br><br>The principle of separation of powers ordains that each of the three great government branches has exclusive cognizance of and is supreme in concerns falling within its own constitutionally allocated sphere.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> The judiciary as Justice Laurel emphatically asserted "will neither direct nor restrain executive [or legislative] action x x x."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><br>Finally, a verbal pronouncement to the effect that E.O. No. 304 is suspended should not have been given weight. An executive order is valid when it is not contrary to the law or Constitution. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the Petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.
