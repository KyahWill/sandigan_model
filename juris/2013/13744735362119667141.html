Sometime in the year 1987, Elizabeth Monzon, the owner of the adjacent parcel of land being occupied by plaintiff [Maslag], informed the plaintiff that the respective parcels of land being claimed by them can now be titled.&nbsp; A suggestion was, thereafter made, that those who were interested to have their lands titled, will contribute to a common fund for the surveying and subsequent titling of the land;<br><br>8. Since plaintiff had, for so long, yearned for a title to the land she occupies, she contributed to the amount being requested by Elizabeth Monzon;<br><br>9. A subdivision survey was made and in the survey, the respective areas of the plaintiff and the defendants were defined and delimited – all for purposes of titling. x x x<br><br>10. But alas, despite the assurance of subdivided titles, when the title was finally issued by the Registry of Deeds, the same was only in the name of Elizabeth Monzon and WILLIAM GESTON.&nbsp; The name of Darma Maslag was fraudulently, deliberately and in bad faith omitted.&nbsp; Thus, the title to the property, to the extent of 18,295 square meters, was titled solely in the name of ELIZABETH MONZON.</blockquote><br>As a relief, petitioner prayed that Monzon be ordered to reconvey the portion of the property which she claimed was fraudulently included in Monzon’s title.&nbsp; Her primary relief was to recover ownership of real property.&nbsp; Indubitably, petitioner’s complaint involves title to real property.&nbsp; An action "involving title to real property," on the other hand, was defined as an action where "the plaintiff’s cause of action is based on a claim that [she] owns such property or that [she] has the legal rights to have exclusive control, possession, enjoyment, or disposition of the same."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>&nbsp; Under the present state of the law, in cases involving title to real property, original and exclusive jurisdiction belongs to either the RTC or the MTC, depending on the assessed value of the subject property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>&nbsp; Pertinent provisions of Batas Pambansa Blg. (BP) 129,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> as amended by Republic Act (RA) No. 7691,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> provides:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 19.&nbsp;<i>Jurisdiction in civil cases</i>. – Regional Trial Courts shall exercise exclusive original jurisdiction:<br><br>(1) In all civil actions in which the subject of the litigation is incapable of pecuniary estimation;<br><br>(2) In all civil actions which involve the title to, or possession of, real property, or any interest therein, where the assessed value of the property involved exceeds Twenty thousand pesos (P20,000.00) or for civil actions in Metro Manila, where x x x the [assessed] value [of the property] exceeds Fifty thousand pesos ([P]50,000.00) except actions for forcible entry into and unlawful detainer of lands or buildings, original jurisdiction over which is conferred upon Metropolitan Trial Courts, Municipal Trial Courts, and Municipal Circuit Trial Courts;<br><br>x x x x<br><br>SEC. 33.&nbsp;<i>Jurisdiction of Metropolitan Trial Courts, Municipal Trial Courts and Municipal Circuit Trial Courts in Civil Cases</i>. — Metropolitan Trial Courts, Municipal Trial Courts and Municipal Circuit Trial Courts shall exercise: x x x x<br><br>(3) &nbsp;Exclusive original jurisdiction in all civil actions which involve title to, or possession of, real property, or any interest therein where the assessed value of the property or interest therein does not exceed Twenty thousand pesos (P20,000.00) or, in civil actions in Metro Manila, where such assessed value does not exceed Fifty thousand pesos (P50,000.00) x x x.</blockquote><br>In the case at bench, annexed to the Complaint is a Declaration of Real Property<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> dated November 12, 1991, which was later marked as petitioner’s Exhibit "A",<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> showing that the disputed property has an assessed value of P12,400<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> only.&nbsp; Such assessed value of the property is well within the jurisdiction of the MTC.&nbsp; In fine, the RTC, thru Judge Cabato, erred in applying Section 19(1) of BP 129 in determining which court has jurisdiction over the case and in pronouncing that the MTC is divested of original and exclusive jurisdiction.<br><br>This brings to fore the next issue of whether the CA was correct in dismissing petitioner’s appeal.<br><br>Section 2, Rule 50 of the Rules of Court provides for the dismissal of an improper appeal:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 2.&nbsp; <i>Dismissal of improper appeal to the Court of Appeals</i>. – An appeal under Rule 41 taken from the Regional Trial Court to the Court of Appeals raising only questions of law shall be dismissed, issues purely of law not being reviewable by said court.&nbsp; Similarly, <b>an appeal by notice of appeal instead of by petition for review from the appellate judgment of a Regional Trial Court shall be dismissed.</b><br><br>An appeal erroneously taken to the Court of Appeals shall not be transferred to the appropriate court but shall be dismissed outright. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>There are two modes of appealing an RTC decision or resolution on issues of fact and law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>&nbsp; The first mode is an <b><i>ordinary appeal under Rule 41</i></b> in cases where the RTC exercised its <i>original jurisdiction</i>.&nbsp; It is done by filing a Notice of Appeal with the RTC.&nbsp; The second mode is a <b><i>petition for review under Rule 42</i></b> in cases where the RTC exercised its <i>appellate jurisdiction</i> over MTC decisions.&nbsp; It is done by filing a Petition for Review with the CA.&nbsp; Simply put, the distinction between these two modes of appeal lies in the type of jurisdiction exercised by the RTC in the Order or Decision being appealed.<br><br>As discussed above, the MTC has original and exclusive jurisdiction over the subject matter of the case; hence, there is no other way the RTC could have taken cognizance of the case and review the court <i>a quo’s</i> Judgment except in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction.&nbsp; Besides, the new RTC Judge who penned the May 4, 2004 Resolution, Judge Diaz de Rivera, actually treated the case as an appeal despite the October 22, 2003 Order.&nbsp; He started his Resolution by stating, "This is an appeal from the Judgment rendered by the Municipal Trial Court (MTC) of La Trinidad Benguet"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> and then proceeded to discuss the merits of the "appeal."&nbsp; In the dispositive portion of said Resolution, he reversed the MTC’s findings and conclusions and remanded residual issues for trial with the MTC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, in fact and in law, the RTC Resolution was a continuation of the proceedings that originated from the MTC.&nbsp; It was a judgment issued by the RTC in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction.&nbsp; With regard to the RTC’s earlier October 22, 2003 Order, the same should be disregarded for it produces no effect (other than to confuse the parties whether the RTC was invested with original or appellate jurisdiction). It cannot be overemphasized that jurisdiction over the subject matter is conferred only by law and it is "not within the courts, let alone the parties, to themselves determine or coveniently set aside."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>&nbsp; Neither would the active participation of the parties nor <i>estoppel</i> operate to confer original and exclusive jurisdiction where the court or tribunal only wields appellate jurisdiction over the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, the CA is correct in holding that the proper mode of appeal should have been a Petition for Review under Rule 42 of the Rules of Court, and not an ordinary appeal under Rule 41.<br><br>Seeing the futility of arguing against what the RTC actually did, petitioner resorts to arguing for what the RTC should have done.&nbsp; She maintains that the RTC should have issued its May 4, 2004 Resolution in its original jurisdiction because it had earlier ruled that the MTC had no jurisdiction over the cause of action.<br><br>Petitioner’s argument lacks merit.&nbsp; To reiterate, only statutes can confer jurisdiction. Court issuances cannot seize or appropriate jurisdiction.&nbsp; It has been repeatedly held that "any judgment, order or resolution issued without [jurisdiction] is void and cannot be given any effect."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>&nbsp; By parity of reasoning, an order issued by a court declaring that it has original and exclusive jurisdiction over the subject matter of the case when under the law it has none cannot likewise be given effect.&nbsp; It amounts to usurpation of jurisdiction which cannot be countenanced.&nbsp; Since BP 129 already apportioned the jurisdiction of the MTC and the RTC in cases involving title to property, neither the courts nor the petitioner could alter or disregard the same.&nbsp; Besides, in determining the proper mode of appeal from an RTC Decision or Resolution, the determinative factor is the type of jurisdiction actually exercised by the RTC in rendering its Decision or Resolution.&nbsp; Was it rendered by the RTC in the exercise of its original jurisdiction, or in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction?&nbsp; In short, we look at what type of jurisdiction was <i>actually exercised</i> by the RTC.&nbsp; We do not look into what type of jurisdiction the RTC <i>should have</i> exercised.&nbsp; This is but logical.&nbsp; Inquiring into what the RTC should have done in disposing of the case is a question which already involves the merits of the appeal, but we obviously cannot go into that where the mode of appeal was improper to begin with.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the Petition for Review is <b>DENIED </b>for lack of merit.&nbsp; The assailed May 31, 2006 and September 22, 2006 Resolutions of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
