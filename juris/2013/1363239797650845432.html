San Roque Power Corporation</i></b><br><br><center><b><u>The Facts</u></b></center><br>The CTA EB’s narration of the pertinent facts is as follows:<br><br><blockquote>[CIR] is the duly appointed Commissioner of Internal Revenue, empowered, among others, to act upon and approve claims for refund or tax credit, with office at the Bureau of Internal Revenue (“BIR”) National Office Building, Diliman, Quezon City.<br><br>[San Roque] is a domestic corporation duly organized and existing under and by virtue of the laws of the Philippines with principal office at Barangay San Roque, San Manuel, Pangasinan. It was incorporated in October 1997 to design, construct, erect, assemble, own, commission and operate power-generating plants and related facilities pursuant to and under contract with the Government of the Republic of the Philippines, or any subdivision, instrumentality or agency thereof, or any government-owned or controlled corporation, or other entity engaged in the development, supply, or distribution of energy.<br><br>As a seller of services, [San Roque] is duly registered with the BIR with TIN/VAT No. 005-017-501. It is likewise registered with the Board of Investments (“BOI”) on a preferred pioneer status, to engage in the design, construction, erection, assembly, as well as to own, commission, and operate electric power-generating plants and related activities, for which it was issued Certificate of Registration No. 97-356 on February 11, 1998.<br><br>On October 11, 1997, [San Roque] entered into a Power Purchase Agreement (“PPA”) with the National Power Corporation (“NPC”) to develop hydro-potential of the Lower Agno River and generate additional power and energy for the Luzon Power Grid, by building the San Roque Multi-Purpose Project located in San Manuel, Pangasinan. The PPA provides, among others, that [San Roque] shall be responsible for the design, construction, installation, completion, testing and commissioning of the Power Station and shall operate and maintain the same, subject to NPC instructions. During the cooperation period of twenty-five (25) years commencing from the completion date of the Power Station, NPC will take and pay for all electricity available from the Power Station.<br><br>On the construction and development of the San Roque Multi-Purpose Project which comprises of the dam, spillway and power plant, [San Roque] allegedly incurred, excess input VAT in the amount of P559,709,337.54 for taxable year 2001 which it declared in its Quarterly VAT Returns filed for the same year. [San Roque] duly filed with the BIR separate claims for refund, in the total amount of P559,709,337.54, representing unutilized input taxes as declared in its VAT returns for taxable year 2001.<br><br>However, on March 28, 2003, [San Roque] filed amended Quarterly VAT Returns for the year 2001 since it increased its unutilized input VAT to the amount of P560,200,283.14. Consequently, [San Roque] filed with the BIR on even date, separate amended claims for refund in the aggregate amount of P560,200,283.14.<br><br>[CIR’s] inaction on the subject claims led to the filing by [San Roque] of the Petition for Review with the Court [of Tax Appeals] in Division on April 10, 2003.<br><br>Trial of the case ensued and on July 20, 2005, the case was submitted for decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></blockquote><br><center><b><u>The Court of Tax Appeals’ Ruling: Division&nbsp; </u></b></center><br>The CTA Second Division initially denied San Roque’s claim. In its Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> dated 8 March 2006, it cited the following as bases for the denial of San Roque’s claim: lack of recorded zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sales; failure to submit documents specifically identifying the purchased goods/services related to the claimed input VAT which were included in its Property, Plant and Equipment account; and failure to prove that the related construction costs were capitalized in its books of account and subjected to depreciation.<br><br>The CTA Second Division required San Roque to show that it complied with the following requirements of Section 112(B) of Republic Act No. 8424 (RA 8424)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> to be entitled to a tax refund or credit of input VAT attributable to capital goods imported or locally purchased: (1) it is a VAT-registered entity; (2) its input taxes claimed were paid on capital goods duly supported by VAT invoices and/or official receipts; (3) it did not offset or apply the claimed input VAT payments on capital goods against any output VAT liability; and (4) its claim for refund was filed within the two-year prescriptive period both in the administrative and judicial levels.<br><br>The CTA Second Division found that San Roque complied with the first, third, and fourth requirements, thus:<br><br><blockquote>The fact that [San Roque] is a VAT registered entity is admitted (<i>par. 4, Facts Admitted, Joint Stipulation of Facts, Records, p. 157</i>). It was also established that the instant claim of P560,200,823.14 is already net of the P11,509.09 output tax declared by [San Roque] in its amended VAT return for the first quarter of 2001. Moreover, the entire amount of P560,200,823.14 was deducted by [San Roque] from the total available input tax reflected in its amended VAT returns for the last two quarters of 2001 and first two quarters of 2002 (<i>Exhibits M-6, O-6, OO-1 &amp; QQ-1</i>). This means that the claimed input taxes of P560,200,823.14 did not form part of the excess input taxes of P83,692,257.83, as of the second quarter of 2002 that was to be carried-over to the succeeding quarters. Further, [San Roque’s] claim for refund/tax credit certificate of excess input VAT was filed within the two-year prescriptive period reckoned from the dates of filing of the corresponding quarterly VAT returns.<br><br>For the first, second, third, and fourth quarters of 2001, [San Roque] filed its VAT returns on April 25, 2001, July 25, 2001, October 23, 2001 and January 24, 2002, respectively (<i>Exhibits “H, J, L, and N”</i>). These returns were all subsequently amended on March 28, 2003 (<i>Exhibits “I, K, M, and O”</i>). On the other hand, [San Roque] originally filed its separate claims for refund on July 10, 2001, October 10, 2001, February 21, 2002, and May 9, 2002 for the first, second, third, and fourth quarters of 2001, respectively, (<i>Exhibits “EE, FF, GG, and HH</i>”) and subsequently filed amended claims for all quarters on March 28, 2003 (<i>Exhibits “II, JJ, KK, and LL”</i>). Moreover, the Petition for Review was filed on April 10, 2003. Counting from the respective dates when [San Roque] originally filed its VAT returns for the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2001, the administrative claims for refund (original and amended) and the Petition for Review fall within the two-year prescriptive period.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></blockquote><br>San Roque filed a Motion for New Trial and/or Reconsideration on 7 April 2006. In its 29 November 2007 Amended Decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> the CTA Second Division found legal basis to partially grant San Roque’s claim. The CTA Second Division ordered the Commissioner to refund or issue a tax credit in favor of San Roque in the amount of P483,797,599.65, which represents San Roque’s unutilized input VAT on its purchases of capital goods and services for the taxable year 2001. The CTA based the adjustment in the amount on the findings of the independent certified public accountant. The following reasons were cited for the disallowed claims: erroneous computation; failure to ascertain whether the related purchases are in the nature of capital goods; and the purchases pertain to capital goods. Moreover, the reduction of claims was based on the following: the difference between San Roque’s claim and that appearing on its books; the official receipts covering the claimed input VAT on purchases of local services are not within the period of the claim; and the amount of VAT cannot be determined from the submitted official receipts and invoices. The CTA Second Division denied San Roque’s claim for refund or tax credit of its unutilized input VAT attributable to its zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sales because San Roque had no record of such sales for the four quarters of 2001.<br><br>The dispositive portion of the CTA Second Division’s 29 November 2007 Amended Decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, [San Roque’s] “Motion for New Trial and/or Reconsideration” is hereby PARTIALLY GRANTED and this Court’s Decision promulgated on March 8, 2006 in the instant case is hereby MODIFIED.<br><br>Accordingly, [the CIR] is hereby ORDERED to REFUND or in the alternative, to ISSUE A TAX CREDIT CERTIFICATE in favor of [San Roque] in the reduced amount of Four Hundred Eighty Three Million Seven Hundred Ninety Seven Thousand Five Hundred Ninety Nine Pesos and Sixty Five Centavos (P483,797,599.65) representing unutilized input VAT on purchases of capital goods and services for the taxable year 2001.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></blockquote><br>The Commissioner filed a Motion for Partial Reconsideration on 20 December 2007. The CTA Second Division issued a Resolution dated 11 July 2008 which denied the CIR’s motion for lack of merit.<br><br><center><b><u>The Court of Tax Appeals’ Ruling: En Banc</u></b><br></center><br>The Commissioner filed a Petition for Review before the CTA EB praying for the denial of San Roque’s claim for refund or tax credit in its entirety as well as for the setting aside of the 29 November 2007 Amended Decision and the 11 July 2008 Resolution in CTA Case No. 6647.<br><br>The CTA EB dismissed the CIR’s petition for review and affirmed the challenged decision and resolution.<br><br>The CTA EB cited <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Toledo Power, Inc</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> and Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 49-03,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> as its bases for ruling that San Roque’s judicial claim was not prematurely filed. The pertinent portions of the Decision state:<br><br><blockquote>More importantly, the Court <i>En Banc </i>has squarely and exhaustively ruled on this issue in this wise:<br><br><blockquote><b>It is true that Section 112(D) of the abovementioned provision applies to the present case. However, what the petitioner failed to consider is Section 112(A) of the same provision.</b> The respondent is also covered by the two (2) year prescriptive period. We have repeatedly held that the claim for refund with the BIR and the subsequent appeal to the Court of Tax Appeals must be filed within the two-year period.<br><br>Accordingly, the Supreme Court held in the case of <i>Atlas Consolidated Mining and Development Corporation vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue </i>that the two-year prescriptive period for filing a claim for input tax is reckoned from the date of the filing of the quarterly VAT return and payment of the tax due. <b>If the said period is about to expire but the BIR has not yet acted on the application for refund, the taxpayer may interpose a petition for review with this Court within the two year period</b>.<br><br>In the case of <i>Gibbs vs. Collector</i>, the Supreme Court held that if, however, the Collector (now Commissioner) takes time in deciding the claim, and the period of two years is about to end, the suit or proceeding must be started in the Court of Tax Appeals before the end of the two-year period without awaiting the decision of the Collector.<br><br>Furthermore, in the case of<i> Commissioner of Customs and Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. The Honorable Court of Tax Appeals and Planters Products, Inc.</i>,<b> the Supreme Court held that the taxpayer need not wait indefinitely for a decision or ruling which may or may not be forthcoming and which he has no legal right to expect</b>. It is disheartening enough to a taxpayer to keep him waiting for an indefinite period of time for a ruling or decision of the Collector (now Commissioner) of Internal Revenue on his claim for refund. It would make matters more exasperating for the taxpayer if we were to close the doors of the courts of justice for such a relief until after the Collector (now Commissioner) of Internal Revenue, would have, at his personal convenience, given his go signal.<br><br>This Court ruled in several cases that once the petition is filed, the Court has already acquired jurisdiction over the claims and the Court is not bound to wait indefinitely for no reason for whatever action respondent (herein petitioner) may take. <b>At stake are claims for refund and unlike disputed assessments, no decision of respondent (herein petitioner) is required before one can go to this Court</b>. (Emphasis supplied and citations omitted)</blockquote><br>Lastly, it is apparent from the following provisions of Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 49-03 dated August 18, 2003, that [the CIR] knows that claims for VAT refund or tax credit filed with the Court [of Tax Appeals] can proceed simultaneously with the ones filed with the BIR and that taxpayers need not wait for the lapse of the subject 120-day period, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>In response to [the] request of selected taxpayers for adoption of procedures in handling refund cases that are aligned to the statutory requirements that refund cases should be elevated to the Court of Tax Appeals before the lapse of the period prescribed by law, certain provisions of RMC No. 42-2003 are hereby amended and new provisions are added thereto.<br><br>In consonance therewith, the following amendments are being introduced to RMC No. 42-2003, to wit:<br><br>I.) A-17 of Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 42-2003 is hereby revised to read as follows:<br><br><b>In cases where the taxpayer has filed a “Petition for Review” with the Court of Tax Appeals involving a claim for refund/TCC that is pending at the administrative agency (Bureau of Internal Revenue or OSS-DOF), the administrative agency and the tax court may act on the case separately</b>. While the case is pending in the tax court and at the same time is still under process by the administrative agency, the litigation lawyer of the BIR, upon receipt of the summons from the tax court, shall request from the head of the investigating/processing office for the docket containing certified true copies of all the documents pertinent to the claim. The docket shall be presented to the court as evidence for the BIR in its defense on the tax credit/refund case filed by the taxpayer. In the meantime, the investigating/processing office of the administrative agency shall continue processing the refund/TCC case until such time that a final decision has been reached by either the CTA or the administrative agency.<br><br><b>If the CTA is able to release its decision ahead of the evaluation of the administrative agency, the latter shall cease from processing the claim</b>. On the other hand, if the administrative agency is able to process the claim of the taxpayer ahead of the CTA and the taxpayer is amenable to the findings thereof, the concerned taxpayer must file a motion to withdraw the claim with the CTA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote></blockquote><br><b><i>G.R.

On the same date, [Taganito] likewise filed an Application for Tax Credits/Refunds for the period covering January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2005 for the same amount.<br><br>On November 29, 2006, [Taganito] sent again another letter dated November 29, 2004 to [the CIR], to correct the period of the above claim for tax credit/refund in the said amount of P8,365,664.38 as actually referring to the period covering January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2005.<br><br>As the statutory period within which to file a claim for refund for said input VAT is about to lapse without action on the part of the [CIR], [Taganito] filed the instant Petition for Review on February 17, 2007.<br><br>In his Answer filed on March 28, 2007, [the CIR] interposes the following defenses:<br><br><blockquote>4. [Taganito’s] alleged claim for refund is subject to administrative investigation/examination by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR);<br><br>5. The amount of ?8,365,664.38 being claimed by [Taganito] as alleged unutilized input VAT on domestic purchases of goods and services and on importation of capital goods for the period January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2005 is not properly documented;<br><br>6. [Taganito] must prove that it has complied with the provisions of Sections 112 (A) and (D) and 229 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997 (1997 Tax Code) on the prescriptive period for claiming tax refund/credit;<br><br>7. Proof of compliance with the prescribed checklist of requirements to be submitted involving claim for VAT refund pursuant to Revenue Memorandum Order No. 53-98, <b>otherwise there would be no sufficient compliance with the filing of administrative claim for refund, the administrative claim thereof being mere pro-forma, which is a condition sine qua non prior to the filing of judicial claim</b> in accordance with the provision of Section 229 of the 1997 Tax Code. Further, Section 112 (D) of the Tax Code, as amended, requires the <b>submission of complete documents in support of the application filed</b> with the BIR before the 120-day audit period shall apply, and <b>before the taxpayer could avail of judicial remedies as provided for in the law</b>. Hence, [Taganito’s] failure to submit proof of compliance with the above-stated requirements warrants immediate dismissal of the petition for review.<br><br>8. [Taganito] must prove that it has complied with the invoicing requirements mentioned in Sections 110 and 113 of the 1997 Tax Code, as amended, in relation to provisions of Revenue Regulations No. 7-95.<br><br>9. In an action for refund/credit, the burden of proof is on the taxpayer to establish its right to refund, and failure to sustain the burden is fatal to the claim for refund/credit <b>(Asiatic Petroleum Co. vs. Llanes, 49 Phil. 466 cited in Collector of Internal Revenue vs. Manila Jockey Club, Inc., 98 Phil. 670);</b><br><br>10. Claims for refund are construed strictly against the claimant for the same partake the nature of exemption from taxation <b>(Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Ledesma, 31 SCRA 95)</b> and as such, they are looked upon with disfavor <b>(Western Minolco Corp. vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 124 SCRA 1211)</b>.<br><br><center><b>SPECIAL AND AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES</b></center><br>11. The Court of Tax Appeals has no jurisdiction to entertain the instant petition for review for failure on the part of [Taganito] to comply with the provision of Section 112 (D) of the 1997 Tax Code which provides, thus:<br><br><blockquote>Section 112. <i>Refunds or Tax Credits of Input Tax. </i>–<br><br><center>xxx xxx xxx</center><br>(D) <i>Period within which refund or Tax Credit of Input Taxes shall be Made</i>. – In proper cases, the Commissioner shall grant a refund or issue the tax credit certificate for creditable input taxes <b>within one hundred (120) days from the date of submission of complete documents in support of the application filed in accordance with Subsections (A) and (B) hereof</b>.<br><br>In cases of full or partial denial for tax refund or tax credit, or the failure on the part of the Commissioner to act on the application within the period prescribed above, the taxpayer affected may, <b>within thirty (30) days from the receipt of the decision denying the claim or after the expiration of the one hundred twenty day-period, appeal the decision or the unacted claim with the Court of Tax Appeals</b>. (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote><br>12. As stated, [Taganito] filed the administrative claim for refund with the Bureau of Internal Revenue on November 14, 2006. Subsequently on February 14, 2007, the instant petition was filed. Obviously the 120 days given to the Commissioner to decide on the claim has not yet lapsed when the petition was filed. The petition was prematurely filed, hence it must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</blockquote><br>During trial, [Taganito] presented testimonial and documentary evidence primarily aimed at proving its supposed entitlement to the refund in the amount of P8,365,664.38, representing input taxes for the period covering January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2005. [The CIR], on the other hand, opted not to present evidence. Thus, in the Resolution promulgated on January 22, 2009, this case was submitted for decision as of such date, considering [Taganito’s] “Memorandum” filed on January 19, 2009 and [the CIR’s] “Memorandum” filed on December 19, 2008.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></blockquote><br><center><b><u>The Court of Tax Appeals’ Ruling: Division</u></b><br></center><br>The CTA Second Division partially granted Taganito’s claim.

Since Philex’s claim covered the 3<sup>rd</sup> quarter of 2005, its administrative claim filed on 20 March 2006 was timely filed, while its judicial claim filed on 17 October 2007 was filed late and therefore barred by prescription.<br><br>On 10 November 2009, the CTA Second Division denied Philex’s Motion for Reconsideration.<br><br><center><b><u>The Court of Tax Appeals’ Ruling: En Banc<br></u></b></center><br>Philex filed a Petition for Review before the CTA EB praying for a reversal of the 20 July 2009 Decision and the 10 November 2009 Resolution of the CTA Second Division in CTA Case No. 7687.<br><br>The CTA EB, in its Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> dated 3 December 2010, denied Philex’s petition and affirmed the CTA Second Division’s Decision and Resolution.<br><br>The pertinent portions of the Decision read:<br><br><blockquote>In this case, while there is no dispute that [Philex’s] administrative claim for refund was filed within the two-year prescriptive period; however, as to its judicial claim for refund/credit, records show that on March 20, 2006, [Philex] applied the administrative claim for refund of unutilized input VAT in the amount of P23,956,732.44 with the One Stop Shop Center of the Department of Finance, per Application No. 52490.

No. 187485 - CIR v. San Roque Power Corporation</b></i><br><br>On 10 April 2003, a mere 13 days after it filed its amended administrative claim with the Commissioner on 28 March 2003, San Roque filed a Petition for Review with the CTA docketed as CTA Case No. 6647. From this we gather two crucial facts: <i>first</i>, San Roque did not wait for the 120-day period to lapse before filing its judicial claim; <i>second</i>, San Roque filed its judicial claim more than four (4) years <b>before</b> the Atlas<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> doctrine, which was promulgated by the Court on 8 June 2007.<br><br>Clearly, San Roque failed to comply with the 120-day waiting period, the time expressly given by law to the Commissioner to decide whether to grant or deny San Roque’s application for tax refund or credit. It is indisputable that compliance with the 120-day waiting period is <b>mandatory and jurisdictional</b>. The waiting period, originally fixed at 60 days only, was part of the provisions of the first VAT law, Executive Order No. 273, which took effect on 1 January 1988. The waiting period was extended to 120 days effective 1 January 1998 under RA 8424 or the Tax Reform Act of 1997. <b>Thus, the waiting period has been in our statute books for more than fifteen (15) years <i>before</i> San Roque filed its judicial claim</b>.<br><br>Failure to comply with the 120-day waiting period violates a mandatory provision of law. It violates the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies and renders the petition premature and thus without a cause of action, with the effect that the CTA does not acquire jurisdiction over the taxpayer’s petition. Philippine jurisprudence is replete with cases upholding and reiterating these doctrinal principles.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>The charter of the CTA expressly provides that its jurisdiction is to review on appeal “<b>decisions</b> of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue in cases involving x x x refunds of internal revenue taxes.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> When a taxpayer prematurely files a judicial claim for tax refund or credit with the CTA without waiting for the decision of the Commissioner, there is no “decision” of the Commissioner to review and thus the CTA as a court of special jurisdiction has no jurisdiction over the appeal. The charter of the CTA also expressly provides that if the Commissioner fails to decide within <b>“a specific period”</b> required by law, such <b>“inaction shall be deemed a denial”</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> of the application for tax refund or credit. It is the Commissioner’s decision, or inaction “deemed a denial,” that the taxpayer can take to the CTA for review. Without a decision or an “inaction x x x deemed a denial” of the Commissioner, the CTA has no jurisdiction over a petition for review.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>San Roque’s failure to comply with the 120-day <b>mandatory</b> period renders its petition for review with the CTA void. Article 5 of the Civil Code provides, “Acts executed against provisions of mandatory or prohibitory laws shall be void, except when the law itself authorizes their validity.” San Roque’s void petition for review cannot be legitimized by the CTA or this Court because Article 5 of the Civil Code states that such void petition cannot be legitimized “except when the law itself authorizes [its] validity.” There is no law authorizing the petition’s validity.<br><br>It is hornbook doctrine that a person committing a void act contrary to a mandatory provision of law cannot claim or acquire any right from his void act. A right cannot spring in favor of a person from his own void or illegal act. This doctrine is repeated in Article 2254 of the Civil Code, which states, “No vested or acquired right can arise from acts or omissions which are against the law or which infringe upon the rights of others.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> For violating a mandatory provision of law in filing its petition with the CTA, San Roque cannot claim any right arising from such void petition. Thus, San Roque’s petition with the CTA is a mere scrap of paper.<br><br>This Court cannot brush aside the grave issue of the mandatory and jurisdictional nature of the 120-day period just because the Commissioner merely asserts that the case was prematurely filed with the CTA and does not question the entitlement of San Roque to the refund. The mere fact that a taxpayer has undisputed excess input VAT, or that the tax was admittedly illegally, erroneously or excessively collected from him, does not entitle him as a matter of right to a tax refund or credit. Strict compliance with the mandatory and jurisdictional conditions prescribed by law to claim such tax refund or credit is essential and necessary for such claim to prosper. <b>Well-settled is the rule that tax refunds or credits, just like tax exemptions, are strictly construed against the taxpayer</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> The burden is on the taxpayer to show that he has strictly complied with the conditions for the grant of the tax refund or credit.<br><br>This Court cannot disregard mandatory and jurisdictional conditions mandated by law simply because the Commissioner chose not to contest the numerical correctness of the claim for tax refund or credit of the taxpayer. Non-compliance with mandatory periods, non-observance of prescriptive periods, and non-adherence to exhaustion of administrative remedies <b>bar</b> a taxpayer’s claim for tax refund or credit, whether or not the Commissioner questions the numerical correctness of the claim of the taxpayer. This Court should not establish the precedent that non-compliance with mandatory and jurisdictional conditions can be excused if the claim is otherwise meritorious, particularly in claims for tax refunds or credit. Such precedent will render meaningless compliance with mandatory and jurisdictional requirements, for then every tax refund case will have to be decided on the numerical correctness of the amounts claimed, regardless of non-compliance with mandatory and jurisdictional conditions.<br><br>San Roque cannot also claim being misled, misguided or confused by the <i>Atlas</i> doctrine because <b>San Roque filed its petition for review with the CTA more than four years before <i>Atlas</i> was promulgated.</b> The<i> Atlas</i> doctrine did not exist at the time San Roque failed to comply with the 120-day period. Thus, San Roque cannot invoke the Atlas doctrine as an excuse for its failure to wait for the 120-day period to lapse. In any event, the <i>Atlas</i> doctrine merely stated that the two-year prescriptive period should be counted from the date of payment of the output VAT, not from the close of the taxable quarter when the sales involving the input VAT were made. <b>The <i>Atlas</i> doctrine does not interpret, expressly or impliedly, the 120+30</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><b> day periods.</b><br><br>In fact, Section 106(b) and (e) of the Tax Code of 1977 as amended, which was the law cited by the Court in <i>Atlas</i> as the applicable provision of the law did not yet provide for the 30-day period for the taxpayer to appeal to the CTA from the decision or inaction of the Commissioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> <b>Thus, the Atlas doctrine cannot be invoked by anyone to disregard compliance with the 30-day mandatory and jurisdictional period</b>. Also, the difference between the <i>Atlas</i> doctrine on one hand, and the<i> Mirant</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> doctrine on the other hand, is a mere 20 days. The <i>Atlas</i> doctrine counts the two-year prescriptive period from the date of payment of the output VAT, which means within 20 days after the close of the taxable quarter. The output VAT at that time must be paid at the time of filing of the quarterly tax returns, which were to be filed “within 20 days following the end of each quarter.”<br><br>Thus, in <i>Atlas</i>, the three tax refund claims listed below were deemed timely filed because the administrative claims filed with the Commissioner, and the petitions for review filed with the CTA, were all filed within two years from the date of payment of the output VAT, following Section 229:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="BOTTOM"> <td style="text-decoration: underline;" width="25%"><div align="CENTER">Period Covered</div></td> <td width="25%"><div align="CENTER">Date of Filing Return <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">&amp; Payment of Tax</span></div></td> <td width="25%"><div align="CENTER">Date of Filing <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Administrative Claim</span> </div></td> <td width="25%"><div align="CENTER">Date of Filing <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Petition With CTA</span></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">2nd Quarter, 1990 <br> Close of Quarter<br> <span style="font-weight: bold;">30 June 1990</span></div></td> <td style="font-weight: bold;"><div align="CENTER">20 July 1990</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">21 August 1990 </div></td> <td style="font-weight: bold;"><div align="CENTER">20 July 1992</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER"></div></td> <td><div align="CENTER"></div></td> <td><div align="CENTER"></div></td> <td><div align="CENTER"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">3rd Quarter, 1990<br> Close of Quarter<br> <span style="font-weight: bold;">30 September 1990</span></div></td> <td style="font-weight: bold;"><div align="CENTER">18 October 1990</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">21 November 1990</div></td> <td style="font-weight: bold;"><div align="CENTER">9 October 1992</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER"></div></td> <td><div align="CENTER"></div></td> <td><div align="CENTER"></div></td> <td><div align="CENTER"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">4th Quarter, 1990<br> Close of Quarter<br> <span style="font-weight: bold;">31 December 1990</span></div></td> <td style="font-weight: bold;"><div align="CENTER">20 January 1991</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">19 February 1991 </div></td> <td style="font-weight: bold;"><div align="CENTER">14 January 1993</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br>Atlas paid the output VAT at the time it filed the quarterly tax returns on the 20<sup>th</sup>, 18<sup>th</sup>, and 20<sup>th</sup> day <b>after</b> the close of the taxable quarter. Had the two-year prescriptive period been counted from the “close of the taxable quarter” as expressly stated in the law, the tax refund claims of Atlas would have already prescribed.&nbsp; In contrast, the <i>Mirant</i> doctrine counts the two-year prescriptive period from the “close of the taxable quarter when the sales were made” as expressly stated in the law, which means the last day of the taxable quarter. <b>The 20-day difference</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> <b>between the <i>Atlas </i>doctrine and the later <i>Mirant</i> doctrine is not material to San Roque’s claim for tax refund.</b><br><br>Whether the <i>Atlas</i> doctrine or the <i>Mirant</i> doctrine is applied to San Roque is immaterial because what is at issue in the present case is San Roque’s non-compliance with the 120-day mandatory and jurisdictional period, which is counted from the date it filed its administrative claim with the Commissioner. The 120-day period may extend beyond the two-year prescriptive period, as long as the administrative claim is filed within the two-year prescriptive period. However, San Roque’s fatal mistake is that it did not wait for the Commissioner to decide within the 120-day period, a mandatory period whether the <i>Atlas</i> or the <i>Mirant</i> doctrine is applied.<br><br>At the time San Roque filed its petition for review with the CTA, the 120+30 day mandatory periods were already in the law. Section 112(C)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> expressly grants the Commissioner 120 days within which to decide the taxpayer’s claim. The law is clear, plain, and unequivocal: “x x x the Commissioner shall grant a refund or issue the tax credit certificate for creditable input taxes <b>within one hundred twenty (120) days</b> from the date of submission of complete documents.” Following the <i>verba legis </i>doctrine, this law must be applied exactly as worded since it is clear, plain, and unequivocal. The taxpayer cannot simply file a petition with the CTA without waiting for the Commissioner’s decision within the 120-day mandatory and jurisdictional period. The CTA will have no jurisdiction because there will be no “decision” or “deemed a denial” decision of the Commissioner for the CTA to review. In San Roque’s case, it filed its petition with the CTA a mere 13 days after it filed its administrative claim with the Commissioner. Indisputably, San Roque knowingly violated the mandatory 120-day period, and it cannot blame anyone but itself.<br><br>Section 112(C) also expressly grants the taxpayer a 30-day period to appeal to the CTA the decision or inaction of the Commissioner, thus:<br><br><blockquote>x x x the taxpayer affected may, <b>within thirty (30) days from the receipt of the decision denying the claim or after the expiration of the one hundred twenty day-period,</b> appeal the decision or the unacted claim with the Court of Tax Appeals. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>This law is clear, plain, and unequivocal. Following the well-settled <i>verba legis</i> doctrine, this law should be applied exactly as worded since it is clear, plain, and unequivocal. As this law states, the taxpayer may, if he wishes, appeal the decision of the Commissioner to the CTA within 30 days from receipt of the Commissioner’s decision, or if the Commissioner does not act on the taxpayer’s claim within the 120-day period, the taxpayer may appeal to the CTA within 30 days from the expiration of the 120-day period.<br><br><i>b. <b>G.R. No. 196113 - Taganito Mining Corporation v. CIR</b></i><b></b><br><br>Like San Roque, Taganito also filed its petition for review with the CTA without waiting for the 120-day period to lapse. Also, like San Roque, Taganito filed its judicial claim <b>before</b> the promulgation of the Atlas doctrine. Taganito filed a Petition for Review on 14 February 2007 with the CTA. This is almost four months before the adoption of the <i>Atlas</i> doctrine on 8 June 2007. Taganito is similarly situated as San Roque - both cannot claim being misled, misguided, or confused by the <i>Atlas</i> doctrine.<br><br>However, Taganito can invoke BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> dated 10 December 2003, which expressly ruled that the <b>“taxpayer-claimant need not wait for the lapse of the 120-day period before it could seek judicial relief with the CTA by way of Petition for Review.”</b> Taganito filed its judicial claim <i>after </i>the issuance of BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 but before the adoption of the <i>Aichi</i> doctrine. Thus, as will be explained later, Taganito is deemed to have filed its judicial claim with the CTA on time.<br><br><i>c. <b>G.R. No. 197156 – Philex Mining Corporation v. CIR</b>&nbsp; </i><br><br>Philex (1) filed on 21 October 2005 its original VAT Return for the third quarter of taxable year 2005; (2) filed on 20 March 2006 its administrative claim for refund or credit; (3) filed on 17 October 2007 its Petition for Review with the CTA. The close of the third taxable quarter in 2005 is 30 September 2005, which is the reckoning date in computing the two-year prescriptive period under Section 112(A).<br><br>Philex timely filed its administrative claim on 20 March 2006, within the two-year prescriptive period. Even if the two-year prescriptive period is computed from the date of payment of the output VAT under Section 229, Philex still filed its administrative claim on time. <b>Thus, the <i>Atlas</i> doctrine is immaterial in this case</b>. The Commissioner had until 17 July 2006, the last day of the 120-day period, to decide Philex’s claim. Since the Commissioner did not act on Philex’s claim on or before 17 July 2006, Philex had until 17 August 2006, the last day of the 30-day period, to file its judicial claim. <b>The CTA EB held that 17 August 2006 was indeed the last day for Philex to file its judicial claim</b>. However, Philex filed its Petition for Review with the CTA only on 17 October 2007, or four hundred twenty-six (426) days after the last day of filing. <b>In short, Philex was late by one year and 61 days in filing its judicial claim.</b> As the CTA EB correctly found:<br><br><blockquote><b>Evidently, the Petition for Review in C.T.A. Case No. 7687 was filed 426 days late.</b> Thus, the Petition for Review in C.T.A. Case No. 7687 should have been dismissed on the ground that the Petition for Review was filed way beyond the 30-day prescribed period; thus, no jurisdiction was acquired by the CTA Division; x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Unlike San Roque and Taganito, Philex’s case is not one of premature filing but of late filing. Philex did not file any petition with the CTA within the 120-day period. Philex did not also file any petition with the CTA within 30 days after the expiration of the 120-day period. Philex filed its judicial claim long after the expiration of the 120-day period, in fact 426 days after the lapse of the 120-day period. <b>In any event, whether governed by jurisprudence before, during, or after the <i>Atlas</i> case, Philex’s judicial claim will have to be rejected because of late filing</b>. Whether the two-year prescriptive period is counted from the date of payment of the output VAT following the <i>Atlas</i> doctrine, or from the close of the taxable quarter when the sales attributable to the input VAT were made following the <i>Mirant</i> and <i>Aichi</i> doctrines, Philex’s judicial claim was indisputably filed late.<br><br>The <i>Atlas </i>doctrine cannot save Philex from the late filing of its judicial claim. The <b>inaction</b> of the Commissioner on Philex’s claim during the 120-day period is, by express provision of law, “deemed a denial” of Philex’s claim. Philex had 30 days from the expiration of the 120-day period to file its judicial claim with the CTA. Philex’s failure to do so rendered the “deemed a denial” decision of the Commissioner final and inappealable. The right to appeal to the CTA from a decision or “deemed a denial” decision of the Commissioner is merely a statutory privilege, not a constitutional right. The exercise of such statutory privilege requires strict compliance with the conditions attached by the statute for its exercise.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> Philex failed to comply with the statutory conditions and must thus bear the consequences.<br><br>II. <b><u>Prescriptive Periods under Section 112(A) and (C)</u></b><br><br>There are three compelling reasons why the 30-day period need not necessarily fall within the two-year prescriptive period, as long as the administrative claim is filed within the two-year prescriptive period.<br><br><i>First</i>, Section 112(A) clearly, plainly, and unequivocally provides that the taxpayer “may, <b>within two (2) years</b> after the close of the taxable quarter when the sales were made, <b>apply for the issuance of a tax credit certificate or refund</b> of the creditable input tax due or paid to such sales.” In short, the law states that the taxpayer may apply with the Commissioner for a refund or credit <b>“within two (2) years,” which means at anytime within two years</b>. Thus, the application for refund or credit may be filed by the taxpayer with the Commissioner on the last day of the two-year prescriptive period and it will still strictly comply with the law. The two-year prescriptive period is a grace period in favor of the taxpayer and he can avail of the full period before his right to apply for a tax refund or credit is barred by prescription.<br><br><i>Second</i>, Section 112(C) provides that the Commissioner shall decide the application for refund or credit “within one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of submission of complete documents in support of the application filed in accordance with Subsection (A).” The reference in Section 112(C) of the submission of documents “in support of the application filed in accordance with Subsection A” means that the application in Section 112(A) is the administrative claim that the Commissioner must decide within the 120-day period. In short, the two-year prescriptive period in Section 112(A) refers to the period within which the taxpayer can file an administrative claim for tax refund or credit.<b> Stated otherwise, the two-year prescriptive period does not refer to the filing of the judicial claim with the CTA but to the filing of the administrative claim with the Commissioner.</b> As held in <i>Aichi,</i> the “phrase ‘within two years x x x apply for the issuance of a tax credit or refund’ <b>refers to applications for refund/credit with the CIR and not to appeals made to the CTA.”</b><br><br><i>Third</i>, if the 30-day period, or any part of it, is required to fall within the two-year prescriptive period (equivalent to 730 days<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup>), then the taxpayer must file his administrative claim for refund or credit within the first 610 days of the two-year prescriptive period.<b> Otherwise, the filing of the administrative claim beyond the first 610 days will result in the appeal to the CTA being filed beyond the two-year prescriptive period</b>. Thus, if the taxpayer files his administrative claim on the 611<sup>th</sup> day, the Commissioner, with his 120-day period, will have until the 731<sup>st</sup> day to decide the claim. If the Commissioner decides only on the 731<sup>st</sup> day, or does not decide at all, the taxpayer can no longer file his judicial claim with the CTA because the two-year prescriptive period (equivalent to 730 days) has lapsed. The 30-day period granted by law to the taxpayer to file an appeal before the CTA becomes utterly useless, even if the taxpayer complied with the law by filing his administrative claim within the two-year prescriptive period.<br><br>The theory that the 30-day period must fall within the two-year prescriptive period adds a condition that is not found in the law. It results in truncating 120 days from the 730 days that the law grants the taxpayer for filing his administrative claim with the Commissioner. This Court cannot interpret a law to defeat, wholly or even partly, a remedy that the law expressly grants in clear, plain, and unequivocal language.<br><br>Section 112(A) and (C) must be interpreted according to its clear, plain, and unequivocal language. The taxpayer can file his administrative claim for refund or credit at <b>anytime</b> within the two-year prescriptive period. If he files his claim on the last day of the two-year prescriptive period, his claim is still filed on time. The Commissioner will have 120 days from such filing to decide the claim. If the Commissioner decides the claim on the 120<sup>th</sup> day, or does not decide it on that day, the taxpayer still has 30 days to file his judicial claim with the CTA. This is not only the plain meaning but also the only logical interpretation of Section 112(A) and (C).<br><br>III. <b><u>“Excess” Input VAT and “Excessively” Collected Tax</u></b><br><br>The input VAT is<b> not</b> “excessively” collected as understood under Section 229 because <b>at the time the input VAT is collected the amount paid is correct and proper</b>. The input VAT is a tax liability of, and legally paid by, a VAT-registered seller<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> of goods, properties or services used as input by another VAT-registered person in the sale of his own goods, properties, or services. This tax liability is true even if the seller passes on the input VAT to the buyer as part of the purchase price. The second VAT-registered person, who is not legally liable for the input VAT, is the one who applies the input VAT as credit for his own output VAT.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> If the input VAT is in fact “excessively” collected as understood under Section 229, then it is the first VAT-registered person - the taxpayer who is legally liable and who is deemed to have legally paid for the input VAT - who can ask for a tax refund or credit under Section 229 as an ordinary refund or credit <b>outside</b> of the VAT System. In such event, the second VAT-registered taxpayer will have no input VAT to offset against his own output VAT.<br><br>In a claim for refund or credit of “excess” input VAT under Section 110(B) and Section 112(A), the input VAT is not “excessively” collected as understood under Section 229. At the time of payment of the input VAT the amount paid is the correct and proper amount. Under the VAT System, there is no claim or issue that the input VAT is “excessively” collected, that is, that the input VAT paid is more than what is legally due. The person legally liable for the input VAT cannot claim that he overpaid the input VAT by the mere existence of an “excess” input VAT. The term “excess” input VAT simply means that the input VAT available as credit exceeds the output VAT, not that the input VAT is excessively collected because it is more than what is legally due. Thus, the taxpayer who legally paid the input VAT cannot claim for refund or credit of the input VAT as “excessively” collected under Section 229.<br><br>Under Section 229, the prescriptive period for filing a judicial claim for refund is two years from the date of payment of the tax “erroneously, x x x illegally, x x x excessively or in any manner wrongfully collected.” The prescriptive period is reckoned from the date the person liable for the tax pays the tax. Thus, if the input VAT is in fact “excessively” collected, that is, the person liable for the tax actually pays more than what is legally due, the taxpayer must file a judicial claim for refund within two years from his date of payment. <b>Only the person legally liable to pay the tax can file the judicial claim for refund. The person to whom the tax is passed on as part of the purchase price has no personality to file the judicial claim under Section 229</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>Under Section 110(B) and Section 112(A), the prescriptive period for filing a judicial claim for “excess” input VAT is two years from the close of the taxable quarter when the sale was made by the person legally liable to pay the <b><i>output </i></b>VAT. This prescriptive period has no relation to the date of payment of the “excess” <b><i>input</i></b> VAT. The “excess” input VAT may have been paid for more than two years but this does not bar the filing of a judicial claim for “excess” VAT under Section 112(A), which has a different reckoning period from Section 229. Moreover, the person claiming the refund or credit of the input VAT is not the person who legally paid the input VAT. Such person seeking the VAT refund or credit does not claim that the input VAT was “excessively” collected from him, or that he paid an input VAT that is more than what is legally due. He is not the taxpayer who legally paid the input VAT.<br><br>As its name implies, the Value-Added Tax system is a tax on the value added by the taxpayer in the chain of transactions. For simplicity and efficiency in tax collection, the VAT is imposed not just on the value added by the taxpayer, but on the entire selling price of his goods, properties or services. However, the taxpayer is allowed a refund or credit on the VAT previously paid by those who sold him the inputs for his goods, properties, or services. The net effect is that the taxpayer pays the VAT only on the value that he adds to the goods, properties, or services that he actually sells.<br><br>Under Section 110(B), a taxpayer can apply his input VAT only against his output VAT. The only exception is when the taxpayer is expressly “zero-rated or effectively zero-rated” under the law, like companies generating power through renewable sources of energy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> Thus, a non zero-rated VAT-registered taxpayer who has no output VAT because he has no sales cannot claim a tax refund or credit of his unused input VAT under the VAT System. Even if the taxpayer has sales but his input VAT exceeds his output VAT, he cannot seek a tax refund or credit of his “excess” input VAT under the VAT System. <b>He can only carry-over and apply his “excess” input VAT against his future output VAT</b>. If such “excess” input VAT is an “excessively” collected tax, the taxpayer should be able to seek a refund or credit for such “excess” input VAT whether or not he has output VAT. The VAT System does not allow such refund or credit. Such “excess” input VAT is not an “excessively” collected tax under Section 229. The “excess” input VAT is a correctly and properly collected tax. However, such “excess” input VAT can be applied against the output VAT because the VAT is a tax imposed only on the value added by the taxpayer. If the input VAT is in fact “excessively” collected under Section 229, then it is the person legally liable to pay the input VAT, not the person to whom the tax was passed on as part of the purchase price and claiming credit for the input VAT under the VAT System, who can file the judicial claim under Section 229.<br><br>Any suggestion that the “excess” input VAT under the VAT System is an “excessively” collected tax under Section 229 may lead taxpayers to file a claim for refund or credit for such “excess” input VAT under Section 229 as an ordinary tax refund or credit outside of the VAT System. Under Section 229, mere payment of a tax beyond what is legally due can be claimed as a refund or credit. There is no requirement under Section 229 for an output VAT or subsequent sale of goods, properties, or services using materials subject to input VAT.<br><br>From the plain text of Section 229, it is clear that what can be refunded or credited is a tax that is “erroneously, x x x illegally, x x x excessively or <b>in any manner wrongfully</b> collected.”&nbsp; In short, there must be a <b>wrongful payment </b>because what is paid, or part of it, is not legally due. As the Court held in <i>Mirant,</i> Section 229 should “<b>apply only to instances of erroneous payment or illegal collection of internal revenue taxes</b>.” Erroneous or wrongful payment includes excessive payment because <b>they all refer to payment of taxes not legally due</b>. Under the VAT System, there is no claim or issue that the “excess” input VAT is “excessively or in any manner wrongfully collected.” In fact, if the “excess” input VAT is an “excessively” collected tax under Section 229, then the taxpayer claiming to apply such “excessively” collected input VAT to offset his output VAT may have no legal basis to make such offsetting. The person legally liable to pay the input VAT can claim a refund or credit for such “excessively” collected tax, and thus there will no longer be any “excess” input VAT. This will upend the present VAT System as we know it.<br><br>IV. <b><u>Effectivity and Scope of the <i>Atlas, Mirant </i>and <i>Aichi </i>Doctrines</u></b><br><br>The <i>Atlas</i> doctrine, which held that claims for refund or credit of input VAT must comply with the two-year prescriptive period under Section 229, should be <b>effective only from its promulgation on 8 June 2007 until its abandonment on 12 September 2008 in <i>Mirant.</i></b> The<i> Atlas</i> doctrine was limited to the reckoning of the two-year prescriptive period from the date of payment of the output VAT. Prior to the <i>Atlas </i>doctrine, the two-year prescriptive period for claiming refund or credit of input VAT should be governed by Section 112(A) following the <i>verba legis</i> rule. The <i>Mirant </i>ruling, which abandoned the <i>Atlas </i>doctrine, adopted the <i>verba legis</i> rule, thus applying Section 112(A) in computing the two-year prescriptive period in claiming refund or credit of input VAT.<br><br>The <i>Atlas </i>doctrine has no relevance to the 120+30 day periods under Section 112(C) because the application of the 120+30 day periods was not in issue in <i>Atlas</i>. The application of the 120+30 day periods was first raised in <i>Aichi</i>, which adopted the <i>verba legis</i> rule in holding that the 120+30 day periods are mandatory and jurisdictional. The language of Section 112(C) is plain, clear, and unambiguous. When Section 112(C) states that “the Commissioner shall grant a refund or issue the tax credit within one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of submission of complete documents,” the law clearly gives the Commissioner 120 days within which to decide the taxpayer’s claim. Resort to the courts prior to the expiration of the 120-day period is a patent violation of the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies, a ground for dismissing the judicial suit due to prematurity. Philippine jurisprudence is awash with cases affirming and reiterating the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> Such doctrine is basic and elementary.<br><br>When Section 112(C) states that “the taxpayer affected <b>may</b>, within thirty (30) days from receipt of the decision denying the claim or after the expiration of the one hundred twenty-day period, appeal the decision or the unacted claim with the Court of Tax Appeals,” the law does not make the 120+30 day periods optional just because the law uses the word “<b>may</b>.” The word “may” simply means that the taxpayer <b>may or may not appeal</b> the decision of the Commissioner within 30 days from receipt of the decision, or within 30 days from the expiration of the 120-day period. Certainly, by no stretch of the imagination can the word “may” be construed as making the 120+30 day periods optional, allowing the taxpayer to file a judicial claim one day after filing the administrative claim with the Commissioner.<br><br>The old rule<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> that the taxpayer may file the judicial claim, without waiting for the Commissioner’s decision if the two-year prescriptive period is about to expire, cannot apply because that rule was adopted before the enactment of the 30-day period. <b>The 30-day period was adopted precisely to do away with the old rule, so that under the VAT System the taxpayer will always have 30 days to file the judicial claim even if the Commissioner acts only on the 120<sup>th</sup> day, or does not act at all during the 120-day period.</b> With the 30-day period always available to the taxpayer, the taxpayer can no longer file a judicial claim for refund or credit of input VAT without waiting for the Commissioner to decide until the expiration of the 120-day period.<br><br>To repeat, a claim for tax refund or credit, like a claim for tax exemption, is construed strictly against the taxpayer. One of the conditions for a judicial claim of refund or credit under the VAT System is compliance with the 120+30 day mandatory and jurisdictional periods. Thus, strict compliance with the 120+30 day periods is necessary for such a claim to prosper, whether before, during, or after the effectivity of the <i>Atlas</i> doctrine, except for the period from the issuance of BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 on 10 December 2003 to 6 October 2010 when the <i>Aichi</i> doctrine was adopted, which again reinstated the 120+30 day periods as mandatory and jurisdictional.<br><br>V. <b><u>Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 49-03 (RMC 49-03) dated 15 April 2003</u></b><br><br>There is nothing in RMC 49-03 that states, expressly or impliedly, that the taxpayer need not wait for the 120-day period to expire before filing a judicial claim with the CTA. RMC 49-03 merely authorizes the BIR to continue processing the administrative claim even after the taxpayer has filed its judicial claim, without saying that the taxpayer can file its judicial claim before the expiration of the 120-day period. RMC 49-03 states: “In cases where the taxpayer has filed a ‘Petition for Review’ with the Court of Tax Appeals involving a claim for refund/TCC that is pending at the administrative agency (either the Bureau of Internal Revenue or the One-Stop Shop Inter-Agency Tax Credit and Duty Drawback Center of the Department of Finance), the administrative agency and the court may act on the case separately.” Thus, if the taxpayer files its judicial claim before the expiration of the 120-day period, the BIR will nevertheless continue to act on the administrative claim because such premature filing cannot divest the Commissioner of his statutory power and jurisdiction to decide the administrative claim within the 120-day period.<br><br>On the other hand, if the taxpayer files its judicial claim after the 120-day period, the Commissioner can still continue to evaluate the administrative claim. There is nothing new in this because even after the expiration of the 120-day period, the Commissioner should still evaluate internally the administrative claim for purposes of opposing the taxpayer’s judicial claim, or even for purposes of determining if the BIR should actually concede to the taxpayer’s judicial claim. The internal administrative evaluation of the taxpayer’s claim must <i><b>necessarily</b></i> continue to enable the BIR to oppose intelligently the judicial claim or, if the facts and the law warrant otherwise, for the BIR to concede to the judicial claim, resulting in the termination of the judicial proceedings.<br><br><b>What is important, as far as the present cases are concerned, is that the mere filing by a taxpayer of a judicial claim with the CTA before the expiration of the 120-day period cannot operate to divest the Commissioner of his jurisdiction to decide an administrative claim within the 120-day mandatory period, <i>unless</i> the Commissioner has clearly given cause for equitable estoppel to apply as expressly recognized in Section 246 of the Tax Code</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>VI. <b><u>BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 dated 10 December 2003</u></b><br><br>BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 does provide a valid claim for equitable estoppel under Section 246 of the Tax Code. BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03<i> expressly</i> states that the<b> “taxpayer-claimant need not wait for the lapse of the 120-day period before it could seek judicial relief with the CTA by way of Petition for Review.”</b> Prior to this ruling, the BIR held, as shown by its position in the Court of Appeals,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> that the expiration of the 120-day period is mandatory and jurisdictional before a judicial claim can be filed.<br><br>There is no dispute that the 120-day period is mandatory and jurisdictional, and that the CTA does not acquire jurisdiction over a judicial claim that is filed before the expiration of the 120-day period. There are, however, two exceptions to this rule. The first exception is if the Commissioner, through a specific ruling, misleads a particular taxpayer to prematurely file a judicial claim with the CTA. Such specific ruling is applicable only to such particular taxpayer. The second exception is where the Commissioner,<i> through a general interpretative rule</i> issued under Section 4 of the Tax Code, misleads all taxpayers into filing prematurely judicial claims with the CTA. In these cases, the Commissioner cannot be allowed to later on question the CTA’s assumption of jurisdiction over such claim since equitable estoppel has set in as expressly authorized under Section 246 of the Tax Code.<br><br>Section 4 of the Tax Code, a new provision introduced by RA 8424, expressly grants to the Commissioner the power to interpret tax laws, thus:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 4. <i>Power of the Commissioner To Interpret Tax Laws and To Decide Tax Cases.</i> — The power to interpret the provisions of this Code and other tax laws shall be under the exclusive and original jurisdiction of the Commissioner, subject to review by the Secretary of Finance.<br><br>The power to decide disputed assessments, refunds of internal revenue taxes, fees or other charges, penalties imposed in relation thereto, or other matters arising under this Code or other laws or portions thereof administered by the Bureau of Internal Revenue is vested in the Commissioner, subject to the exclusive appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Tax Appeals.</blockquote><br>Since the Commissioner has <b>exclusive and original jurisdiction to interpret tax laws</b>, taxpayers acting in good faith should not be made to suffer for adhering to general interpretative rules of the Commissioner interpreting tax laws, should such interpretation later turn out to be erroneous and be reversed by the Commissioner or this Court. Indeed, Section 246 of the Tax Code expressly provides that a reversal of a BIR regulation or ruling cannot adversely prejudice a taxpayer who in good faith relied on the BIR regulation or ruling prior to its reversal. Section 246 provides as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 246. <i>Non-Retroactivity of Rulings.</i> — Any revocation, modification or reversal of any of the <b>rules and regulations </b>promulgated in accordance with the preceding Sections or any of the rulings or circulars promulgated by the Commissioner <b>shall not be given retroactive application if the revocation, modification or reversal will be prejudicial to the taxpayers</b>, except in the following cases:<br><br>(a) Where the taxpayer deliberately misstates or omits material facts from his return or any document required of him by the Bureau of Internal Revenue;<br><br>(b) Where the facts subsequently gathered by the Bureau of Internal Revenue are materially different from the facts on which the ruling is based; or<br><br>(c) Where the taxpayer acted in bad faith. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Thus, a general interpretative rule issued by the Commissioner may be relied upon by taxpayers from the time the rule is issued up to its reversal by the Commissioner or this Court. Section 246 is not limited to a reversal only by the Commissioner because this Section expressly states, “<b><i>Any</i></b> revocation, modification or reversal” without specifying who made the revocation, modification or reversal. Hence, a reversal by this Court is covered under Section 246.<br><br>Taxpayers should not be prejudiced by an erroneous interpretation by the Commissioner, particularly on a difficult question of law. The abandonment of the <i>Atlas</i> doctrine by <i>Mirant</i> and <i>Aichi</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> is proof that the reckoning of the prescriptive periods for input VAT tax refund or credit is a difficult question of law. The abandonment of the<i> Atlas</i> doctrine did not result in <i>Atlas</i>, or other taxpayers similarly situated, being made to return the tax refund or credit they received or could have received under Atlas prior to its abandonment. This Court is applying <i>Mirant</i> and <i>Aichi</i> prospectively. Absent fraud, bad faith or misrepresentation, the reversal by this Court of a general interpretative rule issued by the Commissioner, like the reversal of a specific BIR ruling under Section 246, should also apply prospectively. As held by this <i>Court in CIR v. Philippine Health Care Providers, Inc</i>.:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br><blockquote>In <i>ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corp. v. Court of Tax Appeals,</i> this Court held that under Section 246 of the 1997 Tax Code, <b>the Commissioner of Internal Revenue is precluded from adopting a position contrary to one previously taken where injustice would result to the taxpayer</b>. Hence, where an assessment for deficiency withholding income taxes was made, three years after a new BIR Circular reversed a previous one upon which the taxpayer had relied upon, such an assessment was prejudicial to the taxpayer. To rule otherwise, opined the Court, would be contrary to the tenets of good faith, equity, and fair play.<br><br>This Court has consistently reaffirmed its ruling in ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corp. in the later cases of <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Borroughs, Ltd., Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Mega Gen. Mdsg. Corp., Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Telefunken Semiconductor (Phils.) Inc., and Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Court of Appeal</i>s. <b>The rule is that the BIR rulings have no retroactive effect where a grossly unfair deal would result to the prejudice of the taxpayer, as in this case.</b><br><br>More recently, in Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Benguet Corporation, wherein the taxpayer was entitled to tax refunds or credits based on the BIR’s own issuances but later was suddenly saddled with deficiency taxes due to its subsequent ruling changing the category of the taxpayer’s transactions for the purpose of paying its VAT, this Court ruled that applying such ruling retroactively would be prejudicial to the taxpayer. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>Thus, the only issue is whether BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 is a general interpretative rule applicable to all taxpayers or a specific ruling applicable only to a particular taxpayer.<br><br>BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 is a general interpretative rule because it was a response to a query made, not by a particular taxpayer, but by a government agency tasked with processing tax refunds and credits, that is, the <b>One Stop Shop Inter-Agency Tax Credit and Drawback Center of the Department of Finance</b>. This government agency is also the addressee, or the entity responded to, in BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03. Thus, while this government agency mentions in its query to the Commissioner the administrative claim of Lazi Bay Resources Development, Inc., the agency was in fact asking the Commissioner what to do in cases like the tax claim of Lazi Bay Resources Development, Inc., where the taxpayer did not wait for the lapse of the 120-day period.<br><br>Clearly, BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 is a general interpretative rule. Thus, all taxpayers can rely on BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 from the time of its issuance on 10 December 2003 up to its reversal by this Court in Aichi on 6 October 2010, where this Court held that the 120+30 day periods are mandatory and jurisdictional.<br><br>However, BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 cannot be given retroactive effect for four reasons: <i>first</i>, it is admittedly an erroneous interpretation of the law; <i>second</i>, prior to its issuance, the BIR held that the 120-day period was mandatory and jurisdictional, which is the correct interpretation of the law; <i>third</i>, prior to its issuance, no taxpayer can claim that it was misled by the BIR into filing a judicial claim prematurely; and <i>fourth</i>, a claim for tax refund or credit, like a claim for tax exemption, is strictly construed against the taxpayer.<br><br>San Roque, therefore, cannot benefit from BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 because it filed its judicial claim prematurely on 10 April 2003, <b><i>before</i></b> the issuance of BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 on 10 December 2003. To repeat, San Roque cannot claim that it was misled by the BIR into filing its judicial claim prematurely because BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 was issued only after San Roque filed its judicial claim. At the time San Roque filed its judicial claim, the law as applied and administered by the BIR was that the Commissioner had 120 days to act on administrative claims. This was in fact the position of the BIR prior to the issuance of BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03. <b>Indeed, San Roque never claimed the benefit of BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 or RMC 49-03, whether in this Court, the CTA, or before the Commissioner</b>.<br><br>Taganito, however, filed its judicial claim with the CTA on 14 February 2007, <b><i>after</i></b> the issuance of BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 on 10 December 2003. Truly, Taganito can claim that in filing its judicial claim prematurely without waiting for the 120-day period to expire, it was misled by BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03. Thus, Taganito can claim the benefit of BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03, which shields the filing of its judicial claim from the vice of prematurity.<br><br>Philex’s situation is not a case of premature filing of its judicial claim but of late filing, indeed very late filing. BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 allowed premature filing of a judicial claim, which means non-exhaustion of the 120-day period for the Commissioner to act on an administrative claim. Philex cannot claim the benefit of BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 because Philex did not file its judicial claim prematurely but filed it long after the lapse of the 30-day period <b>following the expiration of the 120-day period</b>. In fact, Philex filed its judicial claim 426 days after the lapse of the 30-day period.<br><br>VII. <b><u>Existing Jurisprudence</u></b><br><br>There is no basis whatsoever to the claim that in five cases this Court had already made a ruling that the filing dates of the administrative and judicial claims are inconsequential, as long as they are within the two-year prescriptive period. The effect of the claim of the dissenting opinions is that San Roque’s failure to wait for the 120-day mandatory period to lapse is inconsequential, thus allowing San Roque to claim the tax refund or credit. However, the five cases cited by the dissenting opinions do not support even remotely the claim that this Court had already made such a ruling. <b>None of these five cases mention, cite, discuss, rule or even hint that compliance with the 120-day mandatory period is inconsequential as long as the administrative and judicial claims are filed within the two-year prescriptive period.</b><br><br>In <i>CIR v. Toshiba Information Equipment (Phils.), Inc.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> the issue was whether any output VAT was actually passed on to Toshiba that it could claim as input VAT subject to tax credit or refund. The Commissioner argued that “although Toshiba may be a VAT-registered taxpayer, it is not engaged in a VAT-taxable business.” The Commissioner cited Section 4.106-1 of Revenue Regulations No. 75 that “refund of input taxes on capital goods shall be allowed only to the extent that such capital goods are used in VAT-taxable business.” In the words of the Court, “Ultimately, however, the issue still to be resolved herein shall be whether respondent Toshiba is entitled to the tax credit/refund of its input VAT on its purchases of capital goods and services, to which this Court answers in the affirmative.” Nowhere in this case did the Court discuss, state, or rule that the filing dates of the administrative and judicial claims are inconsequential, as long as they are within the two-year prescriptive period.<br><br>In <i>Intel Technology Philippines, Inc. v. CIR</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> the Court stated: “The issues to be resolved in the instant case are (1) whether the absence of the BIR authority to print or the absence of the TIN-V in petitioner’s export sales invoices operates to forfeit its entitlement to a tax refund/credit of its unutilized input VAT attributable to its zero-rated sales; and (2) whether petitioner’s failure to indicate “TIN-V” in its sales invoices automatically invalidates its claim for a tax credit certification.” Again, nowhere in this case did the Court discuss, state, or rule that the filing dates of the administrative and judicial claims are inconsequential, as long as they are within the two-year prescriptive period.<br><br>In <i>AT&amp;T Communications Services Philippines, Inc. v. CIR,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> the Court stated: “x x x the CTA First Division, conceding that petitioner’s transactions fall under the classification of zero-rated sales, nevertheless denied petitioner’s claim ‘<b>for lack of substantiation</b>,’ x x x.” The Court quoted the ruling of the First Division that “<b>valid VAT official receipts, and not mere sale invoices, should have been submitted</b>” by petitioner to substantiate its claim. The Court further stated: “x x x the CTA <i>En Banc</i>, x x x affirmed x x x the CTA First Division,” and “petitioner’s motion for reconsideration having been denied x x x, the present petition for review was filed.” Clearly, the sole issue in this case is whether petitioner complied with the substantiation requirements in claiming for tax refund or credit. Again, nowhere in this case did the Court discuss, state, or rule that the filing dates of the administrative and judicial claims are inconsequential, as long as they are within the two-year prescriptive period.<br><br>In <i>CIR v. Ironcon Builders and Development Corporation</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> the Court put the issue in this manner: “Simply put, the sole issue the petition raises is whether or not the CTA erred in granting respondent Ironcon’s application for refund of its <b>excess</b> creditable VAT withheld.” The Commissioner argued that “since the NIRC does not specifically grant taxpayers the option to refund <b>excess</b> creditable VAT withheld, it follows that such refund cannot be allowed.” Thus, this case is solely about whether the taxpayer has the right under the NIRC to ask for a cash refund of <b>excess</b> creditable VAT withheld. Again, nowhere in this case did the Court discuss, state, or rule that the filing dates of the administrative and judicial claims are inconsequential, as long as they are within the two-year prescriptive period.<br><br>In <i>CIR v. Cebu Toyo Corporation,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> the issue was whether Cebu Toyo was exempt or subject to VAT. Compliance with the 120-day period was never an issue in <i>Cebu Toyo</i>. As the Court explained:<br><br><blockquote>Both the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and the Office of the Solicitor General argue that respondent Cebu Toyo Corporation, as a PEZA-registered enterprise, <b>is exempt from national and local taxes, including VAT</b>, under Section 24 of Rep. Act No. 7916 and Section 109 of the NIRC. Thus, they contend that respondent Cebu Toyo Corporation is not entitled to any refund or credit on input taxes it previously paid as provided under Section 4.103-1 of Revenue Regulations No. 7-95, notwithstanding its registration as a VAT taxpayer. For petitioner claims that said registration was erroneous and did not confer upon the respondent any right to claim recognition of the input tax credit.<br><br>The respondent counters that it availed of the income tax holiday under E.O. No. 226 for four years from August 7, 1995 making it exempt from income tax but not from other taxes such as VAT. <b>Hence, according to respondent, its export sales are not exempt from VAT, contrary to petitioner’s claim, but its export sales is subject to 0% VAT</b>. Moreover, it argues that it was able to establish through a report certified by an independent Certified Public Accountant that the input taxes it incurred from April 1, 1996 to December 31, 1997 were directly attributable to its export sales. Since it did not have any output tax against which said input taxes may be offset, it had the option to file a claim for refund/tax credit of its unutilized input taxes.<br><br>Considering the submission of the parties and the evidence on record, we find the petition bereft of merit.<br><br><b>Petitioner’s contention that respondent is not entitled to refund for being exempt from VAT is untenable.</b> This argument turns a blind eye to the fiscal incentives granted to PEZA-registered enterprises under Section 23 of Rep. Act No. 7916. Note that under said statute, the respondent had two options with respect to its tax burden. It could avail of an income tax holiday pursuant to provisions of E.O. No. 226, thus exempt it from income taxes for a number of years but not from other internal revenue taxes such as VAT; or it could avail of the tax exemptions on all taxes, including VAT under P.D. No. 66 and pay only the preferential tax rate of 5% under Rep. Act No. 7916. Both the Court of Appeals and the Court of Tax Appeals found that respondent availed of the income tax holiday for four (4) years starting from August 7, 1995, as clearly reflected in its 1996 and 1997 Annual Corporate Income Tax Returns, where respondent specified that it was availing of the tax relief under E.O. No. 226. <i>Hence, respondent is not exempt from VAT and it correctly registered itself as a VAT taxpayer. In fine, it is engaged in taxable rather than exempt transactions</i>. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><b>Clearly, the issue in <i>Cebu Toyo</i> was whether the taxpayer was exempt from VAT or subject to VAT at 0% tax rate.</b> If subject to 0% VAT rate, the taxpayer could claim a refund or credit of its input VAT. Again, nowhere in this case did the Court discuss, state, or rule that the filing dates of the administrative and judicial claims are inconsequential, as long as they are within the two-year prescriptive period.<br><br>While this Court stated in the narration of facts in<i> Cebu Toyo</i> that the taxpayer “did not bother to wait for the Resolution of its (administrative) claim by the CIR” before filing its judicial claim with the CTA, this issue was not raised before the Court. Certainly, this statement of the Court is not a binding precedent that the taxpayer need not wait for the 120-day period to lapse.<br><br><b>Any issue, whether raised or not by the parties, <i>but not passed upon by the Court</i>, does not have any value as precedent.</b> As this Court has explained as early as 1926:<br><br><blockquote>It is contended, however, that the question before us was answered and resolved against the contention of the appellant in the case of <i>Bautista vs. Fajardo</i> (38 Phil. 624). In that case no question was raised nor was it even suggested that said section 216 did not apply to a public officer. That question was not discussed nor referred to by any of the parties interested in that case. It has been frequently decided that the fact that a statute has been accepted as valid, and invoked and applied for many years in cases where its validity was not raised or passed on, does not prevent a court from later passing on its validity, where that question is squarely and properly raised and presented. <b>Where a question passes the Court <i>sub silentio</i>, the case in which the question was so passed is not binding on the Court (<i>McGirr vs. Hamilton and Abreu,</i> 30 Phil. 563), nor should it be considered as a precedent.</b> (<i>U.S. vs. Noriega and Tobias</i>, 31 Phil. 310; <i>Chicote vs. Acasio</i>, 31 Phil. 401; <i>U.S. vs. More</i>, 3 Cranch [U.S.] 159, 172; <i>U.S. vs. Sanges</i>, 144 U.S. 310, 319; Cross vs. Burke, 146 U.S. 82.) For the reasons given in the case of <i>McGirr vs. Hamilton and Abreu</i>, supra, the decision in the case of Bautista vs. Fajardo, supra, can have no binding force in the interpretation of the question presented here.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>In <i>Cebu Toyo</i>, the nature of the 120-day period, whether it is mandatory or optional, was not even raised as an issue by any of the parties. <b>The Court never passed upon this issue.</b> Thus, <i>Cebu Toyo</i> does not constitute binding precedent on the nature of the 120-day period.<br><br>There is also the claim that there are numerous CTA decisions allegedly supporting the argument that the filing dates of the administrative and judicial claims are inconsequential, as long as they are within the two-year prescriptive period. Suffice it to state that CTA decisions do not constitute precedents, and do not bind this Court or the public. That is why CTA decisions are appealable to this Court, which may affirm, reverse or modify the CTA decisions as the facts and the law may warrant. Only decisions of this Court constitute binding precedents, forming part of the Philippine legal system.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> As held by this Court in <i>The Philippine Veterans Affairs Office v.

However, <b>if no action on the claim for tax credit/refund has been taken by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue <i><u>after</u> the sixty (60) day period</i> from the date of submission of the application but before the lapse of the two (2) year period from the date of filing of the VAT return for the taxable quarter, the taxpayer may appeal to the Court of Tax Appeals.</b><br><br>x x x x<br><br><b><u>1997 Tax Code</u></b><br><br>Section 112. <i>Refunds or Tax Credits of Input Tax </i>—<br><br>(A)&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(D) <i>Period within which Refund or Tax Credit of Input Taxes shall be made.</i> — In proper cases, the Commissioner shall grant the refund or issue the tax credit certificate for creditable input taxes <b>within one hundred twenty (120) days </b>from the date of submission of complete documents in support of the application filed in accordance with Subsections (A) and (B) hereof.<br><br><b>In case of full or partial denial of the claim for tax refund or tax credit, or the failure on the part of the Commissioner to act on the application within the period prescribed above, the taxpayer affected may, within thirty (30) days from the receipt of the decision denying the claim or after the expiration of the hundred twenty day-period, appeal the decision or the unacted claim with the Court of Tax Appeal</b>s.</blockquote><br>There can be no dispute that under Section 106(d) of the 1977 Tax Code, as amended by RA 7716, the Commissioner has a 60-day period to act on the administrative claim. <b>This 60-day period is mandatory and jurisdictional</b>.<br><br>Did Section 4.106-2(c) of Revenue Regulations No. 7-95 change this, so that the 60-day period is no longer mandatory and jurisdictional? The obvious answer is no.<br><br>Section 4.106-2(c) itself expressly states that if, <b><i>“after the sixty (60) day period,</i></b>” the Commissioner fails to act on the administrative claim, the taxpayer may file the judicial claim even “before the lapse of the two (2) year period.” <b>Thus, under Section 4.106-2(c) the 60-day period is still mandatory and jurisdictional.</b><br><br>Section 4.106-2(c) did not change Section 106(d) as amended by RA 7716, but merely implemented it, for two reasons. <i>First,</i><b> Section 4.106-2(c) still expressly requires compliance with the 60-day period.</b> This cannot be disputed.<br><br>Second, under the novel amendment introduced by RA 7716, mere <b>inaction</b> by the Commissioner during the 60-day period is <b>deemed a denial</b> of the claim. Thus, Section 4.106-2(c) states that “if no action on the claim for tax refund/credit has been taken by the Commissioner<b><i> after the sixty (60) day period</i></b>,” the taxpayer “may” already file the judicial claim even long <i>before</i> the lapse of the two-year prescriptive period. Prior to the amendment by RA 7716, the taxpayer had to wait until the two-year prescriptive period was <b>about to expire</b> if the Commissioner did not act on the claim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> With the amendment by RA 7716, the taxpayer need not wait until the two-year prescriptive period is about to expire before filing the judicial claim because mere inaction by the Commissioner during the 60-day period is deemed a denial of the claim. <b>This is the meaning of the phrase “but before the lapse of the two (2) year period” in Section 4.106-2(c)</b>. As Section 4.106-2(c) reiterates that the judicial claim can be filed only “<b><i>after the sixty (60) day period,</i></b>” this period remains mandatory and jurisdictional. Clearly, Section 4.106-2(c) did not amend Section 106(d) but merely faithfully implemented it.<br><br>Even assuming, for the sake of argument, that Section 4.106-2(c) of Revenue Regulations No. 7-95, an administrative issuance, amended Section 106(d) of the Tax Code to make the period given to the Commissioner non-mandatory, still the 1997 Tax Code, a much later law, reinstated the original intent and provision of Section 106(d) by extending the 60-day period to 120 days and <b>re-adopting the original wordings of Section 106(d)</b>. Thus, Section 4.106-2(c), a mere administrative issuance, becomes inconsistent with Section 112(D), a later law. Obviously, the later law prevails over a prior inconsistent administrative issuance.<br><br>Section 112(D) of the 1997 Tax Code is clear, unequivocal, and categorical that the Commissioner has 120 days to act on an administrative claim. The taxpayer can file the judicial claim (1) <b><i>only within thirty days after the Commissioner partially or fully denies the claim</i></b> within the 120-day period, or (2) <b><i>only within thirty days from the expiration of the 120-day period</i></b> if the Commissioner does not act within the 120-day period.<br><br>There can be no dispute that upon effectivity of the 1997 Tax Code on 1 January 1998, or <b>more than five years <i>before </i>San Roque filed its administrative claim on 28 March 2003</b>, the law has been clear: the 120-day period is mandatory and jurisdictional. San Roque’s claim, having been filed administratively on 28 March 2003, is governed by the 1997 Tax Code, not the 1977 Tax Code. Since San Roque filed its judicial claim before the expiration of the 120-day mandatory and jurisdictional period, San Roque’s claim cannot prosper.<br><br>San Roque cannot also invoke Section 4.106-2(c), which expressly provides that the taxpayer can only file the judicial claim “<b><i>after</i></b>” the lapse of the 60-day period from the filing of the administrative claim. <b>San Roque filed its judicial claim just 13 days after filing its administrative claim</b>. To recall, San Roque filed its judicial claim on 10 April 2003, a mere 13 days after it filed its administrative claim.<br><br>Even if,<i> contrary to all principles of statutory construction as well as plain common sense</i>, we gratuitously apply now Section 4.106-2(c) of Revenue Regulations No. 7-95, still <b>San Roque cannot recover any refund or credit because San Roque did not wait for the 60-day period to lapse, contrary to the express requirement in Section 4.106-2(c)</b>. In short, San Roque does not even comply with Section 4.106-2(c). A claim for tax refund or credit is strictly construed against the taxpayer, who must prove that his claim clearly complies with all the conditions for granting the tax refund or credit. San Roque did not comply with the express condition for such statutory grant.<br><br>A final word. Taxes are the lifeblood of the nation. The Philippines has been struggling to improve its tax efficiency collection for the longest time with minimal success. Consequently, the Philippines has suffered the economic adversities arising from poor tax collections, forcing the government to continue borrowing to fund the budget deficits. This Court cannot turn a blind eye to this economic malaise by being unduly liberal to taxpayers who do not comply with statutory requirements for tax refunds or credits. The tax refund claims in the present cases are not a pittance. Many other companies stand to gain if this Court were to rule otherwise. The dissenting opinions will turn on its head the well-settled doctrine that tax refunds are strictly construed against the taxpayer.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court hereby (1) <b>GRANTS</b> the petition of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue in G.R.

It would be nearly impossible for the Bureau of Internal Revenue to operate in an administrative vacuum.<br><br>Although we express the same position that the CTA Decisions constitute an operative fact on the manner in which the BIR, CA, CTA and even this court regarded the 120+<span style="text-decoration: underline;">&lt;</span>30 period leading the taxpayers to believe that they were observing the proper period in their claims for refund, I do not agree with Justice Velasco’s stand as to the application of RR 16-2005 which construed the nature of the 120+<span style="text-decoration: underline;">&lt;</span>30 period as mandatory and jurisdictional only from the date it took effect on 1 November 2005.&nbsp; I believe that in line with numerous jurisprudence, the mandatory and jurisdictional application of the 120+<span style="text-decoration: underline;">&lt;</span>30 period must be applied prospectively, or at the earliest only upon the finality of <i>Aichi</i> where this Court categorically ruled on the nature of the 120+<span style="text-decoration: underline;">&lt;</span>30 period pursuant to Section 112 (D) of the 1997 NIRC.&nbsp; Prior to <i>Aichi</i>, the CTA continuously ruled that the 120+<span style="text-decoration: underline;">&lt;</span>30 period is not mandatory and jurisdictional.<br><br>In <i>Miranda et. al. v.

Concomitant to a liberal application of the rules of procedure should be an effort on the part of the party invoking liberality to explain its failure to comply with the rules. Procedural law has its own rationale in the orderly administration of justice, namely, to ensure the effective enforcement of substantive rights by providing for a system that obviates arbitrariness, caprice, despotism or whimsicality in the settlement of disputes. <b>The enforcement of procedural rules is not antithetical to the substantive rights of the litigants.

To do so creates a tear in the public order and sow more distrust in public institutions. We would be fostering uncertainty in the minds of the public, especially in the business community, if we cannot guarantee our own obedience to these rules.<br><br>In a dissenting opinion in a case involving VAT law, Justice Tinga well said: <b>“Taxes may be inherently punitive, but when the fine line between damage and destruction is crossed, the courts must step forth and cut the hangman's noose.

Thirteen (13) days thereafter, or on <b><u>April 10, 2003</u></b>, San Roque filed a Petition for Review regarding the same amount with the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA).<br><br>The CTA Second Division initially denied San Roque’s claim for insufficiency of supporting documents and evidence. However, on San Roque’s motion, the CTA Second Division reconsidered and granted San Roque’s claim, albeit at a reduced amount of PhP 483,797,599.65.<br><br>The reconsideration prompted the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) to file a Petition for Review before the CTA En Banc claiming that San Roque prematurely filed its judicial claim with the CTA and failed to meet the requisites for claiming a refund/credit of input VAT. The CTA En Banc dismissed the CIR’s petition sustaining the timeliness of San Roque’s administrative and judicial claims.<br><br>The CTA <i>En Banc</i> held that the word “may” in Section 112(D) of the 1997 National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) signifies the intent to allow a directory and permissive construction of the 120-day period for the filing of a judicial claim for refund/credit of input VAT. Hence, the filing of judicial claims for refund/credit of VAT within the said 120-day period is allowed, as long as it is made within the two-year prescriptive period prescribed under Section 229 of the 1997 NIRC.<br><br>Undaunted, the CIR elevated the controversy before this Court asserting, in the main, that San Roque’s failure to wait for the lapse of the 120-day period after filing its claim with the BIR is fatal to San Roque’s right to a refund/credit of input VAT. Moreover, so the CIR claimed, the refund should be spread across the 40-year life span of the capital goods and equipment of the taxpayer.<br><br>In a Resolution dated January 12, 2011, this Court affirmed the CTA Second Division’s Decision, as sustained by the CTA En Banc, with the modification that the tax credit should be spread over the 40-year lifespan of San Roque’s capital goods and equipment.<br><br>On February 11, 2011, the CIR filed a Motion for Reconsideration citing this Court’s October 6, 2010 Decision in<i> Commissioner of Internal Revenue v.

On November 29, 2006, Taganito informed the CIR that the correct period covered by its claim actually spans from to January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2005.<br><br>Ninety-two (92) days after it first filed its claim for refund/credit, or on <b><u>February 14, 2007</u></b>, Taganito filed a Petition for Review with the CTA claiming that the CIR failed to act on its claim. The CTA Second Division partially granted Taganito’s claim and ordered the CIR to refund the taxpayer in the amount of PhP 8,249,883.33.<br><br>When its motion for reconsideration was denied by the CTA Second Division, the CIR filed a Petition for Review with the CTA En Banc asserting that the 120-day period prescribed in Sec. 112(D) of the 1997 NIRC is jurisdictional so that Taganito’s non-compliance thereof is fatal to its claim for refund/credit of input VAT.<br><br>Citing our Decision in <i>Aichi</i>, the <i>CTA En Banc</i> ruled that Taganito’s failure to wait for the lapse of the 120-day period prescribed in Sec. 112(D) of the 1997 NIRC amounted to a premature filing of its judicial claim that violates the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies.<br><br>The CTA <i>En Banc</i> denied Taganito’s Motion for Reconsideration.

Ruling on the petition, the CTA Second Division denied the claim holding that while Philex’s administrative claim was timely filed, its judicial claim was filed out of time. Hence, Philex’s claim for refund/credit is barred by prescription.<br><br>Philex’s Motion for Reconsideration was denied by the CTA Second Division. Hence, on December 2, 2009, Philex filed with the CTA <i>En Banc</i> a Petition for Review.<br><br>The CTA <i>En Banc </i>denied the motion.<br><br>Applying our pronouncements in <i>Aichi</i>, the CTA <i>En Banc</i> held that Philex only had until August 17, 2006, or thirty (30) days after the lapse of the 120-day period from the filing of its administrative claim on March 20, 2006, to file its judicial claim with the CTA. Hence, the CTA Second Division no longer had jurisdiction to entertain the petition filed by Philex 426-day late.<br><br>The denial of its claim impelled Philex to file its petition before this Court.<br><br>To resolve the primary issue common to the foregoing cases, it has been advanced that the following three (3) cases are determinative: (1) <i>Atlas Consolidated Mining and Development Corporation v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, June 8, 2007 (Atlas)</i>;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> (2) <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v.

It is then suggested that the doctrine applicable to a claim for refund or issuance of a TCC depends on the case operative at the time of filing the claim.<br><br>It is, however, submitted that in resolving the issue on the proper period for filing a <b>judicial claim</b>, only <i>Aichi</i> is relevant, and a review of the relevant legislations and regulations is necessary for a more comprehensive appreciation of the present controversy.<br><br>In <i>Atlas</i>, the period to file a judicial claim was never the issue.&nbsp; Instead, <i>Atlas </i>sought to define the start of the two-year period within which to file the claim and pegged it at “the date of filing of the return and payment of the tax due, which, according to the law then existing, should be made within 20 days from the end of quarter.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Moreover, <i>Atlas</i> involved claims for refund of unutilized input VAT covering taxable years 1990 and 1992. It, therefore, construed the relevant provisions of the Tax Code of 1977,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> as amended by Executive Order No. (EO) 273,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> which read:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 106.

(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>It is clear from the foregoing provisions that the Tax Code of 1977 applied in <i>Atlas</i> did not provide a period within which the judicial claim must be filed by the taxpayer after he has filed his administrative claim for refund. The correlation made by this Court of the prescriptive period in Sec. 106 with Sec. 230<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> (now Sec. 229), which states that no suit or proceeding to claim a tax refund is allowed after the expiration of the two (2) years from the date of the payment of the tax, was, therefore, necessary and justified under the circumstances present in <i>Atlas</i>. The same correlation is not applicable to the present cases.<br><br>The period within which to file a judicial claim for the refund of VAT or the issuance of a TCC was first introduced in 1994 through Republic Act No. (RA) 7716,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Sec. 6 of which provided:<br><br><blockquote>Section 6.

However, it likewise did not set forth the period prescribed in <b>Sec. 112(D)</b> of the 1997 NIRC in filing the judicial claim after the administrative claim has been filed. Like in <i>Atlas,</i> the issue resolved in <i>Mirant </i>is the date from which the 2-year prescriptive period to file the claim should be counted. Applying <b>Sec. 112(A)</b> of the 1997 NIRC, this Court, in Mirant, modified the <i>Atlas</i> doctrine and set the commencement of the 2-year prescriptive period from the date of the close of the relevant taxable quarter. In so ruling, this Court declared in <i>Mirant</i> that the provisions of Sec. 229 of the 1997 NIRC do not apply to claims for refund/credit of input taxes because these taxes are not erroneously or illegally collected taxes:<br><br><blockquote>To be sure, MPC cannot avail itself of the provisions of either Sec. 204(C) or 229 of the NIRC which, for the purpose of refund, prescribes a different starting point for the two-year prescriptive limit for the filing of a claim therefor.&nbsp; Secs. 204(C) and 229 respectively provide:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Notably, the above provisions also set a two-year prescriptive period, reckoned from date of payment of the tax or penalty, for the filing of a claim of refund or tax credit.

At the risk of being repetitive, I quote again the pertinent provisions of Sec. 106(d) of the 1977 NIRC, as amended by RA 7716 which was approved on May 5, 1994 prior to the issuance of RR 7-95, and Sec. 112(D) of the 1997 NIRC for comparison:<br><br><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr bordercolor="#000000" bgcolor="#000000"> <td style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);" width="50%"><div align="CENTER"><strong><span class="style1">Sec. 106(d), 1977 NIRC</span></strong></div></td> <td style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);" width="50%"><div align="CENTER"><strong><span class="style1">Sec. 112(D), 1997 NIRC</span></strong></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><p align="JUSTIFY">Sec. 106. <em>Refunds or tax credits of creditable input tax</em>. — x x x</p> <p align="JUSTIFY">d) <em>Period within which refund or tax credit of input taxes shall be made. </em>— In proper cases, <strong>the Commissioner shall grant a refund or issue the tax credit for creditable input taxes within sixty (60) days from the date of submission of complete documents</strong> in support of the application filed in accordance with sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) hereof.<br><br> </p> <p align="JUSTIFY">In case of full or partial denial of the claim for tax refund or tax credit, or the failure on the part of the Commissioner to act on the application within the period prescribed above, <strong>the taxpayer affected may, within thirty (30) days from the receipt of the decision denying the claim or after the expiration of the sixty-day period, appeal the decision or the unacted claim with the Court of Tax Appeals.</strong></p></td> <td><p align="JUSTIFY">Section 112. <em>Refunds or Tax Credits of Input Tax.</em> – x x x</p> <p align="JUSTIFY">(D) <em>Period within which Refund or Tax Credit of Input Taxes shall be made.</em> In proper cases,<strong> the Commissioner shall grant a refund or issue the tax credit certificate for creditable input taxes within one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of submission of complete documents</strong> in support of the application filed in accordance with Subsections (A) and (B) hereof.</p> <p align="JUSTIFY">In case of full or partial denial of the claim for tax refund or tax credit, or the failure on the part of the Commissioner to act on the application within the period prescribed above, <strong>the taxpayer affected may, within thirty (30) days from the receipt of the decision denying the claim or after the expiration of the one hundred twenty day-period, appeal the decision or the unacted claim with the Court of Tax Appeals.</strong></p></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br>It is apparent that Sec. 106(d) of the 1977 NIRC, as amended, was substantially adopted and re-enacted by Sec. 112(D) of the 1997 NIRC.

Thus, RR 7-95 construing and implementing Sec. 106(d) of the 1977 NIRC, as amended by RA 7716, continued in effect under Sec. 112(D) of the 1997 NIRC.</b><br><br>In <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. American Express</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> We ruled that when the legislature reenacts a law that has been construed by an executive agency using substantially the same language, it is an indication of the adoption by the legislature of the prior construction by the agency:<br><br><blockquote>[U]pon the enactment of RA 8424, which substantially carries over the particular provisions on zero rating of services under Section 102(b) of the Tax Code, the principle of legislative approval of administrative interpretation by reenactment clearly obtains. This principle means that “the reenactment of a statute substantially unchanged is persuasive indication of the adoption by Congress of a prior executive construction.”<br><br>The legislature is presumed to have reenacted the law with full knowledge of the contents of the revenue regulations then in force regarding the VAT, and to have approved or confirmed them because they would carry out the legislative purpose. The particular provisions of the regulations we have mentioned earlier are, therefore, re-enforced. “When a statute is susceptible of the meaning placed upon it by a ruling of the government agency charged with its enforcement and the [l]egislature thereafter [reenacts] the provisions [without] substantial change, such action is to some extent confirmatory that the ruling carries out the legislative purpose.”</blockquote><br>In fact, in this Court’s January 17, 2011 Decision in <i>Silicon Philippines, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> where the Court resolved a judicial claim filed on December 27, 2000 for creditable input taxes for the period October to December 1998 (after the effectivity of RA 8424 or the 1997 NIRC), this Court cited and relied on the provisions of RR 7-95, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>To claim a refund of input VAT on capital goods, Section 112 (B) of the NIRC requires that:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Corollarily, <b>Section 4.106-1 (b) of <u>RR No. 7-95</u></b> defines capital goods as follows: x x x Based on the foregoing definition, we find no reason to deviate from the findings of the CTA that training materials, office supplies, posters, banners, T-shirts, books, and the other similar items reflected in petitioner’s Summary of Importation of Goods are not capital goods.&nbsp; A reduction in the refundable input VAT on capital goods from P15,170,082.00 to P9,898,867.00 is therefore in order. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>Thus, this Court, I submit, cannot now assert that RR 7-95 was superseded and became obsolete upon the approval of RA 8424 or the 1997 NIRC.<br><br>Furthermore, the CIR issued Revenue Memorandum Circular No. (RMC) 49-03<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> pursuant to his rule-making power under Sec. 4 the 1997 NIRC, which states:<br><br><blockquote>Section 4. <b>Power of the Commissioner to Interpret tax Laws and to Decide Tax Cases. </b>– The power to interpret the provisions of this Code and other tax laws shall be under the exclusive and original jurisdiction of the Commissioner, subject to review by the Secretary of Finance.<br><br>The power to decide disputed assessments, refunds of internal revenue taxes, fees, or other charges, penalties imposed in relation thereto, or other matters arising under this Code or other laws or portions thereof administered by the Bureau of Internal Revenue is vested in the Commissioner, subject to the exclusive appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Tax Appeals.</blockquote><br>RMC 49-03, like all other RMCs, is an issuance that publishes pertinent and applicable portions, as well as amplifications, of laws, rules, regulations and precedents issued by the BIR and other agencies/offices.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> RMC 49-03, in particular, recognized and laid out the rules concerning the concurrent jurisdiction of the CIR and the CTA in cases of claims for VAT refunds or issuances of TCCs.<br><br>The significance and impact of RMC 49-03, dated August 15, 2003, can best be appreciated by a close reading:<br><br><blockquote>In response to request of selected taxpayers for adoption of procedures in handling refund cases that are aligned to the statutory requirements that refund cases should be elevated to the Court of Tax Appeals before the lapse of the period prescribed by law, certain provisions of RMC No. 42-2003 are hereby amended and new provisions are added thereto.<br><br>In consonance therewith, the following amendments are being introduced to RMC No. 42-2003, to wit:<br><br>1) A-17 of Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 42-3003 is hereby revised to read as follows:<br><br>“In cases where the taxpayer has filed a ‘Petition for Review’ with the Court of Tax Appeals involving a claim for refund/TCC that is pending at the administrative agency (Bureau of Internal Revenue or OSS-DOF),<b> the administrative agency and the tax court may act on the case separately.&nbsp; While the case is pending in the tax court and at the same time is still under process by the administrative agency</b>, the litigation lawyer of the BIR, upon receipt of the summons from the tax court, shall request from the head of the investigating/ processing office for the docket containing certified true copies of all the documents pertinent to the claim.&nbsp; The docket shall be presented to the court as evidence for the BIR in its defense on the tax credit/refund case filed by the taxpayer.&nbsp; <b>In the meantime, the investigating/ processing office of the administrative agency shall continue process­ing the refund/TCC case until such time that a final decision has been reached by either the CTA or the administrative agency</b>.<br><br>If the CTA is able to release its decision ahead of the evaluation of the administrative agency, the latter shall cease from processing the claim.&nbsp; On the other hand, if the administrative agency is able to process the claim of the taxpayer ahead of the CTA and the taxpayer is amenable to the findings thereof, the concerned taxpayer must file a motion to withdraw the claim with the CTA.&nbsp; A copy of the positive resolution or approval of the motion must be furnished the administrative agency as a prerequisite to the release of the tax credit certificate / tax refund processed administra­tively.&nbsp; However, if the taxpayer is not agreeable to the findings of the administrative agency or does not respond accordingly to the action of the agency, the agency shall not release the refund/TCC unless the taxpayer shows proof of withdrawal of the case filed with the tax court.&nbsp; If, despite the termination of the processing of the refund/TCC at the administrative level, the taxpayer decides to continue with the case filed at the tax court, the litigation lawyer of the BIR, upon the initiative of either the Legal Office or the Processing Office of the Administrative Agency, shall present as evidence against the claim of the taxpayer the result of investigation of the investigating/ processing office.” (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>RMC 49-03 explicitly allowed a taxpayer to file his judicial claim with the CTA while his administrative claim for refund of the same input taxes was still pending before the BIR, i.e., without waiting for the administrative claim to be first resolved, and that both claims, judicial and administrative, could proceed simultaneously; in brief, the administrative agency and the tax court may take cognizance of and act on the claims separately.<br><br>RMC 49-03 permitted refund-seeking taxpayers to have recourse to the CTA without having to wait for the lapse of the 120-day period granted to the CIR by Section 112(D).&nbsp; At the same time, the BIR was to continue to exercise jurisdiction over the administrative claim for refund, even after the CTA acquired jurisdiction over the judicial claim for refund of the exact same input VAT.&nbsp; This RMC even provided the mechanics for dealing with situations where one claim was resolved ahead of the other, in order to prevent conflicting outcomes or double refunds.&nbsp; Obviously, this RMC provided much needed and reliable guidance to taxpayers in dealing with their claims that were in peril of being time-barred.<br><br>At bottom, RMC 49-03 conclusively proves that the CIR and the CTA regarded the 120-day and 30-day periods in Sec. 112(D) as being <b>non-jurisdictional in nature</b>.&nbsp; It must be reiterated for emphasis that RMC 49-03 was issued and implemented under the aegis of the 1997 NIRC.<br><br>In addition, it is unarguable that <b>RMC 49-03 was premised on the belief of the CIR and the CTA that the two-year prescriptive period under Sec. 229 continued to be applicable to judicial claims for refund of input VAT, because otherwise, there would have been no need for, and no point in, allowing both the judicial and administrative claims to proceed simultaneously.</b><br><br>Moreover, RMC 49-03 obviously demanded and necessitated the agreement and cooperation of the CTA.&nbsp; In other words, RMC 49-03 was meaningful, relevant, viable and enforceable only because the CTA concurred in the CIR’s belief, and abided by, embraced and implemented the scheme under RMC 49-03 involving the twin-and-simultaneous jurisdiction by the CTA and the BIR over the claims for refund of one and the same input VAT.<br><br>At bottom, the only plausible explanation why the CIR issued and the BIR and CTA jointly implemented the RMC 49-03 system of handling claims, notwithstanding the existence of Sec. 112(D) of the 1997 NIRC, was that they believed that it would not conflict with Sec. 112(D),<b> precisely because of the continued effectivity of RR 7-95</b>.&nbsp; The CIR and the CTA were of the belief that the said two-year prescriptive period was applicable to the filing of judicial claims for refund of input VAT, and, therefore, in order to save such claims from being denied on account of late filing, they devised a system (consistent with and permissible under RR 7-95), allowing the judicial claim to be filed without awaiting the outcome of the administrative claim (or the lapse of the 120-day period), and allowing both claims to proceed simultaneously.<br><br>Needless to say, RMC 49-03 did not spring forth from sheer nothingness; it was preceded by RMC 42-03.&nbsp; In fact, the title of RMC 49-03 reads: “Amending Answer to Question Number 17 of Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 42-2003 and Providing Additional Guidelines on Issues Relative to the Processing of Claims for Value-Added Tax (VAT) Credit/Refund, Including Those Filed with the Tax and Revenue Group, One-Stop Shop Inter-Agency Tax Credit and Duty Drawback Center, Department of Finance (OSS-DOF) by Direct Exporters.”<br><br>On the other hand, RMC 42-03, dated as of July 15, 2003, has the subject title “Clarifying Certain Issues Raised Relative to the Processing of Claims for Value-Added Tax (VAT) Credit/Refund, Including Those Filed with the Tax and Revenue Group, One-Stop Shop Inter-Agency Tax Credit and Duty Drawback Center, Department of Finance (OSS) by Direct Exporters.”<br><br>Obviously intended to address various concerns/difficulties<b> already pre-existing </b>at the time of its issuance, RMC 42-03 presented, in Q &amp; A format, information needed by taxpayers in dealing with specific problematic situations involving VAT usage and VAT refund claims.&nbsp; <u>Question No. 17</u>, at the very end of RMC 42-03, reads as follows:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Q-17: </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">If a claim submitted to the Court of Tax Appeals for judicial determination is denied by the CTA due to lack of documentary support, should the corresponding claim pending at the BIR offices be also denied?</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br>The question speaks of a situation where the administrative claim is still pending with, and has not been resolved by, the BIR, but the judicial claim for refund of the same taxes has already been filed with and taken cognizance of by the CTA, and has been denied on account of lack of documentary support and <u>not on account of prematurity</u>.<br><br>Beyond doubt, this particular scenario was not uncommon back in 2003, <b>and in prior years as well</b>, as shown by the fact that it earned a distinguished spot in the BIR’s FAQ, and eventually had an entire Revenue Memorandum Circular devoted to it (i.e., RMC 49-03).&nbsp; This oft-repeated scenario was the result of the widespread practice among taxpayers of filing judicial claims with an eye to beating the two-year deadline under Sec. 229 of the Tax Code, coupled with the BIR and the CTA’s assiduous disregard of the 120-day and 30-day periods under Sec. 112(D).<br><br><b>The phrasing of that question indicates that neither the BIR nor the CTA considered such judicial claims to be premature for non-compliance with the 120-day and 30-day periods; those periods were by no means deemed jurisdictional in nature.</b>&nbsp; That was the official position taken by the BIR and the CTA, as reflected in their handling of the claims, and <b>the taxpayers and the general public cannot be faulted if they relied on the actuations and declarations of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and the CTA.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>The answer to Question No. 17 confirms the foregoing disquisition.&nbsp;

On the other hand, BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 was issued not by the CIR, but by then <b>Deputy Commissioner</b> Jose Mario C. Buñag of the Legal &amp; Inspection Group of BIR. It was, therefore, not an issuance authorized under Sec. 4 of the NIRC, which clearly provides that the “power to interpret the provisions of [the NIRC] and other tax laws shall be under the <b>exclusive</b> and <b>original</b> jurisdiction of the Commissioner, subject to the review by the Secretary.” Neither can BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 be considered an issuance within the delegated authority of the deputy commissioner considering that Sec. 7 of the 1997 NIRC expressly prohibits the delegation of the following powers:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"><div align="JUSTIFY">(A)</div></td> <td width="95%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">The power to recommend the promulgation of rules and regulations by the Secretary of Finance;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">(B)</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">The power to issue rulings of first impression or to reverse, revoke or modify any existing ruling of the Bureau.</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br>If this Court is set in sustaining the binding effect of BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03, it must be viewed as simply applying an already established and still effective rule provided by RR 7-95, not an issuance that established a new rule that departed from the 1997 NIRC.<br><br>For that matter, a reading of the rulings of this Court on claims for refund/credit of input VAT initiated from 1996 to 2005 made the impression that this Court was simply applying a well and long established rule that the period provided in Sec. 112(D) of the 1997 NIRC is merely discretionary and dispensable. As long as the judicial claim is filed within the 2-year period provided in Sec. 112(A), it was considered irrelevant whether the claim with the CTA is filed a day or a year after the administrative claim was filed with the CIR.&nbsp; The pertinent case laws on the issue are as follows:<br><br>(1) In <i>CIR v.

If it is the Court’s position that the prescribed periods of 120 days for administrative claim and 30 days for judicial claims are jurisdictional at the time the judicial claims were filed in these cases, then the cases should have been decided adversely against the taxpayers for filing the claim in breach of Sec. 112 of the 1997 NIRC. When these cases were entertained by the Court despite the clear departure from Sec. 112, the Court, wittingly or unwittingly, led the taxpayers to believe that the 120 and 30-day periods are dispensable as long as both the administrative and judicial claims for refund/credit of input VAT were filed within 2 years from the close of the relevant taxable quarter. Simply put, <b>the taxpayers relied in good faith on RR 7-95</b> and honestly believed and regarded the 120 and 30-day periods as merely discretionary and dispensable.&nbsp; Hence, noted tax experts and commentators, Victor A. Deoferio, Jr. and Victorino Mamalateo, recommended that for safe measure and to avert the forfeiture of the right to avail of the judicial remedies, taxpayers should “file an appeal with the Court of Tax Appeals, without waiting for the expiration of the 120-day period, if the two-year period is about to lapse.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Unfortunately, the aforecited decisions of the Court were of no help to taxpayers in the years between 1996 and 2005––said decisions were promulgated only in 2005, 2007 and 2010.&nbsp; Prior to 2005, there were no decisions in point rendered by this Court, and taxpayers had for guidance only the BIR issuances then in force and effect: RR No. 7-95, later followed by RMC 42-03 on July 15, 2003, RMC 49-03 on August 15, 2003, and BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03.&nbsp; And of course, the prevailing practices of the BIR and the CTA.<br><br>In fact, decisions of the CTA <i>En Banc</i> in some 128 cases involving judicial claims for refund or credit of unutilized VAT, which claims were filed in the years prior to the issuance of RMC 42-03 on July 15, 2003, and RMC 49-03 on August 15, 2003, paint a revealing picture of how the BIR and the CTA themselves actually regarded the 120 and 30-day periods.<br><br>At this point, I hasten to state that, while CTA Decisions are not binding on the Court, <b>the actual manner in which the BIR and the CTA themselves regarded the 120 and 30-day periods</b>––in the course of handling administrative and judicial claims for refund/tax credit during the period in question, <b>as evidenced by the factual recitals in the CTA Decisions––constitutes an operative fact that cannot simply be ignored.</b>&nbsp; The truth of the matter is that, <b>whatever may have been the law and the regulation in force at the time, <u>taxpayers took guidance from and relied heavily upon the manner in which the BIR and the CTA viewed the 120- and 30-day periods, as reflected in their treatment of claims for input VAT refund/credit, and these taxpayers acted accordingly by filing their claims in the manner permitted and encouraged by the BIR and the CTA</u></b>.&nbsp; This is a reality that even this Court cannot afford to turn a blind eye to.<br><br>Numerous decisions of the CTA in Division and <i>En Banc</i> reveal that the <b>BIR and CTA by their very actuations in the period between 1996 and 2005, did, in fact, permit, tolerate and encourage taxpayers to file their refund/tax credit claims without regard to the 120 and 30-day periods provided in Sec. 112(D)</b>. For instance, in CTA EB Case No. 43, <i>Overseas Ohsaki Construction Corp. v.

RA 9337 also mandated the Secretary of Finance to issue rules and regulations implementing the amended VAT provisions:<br><br><blockquote><b>SEC. 23.

However, like its predecessor RR 7-95, Sec. 4.112-1(d) of RR 14-2005 likewise provided that the judicial claims for refund/credit of input VAT must be made within two (2) years from the close of the taxable quarter when the relevant sales were made:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 4.112-1.

There, the Court is definite and categorical that the prescriptive period of 120 and 30 days under Sec. 112 of the 1997 NIRC is mandatory and jurisdictional. <i>Aichi</i> explained that the 2-year period provided in <b>Sec. 112(A)</b> of the 1997 NIRC refers only to the prescription period for the filing of an <b>administrative claim</b> with the CIR. Meanwhile, the <b>judicial claim</b> contemplated under said <b>Sec. 112(C)</b> must be filed within a <b>mandatory and jurisdictional period</b> of thirty (30) days after the taxpayer’s receipt of the CIR’s decision denying the claim, or within thirty (30) days after the CIR’s inaction for a period of 120 days from the submission of the complete documents supporting the claim. Hence, the period for filing the judicial claim under Sec. 112(C) may stretch out beyond the 2-year threshold provided in Sec. 112(A) as long as the administrative claim is filed within the said 2-year period. Aichi explained, thus:<br><br><blockquote>Section 112 (D) [now Section 112 (C)] of the NIRC clearly provides that the CIR has “120 days, from the date of the submission of the complete documents in support of the application [for tax refund/credit],” within which to grant or deny the claim. In case of full or partial denial by the CIR, the taxpayer’s recourse is to file an appeal before the CTA within 30 days from receipt of the decision of the CIR. However, if after the 120-day period the CIR fails to act on the application for tax refund/credit, the remedy of the taxpayer is to appeal the inaction of the CIR to CTA within 30 days.<br><br>In this case, the administrative and the judicial claims were simultaneously filed on September 30, 2004. Obviously, respondent did not wait for the decision of the CIR or the lapse of the 120-day period. For this reason, we find the filing of the judicial claim with the CTA premature.<br><br><b>Respondent’s assertion that the non-observance of the 120-day period is not fatal to the filing of a judicial claim as long as both the administrative and the judicial claims are filed within the two-year prescriptive period has no legal basis.</b><br><br>There is nothing in Section 112 of the NIRC to support respondent’s view. Subsection (A) of the said provision states that “any VAT-registered person, whose sales are zero-rated or effectively zero-rated may, within two years after the close of the taxable quarter when the sales were made, apply for the issuance of a tax credit certificate or refund of creditable input tax due or paid attributable to such sales.”<br><br><b>The phrase “within two (2) years x x x apply for the issuance of a tax credit certificate or refund” refers to applications for refund/credit filed with the CIR and not to appeals made to the CTA</b>. This is apparent in the first paragraph of subsection (D) of the same provision, which states that the CIR has “120 days from the submission of complete documents in support of the application filed in accordance with Subsections (A) and (B)” within which to decide on the claim.<br><br>In fact, <b>applying the two-year period to judicial claims would render nugatory Section 112(D) of the NIRC, which already provides for a specific period within which a taxpayer should appeal the decision or inaction of the CIR</b>. The second paragraph of Section 112(D) of the NIRC envisions two scenarios: (1) when a decision is issued by the CIR before the lapse of the 120-day period; and (2) when no decision is made after the 120-day period. In both instances, the taxpayer has 30 days within which to file an appeal with the CTA. As we see it then, the 120-day period is crucial in filing an appeal with the CTA.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>In fine, the premature filing of respondent’s claim for refund/credit of input VAT before the CTA warrants a dismissal inasmuch as no jurisdiction was acquired by the CTA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>The Court should not turn a blind eye to the subordinate legislations issued by the Secretary of Finance (and RMCs issued by the CIR) and the various decisions of this Court as well as the then prevailing practices of the BIR and the CTA suggesting that the taxpayers can dispense with the 120 and 30 day-periods in filing their judicial claim for refund/credit of input VAT so long as both the administrative and judicial claims are filed within two (2) years from the close of the relevant taxable quarter.&nbsp; I humbly submit that in deciding claims for refund/credit of input VAT, the following guideposts should be observed:<br><br>(1) For judicial claims for refund/credit of input VAT filed from January 1, 1996 (effectivity of RR 7-95) up to October 31, 2005 (prior to effectivity of RR 16-2005), the Court may treat the filing of the judicial claim within the 120 day (or 60-day, for judicial claims filed before January 1, 1998), or beyond the 120+30 day-period (or 60+30 day-period) as permissible provided that both the administrative and judicial claims are filed within two (2) years from the close of the relevant taxable quarter. Thus, the 120 and 30-day periods under Sec. 112 may be considered merely discretionary and may be dispensed with.<br><br>(2) For judicial claims filed from November 1, 2005 (date of effectivity of RR 16-2005), the prescriptive period under Sec. 112(C) is mandatory and jurisdictional. Hence, judicial claims for refund/credit of input VAT must be filed within a mandatory and jurisdictional period of thirty (30) days after the taxpayer’s receipt of the CIR’s decision denying the claim, or within thirty (30) days after the CIR’s inaction for a period of 120 days from the submission of the complete documents supporting the claim. The judicial claim may be filed even beyond the 2-year threshold in Sec. 112(A) as long as the administrative claim is filed within said 2-year period.<br><br>(3) RR 16-2005, as fortified by our ruling in <i>Aichi</i>, must be applied PROSPECTIVELY in the same way that the ruling in <i>Atlas</i> and <i>Mirant</i> must be applied prospectively.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Sec. 246 of the 1997 NIRC expressly forbids the retroactive application of rules and regulations issued by the Secretary of Finance, viz:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 246. <b>Non-Retroactivity of Rulings</b>. – Any revocation, modification or reversal of any of the rules and regulations promulgated in accordance with the preceding Sections or any of the rulings or circulars promulgated by the Commissioner <b>shall not be given retroactive application</b> if the revocation, modification or reversal will be prejudicial to the taxpayers x x x.

Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> that this rule cannot be used to perpetrate injustice:<br><br><blockquote>The general rule is that the State cannot be put in estoppel by the mistakes or errors of its officials or agents.

Nevertheless, <b><u>the government must not be allowed to deal dishonorably or capriciously with its citizens, and must not play an ignoble part or do a shabby thing; and subject to limitations x x x, the doctrine of equitable estoppel may be invoked against public authorities</u></b> as well as against private individuals.”</blockquote></blockquote><br>Indeed, denying claims for the issuance of TCCs or refund of unutilized input VAT amounting to millions, if not billions, of hard-earned money that rightfully belongs to these taxpayers on the facile ground that the judicial claim was not timely filed in accordance with a <b>later</b> rule, virtually sanctions the perpetration of injustice.<br><br>And since RR 16-2005, as clarified by our ruling in <i>Aichi</i>, is to be applied prospectively, based on and reckoned from the aforestated cut-off date of November 1, 2005, I accordingly vote as follows:<br><ol><li>In <i>CIR v. San Roque Power Corporation</i>, the motion for reconsideration and the petition of the CIR is <b>DENIED</b>.</li></ol><br>San Roque filed its administrative claim for refund of VAT for taxable year 2001 on April 10, 2003 and, barely two weeks after, it filed its judicial claim with the CTA; this was clearly within the 120-day waiting period for administrative claims.&nbsp; However, since both administrative and judicial claims were filed during the effectivity of RR 7-95, San Roque can claim in good faith that it was led by RR 7-95, as well as the guidance of the then prevailing practices of the BIR and the CTA, to believe that the 120 and 30-day periods are dispensable considering that in San Roque’s case, its administrative and judicial claims were both filed within 2 years from the close of the relevant taxable quarter.<br><br>2. In <i>Taganito Mining Corporation v. CIR</i>, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>.<br><br>Taganito filed its judicial claim on February 14, 2007, 92 days after it filed its administrative claim with the CIR and within the 120-day waiting period.&nbsp; Since its judicial claim was filed after November 1, 2005 when RR 16-2005 took effect and superseded RR 14-2005 and RR 7-95, Taganito cannot validly claim reliance in good faith on the revenue regulations that considered the 120 and 30-day periods in Sec. 112(C) dispensable so long as the claims are filed within the 2-year period.<br><br>3.&nbsp; In <i>Philex Mining Corp v. CIR</i>, the petition is likewise <b>DENIED</b>.<br><br>The administrative claim for VAT for the third quarter of 2005 was filed on March 20, 2006 while the judicial claim was filed on October 17, 2007, one year and three months after the lapse of the 120-day period under Sec. 112(C), and 17 days after the lapse of the 2-year prescriptive period in Section 112(A).&nbsp; The judicial claim is, therefore, belatedly filed under both the superseded RR Nos. 7-95 and 14-2005, and the effective RR 16-2005.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> G.R.

An administrative claim that is filed beyond the 2-year period is barred by prescription.<br><br></li><li>CIR has 120 days from the date of submission of complete documents in support of an application, within which to act on the claim.

On the other hand, failure of the taxpayer to elevate its claim within 30 days from the lapse of the 120-day period, counted from the filing of its administrative claim for refund, or from the date of receipt of the decision of the CIR, will bar any subsequent judicial claim for refund.<br><br></li><li>Excess input tax is not an excessively, erroneously, or illegally collected tax. A claim for refund of this tax is in the nature of a tax exemption, which is based on a specific provision of law, i.e., Section 110 of NIRC, which allows VAT-registered persons to recover the excess input taxes they have paid in relation to their sales. Hence, claims for refund/tax credit of excess input tax are governed not by Section 229 but only by Section 112 of the NIRC.<br></li></ol><br>These interpret the following provisions of the NIRC viz:<br><br><blockquote>Section 112. <i>Refunds or Tax Credits of Input Tax</i>. -<br><br>(A) Zero-rated or Effectively Zero-rated Sales. - Any VAT-registered person, whose sales are zero-rated or effectively zero-rated may, within two (2) years after the close of the taxable quarter when the sales were made, apply for the issuance of a tax credit certificate or refund of creditable input tax due or paid attributable to such sales, except transitional input tax, to the extent that such input tax has not been applied against output tax: xxx<br><br><center>xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx</center><br>(D) Period within which Refund or Tax Credit of Input Taxes shall be Made. - In proper cases, the Commissioner shall grant a refund or issue the tax credit certificate for creditable input taxes within one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of submission of complete documents in support of the application filed in accordance with Subsections (A) and (B) hereof.<br><br><b><i>In case of full or partial denial of the claim for tax refund or tax credit, or the failure on the part of the Commissioner to act on the application within the period prescribed above, the taxpayer affected may, within thirty (30) days from the receipt of the decision denying the claim or after the expiration of the one hundred twenty day-period, appeal the decision or the unacted claim with the Court of Tax Appeals</i></b>. (emphasis mine)<br><br>Section 110. <i>Tax Credits. </i>-<br><br>(A) Creditable Input Tax. - xxx<br><br>(B) Excess Output or Input Tax. - If at the end of any taxable quarter the ouput tax exceeds the input tax, the excess shall be paid by the VAT-registered person. If the input tax exceeds the output tax, the excess shall be carried over to the succeeding quarter or quarters. Any input tax attributable to the purchase of capital goods or to zero-rated sales by a VAT-registered person may at his option be refunded or credited against other internal revenue taxes, subject to the provisions of Section 112.</blockquote><br>I am however unable to agree with the conclusion that the interpretation we have just put on these provisions take effect only when we pronounce them. Thus, in the view of the <i>ponencia</i>, that it is to be applied “prospectively”.<br><br>My disagreement stems from the idea that we do not make law. Ours is a duty to construe: i.e., declare authoritatively the meaning of existing text. I can grant that words are naturally open textured and do have their own degrees of ambiguity. This can be based on their intrinsic text, language structure, context, and the interpreter’s standpoint.<br><br>However, the provisions that we have just reviewed already put the private parties within a reasonable range of interpretation that would serve them notice as to the remedies that are available to them. That is, that resort to judicial action can only be done after a denial by the commissioner or after the lapse of 120 days from the date of submission of complete documents in support of the administrative claim for refund.<br><br>Furthermore, settled is the principle that an “erroneous application and enforcement of the law by public officers do not preclude a subsequent correct application of the statute, and the Government is never estopped by mistake or error on the part of its agents.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>Accordingly, while the BIR Commissioner is given the power and authority to interpret tax laws pursuant to Section 4 of the NIRC, it cannot legislate guidelines contrary to the law it is tasked to implement. Hence, its interpretation is not conclusive and will be ignored if judicially found to be erroneous.<br><br>Concededly, under Section 246 of the NIRC, “[a]ny revocation, modification or reversal of any BIR ruling or circular shall not be given retroactive application if the revocation, modification or reversal will be prejudicial to the taxpayers.” However, if it is patently clear that the ruling is contrary to the text of the law, there can be no reliance in good faith by the practitioners.<br><br>BIR Ruling DA-489-03 which states that “the taxpayer-claimant need not wait for the lapse of the 120-day period before it could seek judicial relief with the CTA by way of Petition for Review,” constitutes a clear disregard of the express and categorical provision of Section 112(D) of the NIRC. Thus, the Commissioner's erroneous application of the law is not binding and conclusive upon this Court in any way.<br><br>As aptly held by this Court in <i>Philippine Bank of Communications v. CIR</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br><blockquote>Article 8 of the Civil Code recognizes judicial decisions, applying or interpreting statutes as part of the legal system of the country. But administrative decisions do not enjoy that level of recognition. A memorandum-circular of a bureau head could not operate to vest a taxpayer with a shield against judicial action. For there are no vested rights to speak of respecting a wrong construction of the law by the administrative officials and such wrong interpretation could not place the Government in estoppel to correct or overrule the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></blockquote><br>In many instances, we have not given “prospective” application to our interpretation of tax laws.

Applying the five-year prescriptive period for assessment specified under Section 331 of the Tax Code (and not Article 1145 of the Civil Code), we held that CIR's assessment made on 27 July 1961 against Ilagan Electric for erroneously refunded franchise tax for the 4th quarter of 1952 to the 4<sup>th</sup> quarter of 1954 is barred by prescription. </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">B)</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">In the case of <i>Collector of Internal Revenue v.

Collector of Internal Revenue</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> <b>promulgated on October 15, 1957</b>, the “Joint Emergency Operation” operated by Batangas Transportation Company and Laguna-Tayabas Bus Company is a “corporation” within the meaning of Section 84(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, and consequently, is subject to income tax.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">C)</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">The non-prospective effect of our decision can also be gleaned from what transpired in the case of <i>Carmen Planas v. Collector of Internal Revenue</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> That case involved a resolution of the CTA directing the execution of a judgment of the defunct Board of Tax Appeals, which affirmed the war profit tax assessment made by the Collector (now Commissioner) against Carmen Planas. We took note of our 30 March 1954 Resolution dismissing Carmen Planas' appeal from the Board of Tax Appeals decision on the basis of our declaration in <i>University of Sto. Tomas v. Board of Tax Appeals,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> that the provisions of E.O. No. 401-A conferring upon the Board of Tax Appeals exclusive jurisdiction over all appeals from decisions of the CIR in disputed assessments and other matters arising under the NIRC are null and void; hence, said Board has no jurisdiction over said internal revenue cases. Therefore, we concluded that the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals was neither valid, final or executory.</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br><br>As a matter of fact, in the fairly recent case of <i>Accenture, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> we upheld the Court of Tax Appeal's application of our pronouncements in <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Burmeister and Wain Scandinavian Contractor Mindanao, Inc</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> (<i>Burmeister</i>) as basis in ruling that <i>Accenture’s</i> services would qualify for zero-rating under Section 108(b) of the 1997 NIRC [formerly Section 102(b) of the 1977 Tax Code], only if the recipient of the services was doing business outside of the Philippines. We held:<br><br><blockquote>Moreover, even though Accenture’s Petition was filed before Burmeister was promulgated, the pronouncements made in that case may be applied to the present one without violating the rule against retroactive application. When this Court decides a case, it does not pass a new law, but merely interprets a preexisting one. When this Court interpreted Section 102(b) of the 1977 Tax Code in <i>Burmeister</i>, this interpretation became part of the law from the moment it became effective. It is elementary that the interpretation of a law by this Court constitutes part of that law from the date it was originally passed, since this Court's construction merely establishes the contemporaneous legislative intent that the interpreted law carried into effect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></blockquote><br>It is the duty of the lawyers of private parties to best discern the acceptable interpretation of legal text based upon methodologies familiar to lawyers. In doing so, they take the risk that the Supreme Court will rule otherwise, especially if the text of the law – as in this case – is very clear.<br><br>This Court should not be a guarantor of lawyer’s mistakes. Nor should it remove all risks taken by the taxpayers through the advice and actions of their counsels. The capacity to bear the costs of these mistakes in interpretation is generally better internalized by the private taxpayers rather than carried by the public as a whole. Government has had no agency in the decision of the private parties—in this case San Roque and Taganito Mining —to prematurely raise their claims with the Court of Tax Appeals. They could have taken the other route and erred on the side of caution, especially since Section 112 (D) of the NIRC is very clear.<br><br>In view of the foregoing, I concur with the statement of doctrines in the <i>ponencia</i> but vote for the following result:<br><br><ol><li>Grant the petition of the Commission of Internal Revenue in G.R. No. 187485 to deny the claim for tax refund or credit of San Roque Power Corporation in the amount of P560,200,283.14; <br><br></li><li>Deny the petition of Taganito Mining Corporation in G.R. No. 196113 for a tax credit in the amount of P8,365,664.38; and<br><br></li><li>Deny the petition of Philex Mining Corporation in G.R. No. 197156 for a tax refund or credit of P23,956,732.44.</li></ol><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Philippine Basketball Association v.
