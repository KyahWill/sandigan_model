Stela Marie Q. Gandia-Asuncion, Clerk of Court VI, was submitted to this Authority;<br><br>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our&nbsp; records show that Decree No. 444263 was issued on July 18, 1931 covering Lot Nos. 1 and 2 of plan Psu-53673, in Cadastral Case No. 3732, GLRO Record No. 22141 in favor of the Spouses Nicasio Lapitan and Ana Doliente;<br><br>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The technical descriptions of Lot Nos. 1 and 2 of plan Psu-53673, appearing on the reproduction of Original Certificate of Title No. (not legible) were found correct after examination and due computation and when plotted in the Municipal Index Sheet No. 451/1027, do not appear to overlap previously plotted/decreed properties in the area.</blockquote>The government prosecutor deputized by the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> participated in the trial of the case but did not present controverting evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>On March 9, 2006, the RTC rendered the assailed Decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the Court, finding the documentary as well as the parole (sic) evidence adduced to be adequate and sufficiently persuasive to warrant the reconstitution of the Original Certificate of Title covered by Decree No. 444263, Cadastral Case No. 3732, GLRO Record No. 22141, and pursuant to Section 110, PD No. 1529 and Sections 2 (d) and 15 of RA No. 26, hereby directs the Register of Deeds at Lingayen, Pangasinan, to reconstitute said original certificate of title on the basis of the decree of registration thereof, without prejudice to the annotation of any subsisting rights or interests not duly noted in these proceedings, if any, and the right of the Administrator, Land Registration Authority, as provided for in Sec. 16, Land Registration Commission (now NALTDRA) Circular No. 35, dated June 13, 1983, and to issue a new owner's duplicate copy thereof.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></blockquote>On April 4, 2006, petitioner Republic of the Philippines, through the OSG, filed a Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> which was denied by the RTC in its Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> dated May 24, 2006 for lack of merit.&nbsp; The RTC opined that while the number of the OCT is not legible, a close examination of the entries therein reveals that it is an authentic OCT per the LRA’s findings. Moreover, the RTC held that respondent complied with Section 2 of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 26<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> considering that the reconstitution in this case is based on the owner’s duplicate copy of the OCT.<br><br>Petitioner appealed to the CA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>&nbsp; By Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> dated July 31, 2008, the CA affirmed the RTC’s findings and ruling, holding that respondent’s petition is governed by Section 10 of R.A. No. 26 since the reconstitution proceedings is based on the owner’s duplicate copy of the OCT itself. The CA, invoking this Court’s ruling in <span style="font-style: italic;">Puzon v. Sta. Lucia Realty and Development, Inc.,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> concluded that notice to the owners of the adjoining lots is not required.&nbsp; Moreover, the CA opined that Decree No. 444263 issued on July 18, 1931 covering Lot Nos. 1 and 2 in the name of Spouses Lapitan exists in the Record Book of the LRA as stated in the LRA’s Report. The CA ratiocinated that the LRA’s Report on said Decree tallies with the subject OCT leading to no other conclusion than that these documents cover the same subject lots.&nbsp; Petitioner filed its Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> which the CA, however, denied in its Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> dated November 20, 2008.<br><br>Hence, this petition based on the following grounds, to wit:<br><ol type="1"><li>THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED WHEN IT RULED THAT THE TRIAL COURT CORRECTLY GRANTED THE PETITION FOR RECONSTITUTION EVEN IF THE ORIGINAL CERTIFICATE OF TITLE NUMBER IS NOT LEGIBLE[; and]<br><br></li><li>THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED WHEN IT RULED THAT THE TRIAL COURT CORRECTLY GRANTED THE PRAYER FOR THE ISSUANCE OF A SECOND OWNER’S DUPLICATE.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></li></ol>Petitioner through the OSG avers that respondent does not have any basis for reconstitution because the OCT per se is of doubtful existence, as respondent himself does not know its number.&nbsp; According to the OSG, this fact alone negates the merits of the petition for reconstitution as held by this Court in <span style="font-style: italic;">Tahanan Development Corporation v. Court of Appeals, et al</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Moreover, the OSG highlights that the Deed, the tax declaration for the year 2003, and the Register of Deeds Certification all indicated that the number of the OCT is not legible.&nbsp; The OSG also stresses that nowhere in the records did the LRA acknowledge that it has on file the original copy of Decree No. 444263 from which the alleged OCT was issued and that said Decree did not at all establish the existence and previous issuance of the OCT sought to be reconstituted. The OSG notes that the RTC erred, as found in the dispositive portion of its decision, in basing the reconstitution of the OCT under Section 2(d) of R.A. No. 26.&nbsp; Finally, the OSG submits that respondent cannot seek the issuance of the second owner’s duplicate of the OCT because he himself alleged in his own petition that he is in possession of the same owner’s duplicate certificate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>On the other hand, respondent counters that the OSG’s reliance in <span style="font-style: italic;">Tahanan and Republic of the Phils. v. Intermediate Appellate Court,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> is unavailing. He argues that in Tahanan, the petitioner therein merely relied on documents other than the owner’s duplicate copy of the certificate of title, while in Republic, this Court ruled that reconstitution cannot be based on statutes which do not confer title over the property.&nbsp; Respondent claims that in these aforementioned cases, petitioners therein do not have other sources to support their respective petitions for reconstitution while in this case the owner’s duplicate copy of the OCT sought to be reconstituted truly exists albeit its number is not legible.&nbsp; Respondent submits that the documentary as well as the parol evidence he adduced are adequate to warrant the reconstitution of the OCT as it is covered by Decree No. 444263.&nbsp; Respondent also submits that since there is a valid title in this case, there is legal basis for the issuance of the owner’s duplicate copy of the reconstituted title.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Notwithstanding the numerous contentions raised by both parties, this Court finds that the fundamental issue to be resolved in this case is whether the RTC properly acquired and was invested with jurisdiction in the first place to hear and decide Land Registration Case No. V-0016 in the light of the strict and mandatory provisions of R.A. No. 26.<br><br>We resolve the sole issue in the negative.<br><br>Section 110<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> of Presidential Decree No. 1529, otherwise known as the P<span style="text-decoration: underline;">roperty Registration Decree,</span> as amended by R.A. No. 6732,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> allows the reconstitution of lost or destroyed original Torrens title either judicially, in accordance with the special procedure laid down in R.A. No. 26, or administratively, in accordance with the provisions of R.A. No. 6732.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup>&nbsp; <br><br>As the case set before this Court is one for judicial reconstitution, we limit the discussion to the pertinent law, which is R.A. No. 26, and the applicable jurisprudence.<br><br>The nature of the proceeding for reconstitution of a certificate of title under R.A. No. 26 denotes a restoration of the instrument, which is supposed to have been lost or destroyed, in its original form and condition.&nbsp; The purpose of such a proceeding is merely to have the certificate of title reproduced, after proper proceedings, in the same form it was in when its loss or destruction occurred.&nbsp; The same R.A. No. 26 specifies the requisites to be met for the trial court to acquire jurisdiction over a petition for reconstitution of a certificate of title.&nbsp; Failure to comply with any of these jurisdictional requirements for a petition for reconstitution renders the proceedings null and void.&nbsp; Thus, in obtaining a new title in lieu of the lost or destroyed one, R.A. No. 26 laid down procedures which must be strictly followed in view of the danger that reconstitution could be the source of anomalous titles or unscrupulously availed of as an easy substitute for original registration of title proceedings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>It bears reiterating that respondent’s quest for judicial reconstitution in this case is anchored on the owner’s duplicate copy of said OCT – a source for reconstitution of title provided under Section 2 (a) of R.A. No. 26, which provides in full as follows:<br><blockquote>SEC. 2. Original certificates of title shall be reconstituted from such of the sources hereunder enumerated as may be available, in the following order:<br><ol type="a"><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">The owner’s duplicate of the certificate of title;</span><br><br></li><li>The co-owner’s, mortgagee’s, or lessee’s duplicate of the certificate of title;<br><br></li><li>A certified copy of the certificate of title, previously issued by the register of deeds or by a legal custodian thereof;<br><br></li><li>An authenticated copy of the decree of registration or patent, as the case may be, pursuant to which the original certificate of title was issued;<br><br></li><li>A document, on file in the registry of deeds, by which the property, the description of which is given in said document, is mortgaged, leased or encumbered, or an authenticated copy of said document showing that its original had been registered; and<br><br></li><li>Any other document which, in the judgment of the court, is sufficient and proper basis for reconstituting the lost or destroyed certificate of title. (Emphasis supplied.)</li></ol></blockquote>In this aspect, the CA was correct in invoking our ruling in <span style="font-style: italic;">Puzon v. Sta. Lucia Realty and Development, Inc.,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> that notices to owners of adjoining lots and actual occupants of the subject property are not mandatory and jurisdictional in a petition for judicial reconstitution of destroyed certificate of title when the source for such reconstitution is the owner’s duplicate copy thereof since the publication, posting and notice requirements for such a petition are governed by Section 10 in relation to Section 9 of R.A. No. 26. Section 10 provides:&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><blockquote>SEC. 10.&nbsp; Nothing hereinbefore provided shall prevent any registered owner or person in interest from filing the petition mentioned in section five of this Act directly with the proper Court of First Instance, <span style="font-weight: bold;">based on sources enumerated in sections 2(a), 2(b), 3(a), 3(b), and/or 4(a) of this Act: Provided, however, That the court shall cause a notice of the petition, before hearing and granting the same, to be published in the manner stated in section nine hereof: </span>And, provided, further, That certificates of title reconstituted pursuant to this section shall not be subject to the encumbrance referred to in section seven of this Act. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>Correlatively, the pertinent provisions of Section 9 on the publication, posting and the contents of the notice of the Petition for Reconstitution clearly mandate:<br><blockquote>SEC. 9.&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x Thereupon, the court shall cause a notice of the petition to be published, at the expense of the petitioner, twice in successive issues of the Official Gazette, and to be posted on the main entrance of the provincial building and of the municipal building of the municipality or city in which the land lies, at least thirty days prior to the date of hearing, and after hearing, shall determine the petition and render such judgment as justice and equity may require. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The notice shall specify, among other things, the number of the certificate of title, the name of the registered owner, the names of the interested parties appearing in the reconstituted certificate of title, </span>the location of the property, and the date on which all persons having an interest in the property must appear and file such claim as they may have. x x x (Emphasis supplied.)&nbsp;&nbsp; </blockquote>In sum, Section 10, in relation to Section 9, requires that 30 days before the date of hearing, (1) a notice be published in two successive issues of the Official Gazette at the expense of the petitioner, and that (2) such notice be posted at the main entrances of the provincial building and of the municipal hall where the property is located. The notice shall state the following: (1) the number of the certificate of title, (2) the name of the registered owner, (3) the names of the interested parties appearing in the reconstituted certificate of title, (4) the location of the property, and (5) the date on which all persons having an interest in the property, must appear and file such claims as they may have.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>Verily, while the CA invoked the appropriate provisions of R.A. No. 26, it failed, however, to take note that Section 9 thereof mandatorily requires that the notice shall specify, among other things, the number of the certificate of title and the names of the interested parties appearing in the reconstituted certificate of title. In this case, the RTC failed to indicate these jurisdictional facts in the notice.<br><br>First. The Notice of Hearing issued and published does not align with the in rem character of the reconstitution proceedings and the mandatory nature of the requirements under R.A. No. 26.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> There is a mortal insufficiency in the publication when the missing title was merely identified as “OCT No. (not legible)” which is non-compliant with Section 9 of R.A. No. 26.<br><br>Moreover, while the LRA confirmed the issuance of Decree No. 444263 in its Report, it perplexes this Court that the LRA failed to state that an OCT was actually issued and mention the number of the OCT sought to be reconstituted.&nbsp; In Republic of the Phils. v. El Gobierno De Las Islas Filipinas,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup>&nbsp; this Court denied the petition for reconstitution of title despite the existence of a decree:&nbsp; <br><blockquote>We also find insufficient the index of decree showing that Decree No. 365835 was issued for Lot No. 1499, as a basis for reconstitution. We noticed that the name of the applicant as well as the date of the issuance of such decree was illegible. While Decree No. 365835 existed in the Record Book of Cadastral Lots in the Land Registration Authority as stated in the Report submitted by it, however, the same report did not state the number of the original certificate of title, which is not sufficient evidence in support of the petition for reconstitution. The deed of extrajudicial declaration of heirs with sale executed by Aguinaldo and Restituto Tumulak Perez and respondent on February 12, 1979 did not also mention the number of the original certificate of title but only Tax Declaration No. 00393. As we held in Tahanan Development Corp. vs. Court of Appeals, the absence of any document, private or official, mentioning the number of the certificate of title and the date when the certificate of title was issued, does not warrant the granting of such petition.&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>Second.&nbsp; Respondent and the RTC overlooked that there are two parcels of land in this case.&nbsp; It is glaring that respondent had to amend his petition for reconstitution twice in order to state therein the names of the adjoining owners. Most importantly, the Notice of Hearing issued by the RTC failed to state the names of interested parties appearing in the OCT sought to be reconstituted, particularly the adjoining owners to Lot No. 1, namely, Benito Ferrer and Marcelo Monegas.&nbsp; While it is true that notices need not be sent to the adjoining owners in this case since this is not required under Sections 9 and 10 of R.A. No. 26 as enunciated in our ruling in Puzon, it is imperative, however, that the notice should specify the names of said interested parties so named in the title sought to be reconstituted. No less than Section 9 of R.A. No. 26 mandates it.<br><br>Well-entrenched in this jurisdiction that where the words of a statute are clear, plain, and free from ambiguity, it must be given its literal meaning and applied without attempted interpretation. Verba legis non est recedendum.&nbsp; From the words of a statute there should be no departure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup>&nbsp; In view of these lapses, the RTC did not acquire jurisdiction to proceed with the case since the mandatory manner or mode of obtaining jurisdiction as prescribed by R.A. No. 26 had not been strictly followed, thereby rendering the proceedings utterly null and void.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup>&nbsp; As such, while petitioner overlooked these jurisdictional infirmities and failed to incorporate them as additional issues in its own petition, this Court has sufficient authority to pass upon and resolve the same since they affect jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>Apropos is our ruling in Castillo v. Republic<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> where we held that:<br><blockquote>We cannot simply dismiss these defects as “technical.” Liberal construction of the Rules of Court does not apply to land registration cases. Indeed, to further underscore the mandatory character of these jurisdictional requirements, the Rules of Court do not apply to land registration cases. In all cases where the authority of the courts to proceed is conferred by a statute, and when the manner of obtaining jurisdiction is prescribed by a statute, the mode of proceeding is mandatory, and must be strictly complied with, or the proceeding will be utterly void. When the trial court lacks jurisdiction to take cognizance of a case, it lacks authority over the whole case and all its aspects. All the proceedings before the trial court, including its order granting the petition for reconstitution, are void for lack of jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup></blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, the petition for review on certiorari is <span style="font-weight: bold;">GRANTED. </span>The Decision dated July 31, 2008 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
