Their eldest child is “AAA,” who at the time material to this case was only 12 years old.<br><br>On August 21, 2002, the mother and sisters of “AAA” attended the wake of her auntie in Caloocan City.&nbsp; “AAA” and her father, the appellant, were thus the only ones left in the family residence in San Mateo, Rizal.&nbsp; At around 9:00 p.m. of the said date, “AAA” was lying in her bed in the family room located at the upper portion of their house when appellant fondled her breasts and touched her arms.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>&nbsp;

Appellant pulled out his penis and inserted it again into “AAA’s” vagina.&nbsp; When he was done, appellant put her shorts and panty back on and again threatened “AAA.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>After more than a month or on October 9, 2002, at about 10:30 p.m. and while “AAA” was sleeping in a double-deck bed and her sister was in the lower portion thereof, “AAA” was suddenly awakened.&nbsp; She noticed that her short pants had been lowered while appellant was already lying beside her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp; Appellant then inserted his index finger into “AAA’s” vagina.&nbsp; “AAA” only cried upon feeling the pain.&nbsp; After his deplorable act, appellant reiterated his previous threat to “AAA.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>After a few minutes, “AAA’s” mother entered the room where her daughters were sleeping.&nbsp; She noticed that “AAA” was covered with pillows, except for her head and feet.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>&nbsp; Upon approaching “AAA,” she saw that her legs were spread apart and her panty was slightly lowered and inserted at the center of her genitals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>&nbsp;

She even talked to the wife of appellant at around 6:00 p.m. and was told that she went home with her youngest daughter so they could rest since they have no place to stay in the wake they attended in Caloocan City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>&nbsp; The next day, “AAA,” her mother and sister went back to the wake.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>Appellant’s sister-in-law testified that after “AAA,” her mother and sister went to the wake on August 23, 2002, she, together with her son, mother-in-law, and appellant followed that evening.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>&nbsp; She observed that there seemed to be nothing wrong with “AAA” since she was serving food in the wake and playing with her cousins.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br><b><i>Ruling of the Regional Trial Court</i></b><br><br>In its January 18, 2006 Decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> the RTC gave more weight to “AAA’s” positive testimony as against appellant’s bare denials since her testimony was candid, straightforward and free from material contradictions.&nbsp; Her testimony was complemented by the findings of the medico-legal officer who examined “AAA.”&nbsp; In fact, “AAA” suffered intense psychological stress and depression as a result of the abuses.<br><br>On the other hand, the RTC found that appellant’s denials were not substantiated by clear and convincing evidence.&nbsp; It also found unacceptable his attempt to malign the reputation of his wife and daughter in order to exculpate himself.&nbsp; According to the said court, this evasive attitude of appellant cannot prevail over “AAA’s” testimony.<br><br>Accordingly, the RTC disposed of the criminal cases thus:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered judgment is hereby rendered as follows:<br><br>(a) In [C]riminal [C]ase No. 6572, for the rape committed on August 22, 2002, accused Doney Gaduyon y Tapispisan is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of DEATH and to pay the victim “AAA,” the amount of P50,000 as civil indemnity, P50,000 as moral damages and P25,000.00 as exemplary damages.<br><br>(b) In [C]riminal [C]ase No. 6573, for the sexual abuse committed on August 21, 2002, accused Doney Gaduyon y Tapispisan is hereby sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of One (1) year and One (1) month of Prision Correcional as minimum to Two (2) years, Eleven (11) months of Prision Correccional in its medium period as maximum.<br><br>(c) In [C]riminal [C]ase No. 6574, for the rape committed on October 9, 2002, accused Doney Gaduyon y Tapispisan is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of DEATH and to pay the victim “AAA” the amount of P50,000 as civil indemnity, P50,000 as moral damages and P25,000.00 as exemplary damages.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup></blockquote><br>On September 4, 2006, the RTC, however, partially modified the above judgment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> insofar as the penalty imposed in Criminal Case No. 6574 is concerned, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>The aforesaid judgment is hereby partially modified x x x to read, as follows:<br><br><blockquote>“WHEREFORE, premises considered, the judgment is hereby rendered, as follows:<br><br>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;

It also amended Article 335 of the RPC and incorporated therein Article 266-A which reads:<br><br><blockquote>Art. 266-A. <i> Rape, When and How Committed</i>. – Rape is committed-<br><br>1.

She positively identified appellant as her abuser. She did not waver on the material points of her testimony and maintained the same even on cross-examination.&nbsp; Indeed, her statements under oath are sufficient evidence to convict appellant for the crimes alleged in the Informations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>Moreover, “AAA’s” testimony is corroborated by the result of her medical examination which showed the presence of a deep healed laceration in her private part.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup>&nbsp; This finding is consistent with her declaration that appellant inserted his penis and finger into her vagina.&nbsp; “Where a victim’s testimony is corroborated by the physical findings of penetration, there is sufficient basis for concluding that sexual intercourse did take place.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br>Appellant seeks to discredit “AAA’s” testimony by insisting that he could not have raped the latter in the evening of August 22, 2002 since the whole family was in their house that day.&nbsp; This assertion is undeserving of credence due to our constant pronouncement that a bare assertion cannot prevail over the categorical testimony of a victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup>&nbsp; Even if corroborated by appellant’s mother, the same does not deserve any weight since courts usually frown upon the corroborative testimony of an immediate member of the family of an accused and treat it with suspicion.&nbsp; The close filial relationship between the witness and the accused casts a thick cloud of doubt upon the former’s testimony.<br><br>Even assuming that appellant was not alone with “AAA” on August 22, 2002, the presence of other people is not a deterrent to the commission of rape.&nbsp; This observation is apparent from the rape by sexual assault committed on October 9, 2002 while the entire family was in the residence.&nbsp; As aptly held by the RTC and the CA, rape indeed does not respect time and place.<br><br>Appellant impugns the credibility of “AAA” by emphasizing that she gave conflicting accounts on the manner she was raped.&nbsp; He also stresses the contradictions in the testimony of “AAA” and the other prosecution witnesses on the events that transpired after the alleged rape and regarding the disclosure by “AAA” of her ordeal.<br><br>We are not persuaded.&nbsp; Our review of the transcript of stenographic notes of the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses reveals that these inconsistencies refer to inconsequential matters “that [do] not bear upon the elements of the crime of rape.&nbsp; The decisive factor in the prosecution for rape is whether the commission of the crime has been sufficiently proven.&nbsp;&nbsp; For a discrepancy or inconsistency in the testimony of a witness to serve as a basis for acquittal, it must refer to the significant facts indispensable to the guilt or innocence of the appellant for the crime charged.&nbsp; As the inconsistencies alleged by the appellant had nothing to do with the elements of the crime of rape, they cannot be used as [grounds] for his acquittal.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br>With regard to the inconsistencies on the part of “AAA,” it bears stressing that “victims do not cherish keeping in their memory an accurate account of the manner in which they were sexually violated.&nbsp; Thus, an errorless recollection of a harrowing experience cannot be expected of a witness, especially when she is recounting details from an experience as humiliating and painful as rape.&nbsp; Furthermore, rape victims, especially child victims, should not be expected to act the way mature individuals would when placed in such a situation.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup>&nbsp; Verily, in this case, minor inconsistencies in the testimony of “AAA” are to be expected because (1) she was a minor child during her defloration; (2) she was to testify on a painful and humiliating experience; (3) she was sexually assaulted several times; and, (4) she was examined on details and events that happened almost six months before she testified.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br>Anent appellant’s other assigned errors, we quote the following findings of the CA:<br><br><blockquote>The argument that “AAA” did not manifest overt physical signs of having been raped since she acted and walked normally the following day cannot justify the reversal of appellant’s conviction.&nbsp; How a person goes about the day after the happening of a horrid event is not a tell-tale sign of the truth or [falsity] of an allegation.&nbsp; The workings of the human mind placed under a great deal [of] emotional and psychological stress are unpredictable and different people react differently.&nbsp; Furthermore, under the circumstances of this case, overt physical manifestations cannot be expected since “AAA” did not put up any form of resistance.&nbsp; The threat of harm to be inflicted on her mother was sufficient intimidation for her to succumb to her father’s lust out of fear.&nbsp; The pattern of instilling fear, utilized by the perpetrator in incestuous rape to intimidate his victim into submission, is evident in virtually all cases.&nbsp; It is through this fear that the perpetrator hopes to create a climate of extreme psychological terror which would, he hopes, numb his victim into silence and force her to submit to repeated acts of rape over a period of time.&nbsp; The relationship of the victim to the perpetrator magnifies this terror, because the perpetrator is a person normally expected to give solace and protection to the victim.<br><br>Appellant would also want to impress upon this Court that the accusation of his daughter was concocted by his wife because of their marital problems.&nbsp; This contention is preposterous.&nbsp; It is unnatural for a mother to sacrifice her own daughter, a child of tender years, and subject her to the rigors and humiliation of a public trial for rape if she was not driven by an honest desire to have her daughter’s transgressor punished accordingly.<br><br>Neither can it be said that there was no spontaneous disclosure by “AAA” of the incident.&nbsp; Appellant threatened “AAA.”&nbsp; The humiliation caused by the rape by her own father in addition to the burden of being responsible should her mother be harmed are sufficient to prevent any child from freely disclosing her ordeal. We must be reminded that the crime of rape by itself attaches much humiliation and more so if the loss is caused by her father. Delay and the initial reluctance of a rape victim to make public the assault on her virtue is neither unknown [nor] uncommon. That there was no spontaneous disclosure does not mean that appellant is innocent of the crimes.&nbsp; “AAA” was apparently a terrified young child who was completely at the mercy of her shameless father. Thus, “AAA’s” hesitation may be attributed to her age, the moral ascendancy of the accused over her, and his threats against her.<br><br>On the other hand, neither should the smile of “AAA” while identifying her father in court be given any malicious significance. While appellant puts much importance to said smile, which could be a way of concealing her nervousness, he ignored the fact that “AAA” cried while testifying on the details of the incidents. In fact, during her testimony, she categorically stated that she was afraid and ashamed. The candid and straightforward narration of how she was abused and the tears that accompanied her story are earmarks of credibility and must be given full faith and credit.<br><br>With respect to appellant’s contention that the clinical finding of Dr. Joven Ignacio, the psychiatrist, [is] faulty and not conclusive because she appeared to be biased, it is noteworthy that even without said psychiatric test, the finding of the trial court would still be affirmed considering that the sole testimony of the victim is sufficient basis for conviction in rape, which is a crime usually committed in seclusion.<br><br>Indeed, We are convinced that “AAA” had no reason to falsely incriminate her own father in view of the fact that the accusation would surely deny her mother the companionship of a husband and the protection of a father [for] her younger sisters. It has been consistently held that the testimony of a rape victim as to who abused her is credible where she has no motive to testify against the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup></blockquote><br>On the other hand, what appellant offered for his defense were mere denials which, as aptly observed by the RTC, are unsupported by clear and convincing evidence.<br><br>Given the foregoing circumstances, the CA correctly affirmed the Decision of the RTC finding appellant guilty of the crimes charged.<br><br><b><i>The Proper Penalty</i></b><br><br>The RTC imposed upon appellant the penalty of death for committing the crime of qualified rape through sexual intercourse in Criminal Case No. 6572.&nbsp; The Information in this case alleged the qualifying circumstances of relationship and minority.&nbsp; Appellant is the father of “AAA” and he admitted this filial bond between them during the pre-trial conference<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> and trial.&nbsp; “[A]dmission in open court of relationship has been held to be sufficient and, hence, conclusive to prove relationship with the victim.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup>&nbsp; Also, “AAA’s” birth certificate was submitted as proof of her age.&nbsp; This document suffices as competent evidence of her age.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br>“In view, however, of the passage of R.A.
