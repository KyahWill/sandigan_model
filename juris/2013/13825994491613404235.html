				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Before us is an appeal via a Notice of Appeal from the Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-H.C. No. 04051.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> The appellate court aftirmed <i>in toto</i> the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 18, Malolos, Bulacan which convicted accused-appellants Edwin Ibanez y Albante (Edwin) and Alfredo Nulla y Ibañez (Alfredo) of Murder in Criminal Case No. 3517-M-2004.<br><br>Appellants Edwin and Alfredo, with Jesus Monsillo<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> y Taniares (Jesus), were all charged in an Information for Murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, which reads:<br><blockquote>The undersigned Asst. Provincial Prosecutor accuses Jesus Montisillo y Taniares @ Dodong, Edwin Ibañez y Albante and Alfredo (Freddie) Nulla y Ibañez of the crime of murder, penalized under the provisions of Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, committed as follows:<br><br>That on or about the 29<sup>th</sup> day of August, 2004, in the municipality of Bocaue, province of Bulacan, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, armed with a soil digger (bareta) and with intent to kill one Wilfredo Atendido y Dohenog, conspiring, confederating and helping one another did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously, with evident premeditation, abuse of superior strength and treachery, attack, assault and hit with the said soil digger (bareta) the said Wilfredo Atendido y Dohenog, hitting the latter on his head, thereby inflicting upon him serious physical injuries which directly caused his death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br></blockquote>During arraignment, Edwin and Alfredo pleaded not guilty. Jesus, on the other hand, remained at large; the case against him was archived. Thereafter, trial ensued.<br><br>The prosecution’s version was testified to by the victim’s wife and daughter, in succession.<br><br>On that fateful day, Wilfredo Atendido y Dohenog (Wilfredo) was invited by Alfredo to a drinking session with Jesus and Edwin making them a party of four. Rachel, Wilfredo’s daughter, an adolescent at the time, was underneath the house (<i>silong</i> in the vernacular) of a neighbor, three (3) meters away from the place where Wilfredo and his companions were ostensibly in merrymaking.<br><br>Rachel saw her father step away from the group to urinate. While Wilfredo relieved himself, Edwin snatched a t-shirt from a nearby clothesline, and hooded the t-shirt over the head and face of Wilfredo. Robbed of vision as his head was fully covered, Wilfredo was wrestled and pinned down by Edwin, while Alfredo boxed the left side of Wilfredo’s chest. Jesus, armed with a long iron bar, swung at and hit Wilfredo in the head. Terrified, Rachel stood immobilized as she watched the attack on her father. Thereafter, she saw her mother running out of their house and crying for help.<br><br>On that same auspicious date, 29 August 2004, Rowena, Wilfredo’s wife and Rachel’s mother, was inside their house taking care of their youngest daughter. She heard a commotion coming from the neighboring house, about eight (8) steps away, so she rushed in that direction. Once outside their house, she saw Wilfredo prostrate on the ground covered with blood on his face and forehead. Upon reaching Wilfredo, Rowena saw accused Jesus, standing one meter away from Wilfredo, holding an iron bar. Edwin and Alfredo stood beside Jesus; Edwin held a white shirt. Forthwith, Jesus and Alfredo ran away while Edwin went home. Rowena asked for help to bring Wilfredo to the hospital. However, Wilfredo did not reach the hospital alive and was pronounced dead on arrival.<br><br>Expectedly, the defense mainly of Edwin and Alfredo, proffered an altogether different version of the events.<br><br>The two accused-appellants pointed to Jesus as the sole culprit, proclaimed their innocence and professed to being at the scene of the crime only because of their curiosity for what had occurred.<br><br>Allegedly, on that day, the two buddies were having their regular drinking session at Edwin’s house when they heard a commotion outside. Curious about the ruckus, they approached and saw Wilfredo prostrate on the ground; Jesus, held an iron bar and was being held back by his sister who was shouting, “<i>Tama na</i>[!] <i>Tama na</i>[!].” Edwin then called for a tricycle so Wilfredo could be brought to a hospital and given medical attention. Alfredo stood by and merely watched as events transpired.<br><br>To corroborate their claim of innocence, the defense called Aniceta Dosil (Aniceta) to the witness stand who testified as follows:<br><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify">(1)</div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="justify"> She sold doormats for a living which she peddled on the road;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(2) </div></td> <td> <div align="justify">On 29 August 2004, Rachel helped her in selling the doormats;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(3) </div></td> <td><div align="justify">On that day, they finished at around 6:00 p.m. and headed to their respective residences along the railroad track;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(4) </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Upon arriving at their vicinity, Aniceta witnessed the immediate aftermath of the purported fight between Jesus and Wilfredo;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(5) </div></td> <td><div align="justify">At that juncture, Jesus was being embraced by his sister, Marilou, and the two were two meters away from the body of Wilfredo;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(6)</div></td> <td><div align="justify"> Marilou recounted to Aniceta that Jesus had hit Wilfredo with an iron bar, a preemptive move because Wilfredo was about to stab Jesus;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(7) </div></td> <td><div align="justify">While Aniceta and Marilou discussed the incident, Rachel stood and listened to them;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(8) </div></td> <td><div align="justify">At that time, only the four of them, Jesus, Marilou, Aniceta and Rachel, were at the place of the incident;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(9) </div></td> <td><div align="justify">After learning the entirety of what had transpired, Aniceta, who was afraid to get involved, and Rachel, ran to their respective houses;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(10)</div></td> <td><div align="justify"> For the duration of the day, Aniceta did not step out of her house, neither did she volunteer information to the police when the case was investigated in the following days; and</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(11) </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Aniceta only came forward to testify at the request of Adela Ibañez, wife of Edwin.</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>As previously adverted to, the trial court convicted Edwin and Alfredo of Murder. It disposed of the case, to wit:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, accused Edwin Ibañez y Albante and Alfredo (Freddie) Nulla y Ibañez are hereby found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder and are hereby sentenced to suffer imprisonment of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and to indemnify the heirs of Wilfredo D. Atendido in the amount of:<br><br><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify">a) </div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="justify">Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) as civil indemnity;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">b)</div></td> <td><div align="justify"> Twenty-Five Thousand Pesos (P25,000.00) as temperate damages;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">c)</div></td> <td><div align="justify"> Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) as moral damages;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">d) </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Twenty-Five Thousand Pesos (P25,000.00) as exemplary damages; and</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">e) </div></td> <td><div align="justify">One Million Nine Hundred Forty-Six Thousand and One Hundred Eighty Pesos (P1,946,180.00) for the unearned income of Wilfredo Atendido.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>On appeal, Edwin and Alfredo found no reprieve. The Court of Appeals did not deviate from the RTC’s ruling and affirmed <i>in toto</i> its finding of guilt.<br><br>In this appeal, Edwin and Alfredo assign the following as errors:<br><blockquote><center>I<br></center><br>THE [LOWER COURTS] GRAVELY ERRED IN GIVING FULL WEIGHT AND CREDENCE TO THE TESTIMONY OF THE ALLEGED PROSECUTION EYEWITNESS.<br><br><center>II<br></center><br>THE [LOWER COURTS] GRAVELY ERRED IN NOT GIVING WEIGHT AND CREDENCE TO THE DEFENSE[‘S] EVIDENCE.<br><br><center>III<br></center><br>THE [LOWER COURTS] GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANTS WHEN THEIR GUILT WAS NOT PROVEN BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br></blockquote>In sum, the issue is whether the accused are guilty of murder.<br><br>Edwin and Alfredo maintain their innocence and point to Jesus as the sole perpetrator of the crime. They insist that they were at the scene of the crime only because they wanted to know what the commotion was all about. They claim that, in fact, Edwin called for a tricycle so Wilfredo could be brought to a hospital. To discredit the eyewitness testimony of Rachel, they presented Aniceta who testified that she and Rachel were out on that day selling doormats and only returned at 6:00 p.m. Thus, Rachel could not have witnessed the murder of Wilfredo.<br><br>Both lower courts, however, found the testimony of Rachel credible:<br><blockquote>This Court finds the testimony of Rachel clear and convincing. The testimony flows from a person who was present in the place where the killing occurred. They are replete with details sufficient to shift the burden of evidence to appellants. We have no reason to doubt Rachel’s credibility. Her candid account of the incident, standing alone, clearly established the components of the crime of murder. Appellants’ defense of denial, not sufficiently proven, cannot overcome the conclusions drawn from said evidence. We find no cogent reason to deviate from the findings and conclusions of the trial court. Rachel’s testimony was delivered in a firm, candid, and straightforward manner. There is no showing that Rachel wavered from the basic facts of her testimony, even when she was subjected to a rigorous examination.<br><br>Rachel was only ten (10) years old when she witnessed the murder of the victim. She testified in open court two (2) years later. Thus, she cannot be expected to give an error-free narration of the events that happened two years earlier. The alleged inconsistencies between her sworn statement and testimony referred to by appellants do not affect her credibility. What is important is that in all her narrations she consistently and clearly identified appellants as the perpetrators of the crime. Inconsistencies between the sworn statement and the testimony in court do not militate against witness’ credibility since sworn statements are generally considered inferior to the testimony in open court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br></blockquote>We find no error in the lower courts’ disposal of the issue.<br><br>Well-entrenched in jurisprudence is that the trial court's evaluation of the testimony of a witness is accorded the highest respect because of its direct opportunity to observe the witnesses on the stand and to determine if they are telling the truth or not.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> This opportunity enables the trial judge to detect better that thin line between fact and prevarication that will determine the guilt or innocence of the accused. That line may not be discernible from a mere reading of the impersonal record by the reviewing court. Thus, the trial judge's evaluation of the competence and credibility of a witness will not be disturbed on review, unless it is clear from the records that his judgment is erroneous.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>We have scrutinized the testimony of lone eyewitness, Rachel. Throughout her testimony, in her direct, cross and re-direct and re-cross examinations, she candidly recounted the events surrounding the killing of her father as follows:<br><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">PROS.

She was young and unschooled, but her narration of the incident was categorical, without wavering. It has no markings of a concocted story, impressed upon her by other people.<br><br>The defense, accused-appellants herein, tried to further discredit Rachel’s testimony by arguing that Rachel was a mere child who had studied only until the first grade of elementary school and could barely read, and did not know how to tell time.<br><br>We cannot take Rachel’s testimony lightly simply because she was a mere child when she witnessed the incident and when she gave her testimony in court. There is no showing that her mental maturity rendered her incapable of testifying and of relating the incident truthfully.<br><br>With exceptions provided in the Rules of Court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> all persons who can perceive, and perceiving, can make known their perception to others, may be witnesses. That is even buttressed by the Rule on Examination of a Child Witness which specifies that every child is presumed qualified to be a witness. To rebut this presumption, the burden of proof lies on the party challenging the child's competence. Only when substantial doubt exists regarding the ability of the child to perceive, remember, communicate, distinguish truth from falsehood, or appreciate the duty to tell the truth in court will the court, <i>motu proprio</i> or on motion of a party, conduct a competency examination of a child.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Thus, petitioners’ flimsy objections on Rachel’s lack of education and inability to read and tell time carry no weight and cannot overcome the clear and convincing testimony of Rachel as to who killed her father.<br><br>We likewise note that the line of questioning of the defense during cross-examination on the competency of Rachel to read and tell time did not distract her in recollecting how her father was attacked by accused-appellants. From her position underneath the house of her “<i>Kuya</i> Unyo,” she saw her father, Wilfredo, attacked by accused-appellants. Although she was astonished as the happening unfolded, her ability to perceive, remember, and make known her perception was not diminished.<br><br>As regards Aniceta’s version of the events that Jesus was the sole perpetrator of the crime who attacked Wilfredo only in self-defense, we easily see the fatal flaw: Aniceta arrived <b>after</b> the supposed fight between Wilfredo and Jesus, and what transpired was merely relayed to her by Jesus’ sister, Marilou.<br><br>Quite apparent from Aniceta’s narration of events is that she has no personal knowledge of Wilfredo’s killing. Aniceta’s testimony is mainly hearsay, specially on the purported fight between Wilfredo and Jesus that ended in Wilfredo’s death. Aniceta’s testimony as such carries no probative weight. At best, Aniceta’s testimony is an independent relevant statement: offered only as to the fact of its declaration and the substance of what had been relayed to Aniceta by Marilou, not as to the truth thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Section 36 of Rule 130 of the Rules of Court explicitly provides:<br><blockquote><b>SEC. 36.</b> <i>Testimony generally confined to personal knowledge; hearsay excluded</i>. – A witness can testify only to those facts which he knows of his personal knowledge; that is, which are derived from his own perception, except as otherwise provided in these rules.<br></blockquote>We detect a clever, albeit transparent ploy, to pin Jesus who had already fled and is temporarily out of reach of the law. Thus, with Jesus temporarily shielded from punishment, accused-appellants freely accuse and point to him as the sole perpetrator of the crime. This cannot trump the solid testimony of Rachel on accused-appellants’ direct participation in killing Wilfredo.<br><br>We likewise affirm the lower courts’ appreciation of the aggravating circumstance of treachery:<br><blockquote>[T]he essence of treachery is the sudden and unexpected attack by an aggressor without the slightest provocation on the part of the victim, depriving the latter of any real chance to defend himself, thereby ensuring its commission without risk to the aggressor. Treachery attended the killing of the victim because he was unarmed and the attack on him was swift and sudden. He had not means and there was no time for him to defend himself. Indeed, nothing can be more sudden and unexpected than when [petitioners] Edwin and Alfredo attacked the victim. The latter did not have the slightest idea that he was going to be attacked because he was urinating and his back was turned from his assailants. The prosecution was able to establish that [petitioners’] attack on the victim was without any slightest provocation on the latter’s part and that it was sudden and unexpected. This is a clear case of treachery.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br></blockquote>Finally, we affirm the lower court’s award of damages consistent with jurisprudence:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> (1) P50,000.00 as civil indemnity; (2) P25,000.00 as temperate damages; and (3) P50,000.00 as moral damages.

This award was taken back for having no anchor but the bare assertions of Wilfreda's wife that her husband earned P400.00 to P500.00 daily as a doormat vendor.<br><br>Section 2206 of the Civil Code provides the basis of damages for loss of earning capacity as follows:<br><blockquote>Article 2206. The amount of damages for death caused by a crime or quasi-delict shall be at least three thousand pesos, even though there may have been mitigating circumstances. In addition:<br><blockquote>(1) The defendant shall be liable for the loss of the earning capacity of the deceased, and the indemnity shall be paid to the heirs of the latter; such indemnity shall in every case be assessed and awarded by the court, unless the deceased on account of permanent physical disability not caused by the defendant, had no earning capacity at the time of his death[.]</blockquote></blockquote>As a <i>general rule</i>, this Court holds that "documentary evidence should be presented to substantiate a claim for loss of earning capacity [but] by way of <i>exception</i>, [this] may be awarded despite the absence of documentary evidence when (1) the deceased is self-employed and earning less than the minimum wage under current labor laws, in which case, judicial notice may be taken of the fact that in the deceased’s line of work, no documentary evidence is available; or (2) the deceased is employed as a daily wage worker earning less than the minimum wage under current labor laws.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>There have been occasions when We denied an award for unearned income unsupported by evidence except for the sole testimony by the spouse of the deceased.

The deceased were neither self-employed earning less than the minimum wage nor employed as daily wage workers earning less than the minimum wage. They were, in fact, capable of producing competent evidence such as income tax returns or receipts but failed to do so.<br><br>Wilfredo was a doormat vendor. His source of income was irregular and largely dependent on how many doormats he could sell in a day, if any. These doormats were peddled. They were not highly priced. It is most likely that Wilfredo did not file income tax returns nor issue official receipts. In any case, minimum wage earners are exempt from the payment of income tax.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Thus, they do not need to file an income tax return.<br><br>The <i>ponencia</i> recognized that Wilfredo’s occupation may fall under the first exception; that is, the deceased is self-employed and earning less than the minimum wage, and judicial notice may be taken of the fact that in his line of work, no documentary evidence is available. However, according to the <i>ponencia</i>, Rowena’s claim of P400.00 to P500.00 daily income is above the minimum wage for Region III whose minimum wage is below P400.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>In the 2000 case of <i>People v.

In fact, it would pass for minimum wage in the National Capital Region.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> I am of the view that evidence presented, if seen as credible by the trial court judge, should stand in the absence of clear basis to refute it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> The accused should have presented evidence to refute the evidence in chief presented.<br><br>In any event, this Court has, in the past, awarded temperate damages in lieu of an award for unearned income “where earning capacity is plainly established but no evidence was presented to support the allegation of the injured party’s actual income.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> P200,000.00 was awarded in the 2001 case of <i>People v. Singh</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> P500,000.00 in the 2004 case of <i>Victory Liner v.

OMC Carriers</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>The income-earning capacity of Wilfredo was never disputed. It would seem that P25,000.00 as temperate damages is too meager an amount for the loss suffered by Wilfredo’s heirs as a result of his untimely death in 2004.<br><br>Thus, I concur in affirming the lower courts in finding accused­ appellants guilty beyond reasonable doubt for the crime of murder, but I dissent in so far as the deletion of the award for loss of earning capacity in favor of the heirs ofWilfredo D.
