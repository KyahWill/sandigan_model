Further, it ruled that the official receipts under the name “Bonifacio GDE Water Corporation” were disallowed on the ground that the use of said business name by petitioner was never approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Thus, the court ruled as follows:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in the light of the foregoing, the Petition for Review is <b>PARTIALLY GRANTED</b>.

MOREOVER, A MERE PREPONDERANCE OF EVIDENCE WILL SUFFICE TO JUSTIFY THE GRANT OF A CLAIM. THE CTA <i>EN BANC</i> SANCTIONED THE USE OF A HIGHER STANDARD OF EVIDENCE IN A NON-CRIMINAL PROCEEDING.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></blockquote><br>Simply, the issue is whether or not the CTA <i>En Banc</i> erred in not granting petitioner’s claim for refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate in the amount of P65,642,814.65.<br><br>Petitioner contends that non-compliance with the invoicing requirements under the 1997 Tax Code does not automatically result in the denial of a claim for refund or tax credit when the same is supported by substantial evidence. It contends that the CTA <i>En Banc</i> erred in sustaining the ruling that petitioner is not entitled to a refund of the input VAT evidenced by official receipts in the name of “Bonifacio GDE Water Corporation.”<br><br>Petitioner further submits that the CTA erred in failing to properly apply the definition of capital goods and insists that services incurred in the construction and installation of capital assets and goods should be included in the cost of capital goods for purposes of determining the proper amount of refundable input VAT.<br><br>It also posits that respondent made an “informal judicial admission” and partially recognized its claims for excess input VAT on purchases of capital goods when Revenue District No. 44 issued a memorandum acknowledging,<i> inter alia,</i> that the input taxes claimed as refund were duly supported by valid VAT invoices and/or receipts.<br><br>Lastly, petitioner asserts that the CTA imposed an overly strict standard of evidence in disallowing petitioner’s invoices bearing the name “Bonifacio GDE Water Corporation.” It claims that the denial of the claim in its entirety based purely on technical grounds unduly deprives petitioner of a right granted by law and constitutes an undue deprivation of its property.<br><br>For its part, respondent argues that the instant petition raises purely questions of fact which is not allowed under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. He highlights the fact that the issue of whether or not petitioner was able to present substantial evidence to prove and support its claim for tax refund or tax credit calls for this Court to review and evaluate all the evidence to enable it to determine and resolve the issues raised by petitioner.<br><br>Moreover, respondent avers that the CTA <i>En Banc </i>committed no error in not applying the rules regarding judicial admissions, since no judicial admission was made by or was attributable to respondent, either in the pleadings or in the course of the trial proceedings. He argues that the admission made by a subordinate BIR official in support of the course of action which he had proposed or submitted for approval by his superior cannot by any stretch of imagination be considered an admission, much less a judicial admission, of the latter.<br><br>Finally, respondent stresses that the CTA <i>En Banc</i> did not err in using stricter rules of evidence in cases involving claims for tax refund or tax credit as the same are in the nature of tax exemptions and are regarded as in derogation of sovereign authority and to be construed <i>strictissimi juris</i> against the entity claiming the exemption.<br><br>We agree with respondent.<br><br>At the outset, it must be emphasized that an appeal by petition for review on <i>certiorari </i>cannot determine factual issues. In the exercise of its power of review, the Court is not a trier of facts and does not normally undertake the re-examination of the evidence presented by the contending parties during trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> However, although the rules provide for certain recognized exceptions,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> the circumstances surrounding the present case do not fall under any of them.<br><br>Assuming, however, that this Court can take cognizance of the instant case, it bears stressing that the arguments raised by petitioner have already been extensively discussed by both the CTA Second Division and the CTA <i>En Banc</i>, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Petitioner, in support of its first ground, argues that it has presented substantial evidence that unequivocally proved petitioner’s input VAT on purchases of capital goods from the 4<sup>th</sup> quarter of 1999 to the 4<sup>th</sup> quarter of 2000 as well as the fact that petitioner and Bonifacio GDE Corporation are one and the same entity.<br><br>We do not agree.<br><br>The change of name to Bonifacio GDE Corporation being unauthorized and without approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission, petitioner cannot now seek for a refund of input taxes which are supported by receipts under that name. This is pursuant to Sections 4.104-5 and 4.108-1 of Revenue Regulations No. 7-95 in relation to Sections 113 and 237 of the Tax Code, reproduced below for easy reference.<br><br>x x x x<br><br><b>The requisite that the receipt be issued showing the name, business style, if any, and address of the purchaser, customer or client is precise so that when the books of accounts are subjected to a tax audit examination, all entries therein could be shown as adequately supported and proven as legitimate business transactions. The absence of official receipts issued in the taxpayer’s name is tantamount to non-compliance with the substantiation requirements provided by law.</b><br><br>Petitioner cannot raise the argument that, <i>“non-compliance with the invoicing requirements under the 1997 NIRC, as amended, does not automatically result in the denial of a claim for refund or tax credit when the same is supported by substantial evidence” and that, “In civil cases, such as claims for refund, strict compliance with technical rules of evidence is not required. Moreover, a mere preponderance of evidence will suffice to justify the grant of a claim,</i>” in addition to its first ground in the instant petition. Taxpayers claiming for a refund or tax credit certificate must comply with the strict and mandatory invoicing and accounting requirements provided under the 1997 NIRC, as amended, and its implementing rules and regulations. Rules and regulations with regard to procedures are implemented not to be ignored or to be taken for granted, but are strictly adhered to for they are developed from the law itself. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></blockquote><br>From the foregoing, it is clear that petitioner must show satisfaction of all the documentary and evidentiary requirements before an administrative claim for refund or tax credit will be granted. Perforce, the taxpayer claiming the refund must comply with the invoicing and accounting requirements mandated by the Tax Code, as well as the revenue regulations implementing them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Thus, the change of petitioner’s name to “Bonifacio GDE Water Corporation,” being unauthorized and without approval of the SEC, and the issuance of official receipts under that name which were presented to support petitioner’s claim for tax refund, cannot be used to allow the grant of tax refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate in petitioner’s favor. The absence of official receipts issued in its name is tantamount to non-compliance with the substantiation requirements provided by law and, hence,&nbsp; the CTA <i>En Banc</i>’s partial grant of its refund on that ground should be upheld.<br><br>Also, petitioner’s allegation that some of the disallowed input taxes paid on services related to the construction of petitioner’s Waste Water Treatment and Water Sewerage Distribution Networks, should be included as part of its capital goods, must fail.
