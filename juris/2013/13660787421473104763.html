(Pepsi) is a domestic corporation engaged in the manufacturing, bottling and distribution of soft drink products.

It was also observed that LEPCEU-ALU failed to comply with the seven (7)-day strike vote notice requirement. However, the NLRC denied Pepsi’s prayer to declare loss of employment status of the union officers and members who participated in the strike for its failure to sufficiently establish the identity of the culpable union officers as well as their illegal acts;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>(3) In <b>NLRC RAB VIII Case No. 9-0459-00</b>, the NLRC ordered Pepsi to reinstate Remandaban to his former position without loss of seniority rights but without backwages considering the lack of evidence showing that he willfully intended to disregard the July 27, 1999 return-to-work order;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> and<br><br>(4) In <b>NLRC RAB VIII Case Nos. 9-0432-99 to 9-0458-99</b>, the NLRC dismissed respondents’ complaints for illegal dismissal for having been finally settled by the parties through the execution of quitclaim documents by the respondents in favor of Pepsi.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></blockquote><br>Respondents moved for reconsideration, mainly alleging that the NLRC erred when it declared that Pepsi’s retrenchment program was valid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> The motion was, however, denied by the NLRC in its Resolution dated September 15, 2003.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Aggrieved, respondents filed a petition for certiorari before the CA,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> imputing grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC when it upheld the validity of their retrenchment. They argued that the fact that Pepsi hired new employees as replacements right after retrenching forty-seven (47) of its workers negated the latter’s claim of financial losses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>&nbsp; In any event, the evidence was inadequate to prove that Pepsi did suffer from any economic or financial loss to legitimize its conduct of retrenchment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>In opposition, Pepsi pointed out that the respondents failed to assail the NLRC’s finding that the controversy was not about the validity of the retrenchment program but only about the underlying conflict regarding the selection of the employees to be retrenched; <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> hence, the latter fact should only remain at issue. Further, it claimed that its financial/business losses were sufficiently substantiated by the audited financial statements and other related evidence it submitted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br><center><b>The CA Ruling</b></center><br>On March 31, 2006, the CA issued a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> which reversed and set aside the NLRC’s ruling.<br><br>It observed that Pepsi could not have been in good faith when it retrenched the respondents given that they were chosen because of their union membership with LEPCEU-ALU. In this accord, it ruled that the subject retrenchment was invalid because there was no showing that Pepsi employed fair and reasonable criteria in ascertaining who among its employees would be retrenched.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Moreover, the CA held that Pepsi was guilty of ULP in the form of union busting as its retrenchment scheme only served to defeat LEPCEU-ALU’s right to self-organization. It also pointed out that the fact that Pepsi hired twenty-six (26) replacements and sixty-five (65) new employees right after they were retrenched contravenes Pepsi’s claim that the retrenchment was necessary to prevent further losses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Further, the CA pronounced that the respondents’ signing of the individual release and quitclaims did not have the effect of settling all issues between them and Pepsi considering that the same should have been read in conjunction with the September 17, 1999 Agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Finally, the CA upheld the validity of LEPCEU-ALU’s July 23, 1999 strike, ruling that LEPCEU-ALU “was sure to be the certified collective bargaining agent in the event that a certification election will be conducted” and thus, was authorized to conduct the aforesaid strike.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> It added that there was no need for LEPCEU-ALU to comply with the fifteen (15) day cooling-off period requirement given that the July 23, 1999 strike was conducted on account of union busting.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> In support thereof, the CA noted<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> that in a related case involving the same retrenchment incident affecting, however, other members of LEPCEU-ALU – entitled “<i>George C.

Notably, in Beraya, the NLRC ruled that Pepsi’s retrenchment program and the consequent dismissal of the retrenched employees were valid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Dissatisfied with the CA’s ruling, Pepsi moved for reconsideration which was, however, denied by the CA in its September 18, 2006 Resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Hence, the instant petition.<br><br><center><b>Issues Before the Court</b></center><br>As culled from the records, the following issues have been raised for the Court’s resolution: (1) whether the CA may reverse the factual findings of the NLRC; (2) whether respondents’ retrenchment was valid; (3) whether Pepsi committed ULP in the form of union busting; (4) whether respondents’ execution of quitclaims amounted to a final settlement of the case; and (5) whether Remandaban was illegally dismissed.<br><br><center><b>The Court’s Ruling</b></center><br>The petition is meritorious.<br><br><b><i>A.&nbsp; Appellate Court’s Evaluation<br>of the NLRC’s Findings</i></b><br><br>Pepsi contends that the CA erred in evaluating and examining anew the evidence and in making its own finding of facts when the findings of the NLRC have been fully supported by substantial evidence.&nbsp; It therefore claims that the validity of the corporate rightsizing program, integrity and binding effect of the executed quitclaims as well as the issues relating to union busting and ULP constitute factual matters which have already been resolved by the NLRC and are now beyond the authority of the CA to pass upon on <i>certiorari</i>.<br><br>In contrast, respondents aver that the CA was clothed with ample authority to review the factual findings and conclusions of the NLRC, especially in this case where the latter misappreciated the factual circumstances and misapplied the law.<br><br>Pepsi’s arguments are untenable.<br><br>Parenthetically, in a special civil action for <i>certiorari</i>, the CA is authorized to make its own factual determination when it finds that the NLRC gravely abused its discretion in overlooking or disregarding evidence which are material to the controversy. The Court, in turn, has the same authority to sift through the factual findings of both the CA and the NLRC in the event of their conflict. Thus, in <i>Plastimer Industrial Corporation v. Gopo</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup>&nbsp; the Court explained:<br><br><blockquote>In a special civil action for certiorari, the Court of Appeals has ample authority to make its own factual determination. Thus, the Court of Appeals can grant a petition for certiorari when it finds that the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion by disregarding evidence material to the controversy. To make this finding, the Court of Appeals necessarily has to look at the evidence and make its own factual determination. In the same manner, this Court is not precluded from reviewing the factual issues when there are conflicting findings by the Labor Arbiter, the NLRC and the Court of Appeals. x x x x (Citations omitted.)</blockquote><br>In this light, given the conflicting findings of the CA and NLRC in this case, the Court finds it necessary to examine the same in order to resolve the substantive issues.<br><br>Separately, it must be pointed out that the CA erred in resolving the issues pertaining to LEPCEU-ALU’s July 23, 1999 strike in its March 31, 2006 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> and September 18, 2006 Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> (in CA-G.R. SP No. 82354) considering that the parties therein – now, the respondents in this case – do not have any legal interest in the said issue. To be clear, <b>NLRC-RAB VIII Case Nos. 9-0432-99 to 9-0458-99</b> are the cases which involve herein respondents; their concern in those cases was the illegality of their retrenchment. On the other hand, the strike issue was threshed out in <b>RAB Case No. VIII-7-0301-99</b> which involved other members of LEPCEU-ALU. Although all these cases were subsumed under <b>NLRC Certified Case No. V-000001-2000</b>, the legality of the July 23, 1999 strike was not raised by the respondents in NLRC-RAB VIII Case Nos. 9-0432-99 to 9-0458-99. In view of these incidents, given that the CA has taken cognizance of a matter (i.e., the legality of the strike) where the parties (i.e., respondents) are devoid of any legal interest, the Court sees no reason to perpetuate the misstep and delve upon the same.<br><br><b><i>B.&nbsp; Validity of Retrenchment</i></b><br><br>Retrenchment is defined as the termination of employment initiated by the employer through no fault of the employee and without prejudice to the latter, resorted by management during periods of business recession, industrial depression or seasonal fluctuations or during lulls over shortage of materials. It is a reduction in manpower, a measure utilized by an employer to minimize business losses incurred in the operation of its business.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>Under Article 297 of the Labor Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> retrenchment is one of the authorized causes to validly terminate an employment. It reads:<br><br><blockquote>ART. 297. Closure of Establishment and Reduction of Personnel. – <b>The employer may also terminate the employment of any employee due to</b> the installation of labor saving devices, redundancy, <b>retrenchment to prevent losses</b> or the closing or cessation of operation of the establishment or undertaking unless the closing is for the purpose of circumventing the provisions of this Title, by serving a written notice on the workers and the Ministry of Labor and Employment at least one (1) month before the intended date thereof. In case of termination due to the installation of labor saving devices or redundancy, the worker affected thereby shall be entitled to a separation pay equivalent to at least his one (1) month pay or to at least one (1) month pay for every year of service, whichever is higher. In case of retrenchment to prevent losses and in cases of closure or cessation of operations of establishment or undertaking not due to serious business losses or financial reverses, the separation pay shall be equivalent to one (1) month pay or to at least one-half (1/2) month pay for every year of service, whichever is higher. A fraction of at least six (6) months shall be considered one (1) whole year. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>As may be gleaned from the afore-cited provision, to properly effect a retrenchment, the employer must: (a) serve a written notice both to the employees and to the DOLE at least one (1) month prior to the intended date of retrenchment; and (b) pay the retrenched employees separation pay equivalent to one (1) month pay or at least one-half (½) month pay for every year of service, whichever is higher.<br><br>Essentially, the prerogative of an employer to retrench its employees must be exercised only as a last resort, considering that it will lead to the loss of the employees' livelihood. It is justified only when all other less drastic means have been tried and found insufficient or inadequate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Corollary thereto, the employer must prove the requirements for a valid retrenchment by clear and convincing evidence; otherwise, said ground for termination would be susceptible to abuse by scheming employers who might be merely feigning losses or reverses in their business ventures in order to ease out employees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> These requirements are:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"><div align="JUSTIFY">(1)</div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="JUSTIFY">That retrenchment is reasonably necessary and likely to prevent business losses which, if already incurred, are not merely de minimis, but substantial, serious, actual and real, or if only expected, are reasonably imminent as perceived objectively and in good faith by the employer; </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">(2)</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">That the employer served written notice both to the employees and to the Department of Labor and Employment at least one month prior to the intended date of retrenchment;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">(3)</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">That the employer pays the retrenched employees separation pay equivalent to one (1) month pay or at least one-half (½) month pay for every year of service, whichever is higher;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">(4) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">That the employer exercises its prerogative to retrench employees in good faith for the advancement of its interest and not to defeat or circumvent the employees’ right to security of tenure; and</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">(5)</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">That the employer used fair and reasonable criteria in ascertaining who would be dismissed and who would be retained among the employees, such as status, efficiency, seniority, physical fitness, age, and financial hardship for certain workers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br>In due regard of these requisites, the Court observes that Pepsi had validly implemented its retrenchment program:<br><br>(1) Records disclose that both the CA and the NLRC had already determined that Pepsi complied with the requirements of substantial loss and due notice to both the DOLE and the workers to be retrenched. The pertinent portion of the CA’s March 31, 2006 Decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>In the present action, the NLRC held that PEPSI-COLA’s financial statements <i>are substantial evidence which carry great credibility and reliability viewed in light of the financial crisis that hit the country which saw multinational corporations closing shops and walking away, or adapting [sic] their own corporate rightsizing program</i>. Since these findings are supported by evidence submitted before the NLRC, we resolve to respect the same. x x x x<br><br>The notice requirement was also complied with by PEPSI-COLA when it served notice of the corporate rightsizing program to the DOLE and to the fourteen (14) employees who will be affected thereby at least one (1) month prior to the date of retrenchment. (Citations omitted)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup></blockquote><br>It is axiomatic that absent any clear showing of abuse, arbitrariness or capriciousness, the findings of fact by the NLRC, especially when affirmed by the CA – as in this case – are binding and conclusive upon the Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Thus, given that there lies no discretionary abuse with respect to the foregoing findings, the Court sees no reason to deviate from the same.<br><br>(2)&nbsp; Records also show that the respondents had already been paid the requisite separation pay as evidenced by the September 1999 quitclaims signed by them. Effectively, the said quitclaims serve <i>inter alia</i> the purpose of acknowledging receipt of their respective separation pays.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> Appositely, respondents never questioned that separation pay arising from their retrenchment was indeed paid by Pepsi to them. As such, the foregoing fact is now deemed conclusive.<br><br>(3) Contrary to the CA’s observation that Pepsi had singled out members of the LEPCEU-ALU in implementing its retrenchment program,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> records reveal that the members of the company union (<i>i.e.</i>, LEPCEU-UOEF#49) were likewise among those retrenched.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>Also, as aptly pointed out by the NLRC, Pepsi’s Corporate Rightsizing Program was a company-wide program which had already been implemented in its other plants in Bacolod, Iloilo, Davao, General Santos and Zamboanga.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> Consequently, given the general applicability of its retrenchment program, Pepsi could not have intended to decimate LEPCEU-ALU’s membership, much less impinge upon its right to self-organization, when it employed the same.<br><br>In fact, it is apropos to mention that Pepsi and its employees entered into a collective bargaining agreement on October 17, 1995 which contained a union shop clause requiring membership in LEPCEU-UOEF#49, the incumbent bargaining union, as a condition for continued employment. In this regard, Pepsi had all the reasons to assume that all employees in the bargaining unit were all members of LEPCEU-UOEF#49; otherwise, the latter would have already lost their employment. In other words, Pepsi need not implement a retrenchment program just to get rid of LEPCEU-ALU members considering that the union shop clause already gave it ample justification to terminate them. It is then hardly believable that union affiliations were even considered by Pepsi in the selection of the employees to be retrenched.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>Moreover, it must be underscored that Pepsi’s management exerted conscious efforts to incorporate employee participation during the implementation of its retrenchment program. Records indicate that Pepsi had initiated sit-downs with its employees to review the criteria on which the selection of who to be retrenched would be based. This is evidenced by the report of NCMB Region VIII Director Juanito Geonzon which states that “[Pepsi’s] [m]anagement conceded on the proposal to review the criteria and to sit down for more positive steps to resolve the issue.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>Lastly, the allegation that the retrenchment program was a mere subterfuge to dismiss the respondents considering Pepsi’s subsequent hiring of replacement workers cannot be given credence for lack of sufficient evidence to support the same.<br><br>Verily, the foregoing incidents clearly negate the claim that the retrenchment was undertaken by Pepsi in bad faith.<br><br>(5) On the final requirement of fair and reasonable criteria for determining who would or would not be dismissed, records indicate that Pepsi did proceed to implement its rightsizing program based on fair and reasonable criteria recommended by the company supervisors.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>Therefore, as all the requisites for a valid retrenchment are extant, the Court finds Pepsi’s rightsizing program and the consequent dismissal of respondents in accord with law.<br><br>At this juncture, it is noteworthy to mention that in the related case of <i>Beraya</i> – which involved the same retrenchment incident affecting the respondents, although litigated by other LEPCEU-ALU employees – the NLRC in a Decision dated November 24, 2003 had already pronounced that Pepsi’s retrenchment program was valid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> Subsequently, the petitioners in Beraya elevated the case via petition for <i>certiorari </i>to the CA<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> which was, however, denied in a Decision dated November 28, 2006.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> They appealed the said ruling to the Court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> which was equally denied through the Resolutions dated April 24, 2008<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> and August 4, 2008.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> The fact that the validity of the same Pepsi retrenchment program had already been passed upon and thereafter sustained in a related case, albeit involving different parties, behooves the Court to accord a similar disposition and thus, finally uphold the legality of the said program altogether.<br><br><b><i>C.&nbsp; Union Busting and ULP</i></b><br><br>Under Article 276(c) of the Labor Code, there is union busting when the existence of the union is threatened by the employer’s act of dismissing the former’s officers who have been duly-elected in accordance with its constitution and by-laws.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, the term unfair labor practice refers to that gamut of offenses defined in the Labor Code<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> which, at their core, violates the constitutional right of workers and employees to self-organization,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> with the sole exception of Article 257(f) (previously Article 248[f]).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup>&nbsp; As explained in the case of<i> Philcom Employees Union v.

(Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>Mindful of their nature, the Court finds it difficult to attribute any act of union busting or ULP on the part of Pepsi considering that it retrenched its employees in good faith. As earlier discussed, Pepsi tried to sit-down with its employees to arrive at mutually beneficial criteria which would have been adopted for their intended retrenchment. In the same vein, Pepsi’s cooperation during the NCMB-supervised conciliation conferences can also be gleaned from the records.&nbsp; Furthermore, the fact that Pepsi’s rightsizing program was implemented on a company-wide basis dilutes respondents’ claim that Pepsi’s retrenchment scheme was calculated to stymie its union activities, much less diminish its constituency. Therefore, absent any perceived threat to LEPCEU-ALU’s existence or a violation of respondents’ right to self-organization – as demonstrated by the foregoing actuations – Pepsi cannot be said to have committed union busting or ULP in this case.<br><br><b><i>D.&nbsp; Execution of Quitclaims</i></b><br><br>A waiver or quitclaim is a valid and binding agreement between the parties, provided that it constitutes a credible and reasonable settlement and the one accomplishing it has done so voluntarily and with a full understanding of its import.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> The applicable provision is Article 232 of the Labor Code which reads in part:<br><br><blockquote>ART. 232. Compromise Agreements. — Any compromise settlement, including those involving labor standard laws, voluntarily agreed upon by the parties with the assistance of the Bureau or the regional office of the Department of Labor, shall be <b><u>final and binding upon the parties</u></b>. x x x&nbsp; (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>In <i>Olaybar v. National Labor Relations Commission</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> the Court, recognizing the conclusiveness of compromise settlements as a means to end labor disputes, held that Article 2037 of the Civil Code, which provides that "[a] compromise has upon the parties the effect and authority of <i>res judicata</i>," applies suppletorily to labor cases even if the compromise is not judicially approved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br>In the present case, Pepsi claims that respondents have long been precluded from filing cases before the NLRC to assail their retrenchment due to their execution of the September 1999 quitclaims. In this regard, Pepsi advances the position that all issues arising from the foregoing must now be considered as conclusively settled by the parties.<br><br>The Court is unconvinced.<br><br>As correctly observed by the CA, the September 1999 quitclaims must be read in conjunction with the September 17, 1999 Agreement, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Both parties agree that the release of these benefits is <b>without prejudice to the filing of the case by the Union with the National Labor Relations Commission;</b><br><br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; The <b>Union undertakes to sign the Quitclaim but subject to the 2<sup>nd</sup> paragraph</b> of this Agreement. x x x (Emphasis and underscoring supplied) <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup></blockquote><br>The language of the September 17, 1999 Agreement is straightforward. The use of the term “subject” in the 3<sup>rd</sup> clause of the said agreement clearly means that the signing of the quitclaim documents was without prejudice to the filing of a case with the NLRC. Hence, when respondents signed the September 1999 quitclaims, they did so with the reasonable impression that that they were not precluded from instituting a subsequent action with the NLRC. Accordingly, it cannot be said that the signing of the September 1999 quitclaims was tantamount to a full and final settlement between Pepsi and respondents.<br><br><b><i>E.&nbsp; Dismissal of Remandaban</i></b><br><br>An illegally dismissed employee is entitled to either reinstatement, if viable, or separation pay if reinstatement is no longer viable, and backwages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> In certain cases, however, the Court has ordered the reinstatement of the employee without backwages considering the fact that (1) the dismissal of the employee would be too harsh a penalty; and (2) the employer was in good faith in terminating the employee. For instance, in the case of <i>Cruz v. Minister of Labor and Employment</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> the Court ruled as follows:<br><br><blockquote>The Court is convinced that petitioner's guilt was substantially established. Nevertheless, we agree with respondent Minister's order of reinstating petitioner without backwages instead of <b><u>dismissal which may be too drastic</u>. Denial of backwages would sufficiently penalize her for her infractions</b>. The bank officials acted in good faith. They should be exempt from the burden of paying backwages. <b>The <b>good faith of the employer</b>, when clear under the circumstances, may preclude or diminish recovery of backwages.</b> Only employees discriminately dismissed are entitled to backpay. x x x (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>Likewise, in the case of <i>Itogon-Suyoc Mines, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Commission</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> the Court pronounced that “[t]he ends of social and compassionate justice would therefore be served if private respondent is reinstated but without backwages in view of petitioner's good faith.”<br><br>The factual similarity of these cases to Remandaban’s situation deems it appropriate to render the same disposition.<br><br>As may be gathered from the September 11, 2002 NLRC Decision, while Remandaban was remiss in properly informing Pepsi of his intended absence, the NLRC ruled that the penalty of dismissal would have been too harsh for his infractions considering that his failure to report to work was clearly prompted by a medical emergency and not by any intention to defy the July 27, 1999 return-to-work order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> On the other hand, Pepsi’s good faith is supported by the NLRC’s finding that “the return-to-work-order of the Secretary was taken lightly by Remandaban.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> In this regard, considering Remandaban’s ostensible dereliction of the said order, Pepsi could not be blamed for sending him a notice of termination and eventually proceeding to dismiss him. At any rate, it must be noted that while Pepsi impleaded Remandaban as party to the case, it failed to challenge the NLRC ruling ordering his reinstatement to his former position without backwages. As such, the foregoing issue is now settled with finality.<br><br>All told, the NLRC’s directive to reinstate Remandaban without backwages is upheld.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.
