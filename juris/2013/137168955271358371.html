				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">For consideration is an appeal by appellant Manuel Tolentino <i>y</i> Catacutan from the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated 28 November 2008 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-H.C. No. 02505, affirming with modification the 15 September 2006 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Malolos, Bulacan, Branch 13, which found him guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape.<br><br>On 26 April 2000, appellant was charged in an Information which reads as follows:<br><br><blockquote>That on or about the 20<sup>th</sup> day of January, 2000, in the municipality of Baliuag, province of Bulacan, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously, with lewd designs, have carnal knowledge of the said [AAA],<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> 11 years of age, minor, against her will and without her consent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Appellant pleaded not guilty. Trial proceeded.<br><br>AAA’s and appellant’s families own separate watermelon stores located along a highway in Bulacan. Their stores are adjacent to each other. At around 3:00 a.m. of 20 January 2000, AAA, then 11 years old, was sleeping beside her 10-year old brother and 2-year old nephew inside the store when she was awakened by a mosquito bite and saw appellant lying on top of her. Her parents meanwhile were sleeping in an adjacent room. Appellant ordered AAA to follow him. AAA asked permission to urinate first before appellant brought her to a vacant lot at the back of the store. Appellant undressed her, laid on top of her and inserted his penis into her vagina while pointing a knife at her chest, and threatening to kill her family if she reports the incident. Afterwards, appellant took her earrings and watch and other valuables inside the house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>BBB, AAA’s mother, woke up at dawn and found their store in disarray. She immediately went out of the store and saw appellant, together with a certain Doro and Noel, inside a jeep. She asked Doro why the latter did not notice the robbing of her store and the person who did it. Before Doro could answer, BBB saw AAA stand up and say: “<i>Nanay, Nanay umalis na po tayo dito ninakaw po iyong hikaw ko, yung relo ko. Umalis na po tayo papatayin po tayo.”</i> It was at that point when AAA intimated to BBB that she was raped by appellant and who also threatened to kill her whole family. Upon learning of the rape incident, BBB fainted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> When she regained consciousness, there were already police officers inside the store.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>On the same day, AAA was brought to the Philippine National Police (PNP) Crime Laboratory to undergo medical examination. Dr. Ivan Richard Viray (Dr. Viray) conducted a physical examination on AAA.

He directed both parties to present their underwear for examination. He did not find any bloodstain on appellant’s underwear. He admitted that he caused the filing of the complaint against appellant despite his belief that appellant was innocent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Santiago further narrated that AAA told him that appellant had 2 or 3 <i>“bolitas”</i> or <i>“bukol”</i> (lump) in his private part. Santiago immediately examined appellant and found no lumps in his private part.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Appellant also testified on his behalf, raising denial and alibi as defenses. He denied raping AAA and averred that he slept from 8:00 p.m. of 19 January 2000 until he was awakened by the police between 3:00 to 4:00 a.m. of 20 January 2000. He was arrested and brought to the police station. He claimed that there was a feud between the two families.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> He later divulged that he recently almost got into a fistfight with appellant’s stepfather over the installation of electrical power.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Gloria Tolentino (Gloria), appellant’s mother, corroborated his son’s testimony. She recalled that while she was tending to her watermelon store at around 3:00 a.m., she saw appellant sleeping in a wooden bed. Gloria recounted that prior to the arrest, appellant and AAA’s stepfather had an altercation and almost came to blows over the installation of electrical power.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Luzviminda Francisco, appellant’s aunt, also attested to the claim of appellant that he was sleeping on the wooden bed in the store at around 3:00 a.m. of 20 January 2000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Lastly, Macario dela Cruz, neighbor of appellant, stated that he went to check on his chickens located some 5 meters away from appellant’s watermelon store at around 3:00 a.m. of 20 January 2000. He saw appellant sleeping on the wooden bed. He did not notice anything unusual at that time except when he saw the policemen come and arrest appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>On 15 September 2006, the RTC rendered a Decision with the following dispositive portion:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Court finds the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape as charged herein and hereby sentences him to suffer the penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA.<br><br>The accused is likewise directed to indemnify the private complainant in the amount of SEVENTY-FIVE THOUSAND (P75,000.00) PESOS.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></blockquote><br>The trial court found the victim’s accusation of rape as credible and found appellant guilty.<br><br>Appellant filed with the Court of Appeals a Notice of Appeal dated 19 September 2006.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>On 28 November 2008, the Court of Appeals promulgated a Decision, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the appealed decision of the Regional Trial Court of Bulacan (Malolos, Branch 13) is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATIONS in that the award of [P]75,000.00 as civil indemnity is REDUCED to [P]50,000.00 and that accused-appellant is further ordered to pay to AAA the sum of [P]50,000.00 as moral damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></blockquote>Appellant filed a Notice of Appeal on 18 December 2008.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Both parties opted not to file Supplemental Briefs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>In his Brief, appellant contends that the prosecution failed to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. He questions the credibility of the victim’s testimony. Appellant alleges that the victim’s testimony is “highly incredible [and] not in consonance with reason and common experience.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Appellant argues that based on AAA’s testimony, no force was employed in undressing AAA. Appellant emphasizes that the knife he allegedly used to threaten AAA was never found nor offered in evidence. Moreover, appellant stresses that AAA did not offer any resistance to the alleged rape and she did not try to escape from accused when she had the opportunity to do so. Under these circumstances, appellant submits that it is evident that the alleged threats were only imagined by AAA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>In the prosecution of rape cases, conviction or acquittal depends on the credence to be accorded to the complainant’s testimony because of the fact that usually, the participants are the only eyewitnesses to the occurrences. Thus, the issue ultimately leads to credibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>On this score, findings of fact of the trial court are not to be disturbed on appeal since conclusions as to the credibility of witnesses in rape cases depends heavily on the sound judgment of the trial court which is in a better position to decide the question, having heard the witnesses and observed their deportment and manner of testifying.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>The factual findings of the RTC are further strengthened by the affirmation of the Court of Appeals.<br><br>The legal adage that when a woman, especially a girl-child, says she had been raped, she says in effect all that is necessary to prove that rape was really committed, finds yet another application in this case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> The rationale of this jurisprudential principle is that, “no young woman, especially of tender age, would concoct a story of defloration, allow an examination of her private parts, and thereafter pervert herself by being subjected to public trial, if she was not motivated solely by the desire to obtain justice for the wrong committed against her.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>During the direct examination, AAA recounted the rape incident and positively identified appellant as the perpetrator, thus:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY">PROS.

Her sworn statement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> taken before the police station jived in all material details with her testimony during trial. Moreover, the medico-legal’s finding of fresh laceration bolstered AAA’s claim that she was raped only a few hours before she underwent medical examination.<br><br>AAA’s failure to shout for help, although her siblings were sleeping beside her and her parents were on the other room, does not detract from the credibility of her claims. She explained to the court’s satisfaction that appellant, while holding a knife, had threatened to kill her family if she reported the incident. An 11-year old child like AAA can only cower in fear and submission in the face of a real threat to her life and her family’s posed by an armed assailant.<br><br>Appellant’s alibi that he was sleeping at the time of the rape incident deserves scant consideration. It is an oft-repeated principle that alibi is an inherently weak argument that can be easily fabricated to suit the ends of those who seek its recourse. Thus, an alibi must be supported by the most convincing evidence – a credible corroboration from disinterested witnesses. Further, for alibi to prosper, appellants must prove not only that they were somewhere else when the crime was committed, but also that it was physically impossible for them to have been at the scene of the crime or within its immediate vicinity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Appellant’s alibi, in the case at bar, was corroborated by his relatives and a neighbor who are not considered impartial witnesses. Moreover, there was no showing that it was physically impossible for appellant to have been at the <i>locus criminis</i> at the time of the commission of the rape. Appellant was allegedly seen sleeping in a wooden bed in the store situated adjacent to the store of AAA with an estimated distance of only 8 meters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Alibi cannot prevail over the victim’s positive identification of the accused as the perpetrator of the crime,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> especially when the victim remained steadfast in her testimony when subjected to the rigors of cross- examination.<br><br>Under Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code, rape, which is punishable by <i>reclusion perpetua</i> is committed by having carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:<br><br><blockquote>1) By a man who have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">a) Through force, threat or intimidation;<br>b) When the offended party is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious;<br>c) By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority;<br>and<br>d) When the <b>offended party is under twelve (12) years of age</b> or is demented, even though none of the circumstances mentioned above be present. (Emphasis supplied).</div></blockquote><br>Hence, the trial court correctly imposed the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> for the rape of AAA, who was then under 12 years old, as evidenced by her birth certificate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> We increase the amount of moral damages and civil indemnity from P50,000.00 each to P75,000.00,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> considering that the crime committed is statutory rape. We additionally award exemplary damages in the amount of P30,000.00.
