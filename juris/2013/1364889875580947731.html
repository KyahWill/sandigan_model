Salapuddin (Salapuddin) in the amended information for multiple murder and multiple frustrated murder filed in Criminal Case No. Q-07-149982 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 83 in Quezon City.<br><br>The present controversy started on November 13, 2007 when, shortly after the adjournment of the day’s session in Congress, a bomb exploded near the entrance of the South Wing lobby of the House of Representatives (HOR) in the <i>Batasan </i>Complex, Quezon City.

During the course of the operation, a firefight ensued killing three persons: Bong, Redwan Indama (Redwan) and Saing Indama.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Meanwhile, Caidar Aunal (Aunal), Ikram Indama (Ikram) and Adham Kusain (Kusain)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> were arrested and then brought to Camp Crame in Quezon City. Several items were likewise seized from the premises, including two (2) Cal. 45 pistols, one motor vehicle plate number “8,” an I.D. of HOR issued to Ikram, and a black wallet with a GSIS ID card issued to Aunal with calling cards of Salapuddin.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> One of the Cal. 45 pistols found was traced back to Julham S. Kunam, Political Affairs Assistant of Salapuddin.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>On November 16, 2007, a day after the raid, Kusain executed a <i>Sinumpaang Salaysay</i>. In it, he stated that he is from Tipo-Tipo, Basilan and came to Manila in March 2005, staying when he first arrived in Manila in the house of Salapuddin, his father’s friend. Salapuddin paid for one year of his college education and helped him be employed as a building attendant at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport. He explained that he was in the house at Parkwood Hills because Redwan asked him to get the payment for his black XRM Honda motorcycle that Redwan took from his house on November 2, 2007. He claimed that Redwan did not disclose the purpose for which the motorcycle will be used and it was only after the raid that he learned that his motorcycle was the very same motorcycle used during the bombing at the <i>Batasan</i> Complex.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>On the same day, November 16, 2007, Ikram executed the first of his several affidavits (<i>Ikram’s first affidavit</i>). He stated that he is a driver working for Salapuddin since July 2002 and was staying in a house at 48-A Greenbucks, Filinvest St., Batasan Hills, Quezon City (Greenbucks), owned by Salapuddin, from June 2004 until he went home to Isabela City, Basilan in June 2007.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> He maintained that he returned to Manila on October 16, 2007. He stressed that before returning to Manila, or on October 9, 2007, his cousin Redwan talked to him about a mission to kill Congressman Akbar of Basilan by means of a bomb to be planted on a motorcycle. <b>He was not, however, informed of the reason for the mission or the identity of the person who gave the order</b>. He stated that upon arrival in Manila, he stayed at Greenbucks where the bombing was planned. He stated that those who took part in the planning of the bombing included: Redwan and his wife Saing; Jang, who was a cousin and member of the staff of Congressman Mujiv Hataman; Bong, who made the bomb; Aunal; and Kusain. On October 20, 2007, he and Aunal went home to Basilan and returned to Manila only on November 5, 2007. He also admitted bringing the motorcycle with the bomb to the HOR.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> He narrated that at 3:30 p.m. of November 13, 2007, he went to the <i>Batasan</i> premises on board a black Honda XRM with the bomb and parked it near the entrance of the South Wing lobby, at a spot reserved by Jang.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Later that day, he heard the bomb explode and received a text message from Jang confirming that it was the bomb he brought that exploded. He explained that it was Jang who set off the bomb by calling the cellphone attached to the bomb inside the motorcycle.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Jilbert C. Ortega, Chief of the Complaint and Investigation Unit of the HOR, likewise executed an affidavit on the same day, November 16, 2007, stating that in the morning of November 13, 2007, he noticed two men near the South Wing lobby of the HOR roaming around and seemingly surveying the premises. He identified Ikram as one of the two.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>On the basis of the sworn statements, a request for the conduct of inquest proceedings relative to the participation or involvement of Aunal, Ikram, Kusain, and Jang was made.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>On November 17, 2007, Salapuddin went to Camp Crame and voluntarily gave a sworn statement denying any knowledge of the <i>Batasan</i> bombing, asserting that his name was being used by the media only because of his relationship with the persons arrested in connection with the incident: Ikram was his former driver;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Aunal, his former brother-in-law, being a brother of his ex-wife whom he divorced under Muslim laws; and Kusain who once sought his assistance for employment. He clarified that he knew Redwan and Saing Indama only because they were members of the Moro National Liberation Front but denied knowing Bong. He stated that the individuals thus mentioned rarely visited him, and before the incident, he spoke only to Ikram, who was then working in his water refilling station in Basilan, when the latter asked permission to leave for Manila to look for better employment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> He explained that his house at Greenbucks is usually used by his constituents, including Kusain and Ikram, as a temporary residence or shelter whenever they are in Manila.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>As the police investigation prospered, Ikram executed several supplemental affidavits augmenting the statement he previously gave to the authorities. At 8:00 in the morning of November 18, 2007, Ikram narrated in his first supplemental affidavit<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> (<i>Ikram’s second affidavit</i>) that he, together with Aunal, Redwan, and Bong, planned the Batasan bombing on the night of October 17, 2007 at Greenbucks. On October 19, 2008, they all proceeded to Raon, Quiapo to shop for materials to make the bomb.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> He added that on October 25, 2007, he and Aunal went home to Basilan and returned to Greenbucks in Manila only on November 5, 2007. Bong made the bomb and placed it inside the toolbox of a Honda motorcycle in Greenbucks.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> The following day, they all transferred to Parkwood bringing the motorcycle with them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> It was in Parkwood where they completed the plan to kill Congressman Akbar.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>At 6:00 in the evening of the same day, November 18, 2007, Ikram executed another supplemental affidavit (<i>Ikram’s third affidavit</i>).<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"></span></span><sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</span></span></sup> There he stated that on October 13, 2007, when they were about to leave for Manila, he, Bong, Redwan and Aunal passed by Gersal Hardware owned by Salapuddin in Zamboanga City<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[</sup><sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">35</span></span></sup><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">]</sup> upon the prodding of one Bayan Judda, who handed them a bag. Redwan later informed him that the bag contained ingredients for explosives. They brought the bag with them to Greenbucks in Manila.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> On October 17, 2007, he, along with Bong, Redwan and Aunal, went to Quiapo to buy the wires needed to make a bomb.<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"></span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37</span></span></sup><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">]</sup> Thereafter, Bong made two bombs to be used in killing Congressman Akbar: one intended for the HOR premises and another for either his Valle Verde house or his condo unit in Ortigas. On October 22, 2007, Hajarun Jamiri (Jamiri), the ex-mayor of Tuburan, Basilan arrived at Greenbucks on board a black Suzuki motorcycle where the bomb intended for the Valle Verde house or the Ortigas condo will be placed. After Bong placed the bomb in his motorcycle, Jamiri left on board the same motorcycle.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> On November 10, 2007, Ikram went to Jamiri’s apartment in Malate, Manila to get money. During the said occasion, he saw the Suzuki motorcycle with the bomb parked inside Jamiri’s apartment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Notably, <b>Ikram, in his first three affidavits, never mentioned Salapuddin’s involvement, let alone implicate him, in the plan to kill Congressman Akbar. Ikram’s narration of events altogether changed in his third supplemental affidavit dated November 20, 2007</b> (<i>Ikram’s fourth affidavit</i>).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> There, Ikram alleged that, after receiving his last salary from the HOR, he worked for Salapuddin’s water refilling station in Isabela City as a delivery boy. In September 2007, before the Ramadan, Salapuddin asked him to fetch Redwan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Ikram complied and brought Redwan to Salapuddin’s house on the same day.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> He claimed that he was beside Redwan when Salapuddin ordered: “<i>Pateyun si Cong. Wahab Akbar.</i>”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Ikram saw Redwan again on October 9, 2007 when the latter told him about the mission in Manila to kill Congressman Akbar.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Ikram further narrated in his fourth affidavit that on October 13, 2007, he, Bong, Redwan and Aunal left Isabela City for Manila. In Manila, they stayed at Greenbucks owned by Salapuddin. Ikram also alleged in his affidavit that in the third week of October 2007, he and Redwan met with Hadjiman Hataman-Salliman (Jim Hataman) in a Figaro Coffee House in Ever Gotesco, Commonwealth Avenue, Quezon City (Figaro Café). During the said occasion, Ikram heard Jim Hataman tell Redwan of the plan to kill Congressman Akbar using a bomb. A week later, Redwan brought Ikram to the house of Congressman Mujiv Hataman (Congressman Hataman) in Filinvest II, Batasan Hills where Ikram heard Congressman Hataman order Redwan to kill Congressman Akbar. Ikram explained that Redwan was a cousin of the Hatamans.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>Ikram would later amend the dates mentioned in his earlier affidavits by executing an affidavit dated January 10, 2008<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> (<i>Ikram’s fifth affidavit</i>), where he made it appear that after bringing Redwan to Salapuddin’s house in Basilan, he and Redwan again saw each other on the night of September 5, 2007, not October 9, 2007.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> He declared, however, that Redwan talked to him about a mission to kill Congressman Akbar only on September 8, 2007,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> which was also the date that they started for Manila<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> and dropped by Salapuddin’s Gersal Hardware, not October 13, 2007.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> He added that they returned to Manila on September 11, 2007, not on October 16, 2007.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> <b>He declared that Bong made the bomb at Greenbucks on September 13, 2007, not October 18, 2007.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Inconsistently, however, he stated in the same affidavit that he, together with Aunal, Redwan and Bong, planned the Batasan bombing only on the night of September 17, 2007 at Greenbucks,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> then shopped in Raon for materials to make the bomb only on September 19, 2007.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> On September 17, 2007, not October 22, 2007, Jamiri supposedly went to Greenbucks to have his motorcycle fitted with a bomb.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Ikram also stated that he last saw Congressman Hataman in September 2007, not October 2007.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> He further declared that he and Aunal returned to Basilan on October 14, 2007, not October 20, 2007.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>Incongruously, however, Joel Maturan, the mayor of Ungkaya Pukan, Basilan, stated in his affidavit that he saw Ikram driving Salapuddin’s mini-truck in Lamitan, Basilan on September 20, 2007 and delivering water from Salapuddin’s water refilling station.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>On November 19, 2007, Jamiri was apprehended for illegal possession of firearm. The following day, or on November 20, 2007, he executed an affidavit where he narrated that during Ramadan, in the month of October,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> he brought a Suzuki motorcycle to Greenbucks on the instruction of Redwan. The latter requested Jamiri to leave the motorcycle behind so that he could place a bomb inside it. Jamiri returned the following day and was given instructions on how to remove the bomb from the motorcycle.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> In exchange for keeping the bomb, Redwan gave Jamiri PhP 50,000 with the promise of an additional PhP 500,000 should the bomb be actually used to kill Congressman Akbar when he dines at Sulo Hotel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> However, the bomb was never used as Jamiri failed to bring the motorcycle to the hotel on October 23, 2007.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> He admitted hiding the bomb in a house located at Leveriza Street, Pasay City and expressed his willingness to surrender it to the police.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> Pursuant to the undertaking he made in his affidavit, Jamiri accompanied and guided police authorities in retrieving an improvised explosive device at an apartelle located in Leveriza St., Malate, Manila on the same day he executed his affidavit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>In a supplemental affidavit,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> Jamiri added that during the last week of October 2007, Redwan called him from Figaro Café, in Ever Gotesco, Commonwealth Avenue, Quezon City and asked him to go to the same place. When he arrived at the café, Jamiri saw Redwan with Congressman Hataman and his brother Jim Hataman. Congressman Hataman then asked Jamiri to help Redwan in his “project” to kill Congressman Akbar.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> Jim Hataman thereafter interposed that the death of Congressman Akbar will bring peace to Basilan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>On November 22, 2007, Aunal executed his own affidavit<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> where he stated that he left Isabela City, Basilan for Manila on October 13, 2007 with Ikram, Redwan and Bong.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> They arrived in Manila on October 16, 2007 and proceeded to stay at Greenbucks.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> He recalled watching Bong assemble the two improvised bombs. He stated that when he asked about who their target was, Bong answered that it was Congressman Akbar. He explained that it had something to do with the politics in Basilan. Aunal likewise declared that Bong told him that the order to kill Congressman Akbar was made by Jim Hataman who vied for the congressional seat won by Congressman Akbar.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> Aunal himself heard Jim Hataman order Redwan to kill Congressman Akbar one evening in October 2007 when they were in Figaro Café.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> He and Ikram then went back to Basilan during the last week of October and came back to Manila in the first week of November.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> On November 13, 2007, Ikram brought one of the improvised bombs, hidden inside a motorcycle, to the<i><i> Batasan</i></i> premises where Jang detonated it, killing Congressman Akbar.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>Based on the affidavits of Jamiri, Ikram, and Aunal, Police Superintendent Asher Dolina indorsed a letter dated November 29, 2007 to then Chief State Prosecutor Zuño requesting the inclusion of Salapuddin, Congressman Hataman, Jim Hataman and Police Officer 1 (PO1) Bayan Judda in the complaints for murder and multiple frustrated murder.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> After conducting preliminary investigation, the Chief State Prosecutor approved a Resolution dated December 6, 2007 where he: (1) found probable cause to indict Aunal, Ikram, and Kusain for multiple murder and violation of Presidential Decree No. 1829; (2) recommended the conduct of further investigation for their indictment for multiple frustrated murder; and (3) recommended the conduct of preliminary investigation as to the other respondents who were not under detention.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br>In the meantime, upon the request of the relatives and counsel of the accused, Dr. Benito Molino (Dr. Molino)<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</span></span></sup> conducted in the presence of investigators from the Commission on Human Rights a medical examination of the detained on December 1, 4, and 7, 2007. The results: Kusain, Aunal and Jamiri were subjected to physical and mental torture.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> In particular, Dr. Molino found that “the injuries found on the skin and private parts of Mr. Jamiri two weeks after his claimed ordeal that he received countless blows all over his body in spite of being sick with diabetes, hit by a blunt object on his head and his shins and that electric current was applied to his private parts while being interrogated as to his knowledge and participation in the Batasan bombing x x x are consistent. In his case, the three elements of torture are present.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> Similarly, he found that both Aunal and Kusain “underwent severe physical injuries and subjected to deep emotional stress x x x intentionally inflicted by men believed to be officers of the CIDG [Criminal Investigation and Detection Group] x x x to get information from [them].”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br><br>On December 10, 2007, Jamiri executed an affidavit withdrawing and disavowing the statements he made in his previous affidavits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> He alleged that he was not carrying any weapon, much less an explosive, when arrested. He was merely walking when six men suddenly arrested him, forced him to a van, and blindfolded him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> He was thereafter tortured and forced to sign an affidavit on November 20, 2007, not knowing its contents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> On the same day, he was forcibly brought to an apartment in Leveriza Street, Manila where the police found a bomb. He was thereafter forced to admit that it was he who placed the bomb in the apartment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> He was again prevailed upon by Mayor Tahira Ismael of Sumisip, Basilan to sign another affidavit when the latter told him that the Hatamans and Salapuddin were out to kill his wife and children.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> He claimed that the contents of the affidavits he was forced to sign were all fabricated by the police.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br><br>On December 12, 2007, Kusain and Aunal executed their respective affidavits of recantation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> Both stated that they were coerced to sign their confessions after they were subjected to physical and psychological torture.

Rather, despite this, it has his hands written all over it. The circumstances, the people and place used are all, [in] one way or another, associated with him. It cannot be mere coincidence.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> On the other hand, the resolution dismissed the charge as against Julham Kunam, Congressman Hataman, and Jim Hataman. So the DOJ Investigating Panel found, “their participation as conspirators in the grand scheme is unstable x x x apart from the statements implicating respondents Mujiv Hataman and Hadjiman Hataman-Salliman, no other evidence was presented to sufficiently establish their involvement in the crime.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup><br><br>On March 7, 2008, Salapuddin filed a Petition for Review of the Supplemental Resolution with the Office of the Secretary of Justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> The Investigating Panel, Salapuddin rued, refused to give probative weight to the incriminating statements of Ikram with respect to the Hataman brothers, but relied on the very same statements in finding probable cause to indict him. Moreover, he maintained that there is no evidence independent of Ikram’s statements that will support the finding of probable cause to indict him for murder and multiple frustrated murder.<br><br>On April 23, 2008, the Secretary of Justice issued a Resolution excluding Salapuddin from the Information for the complex crime of murder and frustrated murder, thus modifying the Supplemental Resolution of the Investigating Panel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> The Secretary of Justice predicated his modificatory action on the interplay of the following premises: the only material evidence against Salapuddin is the statements of Ikram.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> However, Ikram’s statements are laden with irreconcilable inconsistencies and contradictions that they cannot be considered worthy of belief.<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"></span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96</span></span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"></span></sup><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">]</sup> What is more, the Secretary added, “there is nothing on record that will indicate that x x x Salapuddin performed the overt acts of the offense charged.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> The Secretary of Justice observed that the statements of the other accused cannot be given weight as they were obtained through force and intimidation contrary to the Constitution and were in fact later recanted.<br><br>In a Petition for Certiorari dated May 13, 2008, herein respondents Jum Akbar and Nor-Rhama Indanan questioned the Secretary of Justice’s Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> before the CA, the recourse docketed as CA-G.R.

Prosecuting officers under the power vested in them by the law, not only have the authority but also the duty of prosecuting persons who, according to the evidence received from the complainant, are shown to be guilty of a crime committed within the jurisdiction of their office. <b><u>They have equally the duty not to prosecute when the evidence adduced is not sufficient to establish a <i>prima facie</i> case.</u></b> (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote></blockquote><br>This broad authority of prosecutors, however, is circumscribed by the requirement of a conscientious conduct of a preliminary investigation for offenses where the penalty prescribed by law is at least 4 years, 2 months and 1 day.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup> This rule is intended to guarantee the right of every person to be free from “the inconvenience, expense, ignominy and stress of defending himself/herself in the course of a formal trial, until the reasonable probability of his or her guilt has been passed upon”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> and to guard the State against the “burden of unnecessary expense and effort in prosecuting alleged offenses and in holding trials arising from false, frivolous or groundless charges.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup><br><br>Hence, even at this stage, the investigating prosecutors are duty-bound to sift through all the documents, objects, and testimonies to determine what may serve as a relevant and competent evidentiary foundation of a possible case against the accused persons.

Otherwise, the conduct of a preliminary investigation would be rendered worthless; the State would still be forced to prosecute frivolous suits and innocent men would still be unnecessarily dragged to defend themselves in courts against groundless charges.

Certainly, this is not sufficient basis for finding probable cause to indict them for a non-bailable crime.

The Secretary cannot plausibly be found culpable of grave abuse of his discretion. The appellate court has committed a reversible error in holding otherwise. As a matter of fact, the CA has failed to capture the import of Our ruling in <i>People v.

The appellate court held:<br><br><blockquote>[T]he totality of evidence sufficiently indicates the probability that Salapuddin lent moral and material support or assistance to the perpetrators or assistance to the perpetrators in the commission of the crime.<br><br>Jurisprudence teaches that ‘it is necessary that a conspirator should have performed some overt acts as a direct or indirect contribution in the execution of the crime planned to be committed.’ However, this overt act may consist of active participation in the actual commission of the crime itself, <u><i>or it may consist of moral assistance to his co-conspirators</i></u> <b><i>by</i> being present at the commission of the crime</b> or <i><i>by exerting moral ascendancy over the other co-conspirators</i></i> x x x.

Hence, <b>it is necessary that a conspirator should have performed some overt acts as a direct or indirect contribution in the execution of the crime planned to be committed</b>. The overt act may consist of active participation in the actual commission of the crime itself, or it may consist of moral assistance to his co-conspirators by being present at the commission of the crime or by exerting moral ascendancy over the other co-conspirators.<br><br><b>Conspiracy transcends mere companionship</b>, it denotes an intentional participation in the transaction with a view to the furtherance of the common design and purpose x x x.

He cannot, therefore, be properly accused of exerting an “overt act” by extending “assistance” to whoever was responsible for the commission of the felony.<br><br>Furthermore, the very cases the appellate court cited provide that while conspiracy can be proven by circumstantial evidence, the series of evidence presented to establish an accused’s participation in the conspiracy <b>must be consistent</b> and should lead to no other conclusion but his participation in the crime as a conspirator.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[147]</sup> After all, the conspiracy itself must be proved as positively as the commission of the felony itself, for it is a “facile device by which an accused may be ensnared and kept within the penal fold.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[148]</sup><br><br>The confession of Ikram relied on by investigating prosecutors and the appellate court does not provide the threshold consistent picture that would justify Salapuddin’s complicity in the conspiracy that led to the <i>Batasan</i> bombing. Consider: Ikram made the allegation regarding Salapuddin’s participation in the conspiracy in his fourth affidavit, after he categorically denied knowing who the mastermind was. In his affidavit dated November 16, 2007, Ikram gave the following answers to the questions thus indicated:<br><br><blockquote>T: Bakit nyo daw papatayin si Wahab Akbar?<br><br>S: Hindi po sa amin pinaalam.<br><br>x x x x<br><br><b>T: Alam mo ba kung sino ang nagutos sa inyo para patayin si Wahab Akbar?&nbsp; </b><br><br><b>S: <u>Hindi po</u></b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[149]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>He did not correct this statement in the two affidavits he executed on November 18, 2007.

Ikram also alleged that Jamiri went to Greenbucks on September 17, 2007,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[161]</sup> but Jamiri claims that he went to Greenbucks during Ramadan in the month of October.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[162]</sup> Inconsistently, Ikram further claims that he saw the Hatamans at Figaro Café during the last week of September 2007, but Jamiri and Aunal both stated in their respective affidavits that the meeting with the Hatamans took place in the latter part of October 2007.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[163]</sup><br><br>The discrepancies in Ikrams’ affidavits and the variations in the statements of the other accused do not persuade this Court to find probable cause that Salapuddin, who was indicted primarily because of Ikram’s confession, was part of the conspiracy that led to the <i>Batasan</i> bombing. Instead, while We are not pre-empting the findings of the trial court with regard to Ikram, Aunal, Jamiri and Kusain, the variations and the inconsistencies contained in their affidavits lend credence to their allegations of torture and coercion, especially as these allegations are supported by medical reports prepared by an independent medical practitioner who was assisted by the personnel of the Human Rights Commission.<br><br>It must not be neglected that strict adherence to the Constitution and full respect of the rights of the accused are essential in the pursuit of justice even in criminal cases. The presumption of innocence, and all rights associated with it, remains even at the stage of preliminary investigation. It is, thus, necessary that in finding probable cause to indict a person for the commission of a felony, only those matters which are constitutionally acceptable, competent, consistent and material are considered. No such evidence was presented to sufficiently establish the probable cause to indict Salapuddin for the non-bailable offenses he is accused of. It, thus, behooves this Court to relieve petitioner from the unnecessary rigors, anxiety, and expenses of trial, and to prevent the needless waste of the courts’ time and the government’s resources.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the instant petition is <b>GRANTED</b> and the Decision dated August 6, 2008 and Resolution dated October 16, 2008 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
