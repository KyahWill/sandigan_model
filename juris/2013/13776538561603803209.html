				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Art has traditionally been viewed as the expression of everything that is true, good and beautiful.&nbsp; As such, it is perceived to evoke and produce a spirit of harmony.&nbsp; Art is also considered as a civilizing force, a catalyst of nation-building.&nbsp; The notion of art and artists as privileged expressions of national culture helped shape the grand narratives of the nation and shared symbols of the people.&nbsp; The artist does not simply express his/her own individual inspiration but articulates the deeper aspirations of history and the soul of the people.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>&nbsp; The law recognizes this role and views art as something that “reflects and shapes values, beliefs, aspirations, thereby defining a people’s national identity.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>&nbsp; If unduly politicized, however, art and artists could stir controversy and may even cause discord, as what happened in this case.<br><br><center><b><i><u>The Antecedents</u></i></b><br></center><br><b><i>History of the Order of National Artists</i></b><br><br>On April 27, 1972, former President Ferdinand E.

In the same issuance, Fernando Amorsolo was declared as the first National Artist.<br><br>On May 15, 1973, Proclamation No. 1144<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> was issued.&nbsp; It amended Proclamation No. 1001 “by creating a National Artists Awards Committee” that would “administer the conferment of the category of National Artist” upon deserving Filipino artists.&nbsp; The Committee, composed of members of the Board of Trustees of the CCP, was tasked to “draft the rules to guide its deliberations in the choice of National Artists, to the end that those who have created a body of work in the arts and letters capable of withstanding the test of time will be so recognized.”<br><br>The authority of the National Artists Awards Committee to administer the conferment of the National Artist Award was again reiterated in Presidential Decree No. 208<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> issued on June 7, 1973.<br><br>On April 3, 1992, Republic Act No. 7356, otherwise known as the <i>Law Creating the National Commission for Culture and the Arts,</i> was signed into law.&nbsp; It established the National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA) and gave it an extensive mandate over the development, promotion and preservation of the Filipino national culture and arts and the Filipino cultural heritage.&nbsp; The NCCA was tasked with the following:<br><br><blockquote>Sec.&nbsp; 8. <i>The Commission</i>. – A National Commission for Culture and Arts is hereby created to formulate policies for the development of culture and arts; implement these policies in coordination with affiliated cultural agencies; coordinate the implementation of programs of these affiliated agencies; administer the National Endowment Fund for Culture and Arts (NEFCA); encourage artistic creation within a climate of artistic freedom; develop and promote the Filipino national culture and arts; and preserve Filipino cultural heritage. The Commission shall be an independent agency. It shall render an annual report of its activities and achievements to the President and to Congress.</blockquote><br>Among the specific mandates of the NCCA under Republic Act No. 7356 is to “extend recognition of artistic achievement through awards, grants and services to artists and cultural groups which contribute significantly to the Filipino’s cultural legacy.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>&nbsp; In connection with this mandate, the NCCA is vested with the power to “advise the President on matters pertaining to culture and the arts, including the creation of a special decoration or award, for persons who have significantly contributed to the development and promotion of Philippine culture and arts.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>As both the CCP Board of Trustees and the NCCA have been mandated by law to promote, develop and protect the Philippine national culture and the arts, and authorized to give awards to deserving Filipino artists, the two bodies decided to team up and jointly administer the National Artists Award.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>&nbsp; Thereafter, they reviewed the guidelines for the nomination, selection and administration of the National Artists Award.&nbsp; Pursuant to their respective powers to draft and promulgate rules, regulations and measures to guide them in their deliberations in the choice of National Artists, the CCP and NCCA adopted the following revised guidelines in September 2007<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td style="font-weight: bold;" width="3%"><div align="JUSTIFY">4. </div></td> <td style="font-weight: bold;" colspan="3"><div align="JUSTIFY">ADMINISTRATION OF THE AWARD</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td style="font-weight: bold;"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td style="font-weight: bold;" width="4%"><div align="JUSTIFY">4.1. </div></td> <td style="font-weight: bold;" colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY">The National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA) shall plan, organize and implement the Order of National Artists in coordination with the Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP).</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">4.2.</div></td> <td colspan="2"> <div align="JUSTIFY">It shall enlist the support and cooperation of private sector experts from the various fields of art to ensure that the awards are implemented in a successful and impartial manner.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">4.3. </div></td> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY">The National Artist Award Secretariat shall commission art experts to form a Special Research Group who shall verify information submitted on nominees and provide essential data.

Moreover, the name of Dr. Santos as National Artist for Music was deleted from the final list submitted by the NCCA and the CCP Boards without clearly indicating the basis thereof.&nbsp; For petitioners, the President’s discretion to name National Artists cannot be exercised to defeat the recommendations made by the CCP and NCCA Boards after a long and rigorous screening process and with the benefit of expertise and experience.&nbsp; The addition of four names to the final list submitted by the Boards of the CCP and the NCCA and the deletion of one name from the said list constituted a substitution of judgment by the President and a unilateral reconsideration without clear justification of the decision of the First, Second and Final Deliberation Panels composed of experts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Petitioners further argue that the choice of respondent Guidote-Alvarez was illegal and unethical because, as the then Executive Director of the NCCA and presidential adviser on culture and arts, she was disqualified from even being nominated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>&nbsp; Moreover, such action on the part of the former President constituted grave abuse of discretion as it gave preferential treatment to respondent Guidote-Alvarez by naming the latter a National Artist despite her not having been nominated and, thus, not subjected to the screening process provided by the rules for selection to the Order of National Artists.&nbsp; Her inclusion in the list by the President represented a clear and manifest favor given by the President in that she was exempted from the process that all other artists have to undergo.&nbsp; According to petitioners, it may be said that the President used a different procedure to qualify respondent Guidote-Alvarez.&nbsp;

The award of the Order of National Artists is the exclusive prerogative of the President who is not bound in any way by the recommendation of the NCCA and the CCP Boards.&nbsp; The implementing rules and regulations or guidelines of the NCCA cannot restrict or limit the exclusive power of the President to select the recipients of the Order of National Artists.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>For her part, in a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> dated March 11, 2010, respondent Guidote-Alvarez manifested that she was waiving her right to file her comment on the petition and submitted herself to the Court’s discretion and wisdom.<br><br>Respondent Mañosa manifested that his creations speak for themselves as his contribution to Filipino cultural heritage and his worthiness to receive the award.&nbsp;

The implementing rules and regulations of Executive Order No. 236, s. 2003, recognized the binding character of the recommendation of the NCCA and the CCP Boards and limited the authority of the Committee on Honors to the determination that (1) there has been no grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NCCA and the CCP Boards in making the nomination, and (2) the nominee is in good standing. Where a nomination meets the said two criteria, a recommendation to the President to confer the award shall be made.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>The OSG further argued that, while the President exercises control over the NCCA and the CCP, the President has the duty to faithfully execute the laws, including the NCCA-CCP guidelines for selection of National Artists and the implementing rules of Executive Order No. 236, s. 2003.&nbsp; Moreover, the laws recognize the expertise of the NCCA and the CCP in the arts and tasked them to screen and select the artists to be conferred the Order of National Artists.&nbsp; Their mandate is clear and exclusive as no other agency possesses such expertise.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>The OSG also assailed the former President’s choice of respondent Guidote-Alvarez for being contrary to Republic Act No. 7356.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup>&nbsp;

To ensure the exclusivity of the membership in the Order, a rigid nomination and screening process has been established with different sets of renowned artists and respected art critics invited to sit as the Council of Experts for the First and Second Deliberation Panels.&nbsp; Moreover, all living National Artists are given a voice on who should be included in their exclusive club as they automatically become members of the Final Deliberation Panel that will vote on who should be included in the final list to be submitted to the President for conferment of the Order of National Artists.&nbsp; To allow the untrammeled discretion and authority of the President to confer the Order of National Artists without regard to the stringent screening and rigorous selection process established by the NCCA and the CCP will diminish, if not negate, the exclusive nature of the said Order.&nbsp; It will unduly subject the selection and conferment of the Order of National Artists to politics rather than to principles and procedures.&nbsp; It will subvert the transparent and rigorous process and allow entry to the exclusive Order of National Artists through a secret backdoor of lobbying, back channeling and political accommodation.<br><br>Among the other petitioners, Prof. Gemino Abad presents a unique valid personal and substantial interest.&nbsp; Like respondents Caparas, Mañosa and Moreno, he was among the 87 nominees for the 2009 Order of National Artists.&nbsp; Like respondent Moreno, he made it to the preliminary shortlist.&nbsp; As he did not make it to the second shortlist, he was not considered by the Final Deliberation Panel, more so by the former President.<br><br>It should be recalled too that respondent Guidote-Alvarez was&nbsp;

Yet, the four of them were treated differently and considered favorably when they were exempted from the rigorous screening process of the NCCA and the CCP and conferred the Order of National Artists.&nbsp; The Committee on Honors and the former President effectively treated respondents Guidote-Alvarez, Caparas, Mañosa and Moreno as a preferred class.&nbsp; The special treatment accorded to respondents Guidote-Alvarez, Caparas, Mañosa and Moreno fails to pass rational scrutiny.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup>&nbsp; No real and substantial distinction between respondents and petitioner Abad has been shown that would justify deviating from the laws, guidelines and established procedures, and placing respondents in an exceptional position.&nbsp;

While petitioner Abad cannot claim entitlement to the Order of National Artists,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> he is entitled to be given an equal opportunity to vie for that honor.&nbsp; In view of the foregoing, there was a violation of petitioner Abad’s right to equal protection, an interest that is substantial enough to confer him standing in this case.<br><br>As regards the other concerned artists and academics as well as the CAP, their claim of deep concern for the preservation of the country’s rich cultural and artistic heritage, while laudable, falls short of the injury in fact requirement of standing.&nbsp;

The Committee on Honors</i></b><br><br>The Committee on Honors serves as a National Awards Committee. It is composed of the following:<br><blockquote>The Executive Secretary, Chairman<br>The Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Vice-Chairman<br>Head, Presidential Management Staff, member<br>Presidential Assistant for Historical Affairs, member<br>Chief of Presidential Protocol, member<br>Chief of Protocol, DFA, member</blockquote>All nominations from the various awards committees must be submitted to the Committee on Honors via the Chancellery of Philippine Orders and State Decorations. The Chancellery shall process nominations for the consideration of the Committee on Honors. The Committee on Honors shall screen and recommend these nominations to the President.<br><br><b>The Committee on Honors shall, as a general rule, serve as a screening committee to ensure that nominations received from the various awards committees meet two tests: that there has not been an abuse of discretion in making the nomination, and that the nominee is in good standing. Should a nomination meet these criteria, a recommendation to the President for conferment shall be made.</b><br><br>The President of the Philippines takes the recommendations of the Committee on Honors in the highest consideration when making the final decision on the conferment of awards. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>Pursuant to the above provision of the implementing rules of Executive Order No. 236, s. 2003, the authority of the Committee on Honors is limited to determining whether the nominations submitted by a particular awards committee, in this case, the joint NCCA and CCP Boards, have been tainted by abuse of discretion, and whether the nominees are in good standing.&nbsp; Should the nominations meet these two criteria, the Committee on Honors shall make a recommendation to the President for conferment of the Order of National Artists.<br><br>In view of the various stages of deliberation in the selection process and as a consequence of his/her duty to faithfully enforce the relevant laws, the discretion of the President in the matter of the Order of National Artists is confined to the names submitted to him/her by the NCCA and the CCP Boards.&nbsp; This means that the President could not have considered conferment of the Order of National Artists on any person not considered and recommended by the NCCA and the CCP Boards.&nbsp; That is the proper import of the provision of Executive Order No. 435, s. 2005, that the NCCA and the CCP “shall advise the President on the conferment of the Order of National Artists.”&nbsp; Applying this to the instant case, the former President could not have properly considered respondents Guidote-Alvarez, Caparas, Mañosa and Moreno, as their names were not recommended by the NCCA and the CCP Boards.&nbsp; Otherwise, not only will the stringent selection and meticulous screening process be rendered futile, the respective mandates of the NCCA and the CCP Board of Trustees under relevant laws to administer the conferment of Order of National Artists, draft the rules and regulations to guide its deliberations, formulate and implement policies and plans, and undertake any and all necessary measures in that regard will also become meaningless.<br><br>Furthermore, with respect to respondent Guidote-Alvarez who was the Executive Director of the NCCA at that time, the Guidelines expressly provides:<br><br><blockquote>6.5&nbsp; NCCA and CCP Board members and consultants and NCCA and CCP officers and staff are automatically disqualified from being nominated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup></blockquote><br>Respondent Guidote-Alvarez could not have even been nominated, hence, she was not qualified to be considered and conferred the Order of National Artists at that time.&nbsp; The President’s discretion on the matter does not extend to removing a legal impediment or overriding a legal restriction.<br><br>From the foregoing, the advice or recommendation of the NCCA and the CCP Boards as to the conferment of the Order of National Artists on Conde, Dr. Santos, Francisco and Alcuaz was not binding on the former President but only discretionary or optional for her whether or not to act on such advice or recommendation.&nbsp; Also, by virtue of the power of control, the President had the authority to alter or modify or nullify or set aside such recommendation or advice.&nbsp; It was well within the President’s power and discretion to proclaim all, or some or even none of the recommendees of the CCP and the NCCA Boards, without having to justify his or her action.&nbsp; Thus, the exclusion of Santos did not constitute grave abuse of discretion on the part of the former President.<br><br>The conferment of the Order of National Artists on respondents Guidote-Alvarez, Caparas, Mañosa and Moreno was an entirely different matter.<br><br>There is grave abuse of discretion when an act is (1) done contrary to the Constitution, the law or jurisprudence or (2) executed whimsically, capriciously or arbitrarily, out of malice, ill will or personal bias.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br><br>There was a violation of the equal protection clause of the Constitution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> when the former President gave preferential treatment to respondents Guidote-Alvarez, Caparas, Mañosa and Moreno.&nbsp; The former President’s constitutional duty to faithfully execute the laws and observe the rules, guidelines and policies of the NCCA and the CCP as to the selection of the nominees for conferment of the Order of National Artists proscribed her from having a free and uninhibited hand in the conferment of the said award.&nbsp; The manifest disregard of the rules, guidelines and processes of the NCCA and the CCP was an arbitrary act that unduly favored respondents Guidote-Alvarez, Caparas, Mañosa and Moreno.&nbsp; The conferment of the Order of National Artists on said respondents was therefore made with grave abuse of discretion and should be set aside.<br><br>While the Court invalidates today the proclamation of respondents Guidote-Alvarez, Caparas, Mañosa and Moreno as National Artists, such action should not be taken as a pronouncement on whether they are worthy to be conferred that honor.&nbsp; Only the President, upon the advise of the NCCA and the CCP Boards, may determine that.&nbsp; The Court simply declares that, as the former President committed grave abuse of discretion in issuing Proclamation Nos. 1826 to 1829 dated July 6, 2009, the said proclamations are invalid.&nbsp; However, nothing in this Decision should be read as a disqualification on the part of respondents Guidote-Alvarez, Caparas, Mañosa and Moreno to be considered for the honor of National Artist in the future, subject to compliance with the laws, rules and regulations governing said award.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is hereby <span style="font-weight: bold;">GRANTED in PART</span>.

It is the minimal level of scrutiny which requires that the challenged classification is rationally related to serving a legitimate State interest. It is used when the government action is a type of discrimination that does not warrant the intermediate and strict levels of scrutiny. The intermediate or middle-tier test requires the government to show that (1) the challenged classification serves an important State interest, and (2) the classification is at least substantially related to serving that interest. It is applied to suspect classifications like gender or illegitimacy. The most demanding is the strict scrutiny test which requires the government to show that (1) the challenged classification serves a compelling State interest, and (2) the classification is necessary to serve that interest. It is used in classifications based on race, national origin, religion alienage, denial of the right to vote, access to courts and other rights recognized as fundamental.
