Lastly, she asserted that despite her marriage to Richard and exercise of profession in Metro Manila, she continued to maintain her residency in Ormoc City which was the place where she was born and raised.<br><br>During the preliminary conference, and as shown in the Preliminary Conference Order dated September 2, 2010, the parties agreed on the following issues for resolution:·<br><br><blockquote><ol><li>Whether or not the instant petition for <i>quo warranto</i> is meritorious;<br></li><li>Whether or not the substitution of respondent is valid;<br></li><li>Whether or not a petition for <i>quo warranto</i> can be used as a substitute for failure to file the necessary petition for disqualification wid1 the COMELEC;<br></li><li>Whether or not respondent's COC was duly subscribed;and<br></li><li>Whether or not respondent is ineligible for the position of Representative of the Fourth District of Leyte for lack of residency requirement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></li></ol></blockquote><br><center><b>Ruling of the HRET</b></center><br>After due proceedings, the HRET issued the assailed March 22, 2012 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> which dismissed the <span style="font-style: italic;">quo warranto</span> petition and declared that private respondent was a qualified candidate for the position of Leyte Representative (Fourth Legislative District).

Hence, it held that the substitution of private respondent in lieu of Richard was legal and valid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Also, it upheld the validity of private respondent's CoC due to petitioner's failure to controvert her claim that: she was personally known to the notary public who notarized her CoC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Finally, the HRET ruled that while it had been admitted that private respondent resides in Colgate Street, San Juan City and lived in San Rafael, Bulacan, the fact was she continued to retain her domicile in Ormoc City given that her absence therefrom was only temporary.<br><br>Hence, the instant petition.<br><br><center><b>Issues Before the Court</b></center><br>The crux of the present controversy is whether or not . the HRET gravely abused its .discretion in finding that Richard was validly substituted by private respondent as candidate for Leyte Representative (Fourth Legislative District) in view of the former's failure to meet the one (1) year residency requirement provided under Section 6, Article VI of the Constitution.<br><br>It is petitioner's submission that the HRET gravely abused its discretion when it upheld the validity of private respondent's substitution despite contrary jurisprudence holding that substitution is impermissible where the substituted candidate's CoC was denied due course to and/or cancelled, as in the case of Richard.

Distinction between a petition for <br>disqualification and a petition to deny <br>due course to/cancel a certificate of<br> candidacy</i></b><br><br>The Omnibus Election Code<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> (OEC) provides for certain remedies to assail a candidate's bid for public office. Among these which obtain particular significance to this case are: (1) a. petition for disqualification under Section 68; and (2) a petition to deny due course to and/or cancel a certificate of candidacy under Section 78. The distinctions between the two are well-perceived.<br><br>Primarily, a disqualification case under· Section 68 of e OEC is hinged on either: (<i>a</i>) a candidate's possession of a permanent resident status in a foreign country;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> or (<i>b</i>) his or her commission of certain acts of disqualification. Anent the latter, the prohibited acts under Section 68 refer to election offenses under the OEC, and not to violations of other penal laws.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> In particular, these are: (1) giving money or other material consideration to influence, induce or corrupt the voters or public officials performing electoral functions; (2) committing acts of terrorism to enhance one's candidacy;.(3) spending in one's election campaign an amount in excess of that allowed by the OEC; (4) soliciting, receiving or making any contribution prohibited under Sections 89, 95, 96, 97 and 104 of the OEC; and (5) violating Sections 80,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> 83,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> 85<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> 86<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> and 261, paragraphs d,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> e<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> k,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> v,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> and cc, sub-paragraph 6<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> of the OEC. Accordingly, the same provision (Section 68) states that any candidate who, in an action or protest in which he or she is a party, is declared by final decision of a competent court guilty of, or found by the COMELEC to have committed any of the foregoing acts shall be disqualified from continuing as a candidate for public office, or disallowed from holding the same, if he or she had already been elected.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>It must be stressed that one who is disqualified under Section 68 is still technically considered to have been a candidate, albeit proscribed to continue as such only because of supervening infractions which do not, however, deny his or her statutory eligibility. In other words, while the candidate's compliance with the eligibility requirements as prescribed by law, such as age, residency, and citizenship, is not in question, he or she is, however, ordered to discontinue such candidacy as a form of penal sanction brought about by the commission of the above-mentioned election offenses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> <br></sup><br>On the other hand, a denial of due course to and/or cancellation of a CoC proceeding under Section 78 of the OEC<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> is premised on a person's misrepresentation of any of the material qualifications required for the elective office aspired for. It is not enough that a person lacks the relevant qualification; he or she must have also made a false representation of the same in the CoC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> The nature of a Section 78 petition was discussed in the case of <i>Fermin v. COMELEC</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> where the Court illumined:<br><br><blockquote>Lest it be misunderstood, the denial of due course to or the cancellation of the CoC is not based on the lack of qualifications but on a finding that the candidate made a material representation that is·false, which may relate to the qualifications required of the public office he/she is running for. It is noted that the candidate states in his/her CoC that he/she is eligible for the office he/she seeks. <b>Section 78 of the OEC, therefore. is to be re.ad in relation to · the constitutional and statutory provisions on qualifications or eligibility for public office. <u>If the can idate subsequently states a material representation in the CoC that is false, the COMELEC, following the law, is empowered to deny due course to or cancel such certificate</u></b>. Indeed, the Court has already likened a proceeding under Section 78 to a quo warranto proceeding under Section 253 of the OEC since they both deal with the eligibility or qualification of a candidate, with the distinction mainly in the fact that a "Section 78" petition is filed before proclamation, while a petition for quo warranto is filed after proclamation of the winning candidate. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Corollary thereto, it must be noted that the deliberateness of the misrepresentation, much less one's intent to defraud, is of bare significance in a Section 78 petition as it is enough that the person's declaration of a material qualification in the CoC be false. In this relation, jurisprudence holds that an express finding that the person committed any deliberate misrepresentation is of little consequence in the determination .of whether one's CoC should be deemed cancelled or not.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> What remains material is that the petition essentially seeks to deny due course to and/or cancel the CoC on the basis of one's ineligibility and that the same be granted without any qualification.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Pertinently, while a disqualified candidate under Section 68 is still considered to have been a candidate for all intents and purposes, on the other hand, a person whose CoC had been denied due course to and/or cancelled under Section 78 is deemed to have not been a candidate at all. The reason being is that a cancelled CoC is considered void <i>ab initio</i> and thus, cannot give rise to a valid candidacy and necessarily, to valid votes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> In <i>Talaga v. COMELEC</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> (<i>Talaga</i>), the Court ruled that:<br><br><blockquote>x x x x While a person who is disqualified under Section 68 is merely prohibited to continue as a candidate, a person whose certificate is cancelled or denied due course under Section 78 is not treated as a candidate at all, as if he/she never filed a CoC.</blockquote><br>The foregoing variance gains utmost importance to the present case considering its implications on candidate substitution.<br><br><b><i>B. Valid CoC as a condition sine <br>qua non for candidate substitution&nbsp; </i></b><br><br>Section 77 of the OEC provides that if an official candidate of a registered or accredited political party dies, withdraws or is disqualified for any cause, a person belonging " to and certified by the same political party may file a CoC to replace the candidate who died, withdraw or was disqualified. It states that:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 77. Candidates in case of death, disqualification or withdrawal of another. -If after the last day for the filing of certificates of candidacy, an <b>official candidate</b> of a registered or accredited political party dies, withdraws or is disqualified for any cause, only a person belonging to, and certified by, the same political party may file a certificate of candidacy to replace the candidate o died, withdrew or was disqualified. (Emphasis supplied)'<br></blockquote><br>Evidently, Section 77 requires that there be an "official candidate" before candidate substitution proceeds. Thus, whether the ground for substitution is death, withdrawal or disqualification of a candidate, the said section unequivocally states that only an official candidate of a registered or accredited party may be substituted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>As defined under Section 79(a) of the OEC, the term "candidate" refers to any person aspiring for or seeking an elective public office <b>who has filed a certificate of candidacy</b> by himself or through an accredited political party, aggroupment, or coalition of parties. Clearly, the law requires that one must have validly filed a CoC in order to be considered a candidate. The requirement of having a CoC obtains even greater importance if one considers its nature. In particular, a CoC formalizes not only a person's public declaration to run for office but evidences as well his or her statutory eligibility to be elected for the said post. In <i>Sinaca v. Mula</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> the Court has illumined:<br><br><blockquote>A certificate of candidacy is in the <b>nature of a formal manifestation</b> to the whole world of the candidate's political creed or lack of political creed. <b>It is a statement of a person seeking to run for a public office certifying that he announces his candidacy for the_ office mentioned <u>and</u> that he is eligible for the office</b>, the name of the political party to which he belongs, if he belongs to any, and his post-office address for all election purposes being as well stated. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied.)</blockquote><br>In this regard, the CoC is the document which formally accords upon a person the status of a candidate. In other words, absent a valid CoC one is not considered a candidate under legal contemplation. As held in <i>Talaga</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br><blockquote>x x x a person's declaration of his intention to run for public office and his affirmation that he possesses the eligibility for the position he seeks to assume, followed by the timely filing of such declaration, constitute <b>a valid CoC that render the person making the declaration a valid or official candidate</b>. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Considering that Section 77 requires that there be a candidate in order for substitution to take place, as well as the precept that a person without a valid CoC is not considered as a candidate at all, it necessarily follows that if a person's CoC had been denied due course to and/or cancelled, he or she cannot be validly substituted in the electoral · process. The existence of a valid CoC is therefore a condition<i> sine qua non</i> for a disqualified candidate to be validly substituted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br><b><i>C. Divergent effects of disqualification <br>and denial of due course to and/or<br> cancellation of CDC cases vis-a-vis<br> candidate substitution</i></b><br><br>Proceeding from the foregoing discourse, it is evident that there lies a clear-cut distinction between a disqualification case under Section 68 and denial of due course to and/or cancellation of COC case under Section 78 vis-a-vis their respective effects on candidate substitution under Section 77.<br><br>As explained in the case of<i> Miranda v. Abaya</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> (<i>Miranda</i>), a candidate who is disqualified under Section 68 can be validly substituted pursuant to Section 77 because he remains· a candidate until disqualified; but a person whose CoC has been denied due course to and/or cancelled under Section 78 cannot be substituted because he is not considered a candidate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Stated differently, since there would be no candidate to speak of under a denial of due course to and/or cancellation of a CoC case, then there would be no candidate to be substituted; the same does not obtain, however, in a disqualification case since there remains to be a candidate to be substituted, although his or her candidacy is discontinued.<br><br>On this note, it is equally revelatory that Section 77 expressly enumerates the instances where substitution is permissible, that is when an official candidate of a registered or accredited political party <b>"dies, withdraws or is <u>disqualified for any cause</u>.</b>" Noticeably, material misrepresentation cases are not included in the said section and therefore, cannot be a valid basis to proceed with candidate substitution.<br><br><b><i>D. Application to the case at bar</i></b><br><br>In this case, it is undisputed that Richard was disqualified to run in the May 10, 2010 elections due to his failure to comply with the one year residency requirement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> The confusion, however, stemmed from the use of the word "disqualified" in the February 17, 2010 Resolution of the COMELEC First Division, which was adopted by the COMELEC <i>En Banc</i> in granting substitution of private respondent, and even further perpetuated by the HRET in denying the <i>quo warranto</i> petition.&nbsp; In short, a finding that Richard was merely disqualified- and not that his CoC was denied due course to and/or cancelled -would mean that he could have been validly substituted by private respondent, thereby legitimizing her candidacy.<br><br>Yet the fact that the COMELEC First Division's February 17, 2010 Resolution did not explicitly decree the denial of due course to and/or cancellation of Richard's CoC should not have obviated the COMELEC <i>En Banc</i> from declaring the invalidity of private respondent's substitution. It should be stressed that the clear and unequivocal basis for Richard's "disqualification" is his failure to comply with the residency requirement under Section 6, Article VI of the Constitution which is a ground for the denial of due course to and/or cancellation a CoC under Section 78 of the OEC, not . for disqualification.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> As earlier mentioned, the material misrepresentation contemplated under a Section 78 petition refers to statements affecting one's qualifications for elective office such as age, <b><i>residence</i></b> and citizenship or non-possession of natural-born Filipino status.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup>&nbsp; T<b><u>here is therefore no legal basis to support a finding of disqualification within the ambit of election laws</u></b>. Accordingly, given Richard's non­ compliance with the one year residency requirement, it cannot be mistaken that the COMELEC First Division's unqualified grant of Juntilla's "Verified Petition to Disqualify Candidate for Lack of Qualification"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> - which prayed that the COMELEC declare Richard "DISQUALIFIED and INELIGIBLE from seeking the office of Member of the House of Representatives" and "x x x <b><u>that [his] Certificate of Candidacy x x x be DENIED DUE COURSE and/or CANCELLED</u></b>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> - carried with it the denial of due course to and/or cancellation of Richard's CoC pursuant to Section 78.<br><br>Case law dictates that if a petition prays for the denial of due course to and/or cancellation of CoC and the same is granted by the COMELEC without any qualification, the cancellation of the candidate's CoC is in order. This is precisely the crux of the <i>Miranda</i> ruling wherein the Court, in upholding the COMELEC <i>En Banc's</i> nullification of the substitution in that case, decreed that the COMELEC Division's unqualified grant of the petition necessarily included the denial of due course to and/or cancellation of the candidate's CoC, notwithstanding the use of the term "disqualified" in the COMELEC Division's resolution, as the foregoing _was prayed for in the said petition:<br><br><blockquote>The question to settle next is whether or not aside from Joel "Pempe" Miranda being disqualified ·by the COMELEC in its May 5, 1998 resolution, his certificate of candidacy had likewise been denied due course and cancelled.<br><br>The Court rules that it was.<br><br>Private respondent's petition in SPA No. 98-019 specifically prayed for the following:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, it is respectfully prayed that the Certificate of Candidacy filed by respondent for the position of Mayor for the City of Santiago <b><u>be not given due course and/or cancelled</u></b>. <br><br>Other reliefs just and equitable in the premises are likewise prayed for.</blockquote><br>In resolving the petition filed by private respondent specifying a very particular relief, the COMELEC ruled favorably in the following manner:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the Commission (FIRST DIVISION) <b><u>GRANTS the Petition</u></b>. Respondent JOSE "Pempe" MIRANDA is hereby <b><u>DISQUALIFIED</u></b> from running for the position of mayor of Santiago City, Isabela, in the May 11, 1998 national and local elections.<br><br>SO ORDERED.</blockquote><br>From a plain reading of the dispositive portion of the COMELEC resolution of May 5, 1998 in SPA No. 98-019, <b><u>it is sufficiently clear that the prayer specifically and particularly sought in the petition was GRAN.TED, there being no qualification on the matter whatsoever</u></b>.

It is rather clear, therefore, that whether or not the COMELEC granted any further relief in SPA No. 98-019 by disqualifying the candidate, <b>the fact remains that the said petition was granted and that the certificate of candidacy of Jose "Pempe" Miranda was denied due course and cancelled</b>.(Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br><br>The same rule was later discussed in the case of <i>Talaga, viz</i>:<br><br><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="TOP" width="40%"><div align="JUSTIFY">3.

(Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>In view of the foregoing rulings; the COMELEC <i>En Banc</i> direly misconstrued the COMELEC First Division's February 17, 2010 Resolution when it adopted the Law Department's finding that Richard was only "disqualified" and that his CoC was not denied due course to and/or cancelled, paving the way for the approval of private respondent's substitution. It overlooked the fact that the COMELEC First Division's ruling encompassed the cancellation of Richard's CoC and in consequence, disallowed the substitution of private respondent. It was therefore grave and serious error on the part of the COMELEC <i>En Banc</i> to have approved private respondent's substitution.<br><br>Consequently, in perpetuating the COMELEC <i>En Banc</i>'s error as above-discussed, the HRET committed a grave abuse of discretion, warranting the grant of the instant petition.<br><br>Fundamental is the rule that grave. abuse of discretion arises when a lower court or tribunal patently violates the Constitution, the law or existing jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> While it is well-recognized that the HRET has been empowered by the Constitution to be the "sole judge" of all contests relating to the election, returns, and qualifications of the members of the House, the Court maintains jurisdiction over it to check "whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction" on the part of the latter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> In other words, when the HRET utterly disregards the law and settled precedents on the matter before it, it commits a grave abuse of discretion.<br><br>Records clearly show that: (1) Richard was held ineligible as a congressional candidate for the Fourth District of Leyte due to his failure to comply with the one year residency requirement; (2) Juntilla's petition prayed for the denial of due course to and/or cancellation of his CoC; and (3) the COMELEC First Division granted the foregoing petition without any qualification.&nbsp; By these undisputed and essential facts alone, the HRET should not have adopted the COMELEC <i>En Banc 's</i> erroneous finding that the COMELEC First Division's February 17, 2010 Resolution "speaks [only] of "disqualification and not of cancellation of [Richard's] CoC"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> and thereby, sanctioned the substitution of private respondent.<br><br>Lest it be misunderstood, the HRET is not bound by previous COMELEC pronouncements relative to the qualifications of the Members of the House. Being the sole judge<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> of all contests relating to the election, returns, and <i>qualifications</i> of its respective members, the HRET cannot be tied down by COMELEC resolutions, else its constitutional mandate<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> be circumvented and rendered nugatory. Instructive on this point is the Court's disquisition in Fernandez v. HRET,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Private respondent concludes from the above that petitioner had no legal basis to claim that the HRET, when reference to the qualification/s of Members of the House of Representatives is concerned, is "co-equal", to the COMELEC, such that the HRET cannot disregard any ruling of COMELEC respecting · the matter of eligibility and qualification of a member of the House of Representatives.&nbsp; <b><u>The truth is the other way around, because the COMELEC is subservient to the HRET when the dispute or contest at issue refers to the eligibility and/or qualification of a Member of the House of Representatives</u></b>. A petition for <i>quo warranto</i> is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the HRET as sole judge, and cannot be considered forum shopping <b><u>even if another body may have passed upon in administrative or quasi-judicial proceeding the issue of the Member's qualification while the Member was still a candidate</u></b>.&nbsp; There is forum-shopping only when two cases involve the same parties and the same cause of action.&nbsp; The two cases here are distinct and dissimilar in their nature and character.&nbsp; (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>Notably, the phrase "election, returns, and qualifications" should be interpreted in its totality as referring to all matters affecting the validity of the contestee's title. More particularly, the term "qualifications" refers to matters that could be raised in a <i>quo warranto</i> proceeding against the pro­ claimed winner, such as his disloyalty or ineligibility, or the inadequacy of his certificate of candidacy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> As used in Section 74 of the OEC, the word "eligible" means having the right to run for elective public office, that is, having all the qualifications and none of the ineligibilities to run for the public office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> In this relation, private respondent's own qualification to run for public office- which was inextricably linked to her husband's own qualifications due to her substitution - was the proper subject of <i>quo warranto</i> proceedings falling within the exclusive jurisdiction of the HRET and independent from any previous proceedings before the COMELEC, lest the jurisdictional divide between the two be blurred.<br><br>Nonetheless, it must be pointed out that the HRET's independence is not without limitation. As earlier mentioned, the Court retains<i> certiorari </i>jurisdiction over the HRET if only to check whether or not it has gravely abused its discretion. In this regard, the Court does not endeavor to denigrate nor undermine the HRET's independence; rather, it merely fulfills its duty to ensure that the Constitution and the laws are upheld through the exercise of its power of judicial review.<br><br>In fine, the Court observes· that the HRET wantonly disregarded the law by deliberately adopting the COMELEC <i>En Banc'</i>s flawed findings regarding private respondent's eligibility to run for public office which essentially stemmed from her substitution. In this light, it cannot be gainsaid that the HRET gravely abused its discretion. <br><br>Owing to the lack of proper substitution .in this case, private respondent was therefore not a <i>bona fide</i> candidate for the position of Representative for the Fourth District of Leyte when she ran for office, which means that she could' not have been elected. Considering this pronouncement, there exists no cogent reason to further dwell on the other issues respecting private respondent's own qualification to office.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.&nbsp; Accordingly the March 22, 2012 Decision rendered by the House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal in HRET Case No. 10-031 (QW) is hereby <b>REVERSED </b>and <b>SET ASIDE.</b><br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Sereno, C.J.

The proclamation of respondent Gomez has become incontrovertible or unassailable after the expiration of ten (10) days from its date.<br><br><b>No factual basis to cancel the certificate of candidacy.</b><br><br>The lack of jurisdiction on the part of the HRET to entertain the untimely Petition for <i>Quo Warranto </i>assailing the proclamation of private respondent Gomez would suffice to dismiss outright the instant petition. Moreover, the substantive issue extensively discussed in the <i>ponencia</i> of the Honorable Associate Justice Estela Perlas Bernabe, particularly as to the "divergent effects of disqualification and denial of due course to and/or cancellation of COC (Certificate of Candidacy) cases vis-a-vis candidate substitution" is inappropriate.<br><br>Firstly, the certificate of candidacy of Richard Gomez, the husband of respondent Gomez, was not cancelled by the COMELEC.<br><br>Secondly, the decision by the COMELEC not to cancel said certificate of candidacy was proper as the COMELEC did not reach any finding that Richard Gomez <b>deliberately </b>committed a misrepresentation, which is a requisite for the cancellation of a certificate of candidacy under Section 78 of the Omnibus Election Code. In <i>Mitra v. Commission on Elections</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> the Court ruled:<br><br><blockquote><b>Section 74</b>, in relation to <b>Section 78</b>, of the Omnibus Election Code (<i>OEC</i>) governs the cancellation of, and grant or denial of due course to, COCs. The combined application of these sections requires that the candidate's stated facts in the COC be true, under pain of the COC's denial or cancellation if any false representation of a material fact is made.<br><br>x x x<br><br>The false representation that these prov1s10ns mention must necessarily pertain to a material fact.&nbsp; The critical material facts are those that refer to a candidate's qualifications for elective office, such as his or her citizenship and residence. The candidate's status as a registered voter in the political unit where he or she is a candidate similarly falls under this classification as it is a requirement that, by law (the Local Government Code), must be reflected in the COC. The reason for this is obvious: the candidate, if he or she wins, will work for and represent the political unit where he or she ran as a candidate.<br><br>The false representation under Section 78 must likewise be a "<b>deliberate attempt to mislead, misinform, or hide a fact</b> that would otherwise render a candidate ineligible."&nbsp; Given the purpose of the requirement, it must be made with the intention to deceive the electorate as to the would-be candidate's qualifications for public office. Thus, the misrepresentation that Section 78 addresses cannot be the result of a mere innocuous mistake, and cannot exist in a situation where the intent to deceive is patently absent, or where no deception on the electorate results. The deliberate character of the misrepresentation necessarily follows from a consideration of the consequences of any material falsity: a candidate who falsifies a material fact cannot run; if he runs and is elected, he cannot serve; in both cases, he can be prosecuted for violation of the election laws.<br><br><b>Based on these standards, we find that Mitra did not commit any&nbsp; deliberate material&nbsp; misrepresentation in his&nbsp; COC</b>. The COMELEC gravely abused its discretion in its appreciation of the evidence, leading it to conclude that Mitra is not a resident of Aborlan, Palawan. <b>The COMELEC, too, failed to critically consider whether Mitra deliberately attempted to mislead, misinform or hide a fact </b>that would otherwise render him ineligible for the position of Governor of Palawan. (Emphases supplied and citations omitted.)</blockquote><br>The <i>ponencia</i> of Justice Bernabe indulged in the legal fiction that the certificate of candidacy of Richard Gomez was cancelled when it in fact was not. Neither can the Court now on its own decree such cancellation in the absence of any factual basis or evidentiary support for a finding that Richard Gomez committed a "deliberate attempt to mislead, misinform, or hide a fact that would otherwise render [him] ineligible."<br><br><b>Substitution was valid</b>.<br><br>Since the COMELEC did not cancel the certificate of candidacy of Richard Gomez but only disqualified him from running in the elections, the substitution by respondent Gomez of Richard Gomez squarely falls within the ambit of Section 77 of the Omnibus Election Code (OEC), which uses the broad language "disqualification for any cause," as follows:<br><br><blockquote><b>Section 77</b>.&nbsp; <i>Candidates in case of death, disqualification or withdrawal of another. </i>- If after the last day for the filing of certificates of candidacy, an official candidate of a registered or accredited political party dies, withdraws or is <b>disqualified for any cause</b>, only a person belonging to, and certified by, the same political party may file a certificate of candidacy to replace the candidate who died, withdrew or was disqualified.&nbsp; The substitute candidate nominated by the political party concerned may file his certificate of candidacy for the office affected in accordance with the preceding sections not later than mid-day of the day of the election. If the death, withdrawal or disqualification should occur between the day before the election and mid-day of election day, said certificate may be filed with any board of election inspectors in the political subdivision where he is a candidate, or, in the case of candidates to be voted for by the entire electorate of the country, with the Commission.</blockquote><br><b>Petition for <i>Quo Warranto</i> lacked factual basis.</b><br><br>Regarding the issue of whether a Petition for <i>Quo Warranto</i> is a proper legal remedy to assail the validity of the substitution of a candidate under Section 77 of the OEC, it suffices here to state that, under Rule 17 of the HRET Rules, the grounds for a Petition for <i>Quo Warranto</i> are ineligibility to run for a public office or disloyalty to the Republic of the Philippines.<br><br>Pertinently, Section 6, Article VI of the Constitution, which provides for the qualifications of a Member of the House of Representatives, states as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Section 6. No person shall be a Member of the House of Representatives unless he is a natural-born citizen of the Philippines and, on the day of the election, is at least twenty-five years of age, able to read and write, and, except the party-list representatives, a registered voter in the district in which he shall be elected, and a resident thereat for a period of not less than one year immediately preceding the day of the election.</blockquote><br>The above-quoted provision refers to the personal attributes of a candidate.&nbsp; The <i>ponencia</i> did not find any of the above qualifications absent in the case of respondent Gomez. However, the <i>ponencia</i> attributed the ineligibility of respondent Gomez to its erroneous assumption that the certificate of candidacy of Richard Gomez, whom she substituted, should have been cancelled. As explained above, the COMELEC correctly did not so cancel said certificate, it having found no factual basis to do so. This being the case and the fact that the Petition for <i>Quo Warranto</i> was filed out of time, there is no need to dwell on the issue of whether the Petition for <i>Quo Warranto</i> may validly question the validity of the substitution of a candidate and to discuss the constitutional boundaries of the respective jurisdictions of the COMELEC and the HRET.<br><br>In view of the foregoing, I reiterate my vote to dismiss the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> filed by Tagolino.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> G.R.

He gave his residence as 910 Carlota Hills, Barangay Can-Adieng, Ormoc City. After a week, Buenaventura O. Juntilla, a registered voter of the district, filed a <i>Verified Petition to Disqualify Candidate for Lack of Qualification</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> before the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) in SPA 09-059 (DC) on the ground that Richard was not an Ormoc City resident. Juntilla asked the COMELEC two things: a) disqualify Richard and b) deny due course to or cancel his CoC for material misrepresentation regarding his residence since he in fact resided in Greenhills, Mandaluyong City.<br><br>On February 17, 2010 the COMELEC First Division issued a resolution disqualifying Richard for failing to present "sufficient proof that would establish his ties to Ormoc." The resolution failed, however, to order the denial of due course or cancellation of his CoC. The dispositive portion of the resolution reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Commission RESOLVED, as it hereby RESOLVES, to GRANT the Petition to Disqualify Candidate for Lack of Qualification filed by BUENAVENTURA O. JUNTILLA against RICHARD I. GOMEZ. Accordingly, RICHARD I. GOMEZ is <b>DISQUALIFIED as a candidate</b> for the Office of Congressman, Fourth District of Leyte, <b>for lack of residency requirement.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>On February 20, 2010 Richard moved for reconsideration of the above resolution. Juntilla, on the other hand, did not file a similar motion even when the COMELEC failed to grant his other prayer for denial of due course or cancellation of Richard's CoC.<br><br>On May 4, 2010 the COMELEC <i>En Banc</i> issued a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dismissing Richard's motion for reconsideration. On the same day, Richard filed with the COMELEC a Manifestation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> informing it of his acceptance of its decision in his case to enable a substitute to take his place. Acting on the Manifestation, the COMELEC <i>En Banc</i> issued an Order on May 5 declaring its May 4 Resolution final and executory.<br><br>On May 5, 2010 the LP Secretary-General wrote the Provincial Election Supervisor of Leyte, nominating respondent Lucy Gomez as a substitute candidate for her husband, Richard. Lucy Gomez promptly filed her CoC with COMELEC as substitute candidate. On the same date, Juntilla filed with the COMELEC a Counter-Manifestation,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> followed by a letter to the COMELEC Law Department, opposing Lucy Gomez's substitution of her husband, claiming that the substitution was invalid since she had no one to substitute in view of the COMELEC's disqualification of Richard by final order.<br><br>On May 8, 2010, the COMELEC <i>En Banc</i> issued Resolution 88906 approving and adopting, among other things, its Law Department's study and recommendation that Lucy Gomez be allowed to substitute for Richard, given that the 1<sup>st</sup> Divisions ruling which did not cancel Richard's CoC but merely "disqualified" him, had already become final and executory. The pertinent portion of the study and recommendation that the <i>En Banc</i> adopted states:<br><br><blockquote><b>The crux of the opposition stemmed from the issue that there should be no substitution because there is no candidate to substitute for.</b><br><br>It must be stressed that the <b>resolution</b> of the First Division, this Commission, in SPA No. 09-059 <b>speaks of disqualification</b> of candidate Richard I. Gomez and <b>not of cancellation</b> of his Certificate of Candidacy:<br><br>"Wherefore, premises considered, the Commission RESOLVED, as it hereby RESOLVES, to GRANT the Petition to Disqualify Candidate for Lack of Qualification filed against RICHARD I. GOMEZ. Accordingly, RICHARD I. GOMEZ is <b>DISQUALIFIED</b> as a candidate for the Office of Congressman, Fourth District of Leyte, for lack of residency requirement."<br><br>The said resolution was affirmed by the Commission <i>En Banc</i> on May 4, 2010. <br><br>xxxx<br><br>In view of the foregoing, the Law Department RECOMMENDS<br><br>the following:<br><br>xxxx<br><br>2. TO ALLOW CANDIDATE LUCY MARIE TORRES GOMEZ AS A SUBSTITUTE CANDIDATE FOR RICHARD GOMEZ; (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>On the same day the COMELEC <i>En Banc</i> issued its May 8, 2010 resolution allowing the substitution, Juntilla filed an Extremely Urgent Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> of the same but the motion remained unacted upon, obviously owing to the supervening May 10 elections. Juntilla never elevated or questioned the matter before the Supreme Court.<br><br>On May 12, 2010 the Leyte Provincial Board of Canvassers proclaimed Lucy Gomez as Congresswoman-elect to represent the 4<sup>th</sup> District of Leyte, having obtained 101,250 votes. Petitioner Silvestre R. Tagolino and another candidate, Eufrocino C. Codilla, Jr., garnered 493 votes and 76,549 votes, respectively.<br><br>In due time, Tagolino brought a <i>quo warranto</i> action<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> against Lucy Gomez with the House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal (HRET) pursuant to its Rule 17 which allows the filing of a petition for <i>quo warranto</i> contesting the election of a member of the House of Representatives "on the ground of ineligibility or disloyalty to the Republic." Juntilla did not join Tagolino in this action.<br><br>Tagolino alleged in his petition (1) that . Lucy Gomez was not a resident of Ormoc City at least one year immediately preceding the election; (2) that she was not a registered voter in the 4th District of Leyte; and (3) that her CoC was void for failing to comply with the requirements of Section 2 of the 2004 Notarial Law.9 Tagolino did not raise in his petition the question of the validity of Lucy Gomez's substitution of her husband Richard.<br><br>In her Answer,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Lucy Gomez averred: (a) that the petition was filed beyond 10 days from proclamation; (b) that the petition assails the validity of her CoC, which is outside the jurisdiction of the HRET and should have been assailed before the COMELEC through a petition to deny due course to or cancel her CoC; (c) that the COMELEC had already resolved her substitution of Richard with finality in its Resolution 8890; (d) that she did not have to present proof of her identity when her CoC was notarized the notary public personally knew her; and (e) she never abandoned her domicile in Ormoc City despite her change of residence and transfer of voting registration to San Rafael, Bulacan, arising from her marriage to Richard.<br><br>On March 22, 2010 the HRET rendered a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> dismissing the <i>quo warranto </i>petition and declaring Lucy Gomez a qualified candidate during the May 2010 election for the subject position, her substitution of her disqualified husband being valid and legal. HRET ruled that Lucy Gomez's domicile continued to be Ormoc City despite her marriage to Richard. Tagolino moved for reconsideration but HRET denied the same on May 28, 2012, hence, this petition.<br><br><center><b>Question Presented</b></center><br>As the <i>ponencia</i> would have it, the issue boils down to the question of whether or not Lucy Gomez validly substituted Richard whom the COMELEC declared disqualified for lack of residency.<br><br>But the above is not an accurate statement of the real issue in this case. The real issue in this case is whether or not the HRET can review and reverse a COMELEC Decision involving a member of the House of Representatives that had become final and executory.<br><br><center><b>Discussion</b><br></center><br>The election of Lucy Gomez as Congresswoman of the 4<sup>th</sup> District of Leyte was preceded by two separate incidents before the COMELEC:<br><br>The <u>first</u> incident involved Richard. It consists in Juntilla's self-titled Verified Petition to Disqualify Candidate for Lack of Qualification Juntilla asked for Richard's disqualification, consistent with the substance of his petition, but added in his prayer that the candidate's CoC be also cancelled or denied due course. The COMELEC First Division granted the petition and disqualified Richard but did not cancel or deny due course to his CoC.<br><br>The <u>second</u> incident involved Lucy Gomez. Juntilla opposed her substitution of Richard on the ground that the substitution was invalid since she had no one to substitute in view of the COMELEC First Division's disqualification of Richard by final order. But the COMELEC <i>En Banc</i> denied the opposition and allowed the substitution, given that the First Division's resolution, which merely disqualified Richard, had already become final and executory.<br><br>The key issue in this case is actually whether or not the HRET was correct in ruling that the COMELEC First Division's February 17, 2010 Resolution that disqualified Richard but did not cancel his CoC or deny it due course had already become final and executory. For, if it had indeed become final and executory, that resolution would, as the COMELEC <i>En Banc</i> held in its May 8, 2010 Resolution, provide legal basis for Lucy Gomez's substitution of Richard.<br><br>It is clear from the facts that the COMELEC First Division's February 17, 2010 Resolution, which merely disqualified Richard but did not cancel or deny due course to his CoC, became final and executory. That resolution may be in error, as the <i>ponencia</i> would have it, but it certainly became final and executory for the following reasons:<br><br><b>First.</b> Juntilla never filed a motion for reconsideration of that resolution. Consequently, he could not help its becoming final and executory as to him.<br><br><b>Second</b>. Only Richard filed a motion for reconsideration of the COMELEC First Division's February 17, 2010 Resolution, which merely disqualified him. When the COMELEC <i>En Banc</i> dismissed that motion for reconsideration on May 4, 2010, Richard filed a manifestation on the same day, accepting its validity. On May 5 the COMELEC <i>En Banc</i> declared its May 4, 2010 Resolution final and executory. Consequently, what remained the last window of opportunity to review and possibly reverse the COMELEC First Division's February 17, 2010 Resolution closed down.<br><br><b>Third</b>. Juntilla attempted to revive the issue concerning the COMELEC First Division's February 17, 2010 Resolution when he opposed Lucy Gomez's substitution of Richard. He claimed that the First Division's resolution resulted in the COMELEC denying due course to Richard's CoC with the effect that, without a valid one, he could not be substituted. But Juntilla is clearly in error since the COMELEC <i>En Banc</i> already declared on May 5 that the First Division's February 17 Resolution merely ordered Richard's disqualification and such resolution had irreversibly become final and executory.<br><br>Juntilla of course filed on May 8, 2010 a motion for reconsideration of the COMELEC <i>En Banc's</i> Resolution of the same date that allowed Lucy Gomez's substitution of Richard, but the motion remained unacted upon, obviously owing to the supervening May 10, 2010 elections. At any rate, Juntilla may be deemed to have abandoned that motion for reconsideration for he never insisted that it be resolved. And he never raised before this Court the issue of the validity of that COMELEC <i>En Banc</i>'s May 8 Resolution that allowed the substitution. Unchallenged, that resolution became final and executory as well.<br><br>The Court has of course ruled In <i>Guerrrero v. Commission on Elections</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> that, since the Constitution makes the HRET "the sole judge of all contests relating to the election, returns and qualifications" of its members, it has the jurisdiction to pass upon the validity of substitution involving such members. Said the Court:<br><br><blockquote>Whether respondent [Rodolfo] Fariñas <b>validly substituted</b> Chevylle V. Fariñas and whether respondent became a legitimate candidate, in our view, <b>must likewise be addressed to the sound judgment of the Electoral Tribunal.</b> Only thus can we demonstrate fealty to the Constitutional provision that the Electoral Tribunal of each House of Congress shall be the "<i>sole judge </i>of all contests relating to the election, returns and qualifications of their respective members."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>But the above ruling should be understood in the context of the facts of the <i>Fariñas</i> case. Guillermo Ruiz, a registered voter, filed a petition with the COMELEC's Second Division seeking the perpetual disqualification of Rodolfo Fariñas as candidate for Congressman for the May 11, 1998 elections on the ground that he had been campaigning for that position despite his failure to file a CoC. Eventually, Fariñas filed his CoC on May 8, 1998 in substitution of Chevylle Fariñas who withdrew earlier on April 3, Because of this supervening event, on May 10 the Second Division dismissed Ruiz's petition for lack of merit.<br><br>Fariñas won the elections and was promptly proclaimed. On May 16, 1998, however, Ruiz filed a motion for reconsideration of the Second Division's May 10 Resolution, contending that Fariñas could not validly substitute for Chevylle, since the latter was not the official candidate of the <i>Lakas ng Makabayan Masang Pilipino</i> but was an independent candidate. Meantime, on June 3, 1998 Fariñas took his oath as member of the House of Representatives.<br><br>On June 10, 1998 petitioner Arnold Guerrero, a rival candidate, filed a petition-in-intervention with the COMELEC, assailing Fariñas' substitution ofChevylle. On January 6, 1999, the COMELEC <i>En Banc</i> dismissed Ruiz's motion for reconsideration and Guerrero's petition-in-intervention for lack of jurisdiction since Fariñas had in the meantime assumed office.<br><br>Upon Guerrero's petition, this Court held that while the COMELEC has the power to declare a CoC valid or invalid, its refusal to exercise that power, following Farifias' proclamation and assumption of office, simply recognized the jurisdictional boundaries between the COMELEC and the HRET. The Court said that whether Fariñas validly substituted Chevylle must now be addressed to the sound judgment of the HRET. The COMELEC's jurisdiction over election contests relating to his election, returns, and qualifications ends, and the HRET's own jurisdiction begins.<br><br>Tagolino cannot invoke the <i>Fariñas</i> ruling for three reasons:<br><br><i><u>First</u></i>, the Court's thesis in <i>Fariñas</i> is that the HRET can take over a pending matter before the COMELEC since the latter may be considered ousted of its jurisdiction over the same upon the winner's assumption of office. The HRET takes over the authority to resolve such pending matter.<br><br>Here, however, the key issue of whether or not the COMELEC First Division's February 17, 2010 Resolution, which merely disqualified Richard but did not cancel his CoC, is no longer a pending matter. It became final and executory since, as pointed out above, Juntilla did not file a motion for its reconsideration and the COMELEC <i>En Banc</i> had found it to be the case.<br><br><u><i>Second</i></u>, Guerrero had the right to raise the issue of Fariñas' disqualification before the HRET since he intervened and joined cause with Guillermo in his action before the COMELEC. This gave Guerrero a stake in the resolution of Guillermo's motion for reconsideration after the COMELEC declined to further act on the same.<br><br>Here, Tagolino never intervened in Juntilla's actions before the COMELEC. He stayed out of it. Consequently, he has no right to ask the HRET to resolve Juntilla's May 8, 2010 motion for reconsideration of the COMELEC <i>En Banc</i>'s order of the same date. The right to press for the resolution of that May 8 motion for reconsideration belonged to Juntilla who alone filed it. But, as it happened, he abandoned his motion when he did not come up either to the Supreme Court or to the HRET to cause it to be resolved.<br><br>And <i><u>third</u></i>, Tagolino is barred from claiming that, in disqualifying Richard, the COMELEC's First Division in effect caused the cancellation of his CoC. Tagolino made a binding admission during the Preliminary Conference before the HRET that the COMELEC did not in fact order such cancellation of Richard's CoC.14 Thus, Tagalino admitted that:<br><br><blockquote>xxxx<br><br>3. By Resolution of February 17, 2010, the Comelec disqualified Richard I. Gomez as candidate: for Representative of the Fourth District of Leyte for lack of residency;<br><br>4. Gomez filed a motion for reconsideration, which the Comelec En Banc dismissed for lack of merit by Resolution of May 4, 2010;<br><br><b>5. Said May 4, 2010 Resolution of the Comelec did not order the cancellation of Gomez' certificate of candidacy</b>; (Emphasis supplied)<br><br>xxxx<br></blockquote><br>Tagolino's admission in paragraph 5 above—that the COMELEC did not order the cancellation of Richard Gomez's certificate of candidacy—is binding on him, especially since he makes no allegation that he made such admission through palpable mistake.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>True, the parties raised before the HRET the issue of "whether the substitution of respondent is valid." But this merely accords with Lucy Gomez's defense in her answer that the COMELEC had already resolved her substitution of Richard with finality in its Resolution 8890. It did not mean that the parties were submitting to the HRET for resolution the issue of the final and executory nature of the COMELEC First Division's resolution that enabled her to substitute for Richard.<br><br>So the Court comes to the real issue in this case: whether or not the HRET can review and reverse a COMELEC decision, involving a member of the House of Representatives, that had already become final and executory.<br><br>The HRET has no authority to review final and executory resolutions or decisions of the COMELEC that it rendered pursuant to its powers under the Constitution, no matter if such resolutions or decisions are erroneous. The parties cannot by agreement confer such authority on HRET. Neither the HRET nor the Court can set aside the COMELEC's final and executory resolutions that paved the way for Lucy Gomez to substitute her husband.<br><br>As for Lucy Gomez's residency qualification, the evidence presented in the case amply supports HRET's conclusion that she met such qualification.<br><br>For all of the above reasons, I vote to deny the petition.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>, pp. 246-253.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Id . at 259-265.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Id. at 266-277.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Id. at 278-279.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Id. at 281-86.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Id. at 303-310.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Id. at 311-324.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Id. at 85-92.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> SEC. 2. <i>Affirmation or Oath</i>. - The term "Affirmation" or "Oath" refers to an act in which an individual on a single occasion:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(a) appears in person before the notary public;<br>(b)
