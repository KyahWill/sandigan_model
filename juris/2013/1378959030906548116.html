Miranda’s Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> and Prohibition with Prayer for <i>Status Quo</i> or Restraining Order.<br><br><center><b><i>The Antecedents</i></b><br></center><br>Petitioner Cesar G. Manalo (Manalo) and private respondent Ernesto M. Miranda (Miranda) were among the three candidates for <i>Punong Barangay</i> of Sta. Maria, Mabalacat, Pampanga during the 2010 <i>Barangay</i> and <i>Sangguniang Kabataan</i> Synchronized Elections on 25 October 2010. As per records, there were six (6) precincts in <i>Barangay</i> Sta. Maria, with a total of 2,302 registered voters, but only 1,605 among them actually voted. After the canvass of votes, the <i>Barangay</i> Board of Canvassers of Sta. Maria proclaimed Miranda as the winner and duly elected <i>Punong Barangay</i> obtaining 344 votes as against 343 votes obtained by Manalo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>On 4 November 2010, Manalo filed an election protest before the 6<sup>th</sup> Municipal Circuit Trial Court (MCTC) of Mabalacat and Magalang, Pampanga, contesting the proclamation of Miranda as the winner for <i>Punong Barangay</i> on the following grounds: (1) misreading or misappreciation of the ballots; (2) the number of votes reflected in the tally sheet did not reflect the same number of votes-one of the members of the Board of Tellers merely copied what was stated in the tally sheet; (3) the watchers of Manalo were deprived of their right to have an unimpeded view of the ballot being read by the Chairman, of the election return and the tally board being simultaneously accomplished by the poll clerk and the third member, respectively, without touching any of these election documents as mandated in Resolution No. 9030.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Miranda, in his Answer with Counterclaim and Motion to Dismiss filed on 15 November 2010, denied any irregularities and maintained the credibility and regularity of the conduct of the <i>Barangay</i> Election under the strict supervision of the COMELEC. In his special and affirmative defense, as well as his motion for dismissal, he asserted that the petition of Manalo was insufficient in form and substance as it failed to allege the specific votes by precinct of the parties. Finally in his counterclaim, Miranda prayed for payment of P100,000.00 by way of attorney’s fees.<br><br>As Manalo failed to prove any election irregularities in the conduct of election committed by the Board of Tellers, the trial court proceeded with the appreciation of the ballots. Upon tabulation, the results showed that Manalo was the winner of the election having garnered Three Hundred Forty-Four (344) votes, up from 343 votes while herein Miranda got three hundred thirty-three (333) votes, down from 344 votes, or a plurality of 11 votes. On 24 May 2011, the trial court rendered a decision in favor of Manalo and declared him as the true choice for <i>Punong Barangay</i> of Sta. Maria, Mabalacat, Pampanga. The dispositive<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> of the decision reads:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of the foregoing, the Court hereby renders the following judgment:<br><ol><li>Declaring null and void and thus set aside the proclamation of protestee Ernesto M. Miranda as the elected Punong Barangay of Sta. Maria, Mabalacat, Pampanga made by the Barangay Board of Canvassers on October 25, 2010;<br><br></li><li>Declaring protestant <b>CESAR MANALO</b> as the duly elected <b>PUNONG BARANGAY of Sta.

Maria, Mabalacat, Pampanga which is now and henceforth, unless otherwise disqualified by law, are conferred unto the declared winner and herein protestant CESAR MANALO, who is hereby ordered to act, perform and discharge the duties, functions and responsibilities and all incidents appertaining to and in connection with the office of the Punong Barangay of Barangay Sta. Maria, Mabalacat, Pampanga immediately after he shall have taken his oath of office.<br></li></ol>No pronouncement as to damages and attorney’s fees for failure of the protestant to adduce evidence relative thereto during the trial.<br><br>As mandated under Section 7, Rule 14 of A.M. No. 07-4-15-SC, otherwise known as the “Rules of Procedure in Election Contests Before the Court Involving Elective Municipal and Barangay Officials” as soon as the decision becomes final, the clerk of court shall send notices to the Commission on Elections, the Department of Interior and Local Government and the Commission on Audit.<br><br>FINALLY, the ballot boxes kept under the Court’s custody are hereby ordered for transmittal to the Treasurer’s Office of Mabalacat, Pampanga as depository of the election paraphernalia and corresponding keys to the ballot boxes be returned to the designated authorized officers. The protestant is hereby ordered to transmit the same as soon as the decision becomes final and executory.<br></blockquote>Immediately on the same day, Miranda filed a Notice of Appeal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> appealing the Decision of the lower court to the COMELEC.<br><br>On 25 May 2011, Manalo filed a Motion for Immediate Execution of Decision Pending Appeal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> before the lower court citing good reasons<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> to justify immediate execution.<br><br>On 2 June 2011, Miranda protested the Motion for Immediate Execution Pending Appeal of Manalo mainly on the basis that no good reason was shown for its immediate execution, as the defeat of the protestee and the victory of the protestant had been clearly established as required under paragraph (2), Section 11, Rule 14 of A.M. No. 07-4-15-SC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Eventually on 3 June 2011, the trial court issued a Special Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> granting Manalo’s Motion for Immediate Execution Pending Appeal on the following grounds:<br><blockquote><ol><li>The victory of the protestant was clearly established;<br><br></li><li>Public interest demands that the true choice of the electorate must be respected and given meaning; and<br><br></li><li>Public policy underlies it as something had to be done to strike the death blow at the pernicious grab-the–proclamation-prolong-the protest technique often, if not invariably resorted to by unscrupulous politicians.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote>On 22 June 2011, Miranda before the COMELEC filed a Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> and Prohibition with Prayer for <i>Status Quo Ante</i> or Restraining Order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>The next day on 23 June 2011, the trial court denied the Motion for Reconsideration filed by Miranda to the Special Order granting the execution pending appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> On 25 June 2011, the trial court issued the contested writ of execution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>On 8 July 2011, COMELEC Second Division, acting on the petition filed by Miranda, issued a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) against the 24 May 2011 Decision and 3 June 2011 Special Order of the trial court as well as all other acts/incidents relating thereto. A <i>status quo ante</i> order was also issued “to restrain any acts that had already been done prior to the filing of petition.” <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>The Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> filed by Manalo was denied by COMELEC Second Division in an Order dated 9 August 2011.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>On 28 October 2011, a Very Urgent Ex Parte Motion for Clarification<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> was filed by Manalo praying that the COMELEC Second Division clarify the phrase, “<i>In the event that the above acts supposed to be restrained had already been done, the parties herein are hereby ordered to maintain the status quo ante prior to the filing of the instant petition</i>,” in the 8 July 2011 Order.<br><br>On 22 December 2011, the COMELEC Second Division granted the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> and Prohibition filed by Miranda. Notably, in its Resolution, the COMELEC Second Division ruled that the trial court’s Decision showed Miranda’s defeat and herein Manalo’s victory. It said that the trial court complied with rules provided by Section 2, Rule 14 of A.M. No. 07-4-15-SC prescribing specific forms which must be followed in election protests. It was observed that the decision even provided for a tabulation and summary of the total number of votes and those validated, nullified and voided; and computed the total valid votes obtained by each candidate.<br><br>However, the Division also invalidated both the Special Order and Writ of Execution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> It was explained that the Special Order did not comply with the ruling in <i>Lim v. COMELEC</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> which enumerated the instances considered as good reasons to allow execution pending appeal. It ruled further that the writ of execution issued by the trial court violated paragraph (b), Section 11, Rule 14 of A.M. No. 07-4-15-SC which specifies that a writ of execution shall be issued after 20 working days from notice of the special order granting the execution pending appeal. The COMELEC noted that in the case before it, from the time of service of the special order, only 14 workings had passed which rendered the execution of the decision premature.<br><br>On 29 December 2011, Manalo filed a Motion for Reconsideration which was denied in a COMELEC En Banc Resolution dated 17 April 2012. The COMELEC En Banc agreed with the findings that the Special Order is invalid as it failed to specify superior circumstances justifying execution pending appeal and merely lifted the reasons cited in jurisprudence without any explanation as to its applicability to the present case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Hence, this petition.<br><br><center><b><i>The Issues</i></b><br></center><br>Petitioner Manalo prays for the reversal of the resolutions on the following grounds:<br><blockquote><center>I.<br></center><br>THE HONORABLE COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS GRAVELY ERRED IN ISSUING A SIXTY (60) DAYS TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER AND/OR STATUS QUO ANTE ORDER ON JULY 8, 2011 WHEN THE ACT SOUGHT TO BE ENJOINED HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE BY THE FACT THAT HEREIN PETITIONER MANALO HAS ALREADY ASSUMED THE POSITION OF PUNONG BARANGAY OF STA. MARIA, MABALACAT, PAMPANGA ON JUNE 24, 2011.<br><br><center>II.<br></center><br>THE HONORABLE COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS GRAVELY AND SERIOUSLY ERRED IN RULING THAT THE LOWER COURT FAILED TO SPECIFY IN ITS SPECIAL ORDER DATED JUNE 3, 2011 SUPERIOR CIRCUMSTANCES JUSTIFYING EXECUTION PENDING APPEAL.<br><br><center>III.<br></center><br>THE HONORABLE COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS GRAVELY AND SERIOUSLY ERRED IN RULING THAT THE PERIOD OF TWENTY (20) DAYS AS ENUNCIATED IN SECTION 11 (B), RULE 14 OF A.M.

Time and effort could have been saved, for better purposes, for all parties including specially this Court.<br><br>The <i>Punong Barangay</i> Election Protest filed by Manalo against Miranda was clearly decided in Manalo’s favor. The trial court stated:<br><blockquote>To recapitulate, out of the total number of protested ballots by the protestant of ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-TWO (122) covering six (6) protested precints in Barangay Sta. Maria, Mabalacat, Pampanga, the total number of ballots that have been voided or nullified as per Court’s findings is ELEVEN (11) to be deducted from the total number of votes obtained by the protestee and from the two (2) ballots claimed by the protestant only one (1) ballot is found to be valid claim which will be added to the votes obtained by the protestant during the October 25, 2010 Barangay Election.<br><br>Thus as shown from the final tally of the result of the Court’s appreciation of ballots, protestant <b>CESAR MANALO</b> is the true choice for Punong Barangay of Sta. Maria, Mabalacat, Pampanga having garnered THREE HUNDRED FORTY-FOUR (344) votes from 343 votes while herein protestee ERNESTO M. MIRANDA got THREE HUNDRED THIRTY-THREE (333) votes from 344 votes or a plurality of 11 votes in favor of the protestant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br></blockquote>This ruling was pushed into the background when, acting on Manalo’s motion for immediate execution of decision pending appeal, the trial court issued a Special Order granting Manalo’s prayer for the issuance of a writ of execution pending appeal. While Miranda’s motion for reconsideration of the special order was yet pending, he filed with the Comelec a Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> and Prohibitions with Prayer for a <i>Status Quo Ante</i> or Retraining Order. A day after, Miranda’s motion for reconsideration was eventually denied, the trial court petinently stating that:<br><blockquote>The Court believes that [Manalo] has won in the barangay election of October 25, 2010 <u>even if</u> the Court had included in the appreciation of ballots those which were claimed by the [Miranda].<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> (Underlining supplied)<br></blockquote>This ruling squarely addressed the argument of Miranda that:<br><blockquote>3. The decision of the Honorable Court indisputably did not include the appreciation of the ballots of [Manalo] objected by [Miranda] and the adjudication of the stray ballots claimed as valid votes of [Miranda] which were clearly indentified in the Reports on the Revision of Ballots and in the Protestee’s Formal Offer of Evidence, because upon the view of the court, [Miranda] did not interpose a counter-protest, which appears to be an erroneous interpretation of the law and a departure from the established procedural norm in election protest; x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br></blockquote>In his petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition before the COMELEC, Miranda repeated his argument that the trial court erred when it did not include in the appreciation the ballots that he “claimed.” Thus:<br><blockquote>In the said Decision, the objections of [Miranda] on some 204 ballots of [Manalo], and the 11 stray ballots claimed by [Miranda] as his valid votes under existing jurisprudence, made duing the revision of ballots were not appreciated by public respondent judge, for the wrong reason that [Miranda] did not file a counter-protest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br></blockquote>This point was, once more, directly ruled upon, this time by the COMELEC itself through its Second Division. Thus:<br><blockquote>The contention of [Miranda] that the Decision of the public respondent did not clearly establish the defeat of [Miranda] or the victory of the [Manalo] is unfounded.<br><br>After a careful examination of public respondent’s Decision, we are convinced that there is a clear showing of [Miranda’s] defeat and [Manalo’s] victory.<br><br>Section 2, Rule 14 of A.M. No. 07-4-15-SC prescribes a specific form of the decision which courts must observe, to wit:<br><blockquote>SEC. 2. <i>Form of decision in election protests</i>. After termination of the revision of ballots and before rendering its decision in an election protest that involved such revision, the court shall examine and appreciate the original ballots. The court, in its appreciation of the ballots and in rendering rulings on objections and claims to ballots of the parties, shall observe the following rules:<br><br> <table  ="" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%">(a) </td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">On <i>Marked Ballots</i> – The court must specify the entries in the ballots that clearly indicate that the intention of the voter is to identify the ballot. The specific markings in the ballots must be illustrated or indicated;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>(b) </td><td><div align="justify">On <i>Fake or Spurious Ballots</i> – The court must specify the COMELEC security markings that are not found in the ballots that are considered fake or spurious;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>(c)</td><td><div align="justify"> On <i>Stray Ballots</i> – The court must specify and state in detail why the ballots are considered stray;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>(d) </td><td><div align="justify">On <i>Pair or Group of Ballots Written by One or Individual Ballots Written By Two</i> – When ballots are invalidated on the ground of written by one person, the court must clearly and distinctly specify why the pair or group of ballots has been written by only one person. The specific strokes, figures, or letters indicating that the ballots have been written by one person must be specified. A simple ruling that a pair or group of ballots has been written by one person would not suffice. The same is true when ballots are excluded on the ground of having been written by two persons. The court must likewise take into consideration the entries of the Minutes of Voting and Counting relative to illiterate or disabled voters, if any, who cast their votes through assistors, in determining the validity of the ballots found to be written by one person, whether the ballots are in pairs or in groups; and</div></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">(e) </td><td><div align="justify">On <i>Claimed Ballots</i> – The court must specify the exact basis for admitting or crediting claimed votes to either party.<br></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>The Decision complied with the foregoing rule. A tabulation was presented by the public respondent which provided for a detailed ruling on each of the questioned ballots. It discussed why some ballots, e.g. Exhibits “C-1,” “C-2,” “C-3” and “C-5” of Precinct 0467A/0467B, were not considered “marked” ballots and therefore valid for [Miranda]. It also detailed out why some ballots, e.g. Exhibits “C-4,” “C-22,” “C-28,” “C-40” of Precinct 0467A/0467B, were considered “marked” ballots and therefore invalid votes for [Miranda]. Furthermore, the specific marks that made the ballots “marked”were duly explained in the Decision.<br><br>In the end, the Decision provided for a summary of the total number of votes that were nullified or voided, thus, must be deducted from [Miranda’s] total number of votes as well as the total valid claim that will be added to the votes obtained by [Manalo]. On the basis of this, public respondent made a pronouncement that [Manalo] won the said election, with a plurality of eleven (11) votes.<br><br>As correctly argued by the [Manalo], “public respondent thoroughly, meticulously and painstakingly studied and took into consideration all the contentions and evidence adduced by both [Miranda] and [Manalo]. We therefore rule that the victory of [Manalo] and the defeat of [Miranda] are manifest in the Decision. Hence, neither haste nor bias is present herein.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br></blockquote>The COMELEC Second Division, however did not find good reason for the issuance of the Special Order of the trial court and further found that the issuance of the Writ of Execution violated the twenty-day waiting period before the Writ of Execution pending appeal can be issued.<br><br>The COMELEC Second Division ruling could have ended the case. The TRO order of the COMELEC Second Division dated 8 July 2011 enjoining the trial judge from implementing the Decision, Special Order and Writ of Execution was <u>only</u> for a <u>period of sixty days</u> and had already lapsed when, on 22 December 2011, the COMELEC held that “the victory of the private respondent [Manalo, before the COMELEC] and the defeat of petitioner [Miranda, before the COMELEC] are manifest in the Decision.” The said Decision could have been the subject of a motion for remand to the trial court for regular execution of judgment. The issue of propriety of execution pending appeal had, by then, become moot. As it would turn out, Miranda no longer questioned the Resolution of the COMELEC Second Division. It was Manalo himself, the declared winner before the trial court and on appeal before the COMELEC, who chose to file a Motion for Partial Reconsideration insisting on the correctness of the Special Order of Execution Pending Appeal. Fortunately for Manalo, even if Miranda took the opportunity of reiterating, through a Comment and Opposition, his argument that “the form of the decision dated 29 May 2011 of public respondent is fatally defective,” the COMELEC En Banc rightfully confined itself to the only issue raised in Manalo’s Motion for Partial Reconsideration, which is, the validity of the trial court’s Special Order for execution pending appeal and the corresponding writ of execution. Not one word was said against the main matter between the parties, which is, the correctness of the trial court’s adjudication that Manalo won over Miranda in the 2010 <i>Barangay</i> Elections for <i>Punong Barangay</i> of Sta. Maria, Mabalacat, Pampanga. Such amounted to a full text of affirmance by the COMELEC En Banc of the trial court’s decision in favor of Manalo. At that point, Manalo was given another mandate, indeed more authoritative, to have the trial court’s decision in his favor regularly, no longer specially, executed. Quite unexplainably, Manalo insisted on a ruling this time from us, on the decisions below on the validity of execution pending appeal. And Miranda, of course, obliged and by his comment to the petition, kept on going the debate on the moot issue. More for an orderly resolution of this election dispute than the personal ambitions of the party, we issued a TRO on 2 April 2013<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> which stated:<br><blockquote>NOW, THEREFORE, effective immediately and continuing until further orders from this Court, You, respondents ERNESTO M.
