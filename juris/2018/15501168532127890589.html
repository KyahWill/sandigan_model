				<H3>PRIVATE HOSPITALS ASSOCIATION OF THE PHILIPPINES, INC. (PHAPI) REPRESENTED BY ITS PRESIDENT, DR. RUSTICO JIMENEZ, PETITIONER, VS. HON. SALVADOR MEDIALDEA, EXECUTIVE SECRETARY, AND THE ACTING SECRETARY OF DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, RESPONDENTS.<BR><BR>DECISION</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>TIJAM, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">On grounds of denial of substantive due process, repugnancy to the constitutional presumption of innocence, violation of the equal protection and involuntary servitude clauses, petitioner Private Hospitals Association of the Philippines, Inc., (PHAPi) - an organization of privately-owned clinics, hospitals, and other health facilities - seeks to declare as unconstitutional and void the duty imposed upon hospitals, medical practitioners and employees to prevent actual death or injury under Section 1; the penal provisions under Section 4; the presumption of liability clause under Section 5; and the reimbursement and tax deduction clause under Sections 7 and 8, all of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 10932<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> otherwise known as an Act Strengthening the Anti-Hospital Deposit Law.<br><br><center><b>The Antecedents</b><br></center><br>In 1984, Batas Pambansa (BP) Bilang 702 entitled An Act Prohibiting the Demand of Deposits or Advance Payments for the Confinement or Treatment of Patients in Hospitals and Medical Clinics in Certain Cases was enacted. BP 702 was described as a landmark legislative measure that aimed to stop the practice of hospitals and medical clinics of asking for deposits or advance payments for treatment or confinement of patients in emergency and serious cases.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>Essentially, BP 702 makes it unlawful for any director, manager or any other officer of a hospital or medical clinic to demand any deposit or any other form of advance payment for confinement or treatment in such hospital or medical clinic in emergency or serious cases.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> BP 702 penalizes such erring director, manager or any other officer of a hospital or medical clinic with a fine of not less than one thousand pesos but not more than two thousand pesos or imprisonment for not less than fifteen days but not more than thirty days, or both such fine and imprisonment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>On August 25, 1997, BP 702 was amended by R.A. No. 8344.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> R.A. No. 8344 makes it unlawful not only to demand, but also to request, solicit, and accept any deposit or advance payment as a prerequisite for confinement or medical treatment in emergency or serious cases. R.A. No. 8344 further makes the refusal to administer medical treatment and support as dictated by good practice of medicine to prevent death or permanent disability unlawful. In case the hospital or the medical clinic has no adequate medical capabilities, R.A. No. 8344 outlines the procedure for the transfer of the patient to a facility where appropriate care can be given.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Under a new provision, R.A. No. 8344 allows the transfer of the patient to an appropriate hospital consistent with the latter's needs after the hospital or medical clinic has administered medical treatment and support.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>R.A. No. 8344 also provides the following governing definitions for purposes of the law:<br><blockquote>(a) Emergency - a condition or state of a patient wherein based on the objective findings of a prudent medical officer on duty for the day there is immediate danger and where delay in initial support and treatment may cause loss of life or cause permanent disability to the patient.<br><br>(b) Serious case - refers to a condition of a patient characterized by gravity or danger wherein based on the objective findings of a prudent medical officer on duty for the day when left unattended to, may cause loss of life or cause permanent disability to the patient.<br><br>(c) Confinement - a state of being admitted in a hospital or medical clinic for medical observation, diagnosis, testing, and treatment consistent with the capability and available facilities of the hospital or clinic.<br><br>(d) Hospital - a facility devoted primarily to the diagnosis, treatment and care of individuals suffering from illness, disease, injury or deformity, or in need of obstetrical or other medical and nursing care. It shall also be construed as any institution, building or place where there are facilities and personnel for the continued and prolonged care of patients.<br><br>(e) Emergency treatment and support - any medical or surgical measure within the capability of the hospital or medical clinic that is administered by qualified health care professionals to prevent the death or permanent disability of a patient.<br><br>(f) Medical clinic - a place in which patients can avail of medical consultation or treatment on an outpatient basis.<br><br>(g) Permanent disability - a condition of physical disability as defined under Article 192-C and Article 193-B and C of Presidential Decree No. 442; as amended, otherwise known as the Labor Code of the Philippines.<br><br>(h) Stabilize - the provision of necessary care until such time that the patient may be discharged or transferred to another hospital or clinic with a reasonable probability that no physical deterioration would result from or occur during such discharge or transfer.<br></blockquote>R.A. No. 8344 also increased the penalties prescribed under BP 702 to imprisonment of not less than six months and one day but not more than two years and four months, or a fine of not less than twenty thousand pesos, but not more than one hundred thousand pesos, or both at the discretion of the court. However, if the violation was committed pursuant to an established hospital or clinic policy or upon the instruction of its management, the director or officer responsible for the formulation and implementation of such policy shall suffer imprisonment of four to six years, or a fine of not less than one hundred thousand pesos, but not more than five hundred thousand pesos, or both, at the court's discretion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Sensing the need to curb the still prevalent practice of refusing to provide initial medical treatment and support in emergency or serious cases without the corresponding deposit or advance payment, House Bill No. 5159<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> was submitted by the House Committee on Health which seeks to increase the penalties for violation of BP 702 as amended by R.A. No. 8344; expand the definition of "emergency care" to include women in active labor and at the risk of miscarriage or fetal distress; include reimbursement from the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) for the expenses advanced by hospitals and medical facilities in treating poor and indigent patients; and mandate the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO) to provide assistance to poor and marginalized patients on emergency treatment in hospitals.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>This development met similar support from the Senate through Senate Bill No. 1353<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> submitted by its Committees on Health and Demography, Justice and Human Rights, and Ways and Means. Similar to its lower house counterpart, Senate Bill No. 1353 aims to increase the penalties for violation of the law; define "basic emergency care"; and include PhilHealth reimbursement of basic emergency care incurred by the hospital or medical clinic. However, peculiar to the Senate version is the presumption of liability imposed against the hospital, medical clinic, and the involved official, medical practitioner, or employee in the event of death, permanent disability, serious impairment of the health condition of the patient, or injury to or loss of the unborn child proceeding from the denial of admission to the health facility pursuant to a policy or practice of demanding deposits or advance payments for confinement or treatment.<br><br>A consolidation of Senate Bill No. 1353 and House Bill No. 5159 gave birth to R.A. No. 10932 which was signed into law on August 3, 2017.<br><br>Thus, as it presently stands, R.A. No. 10932 makes it unlawful to request, solicit, demand or accept deposit or advance payment as a prerequisite not only for confinement or medical treatment but also for administering basic emergency care.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> It expands the scope of "basic emergency care" to include medical procedures and treatment administered to a woman in active labor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>In case a transfer to another hospital is deemed appropriate, R.A. No. 10932 further mandates the local government unit where the hospital or medical clinic is located to allow free use of its emergency medical vehicle. Moreover, all hospitals are required to post a notice indicating its classification level and the list of medical services it is authorized to perform.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>R.A. No. 10932 also introduces the creation of a Health Facilities Oversight Board (Board) where complaints against health facilities for violations of the law shall be initially filed. The Board is given the power to investigate, adjudicate and impose administrative sanctions including the revocation of the health facility's license.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Further to the matter of penalties, R.A. No. 10932 imposes upon an erring official, medical practitioner or employee of the hospital or medical clinic the penalty of imprisonment of not less than six (6) months and one (1) day but not more than two (2) years and four (4) months, or a fine of not less than P100,000.00, but not more than P300,000.00, or both at the court's discretion. However, when the violation was made pursuant to an established hospital policy or upon instructions of its management, the penalties are increased as against the director or officer formulating and implementing such policy to four (4) years to six (6) years, or a fine of not less than P500,000.00, but not more than P1,000,000.00, or both, without prejudice to an award for damages.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>In addition, R.A. No. 10932 introduces the three-strike rule, or when upon 3 repeated violations committed pursuant .to an established policy or upon instruction of the management, the health facility's license to operate shall be revoked by the Department of Health (DOH). The law also makes the president, chairman, board of directors, or trustees and other officers of the health facility solidarily liable for damages.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Apart from the foregoing, R.A. No. 10932 presumes liability against the hospital, medical clinic, and the official, medical practitioner, or employee involved, in the event of death, permanent disability, serious impairment or permanent injury to or loss of an unborn child, proceeding from the denial of admission to a health facility pursuant to a policy of requiring deposits or advance payments for confinement or treatment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>R.A. No. 10932 also mandates that the PhilHealth reimburse the cost of the basic emergency care and transportation services rendered by the hospital or medical clinic to poor and indigent patients and that the PCSO provide medical assistance for the basic emergency care needs of the poor and marginalized groups. Expenses incurred in giving basic emergency care to poor and indigent patients not reimbursed by PhilHealth are allowed to be treated as tax deductions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Meanwhile, pending resolution of the instant petition or on April 4, 2018, the DOH issued Administrative Order No. 2018-0012 implementing R.A. No. 10932.<br><br><center><b>The Arguments for the Petitioner</b><br></center><br>Petitioner claims <i>locus standi</i> to file the present Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> and Prohibition as it stands to be directly injured by the implementation of R.A. No. 10932 insofar as the law regulates the conduct of its members and places the latter's management and staff at the risk of administrative, civil, and criminal sanctions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> At any event, petitioner claims that the issues herein presented specifically on the denial of due process and to equal protection of laws are of transcendental importance that should allow the present petition to prosper despite the absence of direct injury.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Petitioner further claims that the issues raised in the instant petition are ripe for adjudication given the imminent threat of the imposition of the unconstitutional duties and the corresponding unconstitutional sanctions under R.A. No. 10932 against petitioner's members with the impending approval of the rules implementing R.A. No. 10932.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Petitioner also argues that an allegation that R.A. No. 10932 infringes upon the constitutional rights to due process, equal protection of laws and the presumption of innocence, is sufficient to invoke the Court's power of review.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Claiming exception to the doctrine of hierarchy of courts, petitioner also advances the view that direct resort to the Court is justified given the genuine issues of constitutionality posed by the present petition.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Going into the merits of the petition, petitioner seeks to strike down as unconstitutional R.A. No. 10932 for being unduly oppressive and thus violative of substantive due process. Elaborating, petitioner argues that Section 1 of BP 702 as amended by R.A. No. 8344 and R.A. No. 10932 <i>imposes</i> upon the proprietor, president, director, manager or any other officer, medical practitioner or employee of a health care institution the duty to administer basic emergency care or medical treatment and support as dictated by good practice of medicine to <i>prevent</i> death, or permanent disability, or in the case of a pregnant woman, permanent injury or loss of her unborn child, or non-institutional delivery in emergency or serious cases.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Petitioner argues that "basic emergency care" and "emergency treatment and support" as defined under R.A. No. 10932 imposes upon the physician, the hospital, its management and staff the <i>untenable</i> duties to <i>actually prevent</i> death, permanent disability, permanent injury to or loss of an unborn baby or its non-institutional delivery and to <i>sufficiently address</i> an emergency situation and in case of a woman in active labor, to <i>ensure</i> the safe delivery of the baby.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Echoing <i>Lucas, et al. v. Dr. Tuaño</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> petitioner emphasizes that a physician is not an insurer of the good result of treatment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Petitioner thus argues that the duty imposed by R.A. No. 10932, being predicated on the achievement of an end that is impossible to guarantee, amounts to a denial of due process.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Further, petitioner aims to strike down the fines imposed under Section 4 for being unjust, excessive, and oppressive as they are not commensurate to the act or omission that is being penalized.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Petitioner also questions the solidary liability for damages under Section 4 insofar as it generally makes "other officers" of the health facility solidarily liable with the president, chairman, members of the board of directors or trustees.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>The presumption of liability spelled under Section 5 of R.A. No. 10932 is also being assailed for being repugnant to the constitutional presumption of innocence. It is the contention of petitioner that the presumption of liability clause allows for a presumption of generalized liability, i.e., administrative, civil and criminal, upon the occurrence of death, permanent disability and serious impairment of the health condition of the patient or her unborn child after the denial of the patient's admission due to a hospital policy of demanding deposits or advance payments.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Also, petitioner emphasizes that the presumption of liability clause necessarily presumes that there is, at all times, a causal connection between the injury and the acts or omissions complained of.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Expounding on this argument, petitioner argues that the offense defined under R.A. No. 10932 involves medical malpractice. As such, the causation between the injury and the medical action are determinable only through the technical and scientific competence of physicians and thus, cannot be presumed by law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Finally, petitioner seeks to strike down as unconstitutional the exclusion of the basic emergency care of patients <i>not</i> classified as poor, indigent or marginalized from PhilHealth reimbursement, PCSO assistance and tax deductibility under Sections 7 and 8 of R.A. No. 10932 for being violative of the equal protection clause.<br><br>Illustrating its argument, petitioner contends that these provisions would allow a hospital who treats a poor patient to receive PhilHealth reimbursement, PCSO assistance and tax deduction, and yet the hospital who treats a patient not classified as poor, indigent or marginalized will not be allowed a similar PhilHealth reimbursement, PCSO assistance and tax deduction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> It is likewise the view of petitioner that the law, insofar as it obliges hospitals, its staff and management to render services to patients not classified as poor, indigent, or marginalized without the corresponding reimbursement, assistance and tax deduction, amounts to involuntary servitude.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br><center><b>The Arguments for the Respondents</b><br></center><br>Respondents Hon. Salvador Medialdea, Executive Secretary, and the Acting Secretary of Department of Health, through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), seek to dismiss the instant petition for being procedurally infirm on the ground that <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition are proper only against judicial, quasi-judicial, or ministerial act. Like so, respondents seek a dismissal of the petition for lack of a justiciable controversy in the absence of an actual governmental act which directly causes or will imminently cause injury to the alleged right of petitioner.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Respondents also attacks petitioner's standing to file the present petition for lack of personal stake in the outcome of the controversy, it being neither a hospital or health facility itself.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Further, respondents assert that the issues raised by petitioner being speculative are not matters of transcendental importance that would justify a disregard of the rule on <i>locus standi</i> and the doctrine of hierarchy of courts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Contrary to petitioner's claims, respondents contend that R.A. No. 10932 does not impose upon the hospital, medical facility, its staff or management the duty to guarantee that death, permanent loss or injury is prevented, neither does it penalize the failure of the physician or the hospital staff to prevent such occurrences. Rather, respondents argue that what R.A. No. 10932 prohibits is the act of requesting any form of advance payment as a prerequisite for administering basic emergency care or medical treatment, or the act of refusing to administer such as dictated by good practice to prevent death, permanent loss or injury.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Also, respondents maintain that the fines imposed under R.A. No. 10932 are reasonable, and that in any case, the determination of the propriety of fines for violation of offenses lies within the discretion of the legislature.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Respondents add that neither is the solidary liability imposed by law unreasonable because such arises only from the participatory acts of the directors and officers who are responsible for the formulation and implementation of policies contrary to the mandates of R.A. No. 10932 and pertains only to damages which may be awarded to the patient­-complainant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>Respondents likewise defend the validity of the presumption of liability clause on the argument that the liability therein mentioned pertains to the liability for the death, permanent disability, serious impairment, injury or loss of the unborn child and that such presumption arises only upon prior proof that there was denial of admission to the health facility and that such denial was made pursuant to a policy of demanding deposits for confinement or treatment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>Addressing the supposed violation of the equal protection clause, respondents maintain that patients classified as "poor", "indigent", or "marginalized" substantially differ from those who are not categorized as such, hence the provision on PhilHealth reimbursement, PCSO assistance and tax deduction must be upheld in the face of the equal protection challenge.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br><center><b>Issues</b><br></center><br>Before the Court addresses the questions of constitutionality raised against certain provisions of R.A. No. 10932, it is imperative to first determine whether the Court, in fact, can discharge its power of judicial review. This is, in turn, determined by addressing the following issues: (a) are petitions for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition proper to assail the constitutionality of R.A. No. 10932; (b) is direct resort to the Court proper; (c) has petitioner, as an association of privately-owned hospitals, clinics and other health facilities, the requisite legal standing; and (c) is the petition ripe for adjudication.<br><br><center><b>Ruling of the Court</b><br></center><br>We dismiss the petition. While the remedies of <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition are proper legal vehicles to assail the constitutionality of a law, the requirements for the exercise of the Court's judicial review even under its expanded jurisdiction must nevertheless first be satisfied.<br><br><center><b>Propriety of <i>Certiorari</i> and Prohibition</b><br></center><br>Petitioner seeks to declare as unconstitutional certain provisions of R.A. No. 10932 and for this purpose, availed of the remedy of <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition. Respondents counter that <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition are available only against judicial, quasi-judicial or ministerial functions and not against legislative acts, as in the instant case.<br><br>The rule is settled that the allegations in the complaint and the character of the relief sought determine the nature of the action and the court that has jurisdiction over it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> The present petition specifically alleges that R.A. No. 10932 is unconstitutional for being violative of substantive due process, the presumption of innocence, and the equal protection of laws and as such, seeks that the enforcement and implementation thereof be prohibited.<br><br>Under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, the ground for review in <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition is grave abuse of discretion, and there is grave abuse of discretion when an act is <i>done contrary to the Constitution</i>, the law or jurisprudence or executed whimsically, capriciously or arbitrarily, out of malice, ill will or personal bias.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Petitions for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition are thus appropriate remedies to raise constitutional questions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>Grave abuse of discretion as a ground for review does not only appear under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court but also under Section 1,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Article VIII of the Constitution defining judicial power. As constitutionally defined, judicial power includes not only the duty to settle actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable, but also, the duty to determine whether or not there has been grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the government. Such innovation under the 1987 Constitution later on became known as the Court's "traditional jurisdiction" and "expanded jurisdiction," respectively.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>Given the commonality of the ground of grave abuse of discretion, the Court has allowed the use of a Rule 65 petition to invoke this Court's expanded jurisdiction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>As expressly granted by the Constitution, the Court's expanded jurisdiction when invoked permits a review of acts not only by a tribunal, board or officer exercising judicial, quasi-judicial or ministerial functions, but also by any branch or instrumentality of the Government. "Any branch or instrumentality of the Government" necessarily includes the legislative and the executive, even if they are not exercising judicial, quasi-judicial or ministerial functions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>In <i>Pedro Agcaoili, Jr., et al. v. The Honorable Representative Rodolfo C. Fariñas, et al.</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> we affirmed the availability of the extraordinary writs for determining and correcting grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of the legislative and executive branches following <i>Judge Villanueva v. Judicial and Bar Council</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> as follows:<br><blockquote>With respect to the Court, however, the remedies of <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition are necessarily broader in scope and reach, and the writ of <i>certiorari</i> or prohibition may be issued to correct errors of jurisdiction committed not only by a tribunal, corporation, board or officer exercising judicial, quasi-judicial or ministerial functions but also to set right, undo and restrain any act of grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction by any branch or instrumentality of the Government, even if the latter does not exercise judicial, quasi-judicial or ministerial functions. This application is expressly authorized by the text of the second paragraph of Section 1, <i>supra</i>.<br><br>Thus, petitions for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition are appropriate remedies to raise <b>constitutional issues and to review and/or prohibit or nullify the acts of legislative and executive officials</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> (Citation omitted and emphasis ours)<br></blockquote>Accordingly, we held as proper remedies the writs of <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition in <i>Samahan ng mga Progresibong Kabataan (SPARK), et al. v. Quezon City, as represented by Mayor Herbert Bautista, et al.</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> assailing the constitutionality of curfew ordinances and in <i>Agcaoili</i> questioning the contempt powers of the Congress in the exercise of its power of inquiry in aid of legislation. Following this trend in jurisprudence, petitioner therefore correctly availed of <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court to assail the constitutionality of R.A.

As such, PHAPi is not directly subject to the provisions of Republic Act No. (RA) 10932,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and consequently, does not stand to suffer a real and apparent threat or injury so as to demonstrate its <i>locus standi</i> to file this petition. To be sure, while it claims that it represents the interests of its member hospitals, records are bereft of any showing that it was specifically authorized to file this case on their behalf. Hence, PHAPi's conveyed interests, through the distinct manner of argumentation in the petition, can only be attributed as its own.<br><br>Furthermore, there appears to be no actual justiciable controversy that would sanction a review of the assailed provisions of RA 10932. Among others, PHAPi does not allege that any of its represented hospitals employs the deposit policy prohibited under RA 10932. Neither does PHAPi claim that a patient was refused admission by virtue of such policy nor was it shown that a claim has been filed based on the said law. As jurisprudence states, the need to prove an actual justiciable controversy is not merely an idle procedural requirement, but a clear safeguard to ensure that the courts do not unduly intrude into the areas specifically reserved to the other branches of government.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> The Court's exercise of judicial review on a hypothetical and theoretical situation runs the danger of it prematurely supplanting the wisdom of Congress with its own.<br><br><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, I vote to <b>DISMISS</b> the petition.<br><br><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="noshade" align="LEFT"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Garcia v.

This case is indeed not ripe for judicial review.<br><br>Canonical for the exercise of judicial review when the constitutionality of a law is being questioned are these requirements: first, there must be an actual case or controversy involving legal rights that are capable of judicial determination; second, the parties raising the issue must have <i>locus standi</i>; third, the constitutionality of the law must be raised at the earliest opportunity; and fourth, resolving the issue on constitutionality must be essential to the disposition of the case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br><center><b>I</b><br></center><br>There is no actual case or controversy in the case at bar.<br><br>The requirement for an actual case or controversy is fundamental. This is based on Article VIII, Section 1 of the 1987 Constitution:<br><blockquote>Section 1. The judicial power shall be vested in one Supreme Court and in such lower courts as may be established by law.<br><br>Judicial power includes the duty of the courts of justice to settle <i>actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandabie and enforceable</i>, and to determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>An actual case or controversy means that there are conflicting legal rights, such that the legal claim of one party is opposed to the legal claim of another, and it is capable of being resolved by the courts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> It is necessary that the conflicting legal rights must be real and concrete, not merely hypothetical or conjectural.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><blockquote>It is well-established in this jurisdiction that . . . for a court to exercise its power of adjudication, there must be an actual case or controversy — one which involves a conflict of legal rights, an assertion of opposite legal claims susceptible of judicial resolution; . . . In other words, the pleadings must show <i>an active antagonistic assertion of a legal right, on the one hand, and a denial thereof on the other</i>; that is, it must concern a real and not a merely theoretical question or issue. There ought to be an <i>actual and substantial controversy admitting of specific relief through a decree conclusive in nature</i>, as distinguished from an opinion advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Thus, there must first be a real and material act affecting another, which one party asserts is done within the bounds allowed by law, but which another contends is injurious to his or her right. If there is yet no such act, or when such acts are merely conjecture, there is no actual case or controversy. In case of a governmental act, the party asserting its unconstitutionality must allege the actual act performed by the government that caused it the injury.<br><br>In <i>Lozano v. Nograles</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> this Court explained:<br><blockquote>An aspect of the "case-or-controversy" requirement is the requisite of "<b>ripeness</b>". In the United States, courts are centrally concerned with whether a case involves uncertain contingent future events that may not occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all. Another approach is the evaluation of the <b>twofold</b> aspect of ripeness: first, the fitness of the issues for judicial decision; and second, the hardship to the parties entailed by withholding court consideration. In our jurisdiction, the issue of ripeness is generally treated in terms of <i>actual injury</i> to the plaintiff. Hence, a question is ripe for adjudication when the act being challenged has had a <i>direct adverse effect</i> on the individual challenging it. An alternative road to review similarly taken would be to determine whether an <i>action has already been accomplished or performed by a branch of government before the courts may step in</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)<br></blockquote>The requirement of an actual case or controversy is rooted on the respect for the separation of powers of the three branches of the government. Courts cannot supplant the discretionary acts of the legislative or the executive branch on the premise that they know of a wiser, more just, or expedient policy or course of action.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> They may only act in case the other branches acted outside the bounds of their powers or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.<br><br>The other reason for requiring an actual case or controversy is to maintain the significance of this Court's role in making "final and binding construction[s] of law."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Courts do not render mere advisory opinions. Judicial decisions are part of the legal system,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> and thus, have binding effects on actual persons, places, and things. Ruling on hypothetical situations with no bearing on any matter will weaken the import of this Court's issuances. In <i>Belgica, et al. v. Ochoa</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><blockquote>Basic in litigation raising constitutional issues is the requirement that there must be an actual case or controversy. This Court cannot render an advisory opinion. We assume that the Constitution binds all other constitutional departments, instrumentalities, and organs. We are aware that in the exercise of their various powers, they do interpret the text of the Constitution in the light of contemporary needs that they should address. A policy that reduces this Court to an adviser for official acts by the other departments that have not yet been done would unnecessarily tax our resources. It is inconsistent with our role as final arbiter and adjudicator and weakens the entire system of the Rule of Law. Our power of judicial review is a duty to make a final and binding construction of law. This power should generally be reserved when the departments have exhausted any and all acts that would remedy any perceived violation of right. The rationale that defines the extent of our doctrines laying down exceptions to our rules on justiciability are clear: Not only should the pleadings show a convincing violation of a right, but the impact should be shown to be so grave, imminent, and irreparable that any delayed exercise of judicial review or deference would undermine fundamental principles that should be enjoyed by the party complaining or the constituents that they legitimately represent.<br><br>The requirement of an "actual case," thus, means that the case before this Court "involves a conflict of legal rights, an assertion of opposite legal claims susceptible of judicial resolution; the case must not be moot or academic based on extra-legal or other similar considerations not cognizable by a court of justice." Furthermore, "the controversy needs to be definite and concrete, bearing upon the legal relations of parties who are pitted against each other due to their adverse legal interests." Thus, the adverse position of the parties must be sufficient enough for the case to be pleaded and for this Court to be able to provide the parties the proper relief/s prayed for.<br><br>The requirement of an 'actual case' will ensure that this Court will not issue advisory opinions. It prevents us from using the immense power of judicial review absent a party that can sufficiently argue from a standpoint with real and substantial interests.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Moreover, hypothetical or conjectural situations illicitly widen the courts' discretion such that future parties who present claims on the law being interpreted may be unduly affected by the limitations set, without affording them the opportunity to be heard, thus:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><blockquote>An advisory opinion is one where the factual setting is conjectural or hypothetical. In such cases, the conflict will not have sufficient concreteness or adversariness so as to constrain the discretion of this Court. After all, legal arguments from concretely lived facts are chosen narrowly by the parties. Those who bring theoretical cases will have no such limits. They can argue up to the level of absurdity. They will bind the future parties who may have more motives to choose specific legal arguments. In other words, for there to be a real conflict between the parties, <i>there must exist actual facts from which courts can properly determine whether there has been a breach of constitutional text</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote>Thus, in cases where the constitutionality of a law is being questioned, it is not enough that the law or the regulation has been passed or is in effect. To rule on the constitutionality of provisions in the law without an actual case is to decide only the basis of the mere enactment of the statute. This amounts to a ruling on the wisdom of the policy imposed by the Congress on the subject matter of the law.<br><br>In <i>Southern Hemisphere Engagement Network, Inc. v. Anti-Terrorism Council</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> this Court ruled that it is not enough that there is &amp; possibility of abuse of the questioned enactment. There must first be an actual act of abuse.<br><br>In <i>Republic of the Philippines v. Herminio Harry Roque, et al.</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> this Court said that the parties presented no actual case or controversy because they did not show any government action implementing the questioned statute against them.<br><br>In <i>Philippine Bus Operators Association of the Philippines v. Department of Labor and Employment</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> this Court ruled that it is not enough that the issuances may result in a diminution of the bus drivers and conductors' income, considering that the allegations are based on speculation.<br><br>In <i>Philippine Press Institute, Inc. v. Commission on Elections</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> the petitioner in that case did not assert a specific act committed against it by the Commission on Elections in enforcing or implementing the questioned law. This Court found that there was no actual case or controversy.<br><br>An allegation of grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction is insufficient.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> If there is no exercise of discretion, it could not have been gravely abused.<br><br>In the case at bar, petitioner failed to show that any violation of its rights was committed as a consequence of the enactment of Republic Act No. 10932. The law itself has not been enforced against petitioner or its members. In fact, petitioner's allegation is that there is <i>a risk or a threat</i> that its members will be obligated and sanctioned by the enactment of the law. Thus, there is yet no act committed by petitioner showing any breach of the statute, and there is yet no act of enforcement or sanction against it. There is no injury yet suffered by petitioner. The sanctions they alleged are still in the realm of imagination.<br><br><center><b>II</b><br></center><br>I also agree that petitioner failed to show that it has the required <i>locus standi</i> to file the petition.<br><br>As an association which represents private hospitals, petitioner is a third party to the instant case. Thus, before it may file the petition, it must show that it is compliant with the requisites for third-party standing.<br><br>Another requisite for this Court's exercise of judicial review is that the party filing must have <i>locus standi</i> or legal standing to file the suit, thus:<br><blockquote>Legal standing or <i>locus standi</i> is the "right of appearance in a court of justice on a given question." To possess legal standing, parties must show "a personal and substantial interest in the case such that [they have] sustained or will sustain direct injury as a result of the governmental act that is being challenged." The requirement of direct injury guarantees that the party who brings suit has such personal stake in the outcome of the controversy and, in effect, assures "that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court depends for illumination of difficult constitutional questions."<br><br>. . . .<br><br><br>Whether a suit is public or private, the parties must have "a present substantial interest," not a "mere expectancy or a future, contingent, subordinate, or consequential interest." Those who bring the suit must possess their own right to the relief sought.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>The party filing must show that it has a substantial interest in the case such that it was or will be directly affected or injured by the challenged governmental act.<br><br>However, this Court has given leeway to petitions filed by parties who have no personal or substantial interest in the challenged governmental act but nonetheless raise "constitutional issue[s] of critical significance."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br><br>The substantiality and directness of the injury is reckoned from the point of view of petitioner. Thus, this Court has allowed suits to be filed by taxpayers in cases where there is a claim of an unconstitutional tax measure or illegal disbursement of public funds. Cases filed by voters who show an obvious interest in the validity of the questioned election law have been allowed. Courts have likewise taken cognizance of cases filed by legislators in petitions where they claim that their prerogative as legislators have been infringed upon.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>In a very limited subset of cases, this Court has allowed a party to bring a suit on behalf of another. However, for this Court to accept that the third party has the standing to file the case, the following requisites must be present: first, the party filing the suit "must have suffered an 'injury-in-fact', thus [has] a "sufficiently concrete interest" in the outcome of the issue in dispute; [second, he or she] must have a close relation to the third party; and [third, the third party is prevented by] some hindrance . . . to protect his or her own interest."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Associations have been able to file petitions on behalf of its members on the basis of third-party standing.<br><br>In <i>Pharmaceutical and Health Care Association of the Philippines v. Secretary of Health</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> this Court found that an association "has the legal personality to represent its members because the results of the case will affect their vital interests,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> thus:<br><blockquote>This [modern] view fuses the legal identity of an association with that of its members. An association has standing to file suit for its workers despite its lack of direct interest if its members are affected by the action. An organization has standing to assert the concerns of its constituents.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>. . . We note that, under its Articles of Incorporation, the respondent was organized . . . to act as the representative of any individual, company, entity or association on matters related to the manpower recruitment industry, and to perform other acts and activities necessary to accomplish the purposes embodied therein. The respondent is, thus, the appropriate party to assert the rights of its members, because it and its members are in every practical sense identical . . . The respondent [association] is but the medium through which its individual members seek to make more effective the expression of their voices and the redress of their grievances.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> (Citation omitted)<br></blockquote>However, associations must sufficiently establish who their members are, that their members authorized them to sue on their behalf, and that they would be directly injured by the challenged governmental acts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>In <i>Philippine Bus Operators Association of the Philippines vs. Department of Labor and Employment</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> this Court did not allow the association to represent its members because it failed to establish the presence of these requirements. There was no evidence of board resolutions or articles of incorporation showing that it was authorized to file the petition. It noted that some of the associations even had their certificates of incorporation revoked by the Securities and Exchange Commission. This Court ruled that it was not enough that they alleged that they were an association that represented members who would be directly injured by the implementation of a law, thus:<br><blockquote>The associations in <i>Pharmaceutical and Health Care Association of the Philippines, Holy Spirit Homeowners Association, Inc.</i>, and <i>The Executive Secretary</i> were allowed to sue on behalf of their members because they sufficiently established who their members were, that their members authorized the associations to sue on their behalf, and that the members would be directly injured by the challenged governmental acts.<br><br>The liberality of this Court to grant standing for associations or corporations whose members are those who suffer direct and substantial injury depends on a few factors.<br><br>In all these cases, there must be an actual controversy. Furthermore, there should also be a clear and convincing demonstration of special reasons why the truly injured parties may not be able to sue.<br><br>Alternatively, there must be a similarly clear and convincing demonstration that the representation of the association is more efficient for the petitioners to bring. They must further show that it is more efficient for this Court to hear only one voice from the association. <br><br>In other words, the association should show special reasons for bringing the action themselves rather than as a class suit, allowed when the subject matter of the controversy is one of common or general interest to many persons. In a class suit, a number of the members of the class are permitted to sue and to defend for the benefit of all the members so long as they are sufficiently numerous and representative of the class to which they belong.<br><br>In some circumstances similar to those in <i>White Light</i>, the third parties represented by the petitioner would have special and legitimate reasons why they may not bring the action themselves. Understandably, the cost to patrons in the <i>White Light</i> case to bring the action themselves—i.e., the amount they would pay for the lease of the motels—will be too small compared with the cost of the suit. But viewed in another way, whoever among the patrons files the case even for its transcendental interest endows benefits on a substantial number of interested parties without recovering their costs. This is the free rider problem in economics. It is a negative externality which operates as a disincentive to sue and assert a transcendental right.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br></blockquote>In <i>Executive Secretary v. The Hon. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> the Asian Recruitment Council Philippine Chapter, Inc. was found to have standing to file the petition for declaratory relief on behalf of its member recruitment agencies because it proved through board resolutions that it was authorized to sue on the behalf of its members. It was able to show that it was the medium used by the members to effectively communicate their grievances.<br><br>Allegations of transcendental importance are not enough to allow exceptions to <i>locus standi</i>.<br><br>In <i>Francisco v. House of Representatives</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> this Court enumerated factors that determine if an issue is of transcendental importance.<br><blockquote>There being no doctrinal definition of transcendental importance, the following determinants formulated by former Supreme Court Justice Florentino P. Feliciano are instructive: (1) the character of the funds or other assets involved in the case; (2) the presence of a clear case of disregard of a constitutional or statutory prohibition by the public respondent agency or instrumentality of the government; and (3) the lack of any other party with a more direct and specific interest in raising the questions being raised.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Moreover, there must also be a showing of a "clear or imminent threat to fundamental rights" and of "proper parties suffering real, actual or more imminent injury,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> thus:<br><blockquote>In addition to an actual controversy, special reasons to represent, and disincentives for the injured party to bring the suit themselves, there must be a showing of the transcendent nature of the right involved.<br><br>Only constitutional rights shared by many and requiring a grounded level of urgency can be transcendent. For instance, in <i>The Association of Small Landowners in the Philippines, Inc. v. Secretary of Agrarian Reform</i>, the association was allowed to file on behalf of its members considering the importance of the issue involved, i.e., the constitutionality of agrarian reform measures, specifically, of then newly enacted Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law.<br><br>This Court is not a forum to appeal political and policy choices made by the Executive, Legislative, and other constitutional agencies and organs. This Court dilutes its role in a democracy if it is asked to substitute its political wisdom for the wisdom of accountable and representative bodies where there is no unmistakable democratic deficit. It cannot lose this place in the constitutional order. Petitioners' invocation of our jurisdiction and the justiciability of their claims must be presented with rigor. Transcendental interest is not a talisman to blur the lines of authority drawn by our most fundamental law.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>Again, the reasons cited—the "far-reaching consequences" and "wide area of coverage and extent of effect" of Department Order No. 118-12 and Memorandum Circular No. 2012-001—are reasons not transcendent considering that most administrative issuances of the national government are of wide coverage.

To emphasize, an actual case or controversy which justifies the Court's exercise of its judicial review power necessitates an existing case or controversy that is appropriate or ripe for determination, and not merely an anticipatory controversy.<br><br><i>The petitioner has no locus standi to question the constitutionality of RA 10932.</i><br><br>That is not all. Again, in order for the Court to exercise its power of judicial review, the person or entity challenging the act must have standing to challenge — he must have a <b>personal and substantial interest</b> in the case such that he has sustained, or will sustain, <u><b>direct injury</b></u> as a result of its enforcement.<br><br>Defined as a right of appearance in a court of justice on a given question, <i>locus standi</i> requires that a party alleges such <b>personal stake</b> in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that <b>concrete adverseness</b> which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court depends for illumination of difficult constitutional questions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Unless a person has sustained or is in imminent danger of sustaining an injury as a result of an act complained of, such proper party has no standing.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Applying the foregoing in the instant case, it is crystal clear that <b>petitioner PHAPi has no legal standing to question the constitutionality of RA 10932</b> — as it does not stand to sustain any damage or injury of a direct and personal nature in the implementation of RA 10932.<br><br>Under RA 10932, only officials, medical practitioners, and/or medical institutions that actually demand/accept any form of advance payment as a prerequisite for confinement/medical treatment of a patient in emergency situations or refuse to administer medical treatment and support as dictated by good practice of medicine to prevent death/permanent disability are subjected to potential liability under the law.<br><br>Emphasis must be placed on the fact that petitioner PHAPi is <u><b>not</b></u> a medical institution that administers medical treatment, being an association with a completely separate juridical personality from its members. With petitioner PHAPi being a juridical person endowed with a distinct personality of its own, it is clear that any potential liability that may be imposed upon any of the petitioner's member hospitals, clinics, and facilities will <u>NOT</u> be a liability of petitioner PHAPi.<br><br>Restating the obvious, petitioner PHAPi will sustain no direct and personal injury from the implementation of RA 10932; it has no personal stake in the issues raised in the Petition. Hence, the requisite of <i>locus standi</i> is completely lacking, warranting the outright dismissal of the instant Petition.<br><br><i>Section 1 of RA 10932 is not violative of the Constitution.</i><br><br>Nevertheless, even if the abovementioned matters were to be swept aside for the sake of liberality, the instant Petition should nonetheless be dismissed as it is bereft of substantive merit.<br><br>The petitioner argues that Section 1<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> of RA 10932 transgresses the Constitution because it purportedly imposes upon medical institutions and medical practitioners the untenable and impossible duty of actually preventing the death or permanent disability of a patient, or, in the case of a pregnant woman, permanent injury or loss of her unborn child, or non-institutional delivery. The petitioner posits the view that the aforementioned provision of the law is violative of due process as it goes against the jurisprudential doctrine that a physician is not an insurer of the good result of treatment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>The petitioner's interpretation of RA 10932 is mistaken.<br><br>The essence of RA 10932 is to prohibit medical institutions/practitioners from requesting or accepting any deposit or any other form of payment as a prerequisite for administering basic emergency care, confinement, or medical treatment of a patient, or to refuse to administer medical treatment and support as dictated by good practice of medicine to prevent death, or permanent disability, or, in the case of a pregnant woman, permanent injury or loss of her unborn child, or non-institutional delivery, <u>only in emergency or serious cases</u> and <u>only if the medical institution or practitioner has adequate medical capabilities to administer treatment</u>.<br><br>By reason of inadequacy of the medical capabilities of the hospital or medical clinic, the attending physician may transfer the patient to a facility where the appropriate care can be given, after the patient or his next of kin consents to said transfer and after the receiving hospital or medical clinic agrees to the transfer.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Hence, contrary to the specious interpretation of the petitioner, Section 1 of RA 10932 does not mandate whatsoever that physicians be insurers of the good result of treatment. The law merely imposes on medical institutions/practitioners the strict duty to administer basic emergency care, as defined under the law, only with respect to persons in emergency or serious situations, and when the medical institutions/practitioners have the capability to administer such treatment.<br><br><i>Further, Section 4 of RA 10932 is also not violative of the Constitution.</i><br><br>The petitioner likewise argues that the fines and penalties imposed under Section 4<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> of RA 10932 are constitutionally infirm becafuse they are supposedly unjust, excessive, and oppressive; the penalties set by the law are allegedly not commensurate to the act or omission being penalized.</div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br></div><div align="JUSTIFY">This argument deserves scant consideration.<br><br>The penalties as prescribed by statute are essentially and exclusively legislative; the courts should not encroach on the prerogative of the lawmaking body.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> As pronounced by the Court early on in <i>United States v.

The observance of RA 10932 may very well determine whether a patient experiencing an emergency health situation will survive or perish. The grave consequences involved cannot be overstated; a patient's life hangs in the balance. Further, the legislature's desire to impose strict penalties upon violators of RA 10932 is in fealty to the constitutional mandate that the State shall protect and promote the right to health of the people.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Hence, the petitioner's attempt to assail the constitutionality of Section 4 of RA 10932 must also fall.<br><br><i>Furthermore, Section 5 of RA 10932 likewise does not violate the Constitution.</i><br><br>Section 5 of RA 10932 (Presumption of Liability Clause) states:<br><blockquote>SEC. 5. <i>Presumption of Liability</i>. — In the event of death, permanent disability, serious impairment of the health condition of the patient-complainant, or in the case of a pregnant woman, permanent injury or loss of her unborn child, proceeding from the denial of his or her admission to a health facility pursuant to a policy or practice of demanding deposits or advance payments for confinement or treatment, a presumption of liability shall arise against the hospital, medical clinic, and the official, medical practitioner, or employee involved.<br></blockquote>The petitioner finds Section 5, which makes the erring medical institution and/or practitioner <i>prima facie</i> liable for medical malpractice, unconstitutional on the notion that, in medical malpractice cases, the plaintiff must prove that the medical practitioner failed to do what a reasonably prudent doctor would have done or did what a reasonably prudent doctor would not have done. The petitioner adds that medical malpractice must be proven with reasonable medical probability based on competent expert testimony and that proximate cause of injury/death must be established.<br><br>These arguments are mistaken.<br><br>Under Section 5 of RA 10932, the presumption of liability on the part of the medical practitioner/institution arises <u><b><i>only when</i></b></u> death, permanent disability, serious impairment of the health condition of the patient-complainant, or, in the case of a pregnant woman, permanent injury or loss of her unborn child, occurs after the denial by the medical institution/practitioner of the emergency patient's admission to the health facility during an emergency/serious situation, pursuant to an established policy/practice of demanding deposits/advance payments for confinement or treatment.<br><br>In the context of medical malpractice, Section 5 creates a presumption of negligence on the part of the medical institution/practitioner when the latter commits a violation of law, <i>i.e.</i>, the act of denying the emergency patient's admission to the health facility during an emergency/serious situation pursuant to an established policy/practice of demanding deposits/advance payments for confinement or treatment, which RA 10932 considers a violation of law.<br><br><i>The presumption of negligence when a statutory duty has been violated.</i><br><br>While the petitioner posits the view that this is unconstitutional because the plaintiff, in medical malpractice cases, must first prove that negligence was indeed committed, it should be noted that under Philippine law, the violation of a statutory duty may be treated either as a circumstance which establishes a presumption of negligence, negligence per se, or a circumstance which should be considered together with other circumstances as evidence of negligence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>The Court held in <i>F.F.
