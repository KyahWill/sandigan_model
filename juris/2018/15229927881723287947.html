The fact that the poseur-buyer, through the CI, solicited morphine from appellant is not prohibited by aw and does not render the buy bust operation invalid as, under prevailing jurisprudence, "a police officer's act of soliciting drugs from the accused during a buy-bust operation, or what is known as a 'decoy solicitation,' is not prohibited by law and does not render the buy-bust operation invalid."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br>However, while there was a valid buy-bust operation, the Court finds that the prosecution failed to establish an unbroken chain of custody of the seized items, <i>i.e.</i>, there were missing links.<br><br><b><i>The Prosecution failed to establish an unbroken chain of custody of the seized items.</i></b><br><br>Chain of custody is "the duly recorded authorized movements and custody of seized drugs or controlled chemicals or plant sources of dangerous drugs or laboratory equipment of each stage, from the time of seizure/confiscation to receipt in the forensic laboratory to safekeeping, to presentation in court for destruction."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>Section 21 Article II of RA 9165, as amended by RA 10640,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> reads:<br><blockquote>Section 21. Custody and Disposition of Confiscated, Seized, and/or Surrendered Dangerous Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous Drugs. Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, Instruments/Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment. - The PDEA shall take charge and have custody of all dangerous drugs, x x x so confiscated, seized and/or surrendered, for proper disposition in the following manner:<br><br>(i) The apprehending team having initial custody and control of the dangerous drugs, x x x shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, conduct a physical inventory of the seized items and photograph the same in the presence of.the accused or the persons from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, with an elected public official and a representative of the National Prosecution Service or the media who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof; <i>Provided</i>, That the physical inventory and photograph shall be conducted at the place where the search warrant is served; or at the nearest police station or at the nearest office of the apprehending officer/team, whichever is practicable, in case of warrantless seizures: <i>Provided, finally</i>, That noncompliance of these requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and invalid such seizures and custody over said items.<br><br>(2) Within twenty-four (24) hour upon confiscation/seizure of dangerous drugs, x xx the same shall be submitted to the PDEA Forensic Laboratory for a qualitative and quantitative examination;<br><br>(3) A certification of the forensic laboratory examination results x x x shall be issued immediately upon the receipt of the subject item/s: <i>Provided</i>, That when the volume of dangerous drugs, x x x does not allow the completion of testing within the time frame, a partial laboratory examination report shall be provisionally issued stating therein the quantities of dangerous drugs still to be examined by the forensic laboratory: Provided, however, That a final certification shall be issued immediately upon completion of the said examination and certification;<br></blockquote>The Court has consistently ruled that each link in the chain of custody rule must be sufficiently proved by the prosecution and examined with careful scrutiny by the court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> The prosecution has the burden to show "every link in the chain, from the moment the dangerous drug was seized from the accused until the time it is offered in court as evidence."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> Failure to strictly comply with rules of procedure, however, does not <i>ipso facto</i> invalidate or render void the seizure and custody over the items as long as the prosecution is able to show that "(a) there is justifiable ground for non­compliance; and (b) the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> Thus, in case the police officers fail to strictly comply with the rules of procedure, they must be able to "explain the reasons behind the procedural lapses, and that the integrity and value of the seized evidence had nonetheless been preserved x x x because the Court cannot presume what these grounds are or that they even exist."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> In other words, taking into consideration the difficulty of complete compliance with the chain of custody requirement, the Court has considered substantial compliance sufficient "as long as the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending police officers."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><br>In this case, it was established by the testimonies of the prosecution's witnesses and the stipulation of facts agreed by the parties that PO3 Jimenea and SPO4 Rosales marked the seized items with their initials at the police station; that PO3 Jimenea turned over the seized items to SPO1 Gallego; that after the seized items were turned over to him, SPO1 Gallego marked and photographed them;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> that an Inventory<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> of the seized items was then made in the presence of appellant and the representatives of the media and the DOJ; that SPO1 Gallego then prepared a Request for the Laboratory Examination<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> of the seized vials, which were then brought to the crime laboratory on the same day; that PCI Diestro examined the specimen she received; and that her findings were reduced into writing in the Chemistry Report.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup><br><br>No testimonies or stipulations, however, were made on the details of the turnover of the seized vials from the police station to the crime laboratory, and the turnover and submission of the same from the crime laboratory to the court, as only the following facts were stipulated:<br><blockquote>In today's trial, the proposed testimony of [SPO1 Gallego] was dispensed with and [the] parties agreed to stipulate the following: that he was the investigator in this case; that he took cognizance of this case by virtue of the Investigation Report - Exhibit "L[;]" that he received the person of the [appellant], twenty pieces/vials of Morphine Sulfate - Exhibit "B[;]" one big vial [Decaject] 200; two syringe[s] - Exhibit "C;" five pieces of P100.00 bills Exhibit "H[;]" picture Exhibit "J[;]" linger prints Exhibit "N[;]" Inventory Exhibit "I[;]" that he prepared the forwarding report - Exhibit "M[;]" and that he has no personal knowledge as to the actual exchange of the buy-bust money and the dangerous drugs and the articles. x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br><br>In today's trial, the testimony of the first witness for the prosecution, [PCI Diestro] was dispensed with and the parties agreed to stipulate on the following: that the witness is an expert in the field of forensic chemistry; that she was assigned at the PNP Crime Laboratory Office No. 9 on October 14, 2006; that on said date, their office received a request for laboratory examination from the [RIID-SOG], Exhibit "A;" Twenty (20) pieces/vials of Morphine Sulfate, one (1) big vial Decaject 200 - Exhibit "B," which she examined and gave positive result for the presence of methamphetamine hydrochloride, a dangerous drug, whose findings were reduced into writing in Chemistry Report No. D-158-2006, marked as Exhibit "E;" that the said witness has no personal knowledge as to the source of the specimen. x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br></blockquote>From the foregoing, it is very evident that the prosecution in dispensing with the testimonies of SPO1 Gallego, the investigating officer, and PCI Diestro, the forensic chemist, failed to show every link of the chain of custody. Without the testimonies or stipulations stating the details on when and how the seized vials were brought to the crime laboratory, and thereafter, to the court, as well as the details on who actually delivered and received the same from the police station to the crime laboratory, and later, to the court for the prosecution's presentation of evidence, the Court cannot ascertain whether the seized vials presented in evidence were the same vials seized from appellant when he was arrested. These gaps in the chain of custody create doubt as to whether the <i>corpus delicti</i> of the crime had been properly preserved. And more importantly, although appellant was charged with violation of Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 for selling vials of morphine and Nandrolone Decanoate, the parties however stipulated, per August 4, 2008 Order of the RTC, that the items seized from appellant yielded positive results for the presence of methamphetamine hydrochloride or <i>shabu</i>. Clearly, the identity of the <i>corpus delicti</i> of the crime had not been properly established.<br><br>The prosecution likewise failed to give an explanation or a justifiable reason why the apprehending police officers had failed to mark the seized items and conduct the physical inventory of the same at the place where the appellant was arrested. It bears stressing that the marking of the apprehending police officers' initials or signatures on the seized items must be made in the presence of the accused immediately upon arrest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> And although the Chain of Custody Rule allows the physical inventory of the seized items to be done at the nearest police station, this is more of an exception than a rule. Police officers, therefore, must provide an explanation to justify their failure to conduct the marking and the physical inventory at the place of arrest.<br><br>The Court also noticed that, although the prosecution stipulated that SPO1 Gallego conducted the inventory,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> the Certificate of Inventory<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> was signed by a certain PI Domingo.<br><br>Considering all the foregoing, the Court finds that the prosecution failed to (1) prove the <i>corpus delicti</i> of the crime; (2) establish an unbroken chain of custody of the seized drugs; and (3) offer any explanation why the Chain of Custody Rule was not complied with. Accordingly, the Com1 is constrained to acquit appellant based on reasonable doubt.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appeal is <b>GRANTED</b>.
