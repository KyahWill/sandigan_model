				<BR><BR><div align="justify">By petition for <i>certiorari </i>and
 prohibition, petitioner Career Executive Service Board (CESB), through 
its then Executive Director Maria Anthonette Velasco-Allones, assails 
COA Decision No. 2010-121 rendered on November 19, 2010 by the 
Commission on Audit (COA) affirming the Notice of Disallowance (ND) 
issued by the Audit Team Leader (ATL) vis-a-vis the payment of the 
monetary benefits for Calendar Years (CY) 2002 and 2003 to its covered 
officials and employees out of the CESB's savings.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><p>
 The CESB asserts herein that COA Decision No. 2010-121 was null and 
void for having been issued with grave abuse of discretion amounting to 
lack or excess of jurisdiction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> </p><p align="center"> <b>Antecedents</b>
  </p><p> The CESB granted to its officials and employees various 
monetary benefits in CY 2002 and CY 2003 pursuant to Section 2, Article V
 of the Collective Negotiation Agreement (CNA) it had entered into with 
the Samahan ng Kawaning Nagkakaisa sa Diwa, Gawa at Nilalayon 
(SANDIGAN), a duly accredited organization of its employees. 
  </p><p>Section 2, Article V of the CNA stipulated as follows:   
  </p><blockquote>
    <p><b>Section 2. Monetary Benefits. </b>The [CESB] SECRETARIAT shall
 grant all CESB employees the following benefits, subject to existing

  </blockquote>
  <p> Upon post-audit, respondent ATL issued Audit Observation 
Memorandum (AOM) No. 2003 AAR-12, dated February 11, 2004, assailing the
 legality of the grant of benefits. </p><p> In due time, the Director of the Legal and Adjudication Office-Â­National (LAO-N) issued ND No. 2004-67 dated November 9, 2004,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> to wit: 
  </p><blockquote>
    <p> We have audited the Audit Observation Memorandum (AOM) No. 2003 
AAR-12 dated February 11, 2004 and the accompanying supporting

Board, Quezon City relative to the payment of monetary benefits like 
Birthday Bonus, Fringe Benefits, Christmas Grocery and Retirement Pay in
 the total amount of P2,386,000.00 to its rank and files (sic) 
employees. The result of our audit shows that the payment of said 
monetary benefits has no legal support.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> On December 10, 2004, the CESB's Executive Director, Mary Ann Z. 
Fernandez-Mendoza, filed a request dated November 9, 2004 seeking the 
reconsideration of ND No. 2004-67.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> However, the LAO-N denied the request for reconsideration through Decision Number 2005-134 dated April 22, 2005.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> </p><p> The CESB appealed,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> but the LAO-N denied the appeal through Resolution No. 2005-134A dated November 22, 2005.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> </p><p> Ultimately, respondent COA rendered the assailed Decision No. 2010- 121 to affirm ND No. 2004-67 dated November 9, 2004.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></p><p> Hence, this present recourse.</p><p align="center"> <b>Issues</b>
  </p><p> The CESB defines the issues to be resolved, as follows:   
  </p><ol start="" type="a"><li> Whether respondent COA committed grave abuse of discretion when
 it affirmed the recommendation of the Audit Team Leader (ATL) and the 
Supervising Auditor (SA) disallowing the monetary benefits granted by 
the petitioner;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> and <br><br></li><li> Whether respondent COA committed grave abuse of discretion when
 it ordered the refund of the amounts received by the CESB employees.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>
    </li></ol>
  <p align="center"> <b>Ruling of the Court</b>
  </p><p> The Court finds that the respondents did not gravely abused 
their discretion in disallowing the payment of the monetary benefits 
under the CNA, but declares that the officials approving the payment and
 the employees receiving the monetary benefits are not required to 
reimburse the disallowed amounts on the ground of their good faith.   
  </p><p align="center"><b>1.<br> 
  The COA did not commit <br>
  grave abuse of discretion</b>   
  </p><p>We uphold the disallowance by the COA of the monetary benefits granted by the CESB for being based on cogent legal grounds.  
  </p><p> In the discharge of its constitutional mandate, the COA has 
been vested with enough latitude to determine, prevent and disallow 
irregular, unnecessary, excessive, extravagant, or unconscionable 
expenditures of government funds. It has the power to ascertain whether 
or not public funds were utilized for the purpose for which they had 
been intended.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Being the 
guardian of public funds, it has been vested by the 1987 Constitution 
with broad powers over all accounts pertaining to government revenue and
 expenditures and the uses of public funds and property, including the 
exclusive authority to define the scope of its audit and examination, 
establish the techniques and methods for such review, and promulgate 
accounting and auditing rules and regulations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>
  </p><p> In this instance, the CESB granted the monetary benefits 
pursuant Section 2, Article  V of the CNA. It argues that it needed no 
new appropriation to grant the benefits inasmuch as its agency savings 
were utilized for the purpose. In justification, it stresses that the 
use of the savings for the benefits was authorized by the Department of 
Budget and Management (DBM) under National Budget Circular No. 487, 
which embodied the guidelines for the release of funds for CY 2003.</p><p> Section 3.10 of National Budget Circular No. 487 reads: 
  </p><blockquote>
    <p> As an exception to Section 55 of the General Provisions of R.A. 
No. 9206, agencies are authorized to use savings to cover payment of 
TLB, RA x x x and collective negotiation agreement (CNA) incentives even
 if no specific appropriation is provided for the purpose.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> The CESB submits that National Budget Circular 487 was issued 
primarily to enforce or implement an existing law, that is, Republic Act
 (R.A.) No. 9206 (<em>General Appropriations Act of 2003</em>);<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>
 and that the DBM had the authority to identify such other compensations
 that could be granted over and above the standardized salary rates 
pursuant to Section 12 of R.A. No. 6758 (<em>Salary Standardization Law</em>), to wit:
  </p><blockquote>
    <p> Section 12. Consolidation of Allowances and Compensation. -</p>
    <p> All allowances, except for representation and transportation 
allowances; clothing and laundry allowances; subsistence allowance of 
marine officers and crew on board government vessels and hospital 
personnel; hazard pay; allowances of foreign service personnel stationed
 abroad; and such other additional compensation not otherwise specified 
herein as may be determined by the DBM, shall be deemed included in the 
standardized salary rates herein prescribed. Such other additional 
compensation, whether in cash or in kind, being received by incumbents 
only as of July 1, 1989 not integrated into the standardized salary 
rates shall continue to be authorized.</p>
    <p> Existing additional compensation of any national government 
official or employee paid from local funds of a local government unit 
shall be absorbed into the basic salary of said official or employee and
 shall be paid by the National Government.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> that National Budget Circular 487, in conjunction with Section 12 
of the SSL, in effect included the benefits paid under the CNA among 
those not integrated in or consolidated with the standardized salary 
rates pursuant to R.A. No. 6758;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> and that the DBM authorized the use of savings for the payment of the CNA benefits pursuant to the catch-all proviso ("<i>such other additional compensation not otherwise specified herein as may be determined by the DBM</i>â) contained in Section 12 of R.A. No. 6758.</p><p> The submissions of the CESB are unfounded.</p><p>
 To begin with, the DBM did not have any hand in the determination of 
the CNA benefits and incentives to be given to the CESB's employees and 
officers because the CNA had been entered into only by and between the 
CESB and SANDIGAN. As such, the DBM could not have expressly determined 
and authorized the additional compensations in the form of fringe 
benefits, rice subsidy allowance, birthday cash gift, Christmas grocery,
 loyalty award, retirement benefits and funeral assistance agreed upon 
by and between the CESB and SANDIGAN, and thus were not deemed to have 
been included in the prescribed standardized salary rates. The nature of
 such additional benefits for the CESB's employees required their still 
being included in the regular budget of the CESB, and such benefits 
would still be subject to approval by the DBM.</p><p> Secondly, Section 2, Rule VIII of the IRR enumerated the benefits that could be the subject of negotiation, viz.:
  </p><blockquote>
    <p> Section 2. The following concerns, among others, may be the 
subject of negotiation between the employer and the accredited 
employees' organization:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p> a) Schedule of vacation and other leaves;</p>
      <p> b) Work assignment of pregnant women; </p>
      <p>c) Personnel growth and development; </p>
      <p>d) Communication system-lateral and vertical; </p>
      <p>e) Provision for protection and safety;</p>
      <p> f) Provision for facilities for handicapped personnel; </p>
      <p>g) Provision for first aid medical services and supplies;</p>
      <p> h) Physical fitness program;</p>
      <p> i) Provision for family planning services for married women; </p>
      <p>j) Annual medical/physical examination; </p>
      <p>k) Recreational, social, athletic and cultural activities and facilities.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p> </p><p>On the other hand, Section 3, Rule VIII of the IRR listed the benefits that were not subject to negotiation, to wit:
  </p><blockquote>
    <p> Section 3. Those that require appropriation of funds, such as the following, are not negotiable: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p> a. Increase in the salary emoluments and other allowances not presently provided for by law; </p>
      <p> b. Facilities requiring capital outlays; </p>
      <p> c. Car plan; </p>
      <p> d. Provident fund; </p>
      <p> e. 	Special hospitalization, medical and dental services; </p>
      <p> f. 	Rice/sugar/other subsidies; </p>
      <p> g. Travel expenses; </p>
      <p> h. Increase in retirement benefits. <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> </p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p> In light of the foregoing provisions, the COA was correct in 
holding that the benefits given under the CNA were not allowed under 
Executive Order (EO) 180<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> 
and its Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) because the benefits 
given by the CESB to its employees and officers were not subject to 
negotiation.</p><p> And, thirdly, the CESB's reliance on National Budget
 Circular 487 was bereft of legal anchor considering that the CESB had 
no legal authority to use its savings for the payment of the monetary 
benefits.</p><p> To explain, Section 29(1), Article VI of the 1987 
Constitution ordains that: "No money shall be paid out of the Treasury 
except in pursuance of an appropriation made by law." The only exception
 is found in Section 25(5),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>
 Article VI of the 1987 Constitution, by which the President of the 
Philippines, the President of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of 
Representatives, the Chief Justice of the Philippines, and the heads of 
the Constitutional Commissions are authorized to transfer appropriations
 to augment any item in the GAA for their respective offices from the 
savings in other items of their respective appropriations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>
 The CESB is definitely not among the officials or agencies authorized 
to transfer their savings in other items of its appropriation. The CESB 
came into being by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 1 on September 1, 
1974. The CESB, although intended to be an autonomous entity, is 
administratively attached to the Civil Service Commission (CSC),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>
 and does not wield the power to authorize the augmentation of items of 
its appropriations from savings in other items of its appropriations. 
With the CSC being the office vested with fiscal autonomy by the 1987 
Constitution, the CESB's use of its savings to cover the CNA benefits 
for its employees had no legal basis.</p><p> We find no grave abuse of discretion on the part of the COA in issuing COA Decision No. 2010-121 dated November 19, 2010. By <em>grave abuse of discretion</em>
 is meant such capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment as is 
equivalent to lack of jurisdiction. The abuse of discretion must be 
grave as where the power is exercised in an arbitrary or despotic manner
 by reason of passion or personal hostility and must be so patent and 
gross as to amount to an evasion of positive duty or to a virtual 
refusal to perform the duty enjoined by or to act at all in 
contemplation of law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> The 
burden is on the part of the petitioner to prove not merely reversible 
error, but grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of 
jurisdiction on the part of the public respondent issuing the impugned 
order. Mere abuse of discretion is not enough; it must be grave.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>
  </p><p> On the contrary, the COA only discharged and adhered to its 
duty and responsibility to exercise its general audit power under the 
1987 Constitution.</p><p align="center"> <b>2.<br> 
    CESB and its employees<br> 
    need not return the benefits received<br> 
    because of their good faith</b> 
  </p><p>The validity of the disallowance notwithstanding, we note that 
the CESB's officials who authorized and caused the payment of the CNA 
benefits to covered officers and employees, and the latter as the 
recipients of the disallowed payments enjoyed the benefit of good faith 
and should be absolved from the liability to refund. To hold so conforms
 to the ruling in<em> De Jesus v. Commission on Audit</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> <em>viz</em>.:  
  </p><blockquote>
    <p> Nevertheless, our pronouncement in Blaquera v. Alcala supports 
petitioners' position on the refund of the benefits they received. In 
Blaquera, the officials and employees of several government departments 
and agencies were paid incentive benefits which the COA disallowed on 
the ground that Administrative Order No. 29 dated 19 January 1993 
prohibited payment of these benefits. While the Court sustained the COA 
on the disallowance, it nevertheless declared that:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p> Considering, however, that all the parties here acted in good 
faith, we cannot countenance the refund of subject incentive benefits 
for the year 1992, which amounts the petitioners have already received. 
Indeed, no indicia of bad faith can be detected under the attendant 
facts and circumstances. The officials and chiefs of offices concerned 
disbursed such incentive benefits in the honest belief that the amounts 
given were due to the recipients and the latter accepted the same with 
gratitude, confident that they richly deserve such benefits.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p> This ruling in Blaquera applies to the instant case. Petitioners
 here received the additional allowances and bonuses in good faith under
 the honest belief that LWUA Board Resolution No. 313 authorized such 
payment. At the time petitioners received the additional allowances and 
bonuses, the Court had not yet decided Baybay Water District [v. 
Commission on Audit]. Petitioners had no knowledge that such payment was
 without legal basis. Thus, being in good faith, petitioners need not 
refund the allowances and bonuses they received but disallowed by the 
COA. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> This doctrine of good faith has been consistently followed in many other rulings.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Recently, in <em>Philippine Economic Zone Authority v. Commission on Audit (PEZA v. COA)</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>
 the Court has reiterated that the affirmance of the disallowance of 
payments or disbursements does not automatically cast liability on the 
responsible officers when good faith could be considered as a valid 
defense. To appreciate good faith as a valid defense of a public 
official being required to refund or reimburse a disallowed payment, 
however, the Court has required in<em> PEZA v. COA</em> that such public official must possess: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> x x x [A] state of mind denoting "honesty of intention, and 
freedom from knowledge of circumstances which ought to put the holder 
upon inquiry; an honest intention to abstain from taking any 
unconscientious advantage of another, even though technicalities of law,
 together with absence of all information, notice or benefit or belief 
of facts which render transaction unconscientious."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> Thus, guided by the recognition of the good faith on the part of the public officials and employees involved in <i>Arias v. Sandiganbayan</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> <i>Sistoza v. Desierto</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> and <i>Social Security System v. Commission on Audit</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> the Court has fittingly concluded in <i>PEZA v. COA</i> that:
  </p><blockquote>
    <p> x x x [I]t is unfair to penalize public officials based on 
overly stretched and strained interpretations of rules which were not 
that readily capable of being understood at the time such functionaries 
acted in good faith. If there is any ambiguity, which is actually 
clarified years later, then it should only be applied prospectively. A 
contrary rule would be counterproductive. It could result in paralysis, 
or lack of innovative ideas getting tried. In addition, it could 
dissuade others from joining the government. When government service 
becomes unattractive, it could only have adverse consequences for 
society.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> In fine, good faith is properly appreciated in favor of the public
 officials and employees involved when: (1) the concerned public 
officials authorize or the concerned employees receive the disallowed 
payment upon an honest belief that such authority to cause payment or to
 receive payment is valid and legal;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>
 or (2) there is absence of circumstances that ought to put the 
concerned public officials or employees upon inquiry as to the validity 
or legality of the payment;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> or (3) the document relied upon and signed shows no palpable, or patent, or definite defects;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>
 or (4) the concerned public officer's trust and confidence in his 
subordinates upon whom the duty to ensure the validity or legality of 
the payment primarily devolves are within the parameters of tolerable 
judgment and permissible margins of error;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> or (5) there has been no prior jurisprudence or ruling on the allowance or disallowance of the subject or similar payment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> </p><p>
 The officials of the CESB who authorized and caused the disallowed 
payment of the CNA benefits apparently acted and believed in the honest 
belief that the grant of the monetary benefits was proper and had legal 
basis. Indeed, the CESB, relying on its autonomous character, which was 
not negated by its being an attached agency of the CSC,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>
 sincerely believed in good faith that it had the legal authority to use
 its savings to pay the CAN benefits. Similarly, the recipients of the 
disallowed payment honestly believed that they were legally entitled to 
said benefits as the product of the CNA between the CESB and SANDIGAN, 
and thus received the benefits in good faith.</p><p> The CESB officers 
and employees' basis of good faith further stemmed from the fact that 
there had been no prior ruling yet to the effect that the CNA benefits 
were not deemed included in the prescribed standardized salary rates; 
that such benefits were in fact not negotiable; and that the CESB had no
 legal authority to pay such benefits out of its savings. With their 
good faith having been sufficiently established, it becomes just and 
imperative to release the concerned officials and employees of the CESB 
from any financial accountability or legal obligation of reimbursement 
respecting the disallowed payments of the CNA benefits.</p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court <b>PARTLY GRANTS</b> the petition for <i>certiorari</i>; and <b>UPHOLDS</b> Decision No. 2010-121 dated November 19, 2010 of the Commission on Audit subject to the <b>MODIFICATION</b>
