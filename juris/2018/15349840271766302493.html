Upon receipt of the information, a surveillance with the confidential informant was conducted which confirmed that the accused-appellants were indeed engaged in selling dangerous drugs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> </p><p> On 19 January 2009 at around 11:00 A.M., SPO1 Sanchez, SPO2 Ferrer, SPO1 Germodo, SI Tagle, PO2 Corsame, the confidential informant, and other voluntary informants planned an entrapment. It was agreed that Tubio, a PDEA asset, would act as the poseur-buyer while the rest of the team, who would position themselves at a distance near enough to see the whole transaction, would act as back-up. Tubio would remove his cap as the pre-arranged signal that the transaction had been consummated. SPO1 Germodo affixed his signature beside the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas logo on one P100.00 bill<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> and one P200.00 bill<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> which would be used as marked money during the entrapment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></p><p> After the planning at the PDEA office, Tubio proceeded to Upper Luke Wright where he met the accused-appellants while the buy-bust team members were positioned about seven meters away. Tubio convinced the accused-appellants that he wanted to buy shabu. When Abella agreed to sell, Tubio handed her the buy-bust money which she gave to Sendiong. At this point, Sendiong gave a heat-sealed transparent sachet (<em>sachet</em>) to Abella who handed it to Tubio. The transaction consummated, Tubio took off his cap moving the team to effect the arrest of the accused-appellants. SPO1 Germodo informed the accused-appellants of their rights. After Tubio handed the sachet to PO2 Corsame, he immediately left the place in order to avoid revealing his cover as PDEA asset.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> </p><p> PO2 Corsame marked "EM-BB" 1-19-09 on the sachet<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> handed him by Tubio. The letters "EM" stood for Evangeline and Mae Ann; the letters "BB" for buy-bust; and "1-19-09" for the date of the incident. SPO2 Ferrer confiscated the marked money from Abella. SPO1 Germodo arrested Sendiong and confiscated from her a swiss knife key holder<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> which, when opened, revealed a sachet. SPO1 Germodo handed the sachet to PO2 Corsame who marked "MS-P" 1-19-09, the letters "MS" standing for the name of Sendiong; the letter "P" indicating that it was seized while in the possession of Sendiong; and "1-19-09" for the date of the incident. PO2 Corsame conducted an inventory<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> of the items seized at the place where the arrest was effected and in the presence of the accused-appellants, Astillero, and Merced. SPO1 Germodo took pictures<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> during the inventory.

The request and the items for examination were received by PCI Llena, a forensic chemist, who, after the examination, found each of the sachets to contain 0.01 gram of methamphetamine hydrochloride;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> while the urine sample of Abella<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> was positive for methamphetamine and that of Sendiong<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Eositive for methamphetamine and THC-metabolites, both dangerous drugs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> </p><p> After the examination, PCI Llena personally resealed the two sachets and affixed the markings "A D-004-09" and "B-1 D-004-09" for "EM-BB" 1-19-09 and '"MS-P" 1-19-09, respectively. Thereafter, she kept the seized items inside a steel cabinet in the evidence room to which only she had access. She delivered the seized items to the RTC on 30 January 2009.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></p><p> <b><i>The Version of the Defense</i></b> </p><p> According to Abella, she was at the house of Bebie Quizon (<em>Quizon</em>) at Upper Luke Wright on 19 January 2009, at about 2:00 P.M., doing her work as a laundry woman. A person, whom she later came to know was the poseur-buyer, stopped in front of the house looking for somebody and calling out the name "Yenyen." As she was about to go out, the poseur-­buyer entered Quizon's house and told her not to move. When she refused as the poseur-buyer was forcing her out of the house he waved his cap and a vehicle arrived with several people alighting from it. When Quizon still refused to leave the house, PO2 Corsame entered the house, handcuffed her, and forced her to go out.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> </p><p> Once outside, somebody interviewed Quizon while a policewoman searched her body. Although nothing was found on her, an inventory of drugs which she had not seen before was conducted. She was not informed of her constitutional rights. Also arrested at that time was Sendiong, whom she had not met.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> </p><p> Sendiong testified that on 19 January 2009 at about 2:00 P.M., she was at Upper Luke Wright to borrow money from an aunt for the medication of her daughter who had meningitis. As she was waiting for her aunt, she saw people running in her direction and who then arrested her for allegedly being a drug dealer. Two policewomen frisked her but they found nothing. She told them that she did not know anything about the items seized and that she did not have any idea what they were talking about.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></p><p> <b><i>The Ruling of the RTC</i></b> </p><p> The RTC held that the prosecution had successfully proven all the elements necessary for the conviction of the accused-appellants. Moreover, the seized items had been properly examined and were found to contain methamphetamine hydrochloride.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> </p><p> On the one hand, the RTC found the defense of the accused-appellants inherently weak as compared to the credible testimonies of the prosecution witnesses. It upheld the presumption that the buy-bust team had regularly performed their duties in view of their consistent and straightforward narration of what transpired on 19 January 2009. In addition, the poseur-­buyer testified and described in detail how the transaction took place, a testimony which only a trustworthy witness could have narrated with clarity and realism.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></p><p> With these findings, the RTC resolved the cases as follows: </p><blockquote> <p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, in the light of the foregoing, the Court hereby renders judgment as follows: </p> <p> 1. In Criminal Case No. 19359, the accused Evangeline Abella y Sedego and Mae Ann Sendiong are hereby found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the offense of illegal sale of 0.01 gram of shabu in violation of Sec. 5, Art.

No. 9165 and is hereby sentenced to suffer an indeterminate penalty of twelve (12) years and one (1) day as minimum term to fourteen (14) years as maximum term and to pay a fine of Four Hundred Thousand Pesos (P400,000.00).</p> <p> The one (1) heat-sealed transparent plastic sachet containing 0.01 gram of shabu is hereby confiscated and forfeited in favor of the government and to be disposed of in accordance with law. </p> <p> In the service of sentence, the accused Evangeline Abella y Sedego and Mae Ann Sendiong shall be credited with the full time during which they have undergone preventive imprisonment, provided they agree voluntarily in writing to abide by the same disciplinary rules imposed on convicted prisoners.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Believing that the RTC erred in its decision, the accused-appellants appealed to the CA. </p><p> <b><i>The Ruling of the CA</i></b> </p><p> The CA found no merit in the appeal. It held that the elements of the crimes charged had been established beyond moral certainty. On the contention that what took place on 19 January 2009 was instigation, the CA ruled that the arrest of the accused-appellants was the result of a legitimate entrapment which fact can be verified by the credible testimonies of the prosecution witnesses. The CA sustained the RTC's assessment on the credibility of the witnesses and found no indicium of ill motive or of any distorted sense of duty on the part of the buy-bust team.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> </p><p> The CA disposed the appeal of the accused-appellants as follows: </p><blockquote> <p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the instant Appeal is <b>DENIED</b>. </p> <p> Accordingly, the <i>28 October 2011 Joint Judgment</i> of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 30, Dumaguete City in <i>Criminal Case Nos. 19359 and 19381</i>, respectively, finding accused-appellants Evangeline Abella y Sedego and Mae Ann Sendiong guilty beyond reasonable doubt for the crime of illegal selling of 0.01 gram of shabu and accused-appellant Mae Ann Sendiong guilty beyond reasonable doubt for the crime of unlawful possession of 0.01 gram of shabu, is <b>AFFIRMED <i>IN TOTO</i></b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p align="center"> <b>ISSUES</b> </p><p> Abella raised the following issues in her appeal: </p><p align="center"> I. </p><blockquote> <p> THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT OF THE CRIME CHARGED DESPITE THE FAILURE OF THE PROSECUTION TO PROVE HER GUILT BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.</p> </blockquote> <p align="center"> II. </p><blockquote> <p> THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT OF THE CRIME CHARGED DESPITE THE FAILURE OF THE PROSECUTION TO ESTABLISH THE CHAIN OF CUSTODY.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> On the one hand, Sendiong raised this sole issue in her brief, to wit: </p><blockquote> <p> The lower court erred in not holding that the irreconcilable conflict between the testimony of the PDEA asset Urseevi Tubio that he was the poseur-buyer and the testimony of the aforenamed police officers that it was the confidential agent who acted as poseur-buyer, and not Tubio, is fatal to the prosecution's burden of establishing the guilt of accused-appellant Mae Ann Sendiong by proof beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p align="center"> <b>OUR RULING</b> </p><p> There is no merit in the appeal of the accused-appellants. </p><table width="50%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><b><i>The elements of the crimes charged against the accused­ appellants were established beyond reasonable doubt by the prosecution.</i></b> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>Foremost, it must be stressed that accruing jurisprudence dictate that an appeal in criminal cases opens the entire case for review; thus, it is the duty of the reviewing tribunal to correct, cite, and appreciate errors in the appealed judgment whether they are assigned or unassigned.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> The appeal confers the appellate court full jurisdiction over the case and renders such court competent to examine the records, revise the judgment appealed from, increase the penalty, and cite the proper provision of the penal law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> </p><p> In Criminal Case No. 19359, the accused-appellants were charged with violation of Sec. 5,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Art.

No. 9165, the elements of which are as follows: (a) the accused was in possession of an item or object identified as a prohibited drug; (b) such possession was not authorized by law; and (c) the accused freely and consciously possessed the said drug.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> </p><p> In Criminal Case No. 19359, the prosecution was able to prove that it was Tubio who bought from the accused-appellants one transparent heat-sealed sachet which, when subjected to laboratory examination, was found to contain methamphetamine hydrochloride.</p><p> By statutory definition, conspiracy exists when two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> From the established facts, it was clear that each of the accused­ appellants performed an overt act in pursuance or furtherance of the complicity, i.e., both accused-appellants transacted with Tubio; Abella received the money from Tubio and handed it to Sendiong; and Sendiong handed the heat-sealed transparent sachet to Abella who in turn gave it to Tubio.</p><p> Abella averred that in all appearances, the police officers may have conducted a buy-bust operation but which, upon a closer look at the facts, revealed an instance of instigation. She claimed that by Tubio's testimony, he convinced the accused-appellants of his intent to buy shabu.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> </p><p> The Court is not persuaded. </p><p> For a better understanding of the difference between instigation and entrapment, the following jurisprudence is reiterated: </p><blockquote> <p> x x x Instigation means luring the accused into a crime that he, otherwise, had no intention to commit, in order to prosecute him. On the other hand, entrapment is the employment of ways and means in order to trap or capture a lawbreaker. Instigation presupposes that the criminal intent to commit an offense originated from the inducer and not the accused who had no intention to commit the crime and would not have committed it were it not for the initiatives by the inducer. In entrapment, the criminal intent or design to commit the offense charged originates in the mind of the accused; the law enforcement officials merely facilitate the apprehension of the criminal by employing ruses and schemes. In instigation, the law enforcers act as active co-principals. Instigation leads to the acquittal of the accused, while entrapment does not bar prosecution and conviction.</p> <p> To determine whether there is instigation or entrapment, we held in <i>People v. Doria</i> that the conduct of the apprehending officers and the predisposition of the accused to commit the crime must be examined:</p> <blockquote> <p> [I]n buy-bust operations demands that the details of the purported transaction must be clearly and adequately shown. This must start from the initial contact between the poseur-buyer and the pusher, the offer to purchase, the promise or payment of the consideration until the consummation of the sale by the delivery of the illegal drug subject of the sale. The manner by which the initial contact was made, whether or not through an informant, the offer to purchase the drug, the payment of the "buy-bust" money, and the delivery of the illegal drug, whether to the informant alone or the police officer, must be the subject of strict scrutiny by courts to insure that law-abiding citizens are not unlawfully induced to commit an offense. Criminals must be caught but not at all cost[s]. At the same time, however, examining the conduct of the police should not disable courts into ignoring the accused's predisposition to commit the crime. If there is overwhelming evidence of habitual delinquency, recidivism or plain criminal proclivity, then this must also be considered. Courts should look at all factors to determine the predisposition of an accused to commit an offense in so far as they are relevant to determine the validity of the defense of inducement.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup></p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> The records unmistakably prove that Tubio merely convinced the accused-appellants that he would be buying shabu<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> but never told them that he would be buying it from them. Apparently, the criminal intent or design to sell shabu originated in the mind of the accused-appellants because they voluntarily and knowingly transacted with Tubio to sell him a sachet of shabu at the price of P300.00. This conclusion is supported by the synchronized acts of the accused-appellants in receiving the payment and in handing the shabu to the poseur-buyer. Moreover, the fact that Sendiong already had in her possession two heat-sealed transparent sachets containing shabu confirmed the probability that in actuality both of them were engaged in selling shabu. In fact, during the verification operation on 18 January 2009, PO2 Corsame and Tubio were able to witness the accused-appellants openly selling shabu. Obviously, the buy-bust team merely facilitated the apprehension of the criminals by employing ploys and schemes. The proof that the accused-appellants were engaged in the illegal trade of selling shabu was only fortified by the buy-bust operation which, in a series of cases, has been held as a form of entrapment used to apprehend drug peddlers.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> </p><p> Abella finds fault that no police officer stood beside Tubio during the sale transaction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup></p><p> The fact is underscored that Tubio testified on what had actually transpired when he bought shabu from the accused-appellants. Notwithstanding that not one of the members of the buy-bust team was beside Tubio during the transaction, the record will confirm that the members were just seven meters away from him and the accused-appellants, thus, were able to witness the transaction. To stress, Tubio's narration before the RTC coincides with that of the buy-bust team. Additionally, the presence of a police officer beside the poseur-buyer is neither an element of Sec. 5, Art. II of R.A. No. 9165 nor a requirement to secure the conviction of the accused-appellants. More importantly, Sec. 5, Art. II of R.A. No. 9165 does not even prescribe that the poseur-buyer should be a police officer.</p><p> Accused-appellants claimed that there were material inconsistencies in the testimonies of the police officers with that of Tubio. They pointed out that according to the police officers, the poseur-buyer was the same person as the confidential informant.

The accused-appellant, courage to sell shabu even to those they do not know bespeaks of their boldness to violate the law. This truth was easily confirmed by the surveillance operation held a day before the buy-bust operation where the accused-appellants were found to be engaged in selling drugs at Upper Luke Wright.</p><p> In Criminal Case No. 19381, the facts revealed that after the sale transaction, was consummated the buy-bust team approached the accused-appellants to search and arrest them. The buy-bust team were unanimous in their testimony that it was SPO1 Germodo who seized from Sendiong a key holder which yielded a heat-sealed transparent sachet and which, upon laboratory examination, was found to contain methamphetamine hydrochloride. Sendiong was not able to show, either during the arrest or when called to the witness stand, that she was authorized by law to possess the prohibited drug.</p><p> The Court finds no compelling reason to doubt the truth of the straightforward and plausible testimony of the prosecution witnesses who were consistent with each other on significant and material details. Indeed, a review of the prosecution witnesses' respective testimonies would prove that they never wavered despite the gruelling cross-examination by the defense. In addition, the Court is cognizant of the presumption of regularity in the performance of duties of public officers.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> The presumption is that unless there is clear and convincing evidence that the police officers were inspired by any improper motive or did not properly perform their duty, their testimonies on the operation deserve full faith and credit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> In these cases, the presumption became conclusive when the accused-appellants failed to refute it.</p><p> It is noteworthy that both the RTC and the CA found the testimony of the prosecution witnesses credible. Hence, the well-settled rule that finds its significance in these cases is that the findings of the trial court which are factual in nature and involve the credibility of witnesses are accorded respect when no glaring errors, gross misapprehension of facts or speculative, arbitrary, and unsupported conclusions are made from such findings.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> This rule finds even more stringent application where the findings are sustained by the CA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> </p><table width="50%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><b><i>There was an unbroken chain of custody of the seized items.</i></b> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>Equally important as proving the above elements of the crimes charged, is the need to ascertain the identity of the prohibited drug considering that in all prosecutions for violations of R.A No. 9165, the corpus delicti is the dangerous drug itself. The corpus delicti is established by proof that the identity and integrity of the subject matter of the sale, i.e., the prohibited or regulated drug, has been preserved; hence, the prosecution must show beyond reasonable doubt the identity of the dangerous drug to prove its case against the accused.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> The prosecution must be able to account for each link in the chain of custody over the dangerous drug from the moment of seizure up to its presentation in court as evidence of the corpus delicti.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> The justification for this declaration is elucidated as follows: </p><blockquote> <p> Narcotic substances are not readily identifiable. To determine their composition and nature, they must undergo scientific testing and analysis. Narcotic substances are also highly susceptible to alteration, tampering, or contamination. It is imperative, therefore, that the drugs allegedly seized from the accused are the very same objects tested in the laboratory and offered in court as evidence.
