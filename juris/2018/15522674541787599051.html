Consequently, the specialist recommended that petitioner continue his physical therapy treatment,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> while the company-designated physician, in a Medical Report<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> dated March 3, 2015, assessed petitioner an interim disability grading of "Grade 11 – Disturbance of the carrying angle or weakness of an arm or a forearm due to deformity or moderate atrophy of muscles," pursuant to the 2010 Philippine Overseas Employment Administration Standard Employment Contract (POEA-SEC). </p><p> Unsure of his true condition as he was not restored to his pre-injury health status despite surgery and physiotherapy, petitioner consulted an independent physician, Dr. Manuel Fidel M. Magtira (Dr. Magtira), who, in a Medical Report<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> dated April 13, 2015, declared him unfit in any capacity for further sea duties after his physical examination revealed a limitation of flexion of the left elbow joint and muscle weakness on the left arm that resulted in a significant reduction of his pre-injury capacity level.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> </p><p> On the other hand, the company-designated physician, in a Medical Report<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> dated April 14, 2015 addressed to respondent Cruise Ship Solutions, reported that the Orthopedic surgeon was disappointed with the way petitioner was recuperating as the latter still complained of pain.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> The company-designated physician pointed out that petitioner's condition was only temporary and that he can resume work as seafarer "<i>once he is pain free with continuous Physical therapy treatment</i>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> For this reason, petitioner was assessed a partial disability grading of "12 percent – Left Elbow bending reduced to 90 degrees or less," based on the CBA Compensation Scale, or equivalent to US$9,600.00.</p><p> Claiming that his injury impaired his work-efficiency and rendered him incapable of resuming work for more than 240 days from the time he was repatriated, and that he was not furnished copies of his medical records or post treatment assessment by the company-designated physician, petitioner filed a complaint for total and permanent disability benefits as well as damages and attorney's fees against respondents Bibby, its President, Jonathan M. Palma, Crewlink, and CSS Cruise Ship Solutions Ltd. (respondents), before the NLRC. </p><p> In their defense, respondents countered that petitioner was entitled only to partial permanent disability benefits since the company-designated physician assessed him a 12% compensation only pursuant to the CBA Compensation Scale for "elbow bending reduced to 90 degrees or less."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> They also contended that petitioner failed to observe the third doctor referral procedure in case of disagreement in the assessment as provided under Section 20 (A) (3) of the 2010 POEA-SEC, and that the claims for damages and attorney's fees were without factual and legal bases.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> </p><p align="center"> <b>The Labor Arbiter's Ruling</b> </p><p> In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> dated November 27, 2015, the Labor Arbiter (LA) awarded petitioner permanent partial disability benefits, holding that the latter cannot be faulted for not following the conflict resolution provision under the 2010 POEA-SEC since respondents undeniably failed to furnish him copies of his medical treatments and evaluation, and as such, was unaware of the conflicting assessments that needed to be addressed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Nevertheless, the LA gave more credence to the assessment of the company-designated physician, ruling that the same was arrived at after a series of tests and close monitoring of petitioner’s condition, unlike that of petitioner's independent physician, Dr. Magtira, whose findings were mere presumptions and without medical basis. As such, having been assessed by the company-designated physician a Grade 12 impediment, petitioner was entitled to partial disability benefits only in the amount of US$5,225.00 pursuant to the 2010 POEA-SEC. Petitioner's claims for damages and attorney's fees were denied for lack of factual basis.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> </p><p> Aggrieved, petitioner elevated<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> the matter to the NLRC.</p><p align="center"> <b>The NLRC Ruling</b> </p><p> In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> dated February 29, 2016, the NLRC set aside the LA's Decision and ordered respondents to pay petitioner total and permanent disability benefits in the amount of US$80,000.00 in accordance with the CBA as well as 10% attorney's fees.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> </p><p> In ruling as such, the NLRC pointed out that since the last Medical Report dated April 14, 2015 issued by the company-designated physician was beyond the 240-day period within which to make a final assessment of petitioner's fitness or disability, the latter's condition was conclusively presumed by law to be permanent and total.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> It added that the Medical Report dated March 3, 2015 could not be deemed as final since the assessment given therein was clearly an "<i>interim disability grade</i>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Besides, it ruled that even the Medical Report dated April 14, 2015 was not a definite assessment of petitioner's fitness or disability since the latter was still incapacitated to perform his duties as he was still in pain and has to continue physical therapy treatment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Finally, it noted that since respondents admitted in their own pleadings that petitioner was entitled to the benefits provided by the CBA, the latter was entitled to the maximum benefits provided thereunder equivalent to US$80,000.00. It likewise awarded petitioner attorney's fees as he was forced to protect his rights and interests in accordance with Article 111 of the Labor Code and Article 2208 of the Civil Code.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></p><p> Respondents moved for reconsideration<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> which was denied in a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> dated April 21, 2016.

Lastly, while the CA found no basis to grant petitioner's claim for attorney's fees, the dispositive portion nonetheless awarded 10% attorney's fees. Accordingly, respondents were ordered to pay petitioner partial disability benefits in the amount of US$9,600.00 in accordance with the CBA Compensation Scale.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> </p><p> Petitioner's motion for reconsideration<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> was denied in a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> dated April 18, 2018; hence, the petition.</p><p align="center"> <b>The Issue Before the Court</b> </p><p> The essential issue for the Court's resolution is whether or not the CA erred in finding that petitioner was not entitled to permanent total disability benefits.</p><p align="center"> <b>The Court's Ruling</b> </p><p> The petition is meritorious.</p><p> At the outset, there is no dispute that petitioner's injury was work-related and that he is entitled to disability compensation. The controversy, however, arises as to the degree of petitioner's disability and the amount of compensation he is entitled to.</p><p> It is settled that the entitlement of a seafarer on overseas employment to disability benefits is governed by law, by the parties' contracts, and by the medical findings. Section 20 (A) of the 2010 POEA-SEC, which is the rule applicable to this case since petitioner was employed in 2014, governs the procedure for compensation and benefits for a work-related injury or illness suffered by a seafarer on board sea-going vessels during the term of his employment contract, to wit: </p><blockquote> <p> SEC. 20.

Thus, the foremost consideration should be to determine whether the medical assessment or report of the company-designated physician was complete and appropriately issued; otherwise, the medical report shall be set aside and the disability grading contained therein disregarded.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> As case law holds, a <b><i>final and definitive disability assessment</i></b> is necessary in order to truly reflect the true extent of the sickness or injuries to the seafarer and his or her capacity to resume work as such.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></p><p> Failure of the company-designated physician to comply with his or her duty to issue a definite assessment of the seafarer's fitness or unfitness to resume work within the prescribed period shall transform the latter's temporary total disability into one of total and permanent by operation of law. As aptly ruled in the case of <i>Orient Hope Agencies, Inc. v. Jara</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> <b><i>without a valid final and definitive assessment</i></b> from the company-designated physician <b><i>within the prescribed periods</i></b>, the law already steps in to consider the seafarer's disability as total and permanent.</p><p> Notably, during the 120-day period within which the company-designated physician is expected to arrive at a definitive disability assessment, the seafarer shall be deemed on <b>temporary total disability</b> and shall receive his basic wage until he is declared fit to work or his temporary disability is acknowledged by the company-designated physician to be permanent, either partially or totally, as defined under the 2010 POEA-SEC and by applicable Philippine laws. However, if the 120-day period is exceeded and no <b><i>definitive declaration</i></b> is made because the seafarer requires <b><i>further medical attention</i></b>, then the temporary total disability period <b>may be extended up to a maximum of 240 days</b>, subject to the right of the employer to declare within this period that a permanent partial or total disability already exists.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> But before the employer may avail of the allowable 240-day extended treatment period, the company-designated physician must perform some significant act to justify the extension of the original 120-day period.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Otherwise, <b>the law grants the seafarer the relief of permanent total disability benefits due to such non-compliance</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> If this significant act is performed and an extension was duly made, the obligation of the company-designated physician to issue a final assessment is nevertheless retained, albeit in this instance may be discharged within the extended period of not exceeding 240 days reckoned from the seafarer's repatriation. The consequence for non-compliance within the extended period of the required assessment is likewise the <i>ipso jure</i> grant to the seafarer of permanent and total disability benefits, regardless of any justification.</p><p> In <i>Elburg Shipmanagement Philippines, Inc. v. Quiogue, Jr.</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> the Court summarized the rules regarding the company-designated physician's <b>duty to issue a final medical assessment</b> on the seafarer's disability grading, as follows: </p><ol><li> The company-designated physician must issue a final medical assessment on the seafarer's disability grading <strong>within a period of 120 days</strong> from the time the seafarer reported to him;</li><li> If the company-designated physician<strong> fails</strong> to give his assessment within the period of 120 days, without any justifiable reason, then the seafarer's disability becomes <strong>permanent and total</strong>; </li><li> If the company-designated physician fails to give his assessment within the period of 120 days with a <strong>sufficient justification</strong> (<em>e.g</em>. seafarer required further medical treatment or seafarer was uncooperative), then the period of diagnosis and treatment shall be <strong>extended to 240 days. The employer has the burden to prove that the company-designated physician has sufficient justification to extend the period</strong>; and </li><li>If the company-designated physician still<strong> fails</strong> to give his assessment <strong>within the extended period of 240 days</strong>, then the seafarer's disability becomes <strong>permanent and total</strong>, regardless of any justification.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> (Emphases supplied)</li></ol> <p> In the case at bar, it is not disputed that petitioner required further therapy sessions even after the lapse of 120 days from repatriation as the company-designated physician, in his Medical Report dated March 3, 2015 that was issued within the 240-day extended treatment period, noted that the former's "<i>left hand grip has not returned to normal yet</i>" and has performed the simulation tasks with "<em>slight pain and fatigue</em>," and that there was a need to continue his physical therapy treatment. The foregoing findings clearly constitute a significant act that justified the extension of petitioner's treatment period to 240-days, and for which the company-designated physician issued an "<em>interim</em>" assessment of "Grade 11 – Disturbance of the carrying angle or weakness of an arm or a forearm due to deformity or moderate atrophy of muscles" pursuant to the 2010 POEA-SEC. Unfortunately, the last assessment issued by the company-designated physician was only on April 14, 2015, or beyond the 240-day extended treatment period, assessing petitioner's injury and resulting disability at "<i>12 percent</i> – <i>Left Elbow bending reduced to 90 degrees or less</i>" based on the CBA Compensation Scale. Worse, as correctly observed by the NLRC, the said medical report could not have been a final and definite assessment as mandated by law given that petitioner still complained of pain and has to undergo "<i>continuous Physical therapy treatment</i>" Thus, based on the foregoing, the required final assessment from the company-designated physician within the extended 240-day treatment period was not timely issued. Accordingly, the NLRC correctly adjudged that petitioner is entitled to permanent total disability benefits by operation of law.</p><p> At this juncture, the Court deems it apt to rectify the CA's mistaken notion that the April 14, 2015 assessment was a mere reiteration of the company-designated physician's Medical Report dated March 31, 2015. Firstly, the March 31, 2015 medical report relied upon by the CA cannot be given credence as the same was presented only for the first time on <em>certiorari</em> with no justification as to why respondents failed to present the same at the earliest opportunity. Moreover, the said March 31, 2015 report cannot be deemed as final since after its purported issuance, petitioner was still required to undergo physical therapy as observed in the April 14, 2015 medical certificate in view of the persistent pain. Evidently, it failed to fully assess petitioner's condition and cannot provide sufficient basis for the award of disability benefits in his favor. To reiterate, the company-designated physician is expected to arrive at a definite assessment of the seafarer's fitness to work or to determine his disability within a period of 120 or 240 days from repatriation. The 120-day period applies if the duration of the seafarer's treatment does not exceed 120 days. On the other hand, the 240-day period applies in case the seafarer requires further medical treatment after the lapse of the initial 120-day treatment period. Without a final and definite disability assessment from the company-designated physician within the prescribed periods, the seafarer's temporary total disability is transformed by operation of law into one of permanent and total,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> as in this case. </p><p> It is well to point out that in disability compensation, it is not the injury which is compensated, but rather it is the incapacity to work resulting in the impairment of one's earning capacity.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Total disability refers to an employee's inability to perform his or her usual work. It does not require total paralysis or complete helplessness. Permanent disability, on the other hand, is a worker's inability to perform his job for more than 120 days or 240 days, if the seafarer required further medical attention justifying the extension of the temporary total disability period, regardless of whether or not he loses the use of any part of his body.</p><p> Anent the matter of compliance with the third doctor referral procedure, Section 20 (A) (3) of the 2010 POEA-SEC provides that if a doctor appointed by the seafarer disagrees with the assessment of the company-designated physician, a third doctor may be agreed jointly between the employer and the seafarer, and the third doctor's decision shall be final and binding on both.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> In case of non-observance by the seafarer of the third doctor referral provision in the contract, the employer can insist on the company-designated physician's assessment even against the contrary opinion by another doctor, unless the seafarer expresses his disagreement by asking for a referral to a third doctor who shall make a determination and whose decision shall be final and binding on the parties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup></p><p> It is noteworthy to point out at this stage that in the case of <em>Tradephil Shipping Agencies, Inc. v. Dela Cruz</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> the Court ruled that <em><strong>resort to a second opinion must be done after the assessment by the company-designated physician precisely to dispute the said assessment</strong></em>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> Such assessment from the company-designated physician, to reiterate, must be definite and timely issued. Otherwise, there is no valid medical assessment to be contested and it is the law that operates to declare a seafarer's resulting disability to be total and permanent. </p><p> Corollarily, should the seafarer signify his intent to challenge the company-designated physician's assessment through the assessment made by his own doctor, the employer must respond by setting into motion the process of choosing a third doctor who, as the 2010 POEA-SEC provides, can rule with finality on the disputed medical situation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> In such case, no specific period is required by law within which the parties may seek the opinion of a third doctor, and may do so even during the conciliation and mediation stage to abbreviate the proceedings.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup></p><p> Here, since the company-designated physician failed to timely issue a medical assessment of petitioner's disability within the 240-day extended treatment period, there is no valid assessment to be contested and the law steps in to transform the latter's temporary total disability into one of total and permanent, hence, the third doctor referral provision as provided in the 2010 POEA-SEC would not find application. As aptly ruled in the case of <em>Kestrel Shipping Co., Inc. v. Munar</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> absent the required final and definite assessment from the company-designated physician, as in this case, the seafarer need not comply with the third doctor referral provision under Section 20 (A) (3) of the 2010 POEA-SEC,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> ratiocinating in this wise: </p><blockquote> <p> In addition, that it was by operation of law that brought forth the conclusive presumption that Munar is totally and permanently disabled, there is no legal compulsion for him to observe the procedure prescribed under Section 20-B (3) of the POEA-SEC. <b>A seafarer's compliance with such procedure presupposes that the company-designated physician came up with an assessment as to his fitness or unfitness to work before the expiration of the 120-day or 240-day periods. </b>Alternatively put, absent a certification from the company-designated physician, the seafarer had nothing to contest and the law steps in to conclusively characterize his disability as total and permanent.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> In fine, as properly ruled by the NLRC, petitioner's disability is deemed to be total and permanent. Pursuant to the CBA Compensation Scale, the maximum allowable benefit provided thereunder is US$80,000.00. Further, with respect to petitioner's claim for attorney's fees, the Court finds that the same is warranted as the latter was clearly compelled to litigate to satisfy his claims for disability benefits as provided under Article 2208<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> of the Civil Code. However, the claims for moral and exemplary damages were correctly denied for lack of substantial evidence showing that respondents acted with malice or in bad faith in refusing petitioner's claims.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup></p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.
