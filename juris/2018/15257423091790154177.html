Further, this award is predicated on the commitments contained in the attached comfort letter (marked Exhibit "B") issued by Gammon Construction Limited, your associate company overseas and receipt of the duly signed letter from the Chief Executive of Gammon Construction Limited that is expected within seven days from the date hereof.<br> . . . . </p> <p> You may, therefore, proceed with the work at Phase I starting seven (7) days from receipt of this Notice or from the time that Site is dewatered and cleaned up, whichever is the later. It is further understood that Gammon agrees to continue Phase II at the price stated above and the starting time thereof will depend on the completion by others of the footings in time to allow construction of the superstructure in accordance with Gammon's Tender Programme dated 13 August 1997. <br> . . . . </p> <p> Please signify your concurrence by signing the appropriate space below and in the accompanying contract documents and return to Parsons-Interpro the originals.

However, please note that the 3 sheets of construction notes have not been issued. We therefore request issue of these drawings. In addition, there are fifteen 'Requests for Information' (RFIs) which were forwarded to you yesterday - these cover queries which affect both design of slabs and construction of walls, columns and beams. In particular, we urgently need instructions to clarify the reinforcement specification generally, and connectors/splicing of column reinforcement. </p> <p> Finally, our Performance Bond and Advance Payment Bond are being prepared now - we hope to submit these by end of this week.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> In a Letter dated September 3, 1997 (Second Letter), Gammon transmitted to Parsons a signed Letter of Comfort to guarantee its obligations in the Project.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></p><p> However, in a Letter dated September 8, 1997, MRT wrote Gammon that it would need one (1) or two (2) weeks before it could issue the latter the Formal Notice to Proceed:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> Re: <u>Contract for LRT3 North Triangle Podium Structure</u></p> <p> Gentlemen:</p> <p> Due to current developments in the Philippines' foreign exchange rate and the concomitant soaring interest rates, Metro Rail Transit Development Corp.

It shall be final and inappealable except on questions of law which shall be appealable to the Supreme Court.</p> </blockquote> <p> Initially, CIAC decisions are appealable only to this Court.

Araneta</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup> this Court explained that appeals from CIAC may only raise questions of law: </p><blockquote> <p> This is not to say that factual findings of CIAC arbitral tribunals may now be assailed before the Court of Appeals. Section 3's statement "whether the appeal involves questions of fact, of law, or mixed questions of fact and law" merely recognizes variances in the disparate modes of appeal that Rule 43 standardizes: that there were those that enabled questions of fact, there were those that enabled questions of law, and there were those that enabled mixed questions fact and law. Rule 43 emphasizes that though there may have been variances, all appeals under its scope are to be brought before the Court of Appeals. However, in keeping with the Construction Industry Arbitration Law, any appeal from CIAC Arbitral Tribunals must remain limited to questions of law. </p> <p> <em>Hi-Precision Steel Center, Inc. v. Lim Kim Steel Builders, Inc.</em> explained the wisdom underlying the limitation of appeals to pure questions of law:</p> <blockquote> <p> Section 19 makes it crystal clear that questions of fact cannot be raised in proceedings before the Supreme Court — which is not a trier of facts — in respect of an arbitral award rendered under the aegis of the CIAC. Consideration of the animating purpose of voluntary arbitration in general, and arbitration under the aegis of the CIAC in particular, requires us to apply rigorously the above principle embodied in Section 19 that the Arbitral Tribunal's findings of fact shall be final and unappealable.</p> <p> Voluntary arbitration involves the reference of a dispute to an impartial body, the members of which are chosen by the parties themselves, which parties freely consent in advance to abide by the arbitral award issued after proceedings where both parties had the opportunity to be heard. The basic objective is to provide a speedy and inexpensive method of settling disputes by allowing the parties to avoid the formalities, delay, expense and aggravation which commonly accompany ordinary litigation, especially litigation which goes through the entire hierarchy of courts. [The Construction Industry Arbitration Law] created an arbitration facility to which the construction industry in the Philippines can have recourse. The [Construction Industry Arbitration Law] was enacted to encourage the early and expeditious settlement of disputes in the construction industry, a public policy the implementation of which is necessary and important for the realization of national development goals.</p> </blockquote> <p> Consistent with this restrictive approach, this Court is duty-bound to be extremely watchful and to ensure that an appeal does not become an ingenious means for undermining the integrity of arbitration or for conveniently setting aside the conclusions arbitral processes make. An appeal is not an artifice for the parties to undermine the process they voluntarily elected to engage in. To prevent this Court from being a party to such perversion, this Court's primordial inclination must be to uphold the factual findings of arbitral tribunals:</p> <blockquote> <p> Aware of the objective of voluntary arbitration in the labor field, in the construction industry, and in any other area for that matter, the Court will not assist one or the other or even both parties in any effort to subvert or defeat that objective for their private purposes. The Court will not review the factual findings of an arbitral tribunal upon the artful allegation that such body had "misapprehended the facts" and will not pass upon issues which are, at bottom, issues of fact, no matter how cleverly disguised they might be as "legal questions." The parties here had recourse to arbitration and chose the arbitrators themselves; they must have had confidence in such arbitrators. The Court will not, therefore, permit the parties to relitigate before it the issues of facts previously presented and argued before the Arbitral Tribunal, save only where a very clear showing is made that, in reaching its factual conclusions, the Arbitral Tribunal committed an error so egregious and hurtful to one party as to constitute a grave abuse of discretion resulting in lack or loss of jurisdiction. Prototypical examples would be factual conclusions of the Tribunal which resulted in deprivation of one or the other party of a fair opportunity to present its position before the Arbitral Tribunal, and an award obtained through fraud or the corruption of arbitrators. <i>Any other, more relaxed, rule would result in setting at naught the basic objective of a voluntary arbitration and would reduce arbitration to a largely inutile institution</i>. </p> </blockquote> <p> Thus, even as exceptions to the highly restrictive nature of appeals may be contemplated, these exceptions are only on the narrowest of grounds. Factual findings of CIAC arbitral tribunals may be revisited not merely because arbitral tribunals may have erred, not even on the already exceptional grounds traditionally available in Rule 45 Petitions. Rather, factual findings may be reviewed only in cases where the CIAC arbitral tribunals conducted their affairs in a haphazard, immodest manner that the most basic integrity of the arbitral process was imperiled.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup> (Emphasis in the original, citations omitted) </p> </blockquote> <p> Thus, CIAC's factual findings on construction disputes are final, conclusive, and not reviewable by this Court on appeal. The only exceptions are when: </p><blockquote> <p> (1) [T]he award was procured by corruption, fraud or other undue means; (2) there was evident partiality or corruption of the arbitrators or of any of them; (3) the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing upon sufficient cause shown, or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy; (4) one or more of the arbitrators were disqualified to act as such under section nine of Republic Act No. 876 and willfully refrained from disclosing such disqualifications or of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been materially prejudiced; or (5) the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed them, that a mutual, final and definite award upon the subject matter submitted to them was not made.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup> (Citation omitted) </p> </blockquote> <p> Necessarily, before petitioner may raise any question of fact, it must prove that the above circumstances exist in the case at bar. </p><p align="center"> <b>I</b> </p><p> This Court rules that there is a perfected contract between MRT and Gammon. </p><p> MRT argues that there was no perfected contract between the parties as Gammon only accepted MRT's offer after MRT had already revoked it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup> MRT claims that it withdrew its offer to Gammon in its September 8, 1997 Letter, when it suspended the Project to review the foreign exchange rates and interest rates.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup> It emphasizes that while Gammon had already then returned the First Notice to Proceed, it did not return the contract documents until September 12, 1997.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup> By then, MRT had already withdrawn the First Notice to Proceed, and the parties were already renegotiating the contract's cause and object.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup> </p><p> On the other hand, Gammon maintains that there was a perfected contract between the parties.

Article 1305 of the Civil Code states: </p><blockquote> <p> Article 1305. A contract is a meeting of minds between two persons whereby one binds himself, with respect to the other, to give something or to render some service.</p> <p> Article 1315. Contracts are perfected by mere consent, and from that moment the parties are bound not only to the fulfillment of what has been expressly stipulated but also to all the consequences which, according to their nature, may be in keeping with good faith, usage and law.</p> </blockquote> <p> The requisites of a valid contract are provided for in Article 1318 of the Civil Code: </p><blockquote> <p> (1) Consent of the contracting parties; <br> (2) Object certain which is the subject matter of the contract; <br> (3) Cause of the obligation which is established.</p> </blockquote> <p> A contract is perfected when both parties have consented to the object and cause of the contract. There is consent when the offer of one party is absolutely accepted by the other party.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup> The acceptance of the other party may be express or implied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> However, the offering party may impose the time, place, and manner of acceptance by the other party, and the other party must comply.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup></p><p> Thus, there are three (3) stages in a contract: negotiation, perfection, and consummation. </p><p> Negotiation refers to the time the parties signify interest in the contract up until the time the parties agree on its terms and conditions. The perfection of the contract occurs when there is a meeting of the minds of the parties such that there is a concurrence of offer and acceptance, and all the essential elements of the contract—consent, object and cause—are present. The consummation of the contract covers the period when the parties perform their obligations in the contract until it is finished or extinguished.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup></p><p> To determine when the contract was perfected, the acceptance of the offer must be unqualified, unconditional, and made known to the offeror.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup> Before knowing of the acceptance, the offeror may withdraw the offer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup> Moreover, if the offeror imposes the manner of acceptance to be done by the offerree, the offerree must accept it in that manner for the contract to be binding.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup> If the offeree accepts the offer in a different manner, it is not effective, but constitutes a counter-offer, which the offeror may accept or reject.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup> Thus, in <i>Malbarosa v. Court of Appeals</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[121]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> Under Article 1319 of the New Civil Code, the consent by a party is manifested by the meeting of the offer and the acceptance upon the thing and the cause which are to constitute the contract. An offer may be reached at any time until it is accepted. An offer that is not accepted does not give rise to a consent. The contract does not come into existence. To produce a contract, there must be acceptance of the offer which may be express or implied but must not qualify the terms of the offer. The acceptance must be absolute, unconditional and without variance of any sort from the offer. </p> <p> The acceptance of an offer must be made known to the offeror. Unless the offeror knows of the acceptance, there is no meeting of the minds of the parties, no real concurrence of offer and acceptance. The offeror may withdraw its offer and revoke the same before acceptance thereof by the offeree. The contract is perfected only from the time an acceptance of an offer is made known to the offeror. If an offeror prescribes the exclusive manner in which acceptance of his offer shall be indicated by the offeree, an acceptance of the offer in the manner prescribed will bind the offeror. On the other hand, an attempt on the part of the offeree to accept the offer in a different manner does not bind the offeror as the absence of the meeting of the minds on the altered type of acceptance. An offer made<em> inter praesentes</em> must be accepted immediately. If the parties intended that there should be an express acceptance, the contract will be perfected only upon knowledge by the offeror of the express acceptance by the offeree of the offer. An acceptance which is not made in the manner prescribed by the offeror is not effective but constitutes a counter-offer which the offeror may accept or reject. The contract is not perfected if the offeror revokes or withdraws its offer and the revocation or withdrawal of the offeror is the first to reach the offeree. The acceptance by the offeree of the offer after knowledge of the revocation or withdrawal of the offer is inefficacious. The termination of the contract when the negotiations of the parties terminate and the offer and acceptance concur, is largely a question of fact to be determined by the trial court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup> (Citations omitted) </p> </blockquote> <p> In bidding contracts, this Court has ruled that the award of the contract to the bidder is an acceptance of the bidder's offer.

Thus,<i> after the Proposal of respondent was accepted by the Bank thru its telegram and letter both dated December 10, 1965 and respondent in turn accepted the award by its letter of December 15, 1965, both parties became bound to proceed with the subsequent steps needed to formalize and consummate their agreement. Failure on the part of either of them to do so, entitles the other to compensation for the resulting damages</i>. To such effect was the ruling of this Court in Valencia vs. RFC 103 Phil. 444. We held therein that <i>the award of a contract to a bidder constitutes an acceptance of said bidder's proposal and that "the effect of said acceptance was to perfect a contract, upon notice of the award to (the bidder)" . .. We further held therein that the bidder's "failure to (sign the corresponding contract) did not relieve him of the obligation arising from the unqualified acceptance of his offer.

However, please note that the 3 sheets of construction notes have not been issued. We therefore request issue of these drawings. In addition, there are fifteen 'Requests for Information' (RFIs) which were forwarded to you yesterday these cover queries which affect both design of slabs and construction of walls, columns and beams. In particular, we urgently need instructions to clarify the reinforcement specification generally, and connectors/splicing of column reinforcement. </p> <p> Finally, our Performance Bond and Advance Payment Bond are being prepared now - we hope to submit these by the end of the week.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[144]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> This First Letter shows that Gammon fully consented to the contents and accepted the prestations of the First Notice to Proceed. Gammon's acceptance is also manifested in its undertakings to mobilize resources, to prepare the Performance and Advance Payment Bonds, and to procure materials necessary for the Project. All that remained was the formality of returning the contract documents and the Letter of Comfort, which eventually was complied with by Gammon. Thus, there is already mutual consent on the object of the contract and its consideration, and an absolute acceptance of the offer. </p><p> In any case, this Court has ruled that the meeting of the minds need not always be put in writing, and the fact that the documents have not yet been signed or notarized does not mean that the contract has not been perfected.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[145]</sup> A binding contract may exist even if the signatures have not yet been affixed because acceptance may be express or implied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[146]</sup> </p><p> Thus, the parties have become bound to consummate the contract such that the failure by one party to comply with its obligations under the contract entitles the other party to damages. Clearly, Gammon was expected to comply with the award when it signified its concurrence. Thus, it is not just or equitable for the perfection of the contract to be one (1)-sided such that the contract only binds Gammon but not MRT just because the contract documents were not yet returned before MRT suspended the contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[147]</sup> </p><p> Moreover, this Court rules that MRT did not revoke its offer when it temporarily suspended the First Notice to Proceed. </p><p> MRT's September 8, 1997 Letter stated, thus: </p><blockquote> <p> Due to current developments in the Philippines' foreign exchange rate and the concomitant soaring interest rates, Metro Rail Transit Development Corp. (MRTDC) will need a week or two to estimate the possible effects and repercussions on the above[-]mentioned project before MRTDC, through the Chairman of the Board, will issue the formal Notice to Proceed to your company. When these possible effects and repercussions are analysed and decided upon by our Board, hopefully within the week, we shall notify you at once.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[148]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> Thereafter, Parsons directed Gammon to hold any further mobilization activities in a facsimile transmission dated September 9, 1997. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[149]</sup> </p><p> On September 11, 1997, Gammon sent Parsons a facsimile to confirm if all requirements in the contract documents were temporarily suspended pending the clarification of the scope and programming of the Project.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[150]</sup> </p><p> In a facsimile transmission dated September 12, 1997, Parsons confirmed "the temporary suspension of all the requirements under the contract except the re-design of the project floor slabs and the site de­ watering and clean up":<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[151]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> With reference to your fax of September 11, 1997 this will c<i>onfirm the temporary suspension of all requirements under the terms of the contract until such time as clarification of scope has been received from the owner</i>.

Gammon was informed that the contract was temporarily suspended. When a contract is suspended temporarily, it provisionally ceases to be operative until the occurrence of a condition or situation that warrants the lifting of the suspension of the contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[153]</sup> </p><p> It is different from a cancellation of a contract which terminates the contract such that it does not become operative again. </p><p> The usage of the words "temporary suspension" is clear. It is a settled rule that when the words in a contract are clear and leave no doubt on the parties' intentions, the literal meaning shall control.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[154]</sup> Thus, the above communications cannot be interpreted to mean that the contract has been cancelled or rescinded. </p><p> This is bolstered by MRT's express cancellation of the contract on June 10, 1998 in its Fourth Notice to Proceed: </p><blockquote> <p> This notice formally cancels documents referred to as Notice of Award, Notice to Proceed issued on August 27, 1997, which was received by [Gammon Philippines, Inc.] on August 28, 1997 and April 2, 1998, which was received by [Gammon Philippines, Inc.] on April 8, 1998.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[155]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> It can be implied that prior to the Fourth Notice to Proceed, the First and Third Notices to Proceed were not cancelled and were still valid and subsisting.</p><p> Furthermore, MRT's Second Notice to Proceed issued on February 18, 1998 for engineering services based on the redesigned plan was signed by Gammon on March 11, 1998 with a qualification:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[156]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> The Contractor refers to the 'Notice of Award' and 'Notice to Proceed' dated 27 August 1997, and understands that this 'Notice to Proceed' effectively lifts the suspension of work notified in Metro Rail Transit Development Corporation letter dated 8 September 1997, in respect of the design activities only for all of the Level 2 slab and that part of the Level 3 slab over the Depot Maintenance Shop and office area . . . ; <i>and that the existing 'Notice of Award' dated 27 August 1997 is still valid</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[157]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p>MRT did not contest Gammon's notice of receipt of the First Notice to Proceed, expressing that it was still valid and was not cancelled.</p> <p> Additionally, when the parties were discussing the change of plans, MRT did not mention that no contract was executed between them. Instead, it sought to modify its terms and conditions. Thus, Gammon was made to believe that the First Notice to Proceed was in force and effect, albeit temporarily suspended.</p><p> Given these circumstances, it cannot be said that no contract was perfected between the parties.</p><p align="center"> <b>II</b> </p><p> The parties argue on the application of <i>Gammon v. Metro Rail Transit Development Corporation</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[158]</sup> on the contract's perfection. </p><p> MRT claims that this Court's ruling in <i>Gammon</i> did not determine that a contract was perfected as to warrant the application of the doctrine of the law of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[159]</sup> It argues that the issue in <i>Gammon</i> was CIAC's jurisdiction over the Notice of Claim, not the existence of the contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[160]</sup> MRT insists that the ruling was limited only to the preliminary question of whether or not there is an arbitration agreement between the parties to give CIAC jurisdiction over the dispute.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[161]</sup> It was a preliminary finding supported by limited evidence and not the result of an actual trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[162]</sup> </p><p> However, Gammon claims that <em>Gammon</em> already determined that there is a perfected contract, and thus, the doctrine of the law of the case applies. It insists that without the perfected contract, which contains the provision for arbitration, CIAC would not have acquired jurisdiction over the case. This is shown in that the existence of a contract between the parties was not an issue submitted by the parties in the arbitration proceedings. Thus, CIAC could not have ruled on it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[163]</sup> </p><p> The Court of Appeals affirmed that there was a perfected contract because MRT alleged in<i> Gammon</i> that the contract was novated or abandoned. It found that this was an implied admission that the contract was perfected considering that there was nothing to novate or abandon if there had been no perfected contract. The perfection of the contract was further confirmed by this Court's ruling in<i> Gammon </i>that the contract was merely modified.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[164]</sup></p><p> In <i>Gammon v. Metro Rail Transit Development Corporation</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[165]</sup> this Court held: </p><blockquote> <p> Although there is considerable disagreement concerning the foregoing facts, specifically whether Gammon undertook certain works on the Project and whether a re-bidding for the downgraded podium structure was indeed conducted, the Court does not need to make its own factual findings before it can resolve the <i>main question of whether the CIAC's jurisdiction was properly invoked. The resolution of this question necessarily involves a two-pronged analysis, first, of the requisites for invoking the jurisdiction of the CIAC, and second, of the scope of arbitrable issues covered by CIAC's jurisdiction.</i> </p> <p> EO 1008 expressly vests in the CIAC original and exclusive jurisdiction over disputes arising from or connected with construction contracts entered into by parties that have agreed to submit their dispute to voluntary arbitration . . .</p> <p> . . . .</p> <p> In this case, the parties submitted themselves to the jurisdiction of the CIAC by virtue of the arbitration clause in the [General Conditions of Contract], which provides: </p> <p> . . . .</p> <p> MRTDC, however, contends that the contract between the parties was novated by subsequent [Notices of Award]/[Notices to Proceed] which changed the design of the podium structure and reduced the contract price.</p> <p> We do not agree. Novation is defined as the extinguishment of an obligation by the substitution or change of the obligation by a subsequent one which terminates the first, either by changing the object or principal conditions; substituting the person of the debtor; or subrogating a third person in the rights of the creditor. In order tha[t] an obligation may be extinguished by another which substitutes the same, it is imperative that it be so declared in unequivocal terms, or that the old and the new obligations be on every point incompatible with each other.</p> <p> Novation cannot be presumed. The <i>animus novandi</i>, whether partial or total, must appear by the express agreement of the parties, or by their acts that are too clear and unequivocal to be mistaken. Further, novation may either be extinctive or modificatory. It is extinctive when an old obligation is terminated by the creation of a new one that takes the place of the former. It is merely modificatory when the old obligation subsists to the extent that it remains compatible with the amendatory agreement. </p> <p> <i>We have carefully gone over the records of this case and are convinced that the redesign of the podium structure and the reduction in the contract price merely modified the contract. These modifications were even anticipated by the [General Conditions of Contract] as it expressly states that changes may be made on the works without invalidating the contract, thus:</i></p> <p> . . . .</p> <p> <i>By these terms, the parties evidently agreed that should changes need to be made on the Project plans, such changes shall not annul or extinguish the contract. Thus, it can fairly be concluded that the revisions in the design of the Project and the reduction of the contract price were intended to merely modify the agreement and not to supplant the same.</i></p> <p> Parenthetically, while the [Notices of Award]/[Notices to Proceed] adverted to the execution of a formal contract for the Project, no such formal contract appears to have been executed. Instead, the [Notices of Award]/[Notices to Proceed] issued by MRTDC in favor of Gammon denominated the agreement as "Contract No. 4.251.001 for the Construction and Development of the Superstructure MRT 3 North Triangle'' and consistently referred to the [General Conditions of Contract] as one of the controlling documents with regard to the transaction. </p> <p> In fact, as mentioned by the CIAC in its assailed Order dated August 18, 1999, the [Notice of Award]/[Notice to Proceed] dated June 10, 1998 makes reference to the [General Conditions of Contract]. The June 10, 1998 [Notice of Award]/[Notice to Proceed] states: </p> <blockquote> <p> A formal contract for the Work is in process and will be available for signature as soon as possible. Pending the execution of the contract, the General conditions, and the Drawings and Specifications included with the Bid Documents (as originally issued and only as applicable to the current scope of work), all of which are incorporated herein by this reference, shall apply in this Notice ...</p> </blockquote> <p> A similar reference to the [General Conditions of Contract] appears in the April 2, 1998 [Notice of Award]/[Notice to Proceed]. Thus, even granting that, as the Court of Appeals ruled, the August 27, 1997 [Notice of Award]/[Notice to Proceed] had been novated by the April 2, 1998 [Notice of Award]/[Notice to Proceed] and that, in turn, the latter was rescinded by MRTDC, the arbitration clause in the [General Conditions of Contract] remained in force. </p> <p> At any rate, the termination of the contract prior to a demand for arbitration will generally have no effect on such demand, provided that the dispute in question either arose out of the terms of the contract or arose when a broad contractual arbitration clause was still in effect. The Court of Appeals, therefore, erred in ruling that there must be a subsisting contract before the jurisdiction of the CIAC may properly be invoked. <i>The jurisdiction of the CIAC is not over the contract but the disputes which arose therefrom, or are connected thereto, whether such disputes arose before or after the completion of the contract, or after the abandonment or breach thereof</i>. </p> <p> It may even be added that issues regarding the rescission or termination of a construction contract are themselves considered arbitrable issues under Sec. 2, Art. IV of the Rules of Procedure Governing Construction Arbitration, the Rules which were in force at the time the present controversy arose. . . .</p> <p> This brings us to the question of whether the dispute in this case falls within the scope of the arbitration clause.</p> <p> . . . .</p> <p> The arbitration clause in the [General Conditions of Contract] submits to the jurisdiction of the CIAC all disputes, claims or questions subject to arbitration under the contract. The language employed in the arbitration clause is such as to indicate the intent to include all controversies that may arise from the agreement as determined by the CIAC Rules. It is broad enough to encompass all issues save only those which EO 1008 itself excludes,<i> i.e</i>., employer-employee relationship issues. Under these Rules, the amount of damages and penalties is a general category of arbitrable issues under which Gammon's claims may fall.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[166]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted) </p> </blockquote> <p> This Court rules that the doctrine of the law of the case applies in this case. </p><p> There is a distinction between the agreement to arbitrate and the contract which may be the subject matter of the dispute between the parties. While the agreement to arbitrate may be in the same subject matter contract, it is a separate agreement in itself. </p><p> Under the Construction Industry Arbitration Law, CIAC acquires jurisdiction when the parties agree to submit the matter to voluntary arbitration. </p><blockquote> <p> Section 4. <i>Jurisdiction</i>. — The CIAC shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction over disputes arising from, or connected with, contracts entered into by parties involved in construction in the Philippines, whether the dispute arises before or after the completion of the contract, or after the abandonment or breach thereof. These disputes may involve government or private contracts.<i> For the Board to acquire jurisdiction, the parties to a dispute must agree to submit the same to voluntary arbitration.</i> </p> <p> The jurisdiction of the CIAC may include but is not limited to violation of specifications for materials and workmanship; violation of the terms of agreement; interpretation and/or application of contractual time and delays; maintenance and defects; payment, default of employer or contractor and changes in contract cost.</p> <p> Excluded from the coverage of this law are disputes arising from employer-employee relationships which shall continue to be covered by the Labor Code of the Philippines. (Emphasis supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> In <i>Ormoc Sugarcane Planters' Association, Inc. v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[167]</sup> this Court discussed that "an agreement to arbitrate is a contract" in itself: </p><blockquote> <p> Except where a compulsory arbitration is provided by statute, the first step toward the settlement of a difference by arbitration is the entry by the parties into a valid agreement to arbitrate. An agreement to arbitrate is a contract, the relation of the parties is contractual, and the rights and liabilities of the parties are controlled by the law of contracts. In an agreement for arbitration, the ordinary elements of a valid contract must appear, including an agreement to arbitrate some specific thing, and an agreement to abide by the award, either in express language or by implication. (Citation omitted)</p> </blockquote> <p> Thus, in <i>Gammon v. Metro Rail Transit Development Corporation</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[168]</sup> this Court ruled that CIAC does <i>not</i> have jurisdiction over construction <i>contracts</i>. Rather, it has jurisdiction over the <i>dispute </i>arising from or connected to construction contracts, such that it still acquires jurisdiction even if the contract has been breached, abandoned, terminated, or rescinded.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[169]</sup> </p><p> On the basis of this ruling, this Court concluded that CIAC has jurisdiction over the dispute between MRT and Gammon. Their contract need not be valid or in force before CIAC may arbitrate the matter, so long as there is an agreement to arbitrate.</p><p> Thus, the agreement to arbitrate is separate from the construction contract entered into by parties. </p><p> Nonetheless, the doctrine of the law of the case applies in the case at bar. While <i>Gammon</i> did not expressly state that the contract was perfected, it concluded that both the construction contract and the arbitration contract existed between the parties. </p><p> The doctrine of the law of the case applies when in a particular case, an appeal to a court of last resort has resulted in a determination of a question of law. The determined issue will be deemed to be the law of the case such that it will govern a case through all its subsequent stages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[170]</sup> Thus, after ruling on the legal issue and remanding the case to a lower court for further proceedings, the determined legal issue can no longer be passed upon and determined differently in another appeal in the same case. </p><p> In <i>Presidential Decree No. 1271 Committee v. De Guzman</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[171]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> The doctrine of the "law of the case" provides that questions of law previously determined by a court will generally govern a case through all its subsequent stages where "the determination has already been made on a prior appeal to a court of last resort." In <i>People v. Olarte</i>:</p> <blockquote> <p> Suffice it to say that our ruling in Case L-13027, rendered on the first appeal, constitutes the <i>law of the case</i>, and, even if erroneous, it may no longer be disturbed or modified since it has become final long ago. A subsequent reinterpretation of the law may be applied to new cases but certainly not to an old one finally and conclusively determined. </p> <blockquote> <p> 'Law of the case' has been defined as the opinion delivered on a former appeal. More specifically, it means that whatever is once irrevocably established as the controlling legal rule of decision between the same parties in the same case continues to be the law of the case, whether correct on general principles or not, so long as the facts on which such decision was predicated continue to be the facts of the case before the court.</p> <p> As a general rule a decision on a prior appeal of the same case is held to be the law of the case whether that decision is right or wrong, the remedy of the party being to seek a rehearing.</p> <p>. . . . </p> </blockquote> <p> It is thus clear that posterior changes in the doctrine of this Court [cannot] retroactively be applied to nullify a prior final ruling in the same proceeding where the prior adjudication was had, whether the case should be civil or criminal in nature.</p> </blockquote> <p> If an appellate court has determined a legal issue and has remanded it to the lower court for further proceedings, another appeal in that same case should no longer differently determine the legal issue previously passed upon. Similar to<i> res judicata</i>, it is a refusal to reopen what has already been decided.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[172]</sup> (Citations omitted)</p> </blockquote> <p> The legal issue determined in <i>Gammon</i> is the jurisdiction of CIAC. However, this determination was arrived at after this Court found that <i>the parties entered into a construction contract with an agreement to arbitrate.</i></p><p> This is indicated when<i> Gammon </i>determined that there is no novation of the contract between MRT and Gammon as to deprive CIAC of jurisdiction. It ruled that there is merely a <i>modification</i>, not an annulment or extinguishment, of the contract; thus: </p><blockquote> <p> We have carefully gone over the records of this case and are convinced that the redesign of the podium structure and the reduction in the contract price <i>merely modified the contract</i>.

Indemnification for damages shall comprehend not only the value of the loss suffered, but also that of the profits which the obligee failed to obtain.</p> </blockquote> <p> This Court has ruled that the award of unrealized profits cannot be based on the sole testimony of the party claiming it. In <i>Producers Bank of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[200]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> In the case at bar, actual damages in the form of unrealized profits were awarded on the basis of the sole testimony of private respondent Salvador Chua, to wit:</p> <p> . . . .</p> <p> However, other than the testimony of Salvador Chua, private respondents failed to present documentary evidence which is necessary to substantiate their claim for actual or compensatory damages. In order to recover this kind of damages, the injured party must prove his case, thus:</p> <blockquote> <p> When the existence of a loss is established, absolute certainty as to its amount is not required. The benefit to be derived from a contract which one of the parties has absolutely failed to perform is of necessity to some extent, a matter of speculation, but the injured party is not to be denied for that reason alone. He must produce the best evidence of which his case is susceptible and if that evidence warrants the inference that he has been damaged by the loss of profits which he might with reasonable certainty have anticipated but for the defendant's wrongful act, he is entitled to recover. (<i>Cerreno vs. Tan Chuco</i>, 28 Phil. 312 [1914] quoted in <i>Central Bank of the Philippines vs. Court of Appeals</i>, 63 SCRA 431 [1975])</p> </blockquote> <p> Applying the foregoing test to the instant case, the Court finds the evidence of private respondents •insufficient to be considered within the purview of "best evidence." The bare assertion of private respondent Salvador Chua that he lost an average of P18,000.00 per month is inadequate if not speculative and should be admitted with extreme caution especially because it is not supported by independent evidence. Private respondents could have presented such evidence as reports on the average actual profits earned by their gasoline business, their financial statements, and other evidence of profitability which could aid the court in arriving with reasonable certainty at the amount of profits which private respondents failed to earn. Private respondents did not even present any instrument or deed evidencing their claim that they have transferred their right to operate their gasoline station to their relatives. We cannot, therefore, sustain the award of P18,000.00 a month as unrealized profits commencing from October 16, 1984 because this amount is not amply justified by the evidence on record.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[201]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p align="center"> <b>IV.B</b> </p><p> As to the reimbursement award for engineering services, design work, site de-watering, and clean-up, MRT argues that it was not supported by sufficient documentary evidence as only 2% of the claims have official receipts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[202]</sup> It argues that invoice, debit notes, and summaries are not proof of payment.

The Court of Appeals, therefore, erred in ruling that there must be a subsisting contract before the jurisdiction of the CIAC may properly be invoked. <i>The jurisdiction of the CJAC is not over the contract but the disputes which arose therefrom, or are connected thereto, whether such disputes arose before or after the completion of the contract, or after the abandonment or breach thereof.</i></p> <p> It may even be added that issues regarding the rescission or termination of a construction contract are themselves considered arbitrable issues under Sec. 2, Art. IV of the Rules of Procedure Governing Construction Arbitration, the Rules which were in force at the time the present controversy arose.... <br> . . . .</p> <p> The arbitration clause in the [General Conditions of Contract] submits to the jurisdiction of the CIAC all disputes, claims or questions subject to arbitration under the contract. The language employed in the arbitration clause is such as to indicate the intent to include all controversies that may arise from the agreement as determined by the CIAC Rules. It is broad enough to encompass all issues save only those which EO 1008 itself excludes,<i> i.e.</i>, employer-employee relationship issues. Under these Rules, the amount of damages and penalties is a general category of arbitrable issues under which Gammon's claims may fall."
