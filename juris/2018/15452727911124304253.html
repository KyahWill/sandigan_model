Corazon Halili-Dichosa (OIC Halili-Dichosa), to sign the verification and certification of non-form shopping<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> as well as the failure of petitioner to attach material portions of the records of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Respondent argues that there was nothing in Memorandum Order No. 2015-080, series of2015, dated October 9, 2015 to indicate that the OIC is authorized to sign the verification and certification of non-forum shopping as it is not among the list of official documents mentioned in Department Order No. 14-39, series of 2014.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>As to the merits of the case, respondent insists that the CA correctly ruled that the withdrawal of respondent's ITH incentive was without any basis since respondent was able to comply with the requirements under the 2007 IPP by making substantial investments in fixed assets and by submitting progress reports on the implementation of its new project.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Respondent also echoes the view of the CA that there was nothing in the 2007 IPP to suggest that an actual physical structure or building must be erected to be registered as a new project as the same could refer to an equipment such as a conveyor belt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> In fact, respondent was registered as a new project because of its newly adopted beneficiation process, not because of any alleged representation to construct a beneficiation plant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> In any case, respondent claims that it has an assemblage of equipment and machineries which comprise its beneficiation plant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Finally, respondent likewise asserts that the withdrawal of its ITH incentive was without due process as petitioner failed to comply with the procedure laid down in the 2004 Revised Rules of Procedure on the Cancellation of Registration under Republic Act No. 5135, Presidential Decree No. 1789, <i>Batas Pambansa Blg.</i> 391 and Executive Order No. 226 (2004 BOI Revised Rules).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b><br></center><br>The Petition must be denied.<br><br><b><i>The Officer-in-Charge is authorized to sign the verification and certification of non-forum shopping.</i></b><br><br>Respondent questions the authority of OIC Halili-Dichosa to sign the verification and certification of non-forum shopping. Respondent claims that Memorandum Order No. 2015-080 only authorized OIC Halili-Dichosa to sign and approve vouchers, contracts, orders, and other official documents included in Department Order No. 14-39. And since the verification and certification of non­-forum shopping of the instant Petition is not included in the list of official documents, OIC Halili-Dichosa had no authority to file the instant Petition and sign the verification and certification of non-forum shopping of the same.<br><br>Although it appears that the verification and certification of non-forum shopping was not among the list of official documents mentioned in Department Order No. 14-39, series of 2014, the Court is still inclined to uphold the authority of OIC Halili-Dichosa to sign the same. In Memorandum Order No. 2015-080, Supervising Director Halili-Dichosa was designated OIC of petitioner <b>in the interest of service</b> as the Undersecretary/Managing Head was on an official trip. Considering the rationale of the said Memorandum, the Court finds that any doubt as to the authority of OIC Halili-Dichosa to file the instant case and to sign the verification and certification of non-forum shopping should be resolved in favor of the government. Obviously, OIC Halili-Dichosa caused the filing of the instant Petition in the performance of her duties and in order to protect the interests of the government. Thus, it is more prudent for the Court to decide the instant Petition on the merits rather than to dismiss it on a mere technicality.<br><br>Besides, in recent cases, the Court has allowed certain officials and employees to sign the verification and certification of non-forum shopping on behalf of the company without need of a board resolution. These are the chairperson of the board of directors, the president of a corporation, the general manager or acting general manager, the personnel officer, the employment specialist in a labor case, and other officials and employees who are "in a position to verify the truthfulness and correctness of the allegations in the petition."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> In this case, the Court considers OIC Halili-Dichosa to be in a position to verify the truthfulness and correctness of the allegations stated in the instant Petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br><b><i>Petitioner attached the material portions of the records as would support the Petition.</i></b><br><br>Respondent contends that the failure of petitioner to attach copies of the pleadings filed before the CA, namely: (1) respondent's Petition for Review; (2) petitioner's Comment; (3) respondent's Reply to Comment; (4) the Memoranda of the parties; (5) petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration; and (6) respondent's Comment/Opposition, is a ground for the dismissal of the instant case under Sections 4(d)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> and 5,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> of Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.<br><br>The Court does not agree.<br><br>The determination of what pleadings are material to the Petition is up to the Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> In this case, the Court finds that the pleadings filed before the CA were not material considering that most of the attachments to these pleadings were already attached to the instant Petition. What is important is that the assailed Decision and Resolution, the letters and issuances of petitioner as well as the documents submitted by respondent to petitioner were all attached to the Petition. Besides, such failure has been cured as the CA records have been elevated before the Court.<br><br>In <i>F.A.T. Kee Computer Systems, Inc. v. Online Networks International, Inc.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> the Court explained that:<br><blockquote>Rule 45, Section 4 of the Rules of Court indeed requires the attachment to the petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> 'such material portions of the record as would support the petition.' However, such a requirement was not meant to be an ironclad rule such that the failure to follow the same would merit the outright dismissal of the petition. In accordance with Section 7 of Rule 45, 'the Supreme Court may require or allow the filing of such pleadings, briefs, memoranda or documents as it may deem necessary within such periods and under such conditions as it may consider appropriate.' More importantly, Section 8 of Rule 45 declares that '[i]f the petition is given due course, the Supreme Court may require the elevation of the complete record of the case or specified parts thereof within fifteen (15) days from notice.' Given that the TSN of the proceedings before the RTC forms part of the records of the instant case, the failure of FAT KEE to attach the relevant portions of the TSN was already cured by the subsequent elevation of the case records to this Court. This pronouncement is likewise in keeping with the doctrine that procedural rules should be liberally construed in order to promote their objective and assist the parties in obtaining just, speedy and inexpensive determination of every action or proceeding.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br></blockquote>Having disposed of the procedural matters, the Court shall proceed to the substantive issues.<br><br><b><i>Respondent was afforded due process.</i></b><br><br>Petitioner imputes error on the CA in finding that respondent was not afforded due process. Petitioner insists that respondent was informed in the letter dated April 11, 2011 of its violation and was given several opportunities to refute the same.<br><br>Respondent, however, highlights the failure of petitioner to follow the procedure for the Cancellation of Registration provided in Sections 1 to 4, Rule II of the 2004 BOI Revised Rules, which reads:<br><blockquote><i>RULE II <br>Cancellation of Registration</i><br><br>SECTION 1. Initiate Cancellation Proceedings. - The 'Department' concerned shall initiate cancellation procedures against BOI-registered enterprises. It shall prepare a Memorandum for the cancellation of the BOI registration based on any of the ground/s so enumerated in Rule I, Section 2, par. (a) to (k). The same shall be supported by substantial evidence on record.<br><br>At the instance of any interested party and upon finding of reasonable basis to prove that the registered enterprise has committed any of the grounds for the cancellation of registration under Section 2 of these rules, the Department concerned shall prepare a 'show-cause letter of cancellation of registration' addressed to the subject BOI registered enterprise requiring it to explain in writing why its registration should not be cancelled.<br><br>SECTION 2. Memorandum; Contents. - The Memorandum for the cancellation of registration shall contain the following:<br><br>a.) The status of registration of the enterprise;<br><br>b.) The grounds for the cancellation of registration, a statement of the acts or omissions constituting the same, a statement of facts to establish compliance by the Board with the due notice requirement mandated under Article 7 of E.O. 226, the law and evidence in support of its findings and a recommendation for the cancellation of registration including:<br><br>(i) The imposition of fines and penalties, including the payment of interest, with basis therefor;<br><br>(ii) A recommendation for an order of refund, if warranted by the facts/evidence at hand;<br><br>SECTION 3. Complaint by an Interested Party; Contents. - Any interested party may file a verified complaint for the cancellation of the registration of any BOI ­registered enterprise. It shall contain the following:<br><br>a.) Name and address of the Complainant and his legal capacity to file the complaint;<br><br>b.) Name and address of the registered enterprise complained of;<br><br>c.) Ground/s for the cancellation of registration and the acts or omissions complained of as constituting the same; and<br><br>SECTION 4. Show-Cause Letter of Cancellation; Contents. - The 'show-cause letter' shall be addressed to the registered enterprise concerned and shall contain the following:<br><br>a) Ground/s for the cancellation of the registration;<br><br>b) Acts and/or omissions constituting the same;<br><br>c) Imposition of fines and/or penalties, whenever applicable;<br><br>d) Order of refund of incentives, whenever applicable;<br><br>e) Order for the registered enterprise to file its 'Reply' within fifteen (15) days from receipt of the 'show-cause' letter with a proviso that failure or inability to reply within such period will constrain the Office to immediately recommend the cancellation of the registration of the subject enterprise by way of a Memorandum.<br></blockquote>Respondent claims that the Resolution of the <i>Sangguniang Bayan</i> of the Municipality of Tubay cannot be considered as a verified complaint nor can the letter dated April 11, 2011 be deemed as a show-cause letter. Petitioner likewise cannot claim that it initiated <i>motu proprio</i> proceedings against respondent considering that it failed to prepare a memorandum as required under Section 1 of the BOI Revised Rules.<br><br>Due process in administrative proceedings is defined as "the opportunity to explain one's side or the opportunity to seek a reconsideration of the action or ruling complained of."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Because of the nature of administrative proceedings, administrative agencies are usually given a wide latitude or sufficient leeway in applying technical rules of procedure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>In this case, although there may have been infirmities or lapses in initiating the cancellation process, the Court, nonetheless, finds that essentially respondent was afforded due process since it was informed of the allegations against it and was given ample opportunity to refute the same. Records show that respondent received the letter dated April 11, 2011 informing it of the allegations made by the <i>Sangguniang Bayan</i> and of the <i>Sangguniang Bayan's</i> request for the cancellation of respondent's BOI registration; that the said letter required respondent to file a reply within 15 days from receipt of the same; that respondent was allowed to submit evidence to refute the allegations against it; and that respondent sought reconsideration of the withdrawal of its ITH incentive. These clearly show that the essence of due process was complied with.<br><br>It must be stressed though that in finding that respondent was afforded due process, the Court is not implying that rules of procedures may be brushed aside or trivialized. What the Court is saying is that the rigid application of the rules of procedure should be avoided if it would result in delay or frustrate rather than promote substantial justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>However, while respondent was not deprived of due process, the Court, nevertheless, finds that, as aptly found by the CA, the withdrawal of the ITH incentive was without any basis.<br><br><b><i>Respondent is entitled to an ITH incentive.</i></b><br><br>Petitioner claims that the CA erred m reversing and setting aside its resolutions withdrawing respondent's ITH incentives. Petitioner maintains that respondent failed to comply with the terms and conditions attached to its Certificate of Registration; specifically, respondent failed to:<br><blockquote>1) establish another line (beneficiation plant) contrary to its representations;<br><br>2) infuse new investment in fixed assets;<br><br>3) submit progress reports; and<br><br>4) adhere to its project timetable.<br></blockquote>However, after a careful review of the records, the Court agrees with the findings of the CA that the withdrawal of respondent's ITH incentive was not supported by the law and the evidence.<br><br>In its Application for Registration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> respondent asked that it "be considered as a NEW PRODUCER OF BENEFICIATED SILICATE ORE on the basis of its newly granted [Mineral Production Sharing Agreement] and newly adopted beneficiation process."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Clearly, respondent never made any representation that it would be building a beneficiation plant. Moreover, there was nothing in the terms and conditions of both the Project Approval Sheet<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> and respondent's Certificate of Registration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> as well as in the 2007 IPP to indicate that a construction of a new plant was required for respondent to be registered as a "new project." The pertinent provision of the General Guidelines of the 2007 IPP reads:<br><blockquote><b>X. PROJECT TYPE AND STATUS</b><br><br>1. New Projects<br><br>Other than the normal definition of a new project, i.e., one to be undertaken by a newly formed/incorporated enterprise, the following are deemed new projects:<br><br>a Project to be establish by an existing enterprise with existing business operation(s) entirely distinct and different from the proposed project in terms of either final product or service, production process, equipment or raw material.<br><br>b. Project to be established by an existing enterprise along the same line of business as any of its existing operations provided it meets the following:<br><br>i. the new project will involve the establishment of another line that may be put up in a site either outside or contiguous to its existing premises or compound.<br><br>'Another Line' refers to new facilities used in the production of the registered product/service. This line may use a facility common to an existing line such as warehouse, finishing, quality control or laboratory.<br><br>'New Facility' refer to the space or area, physical structure and equipment provided for a particular purpose or segment of the production process/service activity.<br><br>ii. There is new investment in fixed assets and working capital.<br><br>x x x x<br></blockquote>Since there was no such requirement under the terms and conditions of both the Project Approval Sheet and respondent's Certificate of Registration as well as in the 2007 IPP, petitioner cannot use this as ground to withdraw respondent's ITH incentive.<br><br>In any case, even if respondent did commit to build a beneficiation plant, the Court agrees with respondent that a commitment to build a beneficiation plant does not necessarily require the construction of an industrial building or structure, as a beneficiation plant could also be an assemblage of equipment and machineries where the beneficiation process could be done. In this case, respondent was able to prove that it has a beneficiation plant, consisting of the following equipment and machineries:<br><blockquote>1) Kleeman Mobile Process Screen;<br><br>2) Commander Power Screen;<br><br>3) Commander Trommel Washer;<br><br>4) Terex Mobile Crusher;<br><br>5) CAT 950 Front Loader;<br><br>6) CAT 320 Backhoe; and<br><br>7) HM 350 Komatsu Articulated Trucks.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br></blockquote>As to petitioner's allegations that respondent failed (1) to infuse new investments in fixed assets; (2) to submit progress reports; and (3) to adhere to its project timetable, these are belied by the evidence. In fact, records show that respondent has invested a total of P1,151,666,643.01 for equipment and machineries, which are being used to produce beneficiated nickel silicate ore,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> and has submitted progress reports to petitioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Quoted below are the findings of the CA on these matters, which the Court adopts as its own:<br><blockquote>As for [respondent's] alleged failure to infuse new investments in fixed assets and acquisition of machinery/equipment, We find that, based on the evidence submitted by [respondent], which [petitioner] has not refuted or disputed, [respondent] has:<br><br>(a) already invested a total amount of One Billion One Hundred Fifty-One Million Six Hundred Sixty-Six Thousand Six Hundred Forty-Three Pesos and 1/100 (Php1,151,666,643.01);<br><br>(b) acquired, developed and/or constructed new facilities such as mine structures (i.e. ore stockyards and pier yards, dumpsites, haul roads, drainage canals, setting ponds) and support facilities (i.e. office building, motor pool/ME shop, bunkhouses and recreational facility, beaching areas or causeway); and<br><br>(c) acquired major equipment components of the beneficiation plant (i.e. 1 unit of Kleeman Mobiscreen, 1 unit of Caterpillar Model 320 DL HE, 2 units of Komatsu HM350-2, 1 unit of Commander Power Screen, 1 unit of Caterpillar 950H Wheel Loader, 2 units of Komatsu HM 350-1, 1 unit of Terex Mobile Crusher and 1 unit of Caterpillar Model 320 DL HE).<br><br>We cannot agree with [petitioner's] contention that [respondent] failed to comply with the project time table incorporated in its BOI [Certificate of Registration] because allegedly [respondent] purchased major equipment only in 2012. We find that [respondent] has sufficiently explained and proved that the pieces of equipment acquired in 2012 were merely a re-fleeting of old equipment and the acquisition of Kleeman Mobiscreen (used in screening crushed material from sized material) by [respondent] in 2012 is not evidence that before that, [respondent] has no existent and fully functional beneficiation process, albeit sizing, prior to the acquisition of Kleeman Mobiscreen in 2012, was done manually. We note [petitioner's] unsupported contention is highlighted by [respondent's] unrebutted claim that [petitioner] has not made any site inspection to be able to say that [respondent] has no beneficiation plant or has not infused new investment in terms of fixed assets, equipment and machineries.<br><br>We cannot likewise uphold [petitioner's] finding that [respondent] failed to submit progress reports as required under its BOI [Certificate of Registration]. Documentary evidence submitted by [respondent] includes such reports as filed negating BOI's finding. WE also note that [respondent] has, in fact [been] issued a Certificate of Good Standing by the Director of the Supervision and Monitoring Department of BOI.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br></blockquote>All told, the Court finds that the withdrawal of respondent's ITH incentive was without any basis, and thus, affirms the ruling of the CA reversing and setting aside the resolutions embodied in petitioner's letters dated May 24, 2012 and August 12, 2013.

A perusal of these documents would show that [SR Metals] repeatedly described that it would utilize a beneficiation process/plant for its new enterprise subject of its application for registration. The relevant portions of the above documents are herein quoted:<br><ol type="a"><li>In its letter dated April 30, 2008, reiterating its request for the [Board of Investments] to resolve that it is qualified as a "new producer" of beneficiated nickel silicate ore, and not merely an "expansion", viz.:<br><blockquote>"First, [SR Metals] is new in the production of beneficiated nickel silicate ore. <u><b>In its previous mining operations, [SR Metals] had not been engaged in the process of "beneficiation"</b></u> of minerals in its mining project in Tubay[,] Agusan Del Norte. As previously discussed in our application, the process of beneficiation is described as "the most efficient way in which the nickel ore mostly saprolite ores with soft and hard ores could be segregated by <u><b>using a beneficiation/ processing plant</b></u>."<br><br>"Now therefore, [SR Metals] can be considered as a NEW PRODUCER OF BENEFICIATED SILICATE ORE on the basis of its newly granted [Mineral Production Sharing Agreements] and newly adopted beneficiation process."</blockquote></li><li>[SR Metals'] Project Feasibility Report described the mining method it would undertake for its project:<br><blockquote>"3.8 Description of Mining Method<br><br>Mining and processing sequence are as follows:<br><blockquote>• Clearing<br>• Stripping<br>• Mining<br>• Beneficiation<br>• Concentrating<br>• Hauling or beneficiated and concentrated products to pier stockyards<br>• Shipping of the ore<br></blockquote>3.8.4 Beneficiation<br><br>This is the most efficient way in which the ore mostly saprolite ores with soft and hard ores could be segregated by <u>using a beneficiation/processing plant</u>."<br></blockquote></li><li>SR Metals' Project Feasibility Report further stated the use of a beneficiation plant to implement its mining method/processes:<br><blockquote>"[T]he estimated initial volume of investment to implement the Project is Php364,594,150.00 or US$8,102,092.00. The Project Management will undertake mining operation and <u><b>a beneficiation plant will be constructed/installed</b></u> for the efficient segregation of soft and hard [o]res. The Company will be buying its own heavy equipment.</blockquote></li><li>In its Feasibility Project Report, SR Metals indicated that it will make a fixed investment of P43,650,000.00 for the beneficiation plant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)<br></li></ol></blockquote>SR Metals' repeated referral to a beneficiation plant in its Project Feasibility Report belies its assertion that it never represented that it would install a beneficiation plant which would be valued at P43,650,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>More importantly though, it was the construction of a beneficiated plant and the purchase of new pieces of equipment that characterized SR Metals as a new producer because without those two (2) substantial capital investments, it would have been considered to have merely expanded its existing mining operations and would not have qualified for the fiscal incentive of a full income tax holiday.<br><br>This is evident with how the Board of Investments initially rejected SR Metals' application as a "new producer" and suggested that it file an application for an "expanding" producer instead since it was already engaged in small-scale mining. It was only upon SR Metals' request for a reconsideration and upon its commitment that it would build a beneficiation plant that the Board of Investments reconsidered its earlier decision and approved SR Metals' application as "new producer."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>An income tax holiday is one of the incentives for registered enterprises provided for in Executive Order No. 226:<br><blockquote>Article 39. Incentives to Registered Enterprises. All registered enterprises shall be granted the following incentives to the extent engaged in a preferred area of investment;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) Income Tax Holiday.<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(1) For six (6) years from commercial operation for pioneer firms and four (4) years for non-pioneer firms, <i>new registered firms</i> shall be fully exempt from income taxes levied by the National Government. Subject to such guidelines as may be prescribed by the Board, the income tax exemption will be extended for another year in each of the following cases:<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><div style="margin-left: 40px;">i. the project meets the prescribed ratio of capital equipment to number of workers set by the Board;<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">ii. utilization of indigenous raw materials at rates set by the Board;<br></div></div><br><div style="margin-left: 80px;">iii. the net foreign exchange savings or earnings amount to at least US$500,000.00 annually during the first three (3) years of operation.<br></div><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The preceding paragraph notwithstanding, no registered pioneer firm may avail of this incentive for a period exceeding eight (8) years.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) For a period of three (3) years from commercial operation, registered expanding firms shall be entitled to an exemption from income taxes levied by the National Government proportionate to their expansion under such terms and conditions as the Board may determine; Provided, however, That during the period within which this incentive is availed of by the expanding firm it shall not be entitled to additional deduction for incremental labor expense.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) The provision of Article 7 (14) notwithstanding, registered firms shall not be entitled to any extension of this incentive. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Article 39(a)(1) clearly provides that only new registered firms or new projects may qualify for either a four (4)-year or six (6)-year income tax holiday. Article 39(a)(2) likewise provides a similar incentive to expanding firms, but only for a period of three (3) years and only in proportion to their expansion. Thus, it is understandable why SR Metals would insist on being considered as a new producer because the fiscal incentives given to an expanding producer simply pales in comparison to those available to a new producer.<br><br>Nonetheless, the decision on whether or not SR Metals should be classified as a new producer ultimately belongs with the Board of Investments pursuant to its duty to process and approve applications for registration, and to its power to impose the terms and conditions for applications for registration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> The Board of Investments likewise has the principal authority to determine if a registered enterprise falls under the specific activities that may qualify for fiscal incentives under the annual Investment Priorities Plan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Consequently, it has the power to either cancel or suspend a registration or an incentive, for the registered enterprise's failure to maintain the required qualifications or its violation of the terms of registration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, the 2007 Investment Priorities Plan provided three (3) different types of new projects: (1) a newly formed or incorporated enterprise; (2) an existing enterprise with a proposed project that is entirely different from its existing business operation; and (3) an existing enterprise which will put up another line or new facility, i.e., physical structure and equipment, and will infuse new investment into its existing business operation.<br><br>A registered enterprise will have to fall under any of the three (3) classifications for new projects to quality for an income tax holiday; and the Board of Investments, with its mandate of implementing Executive Order No. 226, is the government body empowered to determine if a registered enterprise satisfies the established requirements.<br><br>The Board of Investments found that SR Metals failed to comply with the terms and conditions of its registration; thus, there is a need to revoke its previous entitlement to an income tax holiday:<br><blockquote>In petitioner's evaluation, it found [SR Metals] wanting in its compliance with the terms and conditions of its registration, to wit: 1) establishment of another line (beneficiation plant); 2) infusion of new investments in fixed assets; 3) submission of a progress report; and 4) adherence to project timetable specifically on the acquisition of machinery. As a result of [SR Metals'] failure to comply with the conditions attached to its registration and the grant of [income tax holiday] incentive, [SR Metals'] entitlement to such incentive did not accrue. It follows then that petitioner can revoke/cancel [SR Metals'] [income tax holiday] entitlement. To repeat, facts warrant the complete revocation of [SR Metals'] registration, but petitioner only merited the withdrawal of [income tax holiday] incentive to [SR Metals].<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br></blockquote>This Court has consistently deferred to the factual findings of administrative agencies as they are the recognized experts in their fields and they can resolve problems in their respective fields "with more expertise and dispatch than can be expected from the legislature or courts of justice."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Thus, this Court has accorded respect and even finality to the factual findings of administrative bodies as a tacit recognition of their expertise and technical knowledge over issues falling squarely within their jurisdictions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Similar to the respect accorded to their factual findings, the interpretation by administrative agencies of their own rules and regulations Is likewise given great respect by this Court, as evident in <i>Eastern Telecommunications Philippines, Inc. v. International Communication Corporation</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><blockquote>The NTC, being the government agency entrusted with the regulation of activities coming under its special and technical forte, and possessing the necessary rule-making power to implement its objectives, is in the best position to interpret its own rules, regulations and guidelines. The Court has consistently yielded and accorded great respect to the interpretation by administrative agencies of their own rules unless there is an error of law, abuse of power, lack of jurisdiction or grave abuse of discretion clearly conflicting with the letter and spirit of the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>An income tax holiday is bestowed on a new project to encourage investors to set up businesses and to contribute to the country's economic growth. The fiscal incentive is also meant to help registered enterprises recoup their substantial initial investments by giving them a reprieve from paying income tax for a few years. However, like any privilege, the income tax holiday comes with conditions and requirements which must be fulfilled for its continued enjoyment.<br><br>With its failure to put up a physical structure, i.e., the beneficiation plant, <i>and</i> pieces of equipment, SR Metals cannot be classified as a new project under the 2007 Investment Priorities Plan. Hence, it is not entitled to an income tax holiday and the Board of Investments did not err in revoking its entitlement to it.<br><br><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, I vote to <b>GRANT</b> the petition and <b>REVERSE</b> and <b>SET ASIDE</b> the Court of Appeals December 4, 2014 Decision and August 11, 2015 Resolution in CA-G.R.
