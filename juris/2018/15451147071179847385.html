Forensic chemist PI Baligod was called to the stand to explain why she failed to indicate the "TCF" markings placed by SPO2 Flojo on the plastic sachet of <i>shabu</i> and glass tooter submitted as specimen.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Thereafter, the prosecution presented on the witness stand PO2 Jefferson Sulmerin (PO2 Sulmerin), the poseur-buyer, and PO2 Cristopher<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Pola (PO2 Pola), one of the arresting officers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br><b><i>Version of the Prosecution</i></b><br><br>Based on their testimonies, the version of the prosecution is, as follows:<br><br>At around 2:00 p.m. of March 31, 2011, the Office of the Provincial Anti­-Illegal Drugs Special Operations Task Group (PAIDSOTG) received an information or "tip" from a female informant regarding the rampant selling of <i>shabu</i> by appellant. Thereafter, PO2 Pola, PO2 Joey Aninag (PO2 Aninag) and PO2 Sulmerin coordinated with the resident agents of the Regional Anti-Illegal Drugs Special Operations Task Group (RAIDSOTG), PO2 Jovani Butay (PO2 Butay) and PO2 Dennis Ramos (PO2 Ramos), as well as with the members of the Philippine National Police (PNP) Laoag City led by SPO4 Rovimanuel Balolong (SPO4 Balolong) to conduct a buy-bust

stayed inside their vehicles to wait for the pre-arranged signal, which was a "missed call" on the cellphone of PO2 Pola from PO2 Sulmerin.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> When PO2 Sulmerin and the confidential informant reached the house of appellant, the confidential informant knocked on the door.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Appellant opened the door and asked the confidential informant who she was with, referring to PO2 Sulmerin.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> She said that PO2 Sulmerin was her companion who wanted to buy "stuff."<sup

from him was the marked P1,000.00 bill.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> He was then asked to sit in the living room while the team searched the room from where he got the <i>shabu</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Inside the room, they found Manilyn sitting on the bed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Likewise recovered from the room was a brown box which contained a glass tooter, a lighter, three pieces foil, two wooden clips, and a paper scoop.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> PO2 Sulmerin asked Manilyn to join appellant in the living room.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> PO2 Sulmerin then placed the seized items together with the marked money and the plastic sachet of <i>shabu</i> on the table in the

forensic chemist PI Baligod.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Upon receipt of the seized items, forensic chemist PI Baligod conducted an initial test and a confirmatory test on the

as <i>shabu</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> She then prepared the Initial Laboratory Report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> and the Confirmatory Chemistry Report.<sup

The RTC upheld the validity of the buy-bust operation and gave more credence to the testimonies of the prosecution's witnesses than to the denial of appellant as it found no ill motive on the part of the police officers to falsely accuse appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> As to the testimonies of Rogelio and Reynald, the RTC found that these did not help the defense of denial of appellant as Rogelio apparently only witnessed what happened after the arrest, while the testimony of Reynald did not negate the fact that a buy-bust operation was conducted on the said date.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> The RTC also found that the chain of custody of the seized items was established by the prosecution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>However, as to the charge of illegal possession of drug paraphernalia, the RTC resolved to acquit appellant and Manilyn due to inadmissibility of evidence. The RTC explained, that since appellant was already handcuffed, the possibility him getting a weapon or any contraband in the room was remote. Thus, the search of the room incidental to the arrest was not valid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> As to Manilyn, the RTC found that there was no ample evidence to show that she was the live-in partner of appellant or that she was in control and dominion of the room from which the seized paraphernalia were found.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>Thus, the dispositive portion of the Decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered finding [appellant] GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt as charged in Criminal Case No. 14722 of illegal sale of shabu as punished under Section 5, Article II of [RA] No. 9165 and is therefore sentenced to suffer the penalty of LIFE IMPRISONMENT and to pay a [fine] of P2,000,000.00.<br><br>Said [appellant] and Manilyn Pompa are however ACQUITTED as charged in Criminal Case No. 14723 for illegal possession of drug paraphernalia for inadmissibility of evidence.<br><br>The shabu and the drug paraphernalia subject hereof are confiscated, the same to be disposed as the law prescribes.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br></blockquote><b><i>Ruling of the Court of Appeals</i></b><br><br>Appellant appealed to the CA.<br><br>On October 9, 2015, the CA rendered a Decision affirming the RTC Decision. The CA ruled that there was a valid buy-bust operation based on the evidence presented.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Although there was no prior surveillance, the CA explained that it was not a prerequisite for a valid buy-bust operation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> The CA also found that the Chain of Custody Rule was complied with and that the failure of forensic chemist PI Baligod to indicate the actual markings on her reports was adequately explained.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> The CA further said that the non-presentation of the confidential informant was not fatal to the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> What is important was that the elements of the crime of illegal sale of <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span> were duly established by the evidence presented by the prosecution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>Hence, appellant filed the instant appeal, raising the same arguments he had in the CA.<br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b><br></center><br>The appeal has merit.<br><br>The Chain of Custody Rule, embodied in Section 21, Article II of RA 9165,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> the law applicable at the time of the commission of the crime charged, provides -<br><blockquote>SECTION 21. <i>Custody and Disposition of Confiscated, Seized, and/or Surrendered Dangerous Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous Drugs, Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, Instruments/Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment</i>. - The PDEA shall take charge and have custody of all dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, as well as instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment so confiscated, seized and/or surrendered, for proper disposition in the following manner:<br><br>(1) The apprehending team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice [DOJ], and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof<br><br>(2) Within twenty-four (24) hours upon confiscation/seizure of dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, as well as instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment, the same shall be submitted to the PDEA Forensic Laboratory for a qualitative and quantitative examination.<br><br>(3) A certification of the forensic laboratory examination results, which shall be done under oath by the forensic laboratory examiner, shall be issued within twenty-four (24) hours after the receipt of the subject item/s: <i>Provided</i>, That when the volume of the dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, and controlled precursors and essential chemicals does not allow the completion of testing within the time frame, a partial laboratory examination report shall be provisionally issued stating therein the quantities of dangerous drugs still to be examined by the forensic laboratory: <i>Provided, however</i>, That a final certification shall be issued on the completed forensic laboratory examination on the same within the next twenty-four (24) hours<br></blockquote>x x x x<br><br>In the recent case of <i>People v. Lim</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> the Court stressed the importance of the presence of the three witnesses (i.e. any elected public official and the representative from the media and the DOJ) during the physical inventory and the photograph of the seized items. In case of their absence, the Court ruled that -<br><blockquote>It must be <b>alleged and proved</b> that the presence of the three witnesses to the physical inventory and photograph of the illegal drug seized was not obtained due to reason/s such as:<br><blockquote>(1) <b>their attendance was impossible because the place of arrest was a remote area;</b> (2) <b>their safety during the inventory and photograph of the seized drugs was threatened by an immediate retaliatory action of the accused or any person/s acting for and in his/her behalf;</b> (3) <b>the elected official themselves were involved in the punishable acts sought to be apprehended;</b> (4) <b>earnest efforts to secure the presence of a DOJ or media representative and an elected public official within the period required under Article 125 of the Revised Penal Code prove futile through no fault of the arresting officers, who face the threat of being charged with arbitrary detention;</b> or (5) <b>time constraints and urgency of the anti-drug operations, which often rely on tips of confidential assets, prevented the law enforcers from obtaining the presence of the required witnesses even before the offenders could escape.</b><br></blockquote>Earnest effort to secure the attendance of the necessary witnesses must be proven. <i>People v. Ramos</i> requires:<br><blockquote>It is well to note that the absence of these required witnesses does not <i>per se</i> render the confiscated items inadmissible. However, a justifiable reason for such failure or a <u><b>showing of any genuine and sufficient effort to secure the required witnesses</b></u> under Section 21 of RA 9165 must be adduced. In <i>People v. Umipang</i>, the Court held that the prosecution must show that <u><b>earnest efforts</b></u> were employed in contacting the representatives enumerated under the law for "a sheer statement that representatives were unavailable without so much as an explanation on whether serious attempts were employed to look for other representatives, given the circumstances is to be regarded as a flimsy excuse." Verily, mere statements of unavailability, absent actual serious attempts to contact the required witnesses are unacceptable as justified grounds for noncompliance. These considerations arise from the fact that police officers are ordinarily given sufficient time - beginning from the moment they have received the information about the activities of the accused until the time of his arrest - to prepare for a buy-bust operation and consequently, make the necessary arrangements beforehand knowing full well that they would have to strictly comply with the set procedure prescribed in Section 21 of RA 9165. As such, police officers are compelled not only to state reasons for their non-compliance, but must in fact, also convince the Court that they exerted earnest efforts to comply with the mandated procedure, and that under the given circumstances, their actions were reasonable.<br></blockquote></blockquote>Simply put, under prevailing jurisprudence, in case the presence of the necessary witnesses was not obtained, the prosecution must allege and prove not only the reasons for their absence, but also the fact that earnest efforts were made to secure their attendance.<br><br>Here, the prosecution failed to prove both.<br><br>Under RA 9165, the law prevailing at that time, the physical inventory and photography must be witnessed by three necessary witnesses. In this case, PO2 Sulmerin conducted an inventory of the seized items in the presence of appellant, Manilyn, media person Curameng, and Chief Tanod Bugaoisan, who, as aptly pointed out by Justice Bernabe, was not even an elected public official. There was also no DOJ representative present at the time. Thus, strictly speaking, there was only one valid witness, media person Curanmeng, who signed the Receipt of Properties/Article Seized.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> The Court has carefully reviewed the records and found that no explanation was also offered by the prosecution to explain the absence of the DOJ representative and an elected public official, nor did it show that earnest efforts were exerted to secure the presence of the same. In view of the foregoing, the Court is constrained to reverse the conviction of the appellant due to the failure of the prosecution to provide a justifiable reason for the non-compliance with the Chain of Custody Rule, which creates doubt as to the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized plastic sachet of <i>shabu</i>.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appeal is <b>GRANTED</b>.
