No. 01807 which affirmed with modification the October 29, 2013 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 13, Carigara, Leyte, finding appellant Danilo Japag guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder.<br><br><b><i>The Antecedent Facts</i></b><br><br>Appellant, together with his co-accused, Alvin Liporada (Liporada), was charged with the, crime of murder in an Information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated May 11, 2009 which reads:<br><blockquote>That on or about the 16<sup>th</sup> day of March, 2009[,] in the Municipality of Tunga, Province of Leyte, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, conspiring and helping one another, with deliberate intent to kill, with treachery and taking advantage of superior strength, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack and stab RODEL PARROCHO y MONTE, with the use of a bladed weapon, which accused Danilo Japag provided himself for the purpose, thereby inflicting upon the victim an incised wound at the back left, medial to the inferior portion of the left scapula, penetrating the thoracic cavity, which was the direct and immediate cause of death of said Rodel Parrocho <i>y</i> Monte.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<br></blockquote>During his arraignment on July 7, 2009, appellant entered a plea of not guilty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Trial thereafter ensued.<br><br><b><i>Version of the Prosecution</i></b><br><br>The prosecution's version of the incident is as follows:<br><br>On March 16, 2009, at around 3:00 p.m., Ramil Parrocho (Ramil), the victim's twin brother, was at a <i>sari-sari</i> store in front of Gregorio Catenza National High School when he saw appellant, Liporada, and Eman Macalalag (Macalalag) blocking the way of the victim who was then about to the enter the school gate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Ramil thereafter saw Liporada punch his brother at the left cheek while being held in place by Macalalag. Suddenly, appellant, who was positioned behind the victim, drew a bladed weapon from his pocket and stabbed the latter at the back. Upon receiving the stabbing blow, the victim fell on the ground. The attack on the victim was so unexpected that Ramil and even the security guards at the school outposts were not able to come to his rescue. Appellant, Liporada and Macalalag immediately fled towards the direction of the highway.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>The victim was rushed to the EVRMC Hospital in Tacloban City, but he was pronounced dead on arrival. He died while the ambulance was en route to the hospital from the Municipality of Jaro.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Based on the post-mortem examination conducted on the victim's body by Dr. Crescento A. Uribe (Dr. Uribe), the Municipal Health Officer, the cause of death was <i>Intrathoracic Hemorrhage Secondary to a Penetrating Stab Wound</i>. The victim sustained an incised wound about 2 centimeters in length below the scapular bone of his back. The wound was fatal because it penetrated the victim's thoracic (chest) cavity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br><b><i>Version of the Defense</i></b><br><br>Appellant raised the justifying circumstance of self-defense in order to exculpate himself from criminal liability, <i>viz.</i>:<br><blockquote>x x x x On the mentioned date[,] at 2:00 o'clock in the afternoon, he was practicing together with his classmates a song for their MSEP subject. Alvin Liporada and Eman Macalalag were also there. While they were practicing, Rodel Parrocho came in and threatened to kill him if he goes outside the school. Later that day, while he was on his way home, Rodel Parrocho attacked him and hit him on his face with a fist blow causing him to fall. When he was about to get up, Rodel Parrocho stabbed him with the use of [a] short bladed weapon locally known as <i>sipol</i>. Fortunately, he was able to parry it and wrestled for the knife. The next thing he knew was Rodel Parrocho fell to the ground with a stab wound. This gave him an opportunity to run home. The following day, March 17, 2009[,] at about 7:00 o'clock in the evening, he went to [the] Tunga Police Station to surrender. His father accompanied him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br></blockquote><b><i>Ruling of the Regional Trial Court</i></b><br><br>In its Decision dated October 29, 2013, the RTC found appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code.<br><br>The RTC found no merit in appellant's contention that he had acted in self-defense which resulted in the victim's killing. Aside of the absence of proof showing that he had sustained any injury as a result of the supposed hard punch thrown at him by the victim,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> the RTC also explained that:<br><blockquote>Verily, the self-defense invoked by the accused cannot be appreciated, as it is unworthy of belief. The wound sustained by the victim at his back, would belie the claim of the accused that the stabbing was not deliberate. In fact, accused['s] intent to kill the victim was proven through the deadly weapon used by him, his fatal stab thrust, and the location where the fatal blow was directed, which stab wound resulted in the severe blood loss of the victim leading to the latter's immediate death. x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br></blockquote>Moreover, the RTC ruled that the victim's killing was attended by the qualifying circumstance of treachery, as the suddenness of appellant's attack on the victim from behind rendered the latter defenseless and unable to flee or escape. The RTC held that appellant had consciously adopted the manner by which he mounted the attack on the victim in order to ensure his safety from any retaliatory attack and to deny the victim an opportunity to defend himself or repel the attack.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Accordingly, the RTC sentenced appellant to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>. It likewise ordered appellant to pay the heirs of the victim: P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P75,000.00 as moral damages, P30,000.00 as exemplary damages, and P17,500.00 as actual damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>The RTC also issued an alias warrant of arrest against Liporada "to be served in his residence or anywhere where he could be found within the territory of the Philippines."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Appellant thereafter appealed the RTC Decision before the CA. <br><br><b><i>Ruling of the Court of Appeals</i></b><br><br>In its Decision dated May 21, 2015, the CA affirmed the assailed RTC Decision with modification as regards the imposition of interest at 6% per annum on all damages awarded from date of finality of the judgment until fully paid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Like the RTC, the CA also rejected appellant's claim of self-defense in the absence of proof of unlawful aggression on the part of the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> It noted that Ramil's "clear and detailed account of the incident negate[d] any hint that the unlawful aggression originated from the victim,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> as did the nature and location of the wound sustained by the latter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>The CA further ruled that the elements of the qualifying circumstance of treachery were present in the case, since "[t]he victim had no chance to avoid the attack when he was boxed by Alvin first and then suddenly stabbed from behind by [appellant], while being held by Eman."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> It thus concluded that under those dire circumstances, the victim could not have had the chance to defend himself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Aggrieved, appellant filed the present appeal.<br><br><center><b>The Issues</b><br></center><br>Appellant raises the following issues for the Court's resolution:<br><br><i>First</i>, whether appellant was able to sufficiently prove the justifying circumstance of self-defense;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>And <i>second</i>, whether the victim's stabbing was attended by treachery.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b><br></center><br>The appeal is unmeritorious.<br><br>It is settled that when an accused invokes self-defense, the burden of proof is <i>shifted</i> from the prosecution to the defense,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> and it becomes incumbent upon the accused to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, the existence of the following requisites of self-defense: <b><i>first</i></b>, unlawful aggression on the part of the victim; <b><i>second</i></b>, reasonable necessity of the means employed to prevent or repel such aggression; and <b><i>third</i></b>, lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the person defending himself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>As the burden of proof is shifted to the defense, the accused must rely on the strength of his evidence and <i>not</i> on the weakness of the prosecution's evidence. After all, by invoking self-defense, the accused, in effect, admits having killed or injured the victim, and he can no longer be exonerated of the crime charged <i>if</i> he fails to prove the requisites of self-defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>The most important requisite of self-defense is <b>unlawful aggression</b> which is the condition <i>sine qua non</i> for upholding self-defense as a justifying circumstance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> In other words, unless it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the victim had committed unlawful aggression against the accused, "self-defense, whether complete or incomplete, <i>cannot</i> be appreciated, for the two other essential elements [thereof] would have <i>no factual and legal bases</i> without any unlawful aggression to prevent or repel."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Unlawful aggression "contemplates an actual, sudden and unexpected attack, or imminent danger thereof, and not merely a threatening or intimidating attitude. The person defending himself must have been attacked with actual physical force or with actual use of [a] weapon."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>After a thorough review of the records, we find that appellant failed to discharge the burden of proving that the unlawful aggression had originated from the victim.<br><br><b><i>First</i></b>, it is undisputed that appellant boarded a motorcycle and fled the <i>situs criminis</i> immediately after stabbing the victim at the back.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> "Flight is a veritable badge of guilt and negates the plea of self-defense."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br><b><i>Second</i></b>, the location, nature and seriousness of the wound sustained by the victim is inconsistent with self-defense;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> rather, these factors indicate a determined effort to kill.<br><br>On this point, Dr. Uribe testified that the stabbing wound sustained by the victim <i>at the back portion of his body</i> can be characterized as <i>fatal</i>, as it penetrated the latter's chest cavity, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td colspan="2"><div align="justify">[PROS.
