				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"><b><i>Safety from external danger is the most powerful director of national conduct. Even the ardent love of liberty will, after a time, give way to its dictates.</i> - Alexander Hamilton</b><br><br><i>There is an ongoing rebellion in the Philippines. NPA rebels, Maute rebels, ASG rebels, BIFF rebels, Islamic fundamentalists and other armed groups are on the loose. They are engaged in armed conflict with government forces; they seek to topple the government; and they sow terror and panic in the community. <b>To ignore this reality and to claim that these are non-existent is to court consequences that endanger public safety.</b><br><br>A state of martial law is not the normative state. Neither does it take a perpetual form. It is an extraordinary power premised on necessity meant to protect the Republic from its enemies. Territorial and temporal limitations germane to the Constitutional prerequisites of the existence or persistence of actual rebellion or invasion and the needs of public safety severely restrict the declaration of martial law, or its extensions. The government can lift the state of martial law once actual rebellion no longer persists and that public safety is amply ensured. Should the government, through its elected President and the Congress, fail in their positive duties prescribed by the Constitution or transgress any of its safeguards, any citizen is empowered to question such acts before the Court. When its jurisdiction is invoked, the Court is not acting as an institution superior to that of the Executive or the Congress, but as the champion of the Constitution ordained by the sovereign Filipino people. For, after all, a state of martial law, awesome as it is perceived to be, does not suspend the operations of the Constitution which defines and limits the powers of the government and guarantees the bill of rights to every person.</i><br><br><center><b>The Case</b><br></center><br>These are consolidated petitions,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> filed under the third paragraph, Section 18 of Article VII of the Constitution, assailing the constitutionality of the extension of the proclamation of martial law and suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> in the entire Mindanao for one year from January 1 to December 31, 2018. Petitioners in G.R. No. 235935 alternatively, but not mandatorily, invoke the Court's expanded jurisdiction under Section 1 of Article VIII of the Constitution. Petitioners in G.R. Nos. 235935, 236061 and 236155 pray for a temporary restraining order (TRO) and/or writ of preliminary injunction to enjoin respondents from implementing the one-year extension.<br><br><center><b>The Antecedents</b><br></center><br>On May 23, 2017, President Rodrigo Roa Duterte issued Proclamation No. 216,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> declaring a state of martial law and suspending the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> in the whole of Mindanao for a period not exceeding sixty (60) days, to address the rebellion mounted by members of the Maute Group and Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG).<br><br>On May 25, 2017, within the 48-hour period set in Section 18, Article VII of the Constitution, the President submitted to the Senate and the House of Representatives his written Report, citing the events and reasons that impelled him to issue Proclamation No. 216. Thereafter, the Senate adopted P.S. Resolution No. 388<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> while the House of Representatives issued House Resolution No. 1050,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> both expressing full support to the Proclamation and finding no cause to revoke the same.<br><br>Three separate petitions<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> were subsequently filed before the Court, challenging the sufficiency of the factual basis of Proclamation No. 216. In a Decision rendered on July 4, 2017, the Court found sufficient factual bases for the Proclamation and declared it constitutional.<br><br>On July 18, 2017, the President requested the Congress to extend the effectivity of Proclamation No. 216. In a Special Joint Session on July 22, 2017, the Congress adopted Resolution of Both Houses No. 2<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> extending Proclamation No. 216 until December 31, 2017.<br><br>In a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> to the President, through Defense Secretary Delfin N. Lorenzana (Secretary Lorenzana), the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) Chief of Staff, General Rey Leonardo Guerrero (General Guerrero), recommended the further extension of martial law and suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> in the entire Mindanao for one year beginning January 1, 2018 "for compelling reasons based on current security assessment." On the basis of this security assessment, Secretary Lorenzana wrote a similar recommendation to the President "primarily to ensure total eradication of DAESH-inspired Da'awatul Islamiyah Waliyatul Masriq (DIWM), other like-minded Local/Foreign Terrorist Groups (L/FTGs) and Armed Lawless Groups (ALGs), and the communist terrorists (CTs) and their coddlers, supporters and financiers, and to ensure speedy rehabilitation, recovery and reconstruction efforts in Marawi, and the attainment of lasting peace, stability, economic development and prosperity in Mindanao."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Acting on said recommendations, the President, in a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> dated December 8, 2017, asked both the Senate and the House of Representatives to further extend the proclamation of martial law and the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> in the entire Mindanao for one year, from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018, or for such period as the Congress may determine. Urging the Congress to grant the extension based on the "essential facts" he cited, the President wrote:<br><blockquote>A further extension of the implementation of Martial Law and suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> in Mindanao will help the AFP, the Philippine National Police (PNP), and all other law enforcement agencies to quell completely and put an end to the on-going rebellion in Mindanao and prevent the same from escalating to other parts of the country. Public safety indubitably requires such further extension, not only for the sake of security and public order, but more importantly to enable the government and the people of Mindanao to pursue the bigger task of rehabilitation and the promotion of a stable socio-economic growth and development.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br></blockquote>Attached to the President's written request were the letters of Secretary Lorenzana<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> and General Guerrero<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> recommending the one-year extension.<br><br>On December 13, 2017, the Senate and the House of Representatives, in a joint session, adopted Resolution of Both Houses No. 4<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> further extending the period of martial law and suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> in the entire Mindanao for one year, from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018. In granting the President's request, the Congress stated:<br><blockquote>WHEREAS, the President informed the Congress of the Philippines of the remarkable progress made during the period of Martial Law, but nevertheless reported the following essential facts, which as Commander-in-Chief of all armed forces of the Philippines, he has personal knowledge of: First, despite the death of Hapilon and the Maute brothers, the remnants of their groups have continued to rebuild their organization through the recruitment and training of new members and fighters to carry on the rebellion; Second, the Turaifie Group has likewise been monitored to be planning to conduct bombings, notably targeting the Cotabato area; Third, the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters continue to defy the government by perpetrating at least fifteen (15) violent incidents during the Martial Law period in Maguindanao and North Cotabato; Fourth, the remnants of the Abu Sayyaf Group in Basilan, Sulu, Tawi-tawi, and Zamboanga Peninsula remain a serious security concern; and last, the New People's Army took advantage of the situation and intensified their decades-long rebellion against the government and stepped up terrorist acts against innocent civilians and private entities, as well as guerrilla warfare against the security sector and public and government infrastructure, purposely to seize political power through violent means and supplant the country's democratic form of government with Communist rule.<br><br>WHEREAS, Section 18, Article VII of the 1987 Constitution authorizes the Congress of the Philippines to extend, at the initiative of the President, such proclamation or suspension for a period to be determined by the Congress of the Philippines, if the invasion or rebellion shall persist and public safety requires it;<br><br>WHEREAS, on December 13, 2017, after thorough discussion and extensive debate, the Congress of the Philippines in a Joint Session by two hundred forty (240) affirmative votes comprising the majority of all its Members, has determined that rebellion persists, and that public safety indubitably requires the further extension of the Proclamation of Martial Law and the Suspension of the Privilege of the Writ of <i>Habeas Corpus</i> in the Whole of Mindanao; Now, therefore, be it <i>Resolved by the Senate and the House of Representatives in a Joint Session Assembled</i>, To further extend Proclamation No. 216, Series of 2017, entitled "Declaring a State of Martial Law and Suspending the Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus in the Whole of Mindanao" for a period of one (1) year from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b>The Parties' Arguments</b><br></div><br><b>A. Petitioners' case</b><br><br>Based on their respective petitions and memoranda and their oral arguments before this Court on January 16, 2018 and January 17, 2018, petitioners' arguments are summarized as follows:<br><br>(a) The petitioners' failure to attach the Congress' Joint Resolution approving the extension is not fatal to the consolidated petitions. Such failure is justified by the non-availability of the Resolution at the time the petition was filed. In any case, the Rules on Evidence allow the Court to take judicial notice of the Resolution as an official act of the legislative.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>(b) The doctrine of presidential immunity does not apply in a <i>sui generis</i> proceeding under Section 18, Article VII as such immunity pertains only to civil and criminal liability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> In this proceeding, the President is not being held personally liable for damages, or threatened with any punishment. If at all, he is being held to account for non-compliance with a constitutional requirement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>(c) The principle of conclusiveness of judgment is not a bar to raising the issue of the sufficiency of the factual basis of the extension, being different from the factual and legal issues raised in the earlier case of <i>Lagman v. Medialdea</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> At any rate, the Court's decision in <i>Lagman</i> is transitory considering the volatile factual circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Commissioner Joaquin G. Bernas (Fr. Bernas) emphasized during the deliberations on the 1987 Constitution that the evaluation of the Supreme Court in a petition which assails such factual situation would be "transitory if proven wrong by subsequent changes in the factual situation."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>(d) As to the scope and standards of judicial review, petitioners in G.R. No. 236145 assert that the standard for scrutiny for the present petitions is sufficiency of factual basis, not grave abuse of discretion. The former is, by constitutional design, a stricter scrutiny as opposed to the latter. Moreover, the Court is allowed to look into facts presented before it during the pendency of the litigation. This includes, for example, admissions made by the Solicitor General and the military during oral arguments, as they attempted to show compliance with the constitutional requirements.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>In contrast, petitioners in G.R. No. 235935 argue that the standard to be used in determining the sufficiency of the factual basis for the extension is limited to the sufficiency of the facts and information contained in the President's letter dated December 8, 2017 requesting for the extension and its annexes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>(e) As to the quantum of proof, petitioners in G.R. No. 236061 insist that clear and convincing evidence is necessary to establish sufficient factual basis for the extension of martial law instead of the "probable cause" standard set in <i>Lagman</i>. In comparison to the initial exercise of the extraordinary powers of proclamation of martial law and the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>, their extension must have had the benefit of sufficient time to gather additional information not only on the factual situation of an actual rebellion, but also the initial exercise of the Executive during its initial implementation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Petitioners further argue that given its critical role in the system of checks and balance, the Court should review not only the sufficiency of the factual basis of the re-extension but also its accuracy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>(f) As to the <i>onus</i> of showing sufficiency of the factual bases for extending martial law, petitioners in G.R. Nos. 235935 and 236145 contend that the President bears the same. Petitioners in G.R. No. 236155, however, argues that both the President and the Congress bear the burden of proof.<br><br>(g) In relation to the Court's power to review the sufficiency of the factual basis for the proclamation of martial law or any extension thereof, the military cannot withhold information from the Court on the basis of national security especially since it is the military itself that classifies what is "secret" and what is not. The Court's power to review in this case is a specific and extraordinary mandate of the Constitution that cannot be defeated and limited by merely invoking that the information sought is "classified."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>(h) The Congress committed grave abuse of discretion for precipitately and perfunctorily approving the extension of martial law despite the absence of sufficient factual basis.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> In G.R. No. 235935, petitioners impute grave abuse of discretion specifically against the "leadership and supermajority" of both Chambers of Congress, arguing that the extension was approved with inordinate haste as the Congress' deliberation was unduly constricted to an indecent 3 hours and 35 minutes. The three-minute period of interpellation (excluding the answer) under the Rules of the Joint Session of Congress was inordinately short compared to the consideration of ordinary legislation on second reading. Further, a member of Congress was only allowed a minute to explain his/her vote, and although a member who did not want to explain could yield his/her allotted time, the explanation could not exceed three minutes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Petitioners in G.R. No. 236061 highlighted the limited time given to the legislators to interpellate the AFP Chief, the Defense Secretary and other resource persons and criticized the Congress' Joint Resolution for not specifying its findings and justifications for the re-extension.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>(i) The Constitution allows only a one-time extension of martial law and/or suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>, not a series of extensions amounting to perpetuity. As regards the Congress' discretion to determine the period of the extension, the intent of the Constitution is for such to be of short duration given that the original declaration of martial law was limited to only sixty (60) days.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> In addition, the period of extension of martial law should satisfy the standards of necessity and reasonableness. Congress must exercise its discretion in a stringent manner considering that martial law is an extraordinary power of last resort.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>(j) The one-year extension of the proclamation of martial law and suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> lacked sufficient factual basis because there is no actual rebellion in Mindanao. The Marawi siege and the other grounds under Proclamation No. 216 that were used as the alleged bases to justify the extension have already been resolved and no longer persist.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> In his letter of request for further extension, the President admits that the Maute rebellion has already been quelled and the extension is to prevent the scattered rebels from gathering and consolidating their strength.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Moreover, the President himself had announced the liberation of Marawi and the cessation of armed combat.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>(k) The President and his advisers' justifications, which were principally based on "threats of violence and terrorism," "security concerns" and "imminent danger to public safety," do not amount to actual invasion or rebellion as to justify the extension of martial law. They merely constitute "imminent danger." Since the framers of the 1987 Constitution removed the phrase "imminent danger" as one of the grounds for declaring martial law, the President can no longer declare or extend martial law on the basis of mere threats of an impending rebellion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>(l) The extension should not be allowed on the basis of alleged NPA attacks because this reason was not cited in the President's original declaration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>(m) The alleged rebellion in Mindanao does not endanger public safety. The threat to public safety contemplated under Section 18, Article VII of the Constitution is one where the government cannot sufficiently or effectively govern, as when the courts or government offices cannot operate or perform their functions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>(n) Martial law should be operative only in a "theater of war" as intended by the drafters of the Constitution. For a "theater of war" to exist, there must be an area where actual armed conflict occurs which necessitate military authorities to take over the functions of government due to the breakdown, inability or difficulty of the latter to function. The insurrection must have assumed the status of a public and territorial war, and the conditions must show that government agencies within the local territory can no longer function.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Without any of the four objectives that comprise the second element of rebellion,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> the acts of "regrouping", "consolidation of forces", "recruitment" and "planning" stages, or the continuing commission of the crimes of terrorism, robbery, murder, extortion, as cited by the President in his December 8, 2017 letter, cannot be said to be the "theater of war" referred to by the framers of the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>(o) There is no need to extend martial law to suppress or defeat remnants of vanquished terrorist groups, as these may be quelled and addressed using lesser extraordinary powers (<i>i.e.</i>, calling out powers) of the President. Moreover, respondent General Guerrero failed to state during the oral arguments what additional powers are granted to the military by virtue of the proclamation and suspension and instead limited himself to the "effects" of martial law. Respondents simply failed to demonstrate how martial law powers were used. In short, there is no necessity for martial law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>In their Memorandum, petitioners in G.R. No. 236145 propounded two tests (<i>i.e.</i>, proportionality and suitability) in determining whether the declaration or extension of martial law is required or necessitated by public safety. The <i>Proportionality Test</i> requires that the situation is of such gravity or scale as to demand resort to the most extreme measures. Petitioners cited AFP's own admission that there are only 537 out of 8,813 barangays or 6.09% that are currently being controlled by rebel groups in Mindanao. On the other hand, the <i>Suitability Test</i> requires that the situation is such that the declaration of martial law is the correct tool to address the public safety problem. Considering that the AFP Chief of Staff could not cite what martial law powers they used in the past, and what martial law powers they intend to use moving forward, the present circumstances fail both tests.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>(p) Petitioners in G.R. No. 235935 allege that martial law and the suspension of the writ trigger the commission of human rights violations and suppression of civil liberties. In fact, the implementation of the same resulted to intensified human rights violations in Mindanao.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> In support of the same allegations, petitioners in G.R. No. 236061 attached a letter-report from <i>Salinlahi</i> on human rights violations committed as a consequence of martial law in Mindanao. They emphasize that martial law is a scare tactic, one that is not intended for the armed groups mentioned but actually against the dissenters of the government's policies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>(q) Finally, in support of their prayer for a TRO or a writ of preliminary injunction, petitioners in G.R. No. 235935 allege that they are Representatives to Congress, sworn to defend the Constitution, with the right to challenge the constitutionality of the subject re-extension. They claim that petitioner Villarin, who is a resident of Davao City, is personally affected and gravely prejudiced by there-extension as it would spawn violations of civil liberties of Mindanaoans like him, a steadfast critic of the Duterte administration. They also assert that the injunctive relief will foreclose further commission of human rights violations and the derogation of the rule of law in Mindanao.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Petitioners in G.R. No. 236061 likewise prays for a TRO or writ of preliminary injunction in order to protect their substantive rights and interests while the case is pending before this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br><b>B. Respondents' case</b><br><br>Respondents, through the Office of the Solicitor General, argue that:<br><br>a) Petitioners' failure to submit the written Joint Resolution extending the martial law and suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> is fatal since it is indispensable to the Court's exercise of its review power.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>b) The Cullamat and Rosales Petitions were filed against the President in violation of the doctrine of presidential immunity from suit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>c) The Court already ruled in <i>Lagman</i> that there is actual rebellion in Mindanao. Thus, the principle of conclusiveness of judgment pursuant to Section 47(c),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Rule 39 of the Rules of Court bars the petitioners from re­litigating the same issue.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>d) Given that the Court had already declared in <i>Lagman</i> that there is rebellion in Mindanao, the <i>onus</i> lies on the petitioners to show that the rebellion has been completely quelled.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>e) The invocation of this Court's expanded jurisdiction under Section 1, Article VIII of the Constitution is misplaced. As held in <i>Lagman</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> the "appropriate proceeding" in Section 18, Article VII does not refer to a petition for <i>certiorari</i> filed under Section 1 or 5 of Article VIII, as it is not the proper tool to review the sufficiency of the factual basis of the proclamation or extension.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>f) Petitioners failed to allege that rebellion in Mindanao no longer exists, which is a condition precedent for the filing of the instant petition. They only pointed out the President's announcement regarding the liberation of Marawi from "terrorist influence." They did not mention the rebellion being waged by DAESH-inspired Da'awatul Islamahiyah Waliyatul Masriq (DIWM), other like-minded Local/Foreign Terrorist Groups (L/FTGs) and Armed Lawless Groups (ALGs), remnants of the groups of Hapilon and Maute, the Turaifie Group, the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF), the ASG, and the New People's Army (NPA), as cited in the President's December 8, 2017 letter to Congress.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>g) The determination of the sufficiency of the factual basis to justify the extension of martial law became the duty of Congress after the President's request was transmitted. The question raised had assumed a political nature that can only be resolved by Congress.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>h) The manner in which Congress approved the extension is a political question, outside the Court's judicial authority to review. Congress has full discretion on how to go about the debates and the voting. The Constitution itself allows the Congress to determine the rules of its proceedings. The Court does not concern itself with parliamentary rules, which may be waived or disregarded by the legislature.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>i) Proclamation No. 216 and the subsequent extensions granted by Congress enjoy the presumption of constitutionality, which petitioners failed to overcome by proving that the extension is without basis. The presumption cannot be ignored, especially since the Court held in <i>Lagman</i>, that it considers only the information and data available to the President prior to or at the time of the declaration and will not undertake an independent investigation beyond the pleadings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>j) Even if the Court were to entertain the allegation of grave abuse of discretion on the part of Congress in approving the one-year extension, the same is without merit. Both houses of Congress gave due consideration to the facts relayed by the President which showed that rebellion persists in Mindanao and that public safety requires the extension. The extension was approved because of the stepped-up terrorist attacks against innocent civilians and private entities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>k) The period for deliberation on the President's request for further extension was not unduly constricted. The extension or revocation of martial law cannot be equated with the process of ordinary legislation. Given the time-sensitive nature of martial law or its extension, the time cap was necessary in the interest of expediency. Furthermore, an explanation of one's vote in the deliberation process is not a constitutional requirement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>l) The Constitution does not limit the period for which Congress can extend the proclamation and the suspension, nor does it prohibit Congress from granting further extension. The 60-day period imposed on the President's initial proclamation of martial law does not similarly apply to the period of extension. The clause "in the same manner" must be understood as referring to the manner by which Congress may revoke the proclamation or suspension, <i>i.e.</i>, Congress must also observe the same manner of voting: "voting jointly, by a vote of at least a majority of all its Members in regular or special session." Furthermore, in the absence of any express or implied prohibition in the Constitution, the Court cannot prevent Congress from granting further extensions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>m) The burden to show sufficiency of the factual basis for the extension of martial law is not with the President. Section 18, Article VII of the Constitution states that the extension of martial law falls within the prerogative of Congress.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>n) Even assuming that the burden of proof is on the President or Congress, such burden has been overcome. Although the leadership of the Mautes was decimated in Marawi, the rebellion in Mindanao persists as the surviving members of the militant group have not laid down their arms. The remnants remain a formidable force to be reckoned with, especially since they have established linkage with other rebel groups. With the persistence of rebellion in the region, the extension of martial law is, therefore, not just for preventive reasons. The extension is premised on the existence of an ongoing rebellion. That the rebellion is ongoing is beyond doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>o) In the context of the Revised Penal Code, even those who are merely participating or executing the commands of others in a rebellion, as coddlers, supporters and financiers, are guilty of the crime of rebellion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>p) As a crime without predetermined boundaries, the rebellion in various parts of Mindanao justified the extension of martial law, as well as the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>q) Under the Constitution, the extension of martial law and the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> are justified as long as there is rebellion and public safety requires it. The provision does not require that the group that started the rebellion should be the same group that should continue the uprising. Thus, the violence committed by other groups, such as the BIFF, AKP, ASG, DI Maguid, and DI Toraype (Turaifie) should be taken into consideration in determining whether the rebellion has been completely quelled, as they are part of the rebellion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>r) The President has the sole prerogative to choose which of the extraordinary commander-in-chief powers to use against the rebellion plaguing Mindanao. Thus, petitioners cannot insist that the Court impose upon the President the proper measure to defeat a rebellion. In light of the wide array of information in the hands of the President, as well as the extensive coordination between him and the armed forces regarding the situation in Mindanao, it would be an overreach for the Court to encroach on the President's discretion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>s) Among the differences between the calling out power of the President and the imposition of martial law is that, during the latter, the President may ask the armed forces to assist in the execution of civilian functions, exercise police power through the issuance of General or Special Orders, and facilitate the mobilization of the reserve force, among others.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>t) While the Anti-Terrorism Council (ATC) has powers that can be used to fight terrorism, the ATC, however, becomes relevant only in cases of terrorism. Thus, for the purpose of involving itself during a state of martial law, the ATC must first associate an act of rebellion with terrorism, as rebellion is only one of the means to commit terrorism.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>u) The phrase "theater of war" in relation to martial law should be understood in a traditional Groatian sense, which connotes that "war" is "an idea of multitude" and not limited to the concept between two nations in armed disagreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> Nevertheless, the Constitution does not require the existence of a "theater of war" for a valid proclamation or extension of martial law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>v) There is no need to show the magnitude of rebellion, as placing the requirement of public safety on a scale will prevent the application of laws and undermine the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>w) The alleged human rights violations are irrelevant in the determination of whether Congress had sufficient factual basis to further extend martial law and suspend the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>. As ruled in <i>Lagman</i>, petitioners' claim of alleged human rights violations should be resolved in a separate proceeding and should not be taken cognizance of by the Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> Moreover, the alleged human rights violations are unsubstantiated and contradicted by facts. According to the AFP Human Rights Office, no formal complaints were filed in their office against any member or personnel of the AFP for human rights violations during the implementation of martial law in Mindanao. The online news articles cited in the Cullamat Petition have no probative value, as settled in <i>Lagman</i>.<br><br>x) Martial law does not automatically equate to curtailment and suppression of civil liberties and individual freedom. A state of martial law does not suspend the operation of the Constitution, including the Bill of Rights. The Constitution lays down safeguards to protect human rights during martial law. Civil courts are not supplanted. The suspension of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> applies only to persons judicially charged for rebellion or offenses inherent or directly connected with the invasion. Any person arrested or detained shall be judicially charged within three days. Various statutes also exist to protect human rights during martial law, such as, but not limited to, Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7483 on persons under custodial investigation, R.A. No. 9372 on persons detained for the crime of terrorism, and R.A. No. 9745 on the non-employment of physical or mental torture on an arrested individual.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>y) A temporary restraining order (TRO) or a writ of preliminary injunction to restrain the implementation or the extension of martial law is not provided in the Constitution. Although there are remedies anchored on equity, a TRO and an injunctive relief cannot override, prevent, or diminish an express power granted to the President by no less than the Constitution. If a TRO or injunctive writ were to be issued, it would constitute an amendment of the Charter tantamount to judicial legislation, as it would fashion a shortcut remedy other than the power of review established in the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br>z) Petitioners' allegations do not meet the standard proof required for the issuance of injunctive relief. Neither can the application for injunctive relief be supported by the claim that an injunction will foreclose further violations of human rights, as injunction is not designed to protect contingent or future rights. Petitioners also failed to show that the alleged human rights violations are directly attributable to the President's imposition of martial law and suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br><center><b>Ruling of the Court</b><br></center><br><b>Procedural Issues:<br><br><i>Failure to attach Resolution of Both Houses No. 4 is not fatal to the petitions.</i></b><br><br>Section 1,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> Rule 129 of the Rules of Court provides that a court can take judicial notice of the official acts of the legislative department without the introduction of evidence.<br><br>"Judicial notice is the cognizance of certain facts that judges may properly take and act on without proof because these facts are already known to them; it is the duty of the court to assume something as matters of fact without need of further evidentiary support."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br>Resolution of Both Houses No. 4 is an official act of Congress, thus, this Court can take judicial notice thereof.

As the Court explained in <i>Rubrico v.

Furthermore, it is important that he be freed from any form of harassment, hindrance or distraction to enable him to fully attend to the performance of his official duties and functions. Unlike the legislative and judicial branch, only one constitutes the executive branch and anything which impairs his usefulness in the discharge of the many great and important duties imposed upon him by the Constitution necessarily impairs the operation of the Government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br></blockquote>Accordingly, in <i>David</i>, the Court ruled that it was improper to implead former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo in the petitions assailing the constitutionality of Presidential Proclamation No. 1017, where she declared a state of national emergency, and General Order No. 5, where she called upon the AFP and the Philippine National Police (PNP) to prevent and suppress acts of terrorism and lawless violence in the country.<br><br>It is, thus, clear that petitioners in G.R. Nos. 236061 and 236145 committed a procedural misstep in including the President as a respondent in their petitions.<br><br><b><i>The Congress is an indispensable party to the consolidated petitions.</i></b><br><br>Of the four petitions before the Court, only G.R.

In <i>Marmo, et al. v.

Petitioners in G.R. No. 235935 and 236155 have also put in issue the manner in which the Congress deliberated upon the President's request for extension. Clearly, therefore, it is the Congress as a body, and not just its leadership, which has interest in the subject matter of these cases. Consequently, it was procedurally incorrect for petitioners in G.R. Nos. 235935, 236061 and 236155 to implead only the Senate President and the House Speaker among the respondents.<br><br>Arguably, Senator Aquilino Pimentel III and House Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez can be said to have an interest in these cases, as representatives of the Senate and the House of Representatives, respectively. However, considering that one of their main contentions is that the "supermajority" of the Congress gravely abused their discretion when they allegedly railroaded the adoption of Resolution of Both Houses No. 4, it stands to reason and the requirements of due process that petitioners in G.R. Nos. 235935 and 236061 should have impleaded the Congress as a whole.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> Needless to say, the entire body of Congress, and not merely the respective leaders of its two Houses, will be directly affected should We strike down the extension of martial law. Thus, We hold that in cases impugning the extension of martial law for lack of sufficient factual basis, the entire body of the Congress, composed of the Senate and the House of Representatives, must be impleaded, being an indispensable party thereto.<br><br>It is true that a party's failure to implead an indispensable party is not <i>per se</i> a ground for the dismissal of the action, as said party may be added, by order of the court on motion of the party or <i>motu propio</i>, at any stage of the action or at such times as are just. However, it remains essential - as it is jurisdictional - that an indispensable party be impleaded before judgment is rendered by the court, as the absence of such indispensable party renders all subsequent acts of the court null and void for want of authority to act, not only as to the absent parties but even as to those present.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> Joining indispensable parties into an action is mandatory, being a requirement of due process.

After consideration of the arguments of the parties, We ruled that under Section 18, Article VII of the 1987 Constitution, the Congress is only required to vote jointly to revoke the President's proclamation of martial law and/or suspension of the privilege of the <i>writ of habeas corpus</i>. We clarified that there is no constitutional requirement that Congress must conduct a joint session for the purpose of concurring with the President's declaration of martial law.<br><br>In <i>Lagman</i>, the constitutionality of Proclamation No. 216 was the primary issue raised before Us. We held that the Proclamation was constitutional as the President had sufficient factual basis in declaring martial law and suspending the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> in Mindanao. We found that based on the facts known to the President and the events that transpired before and at the time he issued the Proclamation, he had probable cause to believe that a rebellion was or is being committed, and reasonable basis to conclude that public safety was endangered by the widespread atrocities perpetrated by the rebel groups.<br><br>In contrast, the consolidated petitions at hand essentially assail the Congress' act of approving the President's December 8, 2017 request and extending the declaration of martial law in Mindanao from January 1 to December 31, 2018. In support of their case, petitioners argue that rebellion no longer persists in Mindanao and that public safety is not endangered by the existence of mere "remnants" of the Maute group, ASG, DAESH­-inspired DIWM members.<br><br>Although there are similarities in the arguments of petitioners in the earlier <i>Lagman</i> case and the petitions at bar, We do not find that petitioners are seeking to re-litigate a matter already settled in the <i>Lagman</i> case with respect to the existence of rebellion. A reading of the consolidated petitions reveals that petitioners do not contest the existence of violence committed by various armed groups in Mindanao, to wit:<br><blockquote><u>LAGMAN PETITION (G.R. No. 235935)</u><br><blockquote>43. It is very unfortunate that in their contrived efforts to justify the extension of martial law in Mindanao, President Duterte and his military and police advisers with the support of partisans in the Congress have molded the so-called remnants or residue, miniscule as they are, into apparent menacing ogres.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>53. A litany of alleged "skirmishes" does not necessarily constitute armed public uprising against the government.<br><br>54. They may only indicate banditry, lawless violence and terroristic acts of remnants or residure of vanquished combatants.<br></blockquote><u>CULLAMAT PETITION (G.R. No. 236061)</u><br><blockquote>58. The question now therefore is, the instant case, does the actual rebellion being perpetrated by the armed groups enumerated in the 08 December 2017 letter of President Duterte to the House of Representatives and the Senate, compromise public safety that would warrant the imposition of martial law?<br></blockquote><u>ROSALES PETITION (G.R. No. 236145)</u><br><blockquote>67. In short, the bases (for the extension of martial law in Mindanao) were: first, the supposed continuous rebuilding of the remaining members of the Daesh-inspired DIWM, who are "in all probability, ... presently regrouping and consolidating their forces" or are, at the very least, continuing their efforts and activities "geared towards the conduct of intensified atrocities and armed public uprisings"; <i>second</i>, the supposed "plan" by members of the Turaifie group to conduct bombings; <i>third</i>, the supposed continuing acts of violence of the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters; <i>fourth</i>, the continuous commission of acts of terrorism by members of the Abu Sayaff Group; and <u><i>fifth</i></u>, the intensification of the "decades-long rebellion" by the New People's Army (NPA).<br><br>68. With all due respect, and without diminishing the threat posed by any of the foregoing, none of these constitute <i>actual</i> rebellion or <i>actual</i> invasion. Moreover, it mistakes the distinction between the need for military force which is effected through the use of the calling out powers of the President, on one hand, and the need for imposing martial law on the civilian population, on the other.<br><br>69. Since the five (5) identified groups were/are in the "regrouping", "[consolidation] of forces", "recruitment", "planning" stages, or are continuing the commission of crimes (terrorism, robbery, murder, extortion) without any of the four (4) objectives that comprise the second element of rebellion, there cannot be said to be a "theater of war" already contemplated by the framers of the Constitution as would cripple the normal operation of civilian law.<br></blockquote><u>MONSOD PETITION (G.R. No. 236155)</u><br><blockquote>72. There is no indication that "public safety requires" the further imposition of martial law. The instances cited as justification for the extension requested do not demonstrate gravity such that ordinary powers and resources of the government cannot address these. What Marawi needs at this point is effective and responsive rehabilitation in an atmosphere of freedom and cooperation. It does not need martial law to rise from the ashes of war and turmoil.<br><br>73. At most, these incidents show several protracted incidents of violence and lawlessness that is well within the powers and authority of the government armed forces and police force to suppress without resort to extraordinary powers, which the government has been continuously doing for decades as well. Martial law is neither a commensurate measure to address these incidents, nor preventive measure to thwart the spread of lawless violence in the country. The mere invocation, therefore, of rebellion or invasion, will not be the sufficient factual basis for the declaration of martial law or the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> if it cannot be factually demonstrated that it is actually happening and necessitated by the requirements of public safety in a theater of war.<br></blockquote></blockquote>From the foregoing, it appears that petitioners merely question the gravity and extent of these occurrences as to necessitate the continued implementation of martial law in Mindanao. In other words, the issue put forth by petitioners in the earlier <i>Lagman</i> case, which this Court already settled, refers to the existence of a state of rebellion which would trigger the President's initial declaration of martial law, whereas the factual issue in the case at bar refers to the persistence of the same rebellion in Mindanao which would justify the extension of martial law.<br><br>That petitioners are not barred from questioning the alleged persistence of the rebellion in these consolidated petitions is also supported by the transitory nature of the Court's judgment on the sufficiency of the factual basis for a declaration of martial law. The following exchange during the deliberations of the 1986 Constitutional Commission is instructive:<br><blockquote>MR. BENGZON. I would like to ask for clarification from the Committee, and I would like to address this to Commissioner Bernas.<br><br>Suppose there is a variance of decision between the Supreme Court and Congress, whose decision shall prevail?<br><br>FR. BERNAS. The Supreme Court's decision prevails.<br><br>MR. BENGZON. If Congress, decides to recall before the Supreme Court issues its decision, does the case become moot?<br><br>FR. BERNAS. Yes, Madam President.<br><br>MR. BENGZON. And if the Supreme Court promulgates its decision ahead of Congress, Congress is foreclosed because the Supreme Court has 30 days within which to look into the factual basis. If the Supreme Court comes out with the decision one way or the other without Congress having acted on the matter, is Congress foreclosed?<br><br>FR. BERNAS. <b>The decision of the Supreme Court will be based on its assessment of the factual situation. Necessarily, therefore, the judgment of the Supreme Court on that is a transitory judgment because the factual situation can change.</b> So, while the decision of the Supreme Court may be valid at that certain point of time, the situation may change so that Congress should be authorized to do something about it.<br><br>MR. BENGZON. Does the Gentleman mean the decision of the Supreme Court then would just be something transitory?<br><br>FR. BERNAS. Precisely.<br><br>MR. BENGZON. It does not mean that if the Supreme Court revokes or decides against the declaration of martial law, <b>the Congress can no longer say, "no, we want martial law to continue" because the circumstances can change</b>.<br><br>FR. BERNAS. The Congress can still come in because the factual situation can change.<br></blockquote>Verily, the Court's review in martial law cases is largely dependent on the existing factual scenario used as basis for its imposition or extension. The gravity and scope of rebellion or invasion, as the case may be, should necessarily be re-examined, in order to make a justiciable determination on whether rebellion persists in Mindanao as to justify an extension of a state of martial law.<br><br><b><i>The Court's power to review the extension of martial law is limited solely to the determination of the sufficiency of the factual basis thereof.</i></b><br><br>Section 1, Article VIII of the Constitution pertains to the Court's judicial power to settle actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable, and to determine whether or not there has been grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government. The first part is to be known as the traditional concept of judicial power while the latter part, an innovation of the 1987 Constitution, became known as the court's expanded jurisdiction. Under its expanded jurisdiction, courts can now delve into acts of any branch or instrumentality of the Government traditionally considered as political if such act was tainted with grave abuse of discretion.<br><br>In seeking the Court's review of the extension of Proclamation No. 216 on the strength of the third paragraph of Section 18, Article VII of the Constitution, petitioners in G.R. No. 235935 alternately invoke the Court's expanded (<i>certiorari</i>) jurisdiction under Section 1, Article VIII.<br><br>In <i>Lagman</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> We emphasized that this Court's jurisdiction under the third paragraph of Section 18, Article VII is special and specific, different from those enumerated in Sections 1<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> and 5<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> of Article VIII. It was further stressed therein that the standard of review in a petition for <i>certiorari</i> is whether the respondent has committed any grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in the performance of his or her functions, whereas under Section 18, Article VII, the Court is tasked to review the sufficiency of the factual basis of the President's exercise of emergency powers. Hence, the Court concluded that a petition for <i>certiorari</i> pursuant to Section 1 or Section 5 of Article VIII is not the proper tool to review the sufficiency of the factual basis of the proclamation of martial law or the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>. We held that to apply the standard of review in a petition for <i>certiorari</i> will emasculate the Court's constitutional task under Section 18, Article VII, which was precisely meant to provide an additional safeguard against possible martial law abuse and limit the extent of the powers of the Commander-in-Chief.<br><br>With regard to the extension of the proclamation of martial law or the suspension of the privilege of the writ, the same special and specific jurisdiction is vested in the Court to review, in an appropriate proceeding filed by any citizen, the sufficiency of the factual basis thereof. Necessarily, and by parity of reasoning, a <i>certiorari</i> petition invoking the Court's expanded jurisdiction is not the proper remedy to review the sufficiency of the factual basis of the Congress' extension of the proclamation of martial law or suspension of the privilege of the writ.<br><br>Furthermore, as in the case of the Court's review of the President's proclamation of martial law or suspension of the privilege of the writ, the Court's judicial review of the Congress' extension of such proclamation or suspension is limited only to a determination of the sufficiency of the factual basis thereof. By its plain language, the Constitution provides such scope of review in the exercise of the Court's <i>sui generis</i> authority under Section 18, Article VII, which is principally aimed at balancing (or curtailing) the power vested by the Constitution in the Congress to determine whether to extend such proclamation or suspension.<br><br><center><b>Substantive Issues</b><br></center><br><b><i>Congressional check on the exercise of martial law and suspension powers</i></b><br><br>Under the 1935<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> and 1973<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> Constitutions, the Congress had no power to review or limit the Executive's exercise of the authority to declare martial law or to suspend the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>. Borne of the country's martial law experience under the Marcos regime, such power was subsequently established in the 1987 Constitution as part of a system of checks and balance designed to forestall any potential abuse of an extraordinary power lodged in the President as Commander-in-Chief of the country's armed forces.<br><br>The 1987 Constitution grants the Congress the power to shorten or extend the President's proclamation of martial law or suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>. Section 18, Article VII of the 1987 Constitution, in pertinent part, states:<br><blockquote>Section 18. The President shall be the Commander-in-Chief of all armed forces of the Philippines and whenever it becomes necessary, he may call out such armed forces to prevent or suppress lawless violence, invasion or rebellion. In case of invasion or rebellion, when the public safety requires it, he may, for a period not exceeding sixty days, suspend the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> or place the Philippines or any part thereof under martial law. Within forty-eight hours from the proclamation of martial law or the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>, the President shall submit a report in person or in writing to the Congress. <b>The Congress, voting jointly, by a vote of at least a majority of all its Members in regular or special session, may revoke such proclamation or suspension, which revocation shall not be set aside by the President.

(Emphasis ours)<br></blockquote>Congressional check on the President's martial law and suspension powers thus consists of:<br><blockquote><b>First.</b> The power to review the President's proclamation of martial law or suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>, and to revoke such proclamation or suspension. The review is "automatic in the sense that it may be activated by Congress itself at any time after the proclamation or suspension is made."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> The Congress' decision to revoke the proclamation or suspension cannot be set aside by the President.<br><br><b>Second.</b> The power to approve any extension of the proclamation or suspension, upon the President's initiative, for such period as it may determine, if the invasion or rebellion persists and public safety requires it.<br></blockquote><b><i>Joint executive and legislative act</i></b><br><br>When approved by the Congress, the extension of the proclamation or suspension, as described during the deliberations on the 1987 Constitution, becomes a "joint executive and legislative act" or a "collective judgment" between the President and the Congress:<br><blockquote>THE PRESIDENT.

Furthermore, deliberations on extending martial law certainly cannot be equated to the consideration of regular or ordinary legislation.

Such silence, however, should not be construed as a vacuum, flaw or deficiency in the provision. While it does not specify the number of times that the Congress is allowed to approve an extension of martial law or the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>, Section 18, Article VII is clear that the <u>only</u> limitations to the exercise of the congressional authority to extend such proclamation or suspension are that the extension should be upon the President's initiative; that it should be grounded on the persistence of the invasion or rebellion and the demands of public safety; and that it is subject to the Court's review of the sufficiency of its factual basis upon the petition of any citizen.<br><br>A cardinal rule in statutory construction is that when the law is clear and free from any doubt or ambiguity, there is no room for construction or interpretation, but only for application.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup> Thus, whenever there is a determination that the invasion or rebellion persists and public safety requires the extension of martial law or of the suspension of the privilege of the writ, the Congress may exercise its authority to grant such extension as may be requested by the President, even if it be subsequent to the initial extension.<br><br>Section 18, Article VII did not also fix the period of the extension of the proclamation and suspension. However, it clearly gave the Congress the authority to decide on its duration; thus, the provision states that that the extension shall be "<b><i>for a period to be determined by the Congress</i></b>." If it were the intention of the framers of the Constitution to limit the extension to sixty (60) days, as petitioners in G.R. No. 235935 theorize, they would not have expressly vested in the Congress the power to fix its duration.<br><br>The Court cannot accept said petitioners' argument that the 60-day limit can be deduced from the following clause in Section 18, Article VII: "<i>the Congress may, <b>in the same manner</b>, extend such proclamation or suspension</i>."

Yes, the amendment is accepted it makes the provision clearer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup> (Emphasis ours)<br></blockquote>United States Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, in his book entitled "<i>Reading the Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts</i>,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup> succinctly explained the dangers of construction that departs from the text of a statute, particularly as to the allocation of powers among the branches of government. He stated:<br><blockquote>Some judges, however, refuse to yield the ancient judicial prerogative of making the law, improvising on the text to produce what they deem socially desirable results-usually at the behest of an advocate for one party to a dispute. The judges are also prodded by interpretative theorists who avow that courts are "better able to discern and articulate basic national ideals than are the people's politically responsible representatives". On this view, judges are to improvise "basic national ideals of individual liberty and fair treatment, even when the content of these ideals is not expressed as a matter of positive law in the written Constitution."<br><br>To the extent that people give this view any credence, the notion that judges may (even should) improvise on constitutional and statutory text enfeebles the democratic polity. As Justice John Marshall Harlan warned in the 1960s, an invitation to judicial lawmaking results inevitably in "a <b>lessening, on the one hand, of judicial independence and, on the other, of legislative responsibility, thus polluting the bloodstream of our system of government</b>." Why these alarming outcomes? First, when judges fashion law rather than fairly derive it from governing texts, they subject themselves to intensified political pressures - in the appointment process, in their retention, and in the arguments made to them. Second, every time a court constitutionalizes a new sliver of law - as by finding a "new constitutional right" to do this, that, or the other - that sliver becomes thenceforth untouchable by the political branches. In the American system, a legislature has no power to abridge a right that has been authoritatively held to be part of the Constitution - even if that newfound right does not appear in the text. Over the past 50 years especially, we have seen the judiciary incrementally take control of larger and larger swaths of territory that ought to be settled legislatively.<br><br>It used to be said that judges do not "make" law - they simply apply it. In the 20th century, the legal realists convinced everyone that judges do indeed make law. To the extent that this was true, it was knowledge that the wise already possessed and the foolish could not be trusted with. It was true, that is, that judges did not really "find" the common law but invented it over time. Yet this notion has been stretched into a belief that judges "make" law through judicial interpretation of democratically enacted statutes. Consider the following statement by John P. Dawson, intended to apply to statutory law:<br><blockquote>It seems to us inescapable that judges should have a part in creating law creating it as they apply it. In deciding the multifarious disputes that are brought before them, we believe that judges in any legal system invariably adapt legal doctrines to new situations and thus give them new content.<br></blockquote>Now it is true that in a system such as ours, in which judicial decisions have a <i>stare decisis</i> effect, a court's application of a statute to a "new situation" can be said to establish the law applicable to that situation that is, to pronounce definitively whether and how the statute applies to that situation. But establishing this retail application of the statute is probably not what Dawson meant by "creating law," "adapting legal doctrines," and "giving them new content." Yet beyond that retail application, good judges dealing with statutes do not make law. They do not "give new content" to the statute, but merely apply the content that has been there all along, awaiting application to myriad factual scenarios. To say that they "make law" without this necessary qualification is to invite the taffy-like stretching of words - or the ignoring of words altogether. (Emphasis ours)<br></blockquote>Even on the assumption that there is a gap in our Constitution anent the frequency and period of the Congress' extension, and there is a need for this Court to exercise its power to interpret the law, We undertake the same in such a way as to reflect the will of the drafters of the Constitution. "While We may not read <i>into</i> the law a purpose that is not there, We nevertheless have the right to read <i>out of it</i> the reason for its enactment."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup> We refer thus to the Constitutional Commission's deliberations on the matter, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>MR. SUAREZ. Thank you, Madam President. I concur with the proposal of Commissioner Azcuna but <b>may I suggest that we fix a period for the duration of the extension</b>, because it could very well happen that the initial period may be shorter than the extended period and it could extend indefinitely. <b>So if Commissioner Azcuna could put a certain limit to the extended period</b>, I would certainly appreciate that, Madam President.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>MR. SUAREZ. Thank you Madam President. <b>May we suggest that on line 7, between the words "same" and "if", we insert the phrase FOR A PERIOD OF NOT MORE THAN SIXTY DAYS, which would equal the initial period for the first declaration</b> just so it will keep going.<br><br>THE PRESIDENT. What does the Committee say?<br><br>MR. REGALADO. May we request a clarification from Commissioner Suarez on this proposed amendment? This extension is already a joint act upon the initiative of the President and with the concurrence of the Congress. It is assumed that they have already agreed not only on the fact of extension but on the period of extension. <b>If we put It at 60 days only, then thereafter, they have to meet again to agree jointly on a further extension.</b><br><br>MR. SUAREZ. That is precisely intended to safeguard the interests and protect the lives of citizens.<br><br>MR. REGALADO. In the first situation where the President declares martial law, there had to be a prescribed period because there was no initial concurrence requirement. And if there was no concurrence, the martial law period ends at 60 days. Thereafter, if they intend to extend the same suspension of the privilege of the writ or the proclamation of martial law, it is upon the initiative of the President this time, and with the prior concurrence of Congress. <b>So, the period of extension has already been taken into account by both the Executive and the Legislative, unlike the first situation where the President acted alone without prior concurrence. The reason for the limitation in the first does not apply to the extension.</b><br><br>MR. SUAREZ. We are afraid of a situation that may develop where the extended period would be even longer than the initial period, Madam President. It is only reasonable to suggest that we have to put a restriction on the matter of the exercise of this right within a reasonable period.<br><br>MR. REGALADO. Madam President, following that is the clause "extend the same if the invasion or rebellion shall persist and public safety requires it." That by itself suggests a period within which the suspension shall be extended, if the invasion is still going on. But there is already the cut-off 60-day period. Do they have to meet all over again and agree to extend the same?<br><br>MR. SUAREZ. That is correct. I think the two of them must have to agree on the period; but it is theoretically possible that when the President writes a note to the Congress, because it would be at the instance of the President that the extension would have to be granted by Congress, it is possible that the period for the extension may be there. It is also possible that it may not be there. That is the reason why we want to make it clear that there must by a reasonable period for the extension. So, if my suggestion is not acceptable to the Committee, may I request that a voting be held on it Madam President.<br><br>FR. BERNAS. Madam President, may I just propose something because I see the problem. Suppose we were to say: <b>"or extend the same FOR A PERIOD TO BE DETERMINED BY CONGRESS" - that gives Congress a little flexibility on just how long the extension should be</b>.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>THE PRESIDENT. Is that accepted by Commissioner Suarez? <br><br>MR. SUAREZ. Yes, Madam President.<br><br>MR. OPLE. May I just pose a question to the Committee in connection with the Suarez amendment? Earlier Commissioner Regalado said that that point was going to be a collective judgment between the President and the Congress. Are we departing from that now in favor of giving Congress the plenipotentiary power to determine the period?<br><br>FR. BERNAS. Not really, Madam President, because Congress would be doing this in consultation with the President, and the President would be outvoted by 300 Members.<br><br>MR. OPLE. Yes, but still the idea is to preserve the principle of collective judgment of that point upon the expiration of the 60 days when, upon his own initiative, the President seeks for an extension of the proclamation of martial law or the suspension of the privilege of the writ.<br><br>FR. BERNAS. Yes, the participation of the President, is that when we put all of these encumbrances on the President and Commander-in­-Chief during an actual invasion and rebellion, given an intractable Congress that may be dominated by opposition parties, we may be actually impelling the President to use the sword of Alexander to cut the Gordian knot by just declaring a revolutionary government that sets him free to deal with the invasion or the insurrection. That is the reason I am in favor of the present formulation. However, if Commissioner Suarez insists on his amendment, I do not think I will stand in the way.<br><br>Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>MR. SUAREZ. We will accept the committee suggestion, subject to style later on.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>MR. PADILLA. According to Commissioner Concepcion, our former Chief Justice, the declaration of martial law or the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> is essentially an executive act. If that be so, and especially under the following clause: "if the invasion or rebellion shall persist and public safety requires it," I do not see why the period must be determined by the Congress. We are turning a purely executive act to a legislative act.<br><br>FR. BERNAS. I would believe what the former Chief Justice said about the initiation being essentially an executive act, but what follows after the initiation is something that is participated in by Congress.<br><br>MR. CONCEPCION. If I may add a word. The one who will do the fighting is the executive but, of course, it is expected that if the Congress wants to extend, it will extend for the duration of the fighting. If the fighting goes on, I do not think it is fair to assume that the Congress will refuse to extend the period, especially since in this matter the Congress must act at the instance of the executive. He is the one who is supposed to know how long it will take him to fight. <b>Congress may reduce it, but that is without prejudice to his asking for another extension, if necessary.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> (Emphasis ours)<br></blockquote>Commissioner Jose E. Suarez's proposal to limit the extension to 60 days was not adopted by the majority of the Commission's members. The framers evidently gave enough flexibility on the part of the Congress to determine the duration of the extension. Plain textual reading of Section 18, Article VII and the records of the deliberation of the Constitutional Commission buttress the view that as regards the frequency and duration of the extension, the determinative factor is as long as "the invasion or rebellion persists and public safety requires" such extension.<br><br><b><i>The President and the Congress had sufficient factual basis to extend Proclamation No. 216</i></b><br><br>Section 18, Article VII of the 1987 Constitution requires two factual bases for the extension of the proclamation of martial law or of the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>: (a) the invasion or rebellion persists; and (b) public safety requires the extension.<br><br><b><i>A.

The Court held:<br><blockquote>A review of the aforesaid facts similarly leads the Court to conclude that the President, in issuing Proclamation No. 216, had sufficient factual bases tending to show that actual rebellion exists. The President's conclusion, that there was an armed public uprising, the culpable purpose of which was the removal from the allegiance of the Philippine Government a portion of its territory and the deprivation of the President from performing his powers and prerogatives, was reached after a tactical consideration of the facts. In fine, the President satisfactorily discharged his burden of proof.<br><br>After all, what the President needs to satisfy is only the standard of probable cause for a valid declaration of martial law and suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>. x x x<br></blockquote>On July 22, 2017, upon the President's initiative, Congress extended Proclamation No. 216 until December 31, 2017.<br><br>The ensuing question, therefore, is whether the rebellion persists as to satisfy the first condition for the extension of martial law or of the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>.<br><br>The word "persist" means "to continue to exist," "to go on resolutely or stubbornly in spite of opposition, importunity or warning," or to "carry on."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup> It is the opposite of the words "cease," "discontinue," "end," "expire," "finish," "quit," "stop" and "terminate."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup><br><br>The reasons cited by the President in his request for further extension indicate that the rebellion, which caused him to issue Proclamation No. 216, continues to exist and its "remnants" have been resolute in establishing a DAESH/ISIS territory in Mindanao, carrying on through the recruitment and training of new members, financial and logistical build-up, consolidation of forces and continued attacks. Thus, in his December 8, 2017 letter to Congress, the President stated:<br><blockquote>First, despite the death of Hapilon and the Maute brothers, the remnants of their Groups have continued to rebuild their organization through the recruitment and training of new members and fighters to carry on the rebellion.

These newly recruited personalities were motivated by clannish culture as they are relatives of terrorist personalities; revenge for their killed relatives/parents during the Marawi operations; financial gain as new recruits were given an amount ranging from <u><b>PhP15,000.00</b></u> to <u><b>50,000.00</b></u>; and, as radicalized converts.<br><br>These newly recruited members are undergoing trainings in tactics, marksmanships and bombing operations at the different areas of Mount Cararao Complex, Butig, and Piagapo all of Lanao Del Sur. Recruits with high potentials [sic] were given instruction on IED-making and urban operations.<br><br>Furthermore, the situation has become complicated with the influx of Foreign Terrorist Fighters (FTFs), capitalizing on the porous maritime boundaries in Southern Philippines, in the guise as tourists and business men. As of this period, <u><b>48</b></u> FTFs were monitored joining the Daesh-­inspired groups, particularly the Maute Group in Lanao and Turaifie Group in Central Mindanao. The closeness of these two groups is predominant with <b>@Abu DAR</b> who has historically established link with <b>Turaifie</b>.<br><br>On Dawlah Islamiyah-initiated violent incidents, these have increased to <b>100%</b> for the 2nd Semester.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup> (Emphasis ours)<br></blockquote>The AFP's data also showed that Foreign Terrorist Fighters (FTFs) are now acting as instructors to the new members of the Dawlah Islamiyah.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup><br><br>These accounts ineluctably show that the rebellion that spawned the Marawi crisis persists, and that its remaining members have regrouped, substantially increased in number, and are no less determined to turn Mindanao into a DAESH/ISIS territory.<br><br>Petitioners in G.R. No. 235935 argue that "remnants" or a residue of a rebel group cannot possibly mount a rebellion. The argument, however, fails to take into account the 185 persons identified in the Martial Law Arrest Orders who are still at large; the 400 new members whom said remnants were able to recruit; the influx of 48 FTFs who are training the new recruits in their ways of terrorism; and the financial and logistical build-up which the group is currently undertaking with their sympathizers and protectors. It likewise fails to consider that the new Dawlah Islamiyah members number nearly the same as the group that initially stormed Marawi City, and while the government succeeded in vanquishing 1,010 rebels following the siege,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[124]</sup> it took several months to accomplish this even under martial law. Thus, it will be imprudent nay reckless to downplay or dismiss the capacity of said remnants to relentlessly pursue their objective of establishing a seat of DAESH/ISIS power in Mindanao.<br><br>Petitioners in G.R. Nos. 236061 and 236155 have asserted that the rebellion no longer persists as the President himself had announced the liberation of Marawi City, and armed combat has ceased therein. Petitioners in G.R. No. 236061 added that Col. Romeo Brawner, Deputy Commander of the Joint Task Force Ranao, was also quoted as saying that the Maute-ISIS problem was about to be over. The statements, however, were admittedly made on October 17, 2017,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[125]</sup> nearly two months before the President's request for extension in December 2017. Such declaration does not preclude the occurrence of supervening events as the AFP discovered through their monitoring<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[126]</sup> efforts. It is not inconceivable that remnants of the Dawlah Islamiyah would indeed regroup, recruit new members and build up its arsenal during the intervening period. The termination of a rebellion is a matter of fact. Rebellion does not cease to exist by estoppel on account of the President's or the AFP's previous pronouncements. Furthermore, it is settled that rebellion is in the nature of a continuing crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[127]</sup> Thus, members of the Dawlah Islamiyah who evaded capture did not cease to be rebels.<br><br>So also, it does not necessarily follow that with the liberation of Marawi, the DAESH/ISIS-inspired rebellion no longer exists. Secretary Lorenzana, during the Congress' Joint Session on December 13, 2017, explained that while the situation in Marawi has substantially changed, the rebellion has not ceased but simply moved to other places in Mindanao, thus:<br><blockquote><b>Senator Drilon.</b> Meaning, the question that we raised, Mr. President, are the declarations of the President, His Excellency, and the secretary of national defense changed since the time that the situation was described on October 23 of this year? Has the situation changed or is it the same situation today that the Marawi City has been liberated from terrorists [sic] influence that there has been a termination of combat operations in Marawi City?<br><br><b>Hon. Lorenzana.</b> May I answer that, Mr. President. Mr. President, the situation in Marawi has substantially changed from the time that our troops were fighting the ISIS-inspired Maute Group and that's the reason why there is now this post-conflict need assessment as being conducted in Marawi. However, as situations developed later on, the ISIS-inspired other groups in Mindanao are also active like the BIFF in Central Mindanao and also in some other parts of the BaSulTa islands.<br><br>Now, the reports now, Mr. President, is that they are <b>actively recruiting again</b>, recruiting actively, recruiting some of the Muslim youths in the area and that is what we are saying that <b>the rebellion has not stopped. It just moved to another place</b>.<br><br>x x x x<br><br><b>Representative Tinio.</b> x x x<br><br>Mr. Speaker, <i>hindi po ba sinabi ni Presidente sa kanyang sulat</i> that the AFP has achieved remarkable progress in putting the rebellion under control at <i>hindi po ba sinabi ni</i> Executive Secretary na substantially neutralized <i>na raw and</i> Maute-Daesh? <i>Pwede po bang ipaliwanag ito ng mga</i> resource persons?<br><br><b>The Speaker.</b> The panel may respond.<br><br><b>Hon. Lorenzana.</b> Mr. President, <b>ang sagot po doon sa G.</b> Congressman <i>ay ganito - ang sinasabi po naming</i> substantially reduced <i>na iyong</i> strength or clear na <i>iyong</i> Marawi of any terrorists ay <b><i>Marawi lang po iyon</i></b>. <b>It does not include the whole of, the other parts of Mindanao that are also subject to the influence of these terroristic groups.</b> <i>Sabi nga ng</i> Supreme Court <i>ay, ang nangyayari sa Marawi ay nag-spill over na rin sa ibang Iugar doon sa Mindanao kaya nga sinustain nila iyong</i> declaration <i>ng</i> Martial Law.<br><br>x x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[128]</sup> (Emphasis ours)<br></blockquote>In <i>Lagman</i>, We recognized that "rebellion is not confined within predetermined bounds," and "for the crime of rebellion to be consummated, it is not required that all armed participants should congregate in <i>one</i> place x x x and publicly rise in arms against the government for the attainment of their culpable purpose." We held that the grounds on which the armed public uprising actually took place should not be the measure of the extent, scope or range of the actual rebellion when there are other rebels positioned elsewhere, whose participation did not necessarily involve the publicity aspect of rebellion, as they may also be considered as engaged in the crime of rebellion.<br><br>In a similar vein, the termination of armed combat in Marawi does not conclusively indicate that the rebellion has ceased to exist. It will be a tenuous proposition to confine rebellion simply to a resounding clash of arms with government forces. As noted in <i>Aquino, Jr. v. Enrile</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[129]</sup> modern day rebellion has other facets than just the taking up of arms, including financing, recruitment and propaganda, that may not necessarily be found or occurring in the place of the armed conflict, thus:<br><blockquote>x x x The argument that while armed hostilities go on in several provinces in Mindanao there are none in other regions except in isolated pockets in Luzon, and that therefore there is no need to maintain martial law all over the country, ignores the sophisticated nature and ramifications of rebellion in a modem setting. It does not consist simply of armed clashes between organized and identifiable groups on fields of their own choosing. It includes subversion of the most subtle kind, necessarily clandestine and operating precisely where there is no actual fighting. Underground propaganda, through printed news sheets or rumors disseminated in whispers; recruitment of armed and ideological adherents, raising of funds, procurement of arms and material, fifth-column activities including sabotage and intelligence-all these are part of the rebellion which by their nature are usually conducted far from the battle fronts. x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[130]</sup><br></blockquote>Furthermore, as We explained in <i>Lagman</i>, "(t)he crime of rebellion consists of many acts. It is a vast movement of men and a complex net of intrigues and plots." Thus:<br><blockquote>Acts committed in furtherance of rebellion[,] though crimes in themselves[,] are deemed absorbed in one single crime of rebellion. Rebellion <i>absorbs</i> "other acts committed in its pursuance." Direct assault, murder, homicide, arson, robbery, kidnapping just to name a few, are absorbed in the crime of rebellion if committed in furtherance of rebellion; "[i]t cannot be made a basis of a separate charge." Jurisprudence also teaches that not only common crimes may be absorbed in rebellion but also "offenses under special laws [such as Presidential Decree No. 1829] which are perpetrated in furtherance of the political offense". "All crimes, whether punishable under a special law or general law, which arc mere components or ingredients, or committed in furtherance thereof, become absorbed in the crime of rebellion and cannot be isolated and charged as separate crimes in themselves." (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>In any case, Secretary Lorenzana has stressed that notwithstanding the termination of armed combat in Marawi, clashes between the rebels and government forces continue to take place in other parts of Mindanao. Thus, during an interpellation at the December 13, 2017 Joint Session in Congress, he stated:<br><blockquote><b>Senator Pangilinan.</b> x x x<br><br>It would have been a very different situation altogether if the fighting was still ongoing. If there is still that siege, then we can see that the situation is extreme and therefore, we can proceed with an extension.<br><br>x x x x<br><br><b>Hon. Lorenzana.</b> Mr. President, may I reply to the good senator.<br><br><b>Sir, maybe your perception here is not as bad as what is happening on the ground, but the troops report otherwise.</b><br><br><b>You know, <i>wala na sigurong bakbakan diyan sa</i> Marawi, but there are still clashes almost everyday in other parts of Mindanao.</b> The clash with the BJFF in Central Mindanao continues almost everyday. <i>Iyong mga engkwentro din sa mga ibang lugar sa</i> Eastern Mindanao with the CPP-NPA <i>ay nandoon pa rin</i>. Basilan, Jolo <i>ay ongoing pa rin iyan</i>.<br><br>x x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[131]</sup> (Emphasis ours)<br></blockquote>During the oral arguments, AFP General Guerrero also confirmed that there were actually armed encounters with the remnants of the DAESH/ISIS­-inspired DIWM.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[132]</sup><br><br>Accordingly, it would be error to conclude that the rebellion ceased to exist upon the termination of hostilities in Marawi.<br><br><b><i>Other rebel groups</i></b><br><br>The extension has also been challenged on the ground that it did not refer to the same rebellion under Proclamation No. 216.<br><br>It is true that the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF), the Turaifie Group and the New People's Army (NPA) were not expressly mentioned either in Proclamation No. 216 or in the President's Report to Congress after he issued the Proclamation. However, in <i>Lagman</i>, the government clearly identified the BIFF, based in the Liguasan Marsh, Maguindanao, as one of the four ISIS-linked rebel groups that had formed an alliance for the unified mission of establishing an ISIS territory in Mindanao, led by ASG-Basilan leader, Isnilon Hapilon, who had been appointed emir of all ISIS forces in the Philippines. The other three rebel groups were the ASG from Basilan, Ansarul Khilafah Philippines (AKP), also known as the Maguid Group, from Saranggani and Sultan Kudarat, and the Maute Group from Lanao del Sur.<br><br>Furthermore, while it named only the Maute Group and the ASG, the President's Report made express reference to "lawless armed groups" as perpetrators of the Marawi siege resolved to unseat the duly-constituted government and make Mindanao a DAESH/ISIS province. The Report also indicated, as additional reasons for the Proclamation, the "extensive networks or linkages of the Maute Group with foreign and local armed groups" and the "network and alliance-building activities among terrorist groups, local criminals, and lawless armed men" in Mindanao.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[133]</sup> Thus, though not specifically identified in the Proclamation or the President's Report, the BIFF and the Turaifie Group are deemed to have been similarly alluded to.<br><br>Indeed, absolute precision cannot be expected from the President who would have to act quickly given the urgency of the situation. Under the circumstances, the actual rebellion and attack, more than the exact identity of all its perpetrators, would be his utmost concern. The following pronouncement in <i>Lagman</i>, thus, finds relevance:<br><blockquote>Neither should the Court expect absolute correctness of the facts stated in the proclamation and in the written Report as the President could not be expected to verify the accuracy and veracity of all facts reported to him due to the urgency of the situation. To require precision in the President's appreciation of facts would unduly burden him and therefore impede the process of his decision-making. Such a requirement will practically necessitate the President to be on the ground to confirm the correctness of the reports submitted to him within a period that only the circumstances obtaining would be able to dictate. Such a scenario, of course, would not only place the President in peril but would also defeat the very purpose of the grant of emergency powers upon him, that is, to borrow the words of Justice Antonio T. Carpio in <i>Fortun</i>, to "immediately put an end to the root cause of the emergency". Possibly, by the time the President is satisfied with the correctness of the facts in his possession, it would be too late in the day as the invasion or rebellion could have already escalated to a level that is hard, if not impossible, to curtail.<br></blockquote>In the same vein, to require the President to render a meticulous and comprehensive account in his Proclamation or Report will be most tedious and will unduly encumber his efforts to immediately quell the rebellion.<br><br>The efforts of the Turaifie Group and its allies<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[134]</sup> in the ISIS-inspired<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[135]</sup> BIFF to wrest control of Mindanao continued even as the government was able to put the Marawi crisis under control.<br><br>In his December 8, 2017 letter to the Congress, the President stated:<br><blockquote>Second, the Turaifie Group has likewise been monitored to be planning to conduct bombings, notably targeting the Cotabato area. Turaitie is said to be Hapilon's potential successor as Amir of DAESH Wilayat in the Philippines and the Southeast Asia.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[136]</sup><br></blockquote>Furthermore, as the AFP reported during the oral arguments, the BIFF "continues to inflict violence and sow terror in central Mindanao," and as one of the AFP's primary targets for disbandment, "the group will likely continue its hostile operations in a bid to retaliate, fight for its relevance and demonstrate its resiliency."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[137]</sup><br><br>The AFP has likewise confirmed that the Turaifie Group is one of several terrorist groups responsible for the Marawi siege, and that it has so far successfully recruited 70 new members in its unwavering pursuit of a DAESH/ISIS <i>wilayat</i> in Mindanao.<br><br>The Court, thus, finds that the government has sufficiently established the persistence of the DAESH/ISIS rebellion.<br><br>The inclusion of the rebellion of the New People's Army (NPA) as basis for the further extension of martial law in Mindanao will not render it void. Undeniably, the NPA aims to establish communist rule in the country while the DAESH/ISIS-inspired rebels intend to make Mindanao the seat of ISIS power in Southeast Asia. It is obvious, however, that even as they differ in ideology, they have the shared purpose of overthrowing the duly constituted government. The violence the NPA has continued to commit in Mindanao, as revealed by the Executive, hardly distinguish its rebels from the architects of the Marawi siege. Both have needlessly and violently caused the death of military forces and civilians, and the destruction of public and private property alike. Thus, in his request for the further extension of Proclamation No 216, the President informed the Congress that:<br><blockquote>Last, but certainly not the least, while the government was preoccupied with addressing the challenges posed by the DAESH-inspired DIWM and other Local Terrorist Groups (LTGs), the New People's Army (NPA) took advantage of the situation and intensified their decades-long rebellion against the government and stepped up terrorist attacks against innocent civilians and private entities, as well as guerilla warfare against the security sector and public government infrastructure, <b>purposely to seize political power through violent means and supplant the country's democratic form of government with Communist rule</b>.<br><br>This year, the NPA has perpetrated a total of at least three hundred eight-five (385) atrocities (both terrorism and guerilla warfare) in Mindanao, which resulted in forty-one (41) Killed-in-Action and sixty-two (62) Wounded-in-Action (WIA) on the part of government forces. On the part of the civilians, these atrocities resulted in the killing of twenty-three (23) and the wounding of six (6) persons. The most recent was the ambush in Talakag, Bukidnon on 09 November 2017, resulting in the killing of one (1) PNP personnel and the wounding of three (3) others, as well as the killing of a four (4)-month-old infant and the wounding of two (2) civilians.<br><br>Apart from these, at least fifty-nine (59) arson incidents have been carried out by the NPA in Mindanao this year, targeting businesses and private establishments and destroying an estimated P2.2 billion-worth of properties. Of these, the most significant were the attack on Lapanday Food Corporation in Davao City on 09 April 2017 and the burning of facilities and equipment of Mil-Oro Mining and Frasec Ventures Corporation in Mati City, Davao Oriental on 06 May 2017, which resulted in the destruction of properties valued at P1.85 billion and P109 million, respectively.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[138]</sup> (Emphasis ours)<br></blockquote>Given the scale of the attacks perpetrated by the communist rebels, it is far from unreasonable for the President to include their rebellion in his request for the further extension of martial law in Mindanao. The NPA's "intensified" insurgence clearly bears a significant impact on the security of Mindanao and the safety of its people, which were the very reasons for the martial law proclamation and its initial extension.<br><br>It will also be noted that when Proclamation No. 216 was issued, the Government and the NPA were undergoing peace negotiations. Thus, the President could not have included the NPA's rebellion in the Proclamation even granting he had cause to do so. The Office of the Solicitor General declared during the oral arguments that because of the peace negotiations, the NPA was "not explicitly included" as a matter of comity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[139]</sup> The Executive's data showed that despite the peace talks, the NPA continued its hostilities and intensified its tactical offensives, prompting the President to terminate the peace negotiations on November 23, 2017. In his December 8, 2017 letter to Congress, the President wrote:<br><blockquote>As a direct result of these atrocities on the part of the NPA, I was constrained to issue Proclamation No. 360 on 23 November 2017 declaring the termination of peace negotiations with the National Democratic Front-­Communist Party of the Philippines-New People's Army (NDF-CPP-NPA) effective immediately. I followed this up with Proclamation No. 374 on 05 December 2017, where I declared the CPP-NPA as a designated/identified terrorist organization under the Terrorism Financing Prevention and Suppression Act of 2012, and the issuance of a directive to the Secretary of Justice to file a petition in the appropriate court praying to proscribe the NDF-CPP-NPA as a terrorist organization under the Human Security Act of 2007.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[140]</sup><br></blockquote>It is readily apparent that the inclusion of the NPA's rebellion in the President's request for extension was precipitated by these turn of events, as well as the magnitude of the atrocities attributed to the communist rebels. It would make no sense to exclude or separate the communist rebellion from the continued operation of martial law in Mindanao when it also persists in the same region. Thus, the Court finds that the President's decision to add the NPA's "intensified" insurgence to the DAESH/ISIS rebellion, as further basis to request for the extension, was not uncalled for.<br><br>In any event, seeking the concurrence of the Congress to use martial law to quell the NPA's rebellion, instead of issuing a new martial law proclamation for the same purpose, appears to be more in keeping with the Constitution's aim of preventing the concentration of the martial law power in the President. The extension granted by the Congress upon the President's request has become a joint action or a "collective judgment"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[141]</sup> between the Executive and the Legislature, thereby satisfying one of the fundamental safeguards&nbsp; established under Section 18, Article VII of the 1987 Constitution.<br><br><b><i>B. Public safety requires the extension</i></b><br><br>In <i>Lagman</i>, the Court defined "public safety" as follows:<br><blockquote>Public safety, which is another component element for the declaration of martial law, "involves the prevention of and protection from events that could endanger the safety of the general public <b>from significant danger, injury/harm, or damage, such as crimes or disasters</b>." Public safety is an abstract term; it does not take any physical form. Plainly, its range, extent or scope could not be physically measured by metes and bounds. (Emphasis ours)<br></blockquote>The question, therefore, is whether the acts, circumstances and events upon which the extension was based posed a significant danger, injury or harm to the general public. The Court answers in the affirmative.<br><br>The following events and circumstances, as disclosed by the President, the Defense Secretary and the AFP, strongly indicate that the continued implementation of martial law in Mindanao is necessary to protect public safety:<br><br>(a) No less than 185 persons in the Martial Law Arrest Orders have remained at large.

It warned that the Dawlah Islamiyah will attempt to replicate the Marawi siege in other cities of Mindanao and may conduct terrorist attacks in Metro Manila and Davao City as the seat of power of the Philippine Government. With the spotlight on terrorism shifting from the Middle East to Southeast Asia following the Marawi siege, the AFP likewise indicated that the influx of FTFs in the Southern Philippines will persist.

The Court, thus, holds that there exists sufficient factual basis for the further extension sought by the President and approved by the Congress in its Resolution of Both Houses No. 4.<br><br>Necessarily, We do not see the merit to the petitioners' theory in the Cullamat petition that the extent of threat to public safety as would justify the declaration or extension of the proclamation of martial law and the suspension of the privilege of the writ must be of such level that the government cannot sufficiently govern, nor assure public safety or deliver government services. Petitioners posit that only in this scenario may martial law be constitutionally permissible.<br><br>Restrained caution must be exercised in adopting petitioners' theory for several reasons. To begin with, a hasty adoption of the suggested scale, level or extent of threat to public safety is to supplant into the plain text of the Constitution. An interpretation of the Constitution precedes from the fundamental postulate that the Constitution is the basic and paramount law to which all other laws must conform and to which all persons, including the highest officials of the land, must defer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[177]</sup> The consequent duty of the judiciary then is to determine conflicting claims of authority under the Constitution and to establish for the parties in an actual controversy the rights which that instrument secures and guarantees to them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[178]</sup> This must be so considering that the Constitution is the mother of all laws, sufficient and complete in itself. For the Court to categorically pronounce which kind of threat to public safety justifies the declaration or extension of martial law and which ones do not, is to improvise on the text of the Constitution ideals even when these ideals are not expressed as a matter of positive law in the written Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[179]</sup> Such judicial improvisation finds no justification.<br><br>For another, if the Court were to be successful in disposing of its bounden duty to allocate constitutional boundaries, the Constitutional doctrines the Court produces must necessarily remain steadfast no matter what may be the tides of time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[180]</sup> The adoption of the extreme scenario as the measure of threat to public safety as suggested by petitioners is to invite doubt as to whether the proclamation of martial law would be at all effective in such case considering that enemies of the State raise unconventional methods which change over time. It may happen that by the time government loses all capability to dispose of its functions, the enemies of the government might have already been successful in removing allegiance therefrom. Any declaration then of martial law would be of no useful purpose and such could not be the intent of the Constitution. Instead, the requirement of public safety as it presently appears in the Constitution admits of flexibility and discretion on the part of the Congress.<br><br>So too, when the President and the Congress ascertain whether public safety requires the declaration and extension of martial law, respectively, they do so by calibrating not only the present state of public safety but the further repercussions of the actual rebellion to public safety in the future as well. Thus, as persuasively submitted by Fr. Bernas in his <i>Amicus Curiae Brief</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[181]</sup> in <i>Fortun v. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[182]</sup><br><blockquote>From all these it is submitted that the focus on public safety adds a nuance to the meaning of rebellion in the Constitution which is not found in the meaning of the same word m Article 134 of the Penal Code. The concern of the Penal Code, after all, is to punish acts of the past. <b>But the concern of the Constitution is to counter threat to public safety both in the present and in the future arising from present and past acts.</b> Such nuance, it is submitted, gives to the President a degree of flexibility for determining whether rebellion constitutionally exists as basis for martial law even if facts cannot obviously satisfy the requirements of the Penal Code whose concern is about past acts. To require that the President must first convince herself that there can be proof beyond reasonable doubt of the existence of rebellion as defined in the Penal Code and jurisprudence can severely restrict the President's capacity to safeguard public safety for the present and the future and can defeat the purpose of the Constitution. (Emphasis ours)<br></blockquote>The requirement of the Constitution is therefore adequately met when there is sufficient factual basis to hold that the present and past acts constituting the actual rebellion are of such character that endanger and will endanger public safety. This permissive approach is sanctioned not only by an acknowledgment that the Congress is and should be allowed flexibility but also because the Court is without the luxury of time to determine accuracy and precision.<br><br><b><i>No necessity to impose tests on the choice and manner of the President's exercise of military powers</i></b><br><br>We refuse to be tempted by petitioner Rosales' prodding that We set two tests in reviewing the constitutionality of a declaration or extension of martial law. In her memorandum,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[183]</sup> she clarifies the two tests, as follows:<br><blockquote>1. Proportionality Test requires that a situation is of such gravity or scale as to demand resort to the most extreme of measures, <i>i.e.</i> a situation where the ordinary police powers of the State are no longer sufficient to restore, secure or preserve public safety; and<br><br>2. Suitability Test requires that a situation is such that the declaration of martial law is the correct tool to address safety problem.<br></blockquote>It is sufficient to state that this Court already addressed the same argument in Our decision in <i>Lagman</i>. The determination of which among the Constitutionally given military powers should be exercised in a given set of factual circumstances is a prerogative of the President. The Court's power of review, as provided under Section 18, Article VII do not empower the Court to advise, nor dictate its own judgment upon the President, as to which and how these military powers should be exercised.<br><br><b><i>Safeguards against abuse</i></b><br><br>Martial law is a law of necessity. "Necessity creates the conditions for martial law and at the same time limits the scope of martial law."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[184]</sup> Thus, when the need for which Proclamation No. 216 was further extended no longer exists, the President can lift the martial law imposition even before the end of the one-year period. Under the same circumstances, the Congress itself may pass a resolution pre-terminating the extension. This power emanates from the Congress' authority, granted under the Constitution, to approve the extension and to fix its duration. The power to determine the period of the extension necessarily includes the power to shorten it. Furthermore, considering that this Court's judgment on the constitutionality of an extension is "transitory," or "valid at that certain point of time," any citizen may petition the Court to review the sufficiency of the factual basis for its continued implementation should the President and the Congress fail or refuse to lift the imposition of martial law. During the deliberations on the 1987 Constitution, it was explained:<br><blockquote>FR. BERNAS. The decision of the Supreme Court will be based on its assessment of the factual situation. Necessarily, therefore, the judgment of the Supreme Court on that is a <b>transitory judgment</b> because the <b>factual situation can change</b>. So, while the decision of the Supreme Court may be <b>valid at that certain point of time, the situation may change so that Congress should be authorized to do something about it</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[185]</sup> (Emphasis ours)<br></blockquote>Petitioners fear that the one-year extension of martial law will only intensify the human rights violations committed by government forces against civilians. To place a territory under martial law is undeniably an immense power, and like all other powers, it may be abused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[186]</sup> However, the possibility of abuse and even the country's martial law experience under the Marcos regime did not prevent the framers of the 1987 Constitution from including it among the Commander-in-Chief powers of the President. This is in recognition of the fact that during critical times when the security or survival of the state is greatly imperiled, an equally vast and extraordinary measure should be available for the President to protect and defend it.<br><br>Nevertheless, cognizant of such possibility of abuse, the framers of the 1987 Constitution endeavored to institute a system of checks and balances to limit the President's exercise of the martial law and suspension powers, and to establish safeguards to protect civil liberties. Thus, pursuant to Section 18, Article VII of the 1987 Constitution:<br><blockquote>(a) The President may declare martial law or suspend of the privilege of the writ of the privilege of <i>habeas corpus</i> only when there is an invasion or rebellion and public safety requires such declaration or suspension.<br><br>(b) The President's proclamation or suspension shall be for a period not exceeding 60 days.<br><br>(c) Within 48 hours from the proclamation or suspension, the President must submit a Report in person or in writing to Congress.<br><br>(d) The Congress, voting jointly and by a vote of at least a majority of all its Members, can revoke the proclamation or suspension.<br><br>(e) The President cannot set aside the Congress' revocation of his proclamation or suspension.<br><br>(f) The President cannot, by himself, extend his proclamation or suspension. He should ask the Congress' approval.<br><br>(g) Upon such initiative or request from the President, the Congress, voting jointly and by a vote of at least a majority of all its Members, can extend the proclamation or suspension tor such period as it may determine.<br><br>(i) The extension of the proclamation or suspension shall only be approved when the invasion or rebellion persists and public safety requires it.<br><br>(j) The Supreme Court may review the sufficiency of the factual basis of the proclamation or suspension, or the extension thereof, in an appropriate proceeding filed by any citizen.<br><br>(k) The Supreme Court must promulgate its decision within 30 days from the filing of the appropriate proceeding.<br><br>(l) Martial law does not suspend the operation of the Constitution.<br><br>Accordingly, the Bill of Rights<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[187]</sup> remains effective under a state of martial law. Its implementers must adhere to the principle that civilian authority is supreme over the military and the armed forces is the protector of the people.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[188]</sup> They must also abide by the State's policy to value the dignity of every human person and guarantee full respect for human rights.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[189]</sup><br><br>(m) Martial law does not supplant the functioning of the civil courts or legislative assemblies, nor authorize the conferment of jurisdiction on military courts and agencies over civilians where civil courts are able to function.<br><br>(n) The suspension of the privilege of the writ applies only to persons judicially charged for rebellion or offenses inherent in or directly connected with invasion.<br><br>(o) Finally, during the suspension of the privilege of the writ, any person thus arrested or detained should be judicially charged within three days, otherwise he should be released.<br></blockquote>As Commissioner De Los Reyes explained during the deliberations on the 1987 Constitution:<br><blockquote>MR. DE LOS REYES. May I explain my vote, Madam President.<br><br>My vote is <u>yes</u>. The power of the President to impose martial law is doubtless of a very high and delicate nature. A free people are naturally jealous of the exercise of military power, and the power to impose martial law is certainly felt to be one of no ordinary magnitude. But as presented by the Committee, there are many safeguards: 1) it is limited to 60 days; 2) Congress can revoke it; 3) the Supreme Court can still review as to the sufficiency of the actual basis; and 4) it does not suspend the operation of the Constitution. To repeat what I have quoted when I interpellated Commissioner Monsod, <b>it is said that the power to impose martial law is dangerous to liberty and may be abused. All powers may be abused if placed in unworthy hands. But it would be difficult, we think, to point out any other hands in which this power will be more safe [sic] and at the same time equally effectual</b>. When citizens of the State are in arms against each other and the constituted authorities are unable to execute the laws, the action of the President must be prompt or it is of little value. I vote yes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[190]</sup> (Emphasis ours)<br></blockquote>Human rights violations and abuses in the implementation of martial law and suspension powers cannot by any measure be condoned. The Court lauds petitioners' vigilance to make sure that the abuses of the past are not repeated and perceived abuses of the present will not go unnoticed. However, as the Court settled in <i>Lagman</i>, alleged human rights violations committed during the implementation of martial law or the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> should be resolved in a separate proceeding. It, thus, bears noting some of the remedies, requirements and penalties imposed under existing laws, meant to address abuses by arresting or investigating public officers.<br><br>In <i>Lacson v. Perez</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[191]</sup> the Court had occasion to rule:<br><blockquote>Moreover, petitioners' contention in G.R. No. 147780 (<i>Lacson Petition</i>), 147781 (<i>Defensor-Santiago Petition</i>), and 147799 (<i>Lumbao Petition</i>) that they are under imminent danger of being arrested without warrant do not justify their resort to the extraordinary remedies of <i>mandamus</i> and prohibition, since an individual subject to warrantless arrest is not without adequate remedies in the ordinary course of law. Such an individual may ask for a preliminary investigation under Rule 112 of the Rules of Court, where he may adduce evidence in his defense, or he may submit himself to inquest proceedings to determine whether or not he should remain under custody and correspondingly be charged in court. x x x Should the detention be without legal ground, the person arrested can charge the arresting officer with arbitrary detention. All this is without prejudice to his filing an action for damages against the arresting officer under Article 32 of the Civil Code. Verily, petitioners have a surfeit of other remedies which they can avail themselves of, thereby making the prayer for prohibition and <i>mandamus</i> improper at this time (Sections 2 and 3, Rule 65, Rules of Court).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[192]</sup><br></blockquote>R.A.

In A.M. No. 07-9-12-SC,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[197]</sup> this Court made available the remedy of a writ of <i>amparo</i> to any person whose right to life, liberty and security is violated or threatened with violation by an unlawful act or omission of a public official or employee, or of a private individual or entity. Similarly, in A. M. No. 08-1-16-SC,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[198]</sup> this Court also crafted the rule on the writ of <i>habeas data</i> to provide a remedy for any person whose right to privacy in life, liberty or security is violated or threatened by an unlawful act or omission of a public official or employee, or of a private individual or entity engaged in the gathering, collecting or storing of data or information regarding the person, family, home and correspondence of the aggrieved party.<br><br>It also bears to note that the Philippines, is a signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[199]</sup> which is embodied in the International Bill of Human Rights.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[200]</sup> As such, it recognizes that everyone has the right to liberty and security of one's person.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[201]</sup> That no one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest or detention; or that no one shall be deprived of his liberty except on such grounds and in accordance with such procedure as are established by law, are just among the thirty (30) articles, mentioned in the UDHR setting forth the human rights and fundamental freedoms to which all men and women, everywhere in the world, are entitled, without any discrimination.<br><br>Significantly, during the Congress' December 13, 2017 Joint Session, the Executive Department, through Secretary Lorenzana, made an express commitment to submit a monthly report to the Congress regarding the extended implementation of martial law in Mindanao.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[202]</sup> Although not required under Section 18, Article VII of the 1987 Constitution, the submission of such report' is an ideal complement to the system of checks and balance instituted therein. It will clearly assist the Congress in evaluating the need to maintain or shorten the period of extension of martial law in Mindanao; it will also serve as an additional measure to check on possible abuses or human rights violations in the Executive's enforcement of martial law.<br><br><b><i>Petitioners failed to comply with the requisites for the issuance of an injunctive writ</i></b><br><br>The purpose of a preliminary injunction under Section 3, Rule 58 of the Rules of Court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[203]</sup> is to prevent threatened or continuous irremediable injury to some of the parties before their claims can be thoroughly studied and adjudicated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[204]</sup> Its sole aim is to preserve the <i>status quo</i> until the merits of the case can be heard fully.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[205]</sup> <i>Status quo</i> is the last actual, peaceable and uncontested situation which precedes a controversy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[206]</sup> By jurisprudence, to be entitled to an injunctive writ, petitioners have the burden to establish the following requisites: (1) a right <i>in esse</i> or a clear and unmistakable right to be protected; (2) a violation of that right(3) that there is an urgent and permanent act and urgent necessity for the writ to prevent serious damage;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[207]</sup> and (4) no other ordinary, speedy, and adequate remedy exists to prevent the infliction of irreparable injury.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[208]</sup><br><br>Petitioners anchored their prayer for the issuance of an injunctive writ on respondents' gross transgressions of the Constitution when they extended the martial law in Mindanao for one year. The Lagman petition likewise alleges that petitioner Villarin, a Davao City resident, is personally prejudiced by the extension or martial law in Mindanao "<i>which would spawn violations of civil liberties of Mindanaoans like petitioner Villarin who is a steadfast critic of the Duterte administration and of the brutalities committed by police and military forces</i>".<br><br>These grounds, however, cannot carry the day for the petitioners. Basic is the rule that mere allegation is not evidence and is not equivalent to proof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[209]</sup> These allegations cannot constitute a right <i>in esse</i>, as understood in jurisprudence. A right <i>in esse</i> is a clear and unmistakable right to be protected,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[210]</sup> one clearly founded on or granted by law or is enforceable as a matter of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[211]</sup> The existence of a right to be protected, and the acts against which the writ is to be directed are violative of said right must be established.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[212]</sup><br><br>The alleged violations of the petitioners' civil liberties do not justify the grant of injunctive relief. The petitioners failed to prove that the alleged violations are directly attributable to the imposition of martial law. They likewise failed to establish the nexus between the President's exercise of his martial law powers and their unfounded apprehension that the imposition "<i>will target civilians who have no participation at all in any armed uprising or struggle</i>". Incidentally, petitioners failed to state what the "<i>civil liberties</i>" specifically refer to, and how the extension of martial law in Mindanao would threaten these "<i>civil liberties</i>" in derogation of the rule of law. Evidently, petitioners' right is doubtful or disputed, and can hardly be considered a clear legal right, sufficient for the grant of an injunctive writ.<br><br>In <i>Dynamic Builders &amp; Construction Co. (PHIL.), Inc. v. Hon. Ricardo P. Presbitero, Jr., et. al.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[213]</sup> this Court held that no automatic issuance of an injunctive relief will result by the mere allegation of a constitutionally protected right. We explained, thus:<br><blockquote>Mere allegation or invocation that constitutionally protected rights were violated will not automatically result in the issuance of injunctive relief. The plaintiff or the petitioner should discharge the burden to show a clear and compelling breach of a constitutional provision. Violations of constitutional provisions are easily alleged, but trial courts should scrutinize diligently and deliberately the evidence showing the existence of facts that should support the conclusion that a constitutional provision is clearly and convincingly breached. In case of doubt, no injunctive relief should issue. In the proper cases, the aggrieved party may then avail itself of special civil actions and elevate the matter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[214]</sup><br></blockquote>Indeed, this Court cannot rely on speculations, conjectures or guesswork, but must depend upon competent proof and on the basis of the best evidence obtainable under the circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[215]</sup> We emphasize that the grant or denial of an injunctive writ cannot be properly resolved by suppositions, deductions, or even presumptions, with no basis in evidence, for the truth must have to be determined by the procedural rules of admissibility and proof. In <i>The Executive Secretary v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[216]</sup> this Court stressed the indispensability of establishing the requirements for injunctive writ:<br><blockquote>To be entitled to a preliminary injunction to enjoin the enforcement of a law assailed to be unconstitutional, the party must establish that it will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of injunctive relief and must demonstrate that <i>it is likely to succeed on the merits, or that there are sufficiently serious questions going to the merits and the balance of hardships tips decidedly in its favor</i>. The higher standard reflects judicial deference toward "legislation or regulations developed through presumptively reasoned democratic processes." Moreover, an injunction will alter, rather than maintain, the <i>status quo</i>, or will provide the movant with substantially all the relief sought and that relief cannot be undone even if the defendant prevails at a trial on the merits. Considering that injunction is an exercise of equitable relief and authority, in assessing whether to issue a preliminary injunction, <i>the courts must sensitively assess all the equities of the situation, including the public interest</i>. In litigations between governmental and private parties, courts go much further both to give and withhold relief in furtherance of public interest than they are accustomed to go when only private interests are involved. Before the plaintiff may be entitled to injunction against future enforcement, he is burdened to show some substantial hardship.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[217]</sup> (Citations omitted and italics in the original)<br></blockquote>Incidentally, there is nothing in the Constitution, nor in any law which supports petitioners' theory. Such purported human right violations cannot be utilized as ground either to enjoin the President from exercising the power to declare martial law, or the Congress in extending the same. To sanction petitioners' plea would result into judicial activism, thereby going against the principle of separation of powers.<br><br>As discussed above, petitioners are not left without any recourse. Such transgressions can be addressed in a separate and independent court action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[218]</sup> Recall that the imposition of martial law does not result in suspending the operation of the Constitution, nor supplant the functioning of the civil courts nor authorize the conferment of jurisdiction on military courts and agencies over civilians where civil courts are able to function. Hence, petitioners can lodge a complaint-affidavit before the prosecutor's office or file a direct complaint before the appropriate courts against erring parties.<br><br><center><b>A Final Word</b><br></center><br>The imperative necessity of .Martial Law as a tool of the government for self-preservation is enshrined in the 1935, 1973 and 1987 Constitutions. It earned a bad reputation during the Marcos era and apprehensions still linger in the minds of doubtful and suspicious individuals. Mindful of its importance and necessity, the Constitution has provided for safeguards against its abuses.<br><br>Martial law is a constitutional weapon against enemies of the State. Thus, Martial law is not designed to oppress or abuse law abiding citizens of this country.<br><br>Unfortunately, the enemies of the State have employed devious, cunning and calculating means to destabilize the government. They are engaged in an unconventional, clandestine and protracted war to topple the government. The enemies of the State are not always quantifiable, not always identifiable and not visible at all times. They have mingled with ordinary citizens in the community and have unwittingly utilized them in the recruitement, surveillance and attack against government forces. Inevitably, government forces have arrested, injured and even killed these ordinary citizens complicit with the enemies.<br><br>Admittedly, innocent civilians have also been victimized in the cross fire as unintended casualties of this continuing war.<br><br>These incidents, however, should not weaken our resolve to defeat the enemies of the State. In these exigencies, We cannot afford to emasculate, dilute or diminish the powers of government if in the end it would lead to the destruction of the State and place the safety of our citizens in peril and their interest in harm's way.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court <b>FINDS</b> sufficient factual bases for the issuance of Resolution of Both Houses No. 4 and <b>DECLARES</b> it as <b>CONSTITUTIONAL</b>.

Instead, it has taken an extreme view, ceding all substantive points to respondents and allowing thereby no significant quarters to petitioners. In demonstrating its serious lack of balance, it has made itself even more vulnerable to political forces, rendering itself inert in exercising the power of judicial review.<br><br>With all due respect, I refer most especially to the <i>ponencia</i>'s inability to establish sufficient parameters to determine whether the first or the second requirement under the Constitution is present to support a valid extension of the declaration of Martial Law and suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>. These two requirements are that actual rebellion persists, and that public safety requires the imposition of Martial Law or the suspension of the writ.<br><br>The <i>ponencia</i> has additionally defaulted by providing no limits to the length or the number of extensions that Congress may allow for Martial Law to take hold. The limitations on the power of extension are so insubstantial as to be invisible. It holds that "Section 18, Article VII is clear that the only limitation[s] to the exercise of the congressional authority to extend such proclamation or suspension are that the extension should be upon the President's initiative; that it should be grounded on the persistence of the invasion or rebellion and the demands of public safety; and that it is subject to the Court's review of the sufficiency of its factual basis upon the petition of any citizen."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>The <i>ponencia</i> then proceeds to cite the factual allegations of both the Executive and Congress and without any further test, yields to the spirit of deference and justifies its conclusion in this wise:<br><blockquote>The information upon which the extension of martial law or of the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> shall be based principally emanate from and are in the possession of the Executive Department. Thus, "the Court will have to rely on the fat-finding capabilities of the [E]xecutive [D]epartment; in turn, the Executive Department will have to open its findings to the scrutiny of the Court."<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The facts as provided by the Executive and considered by Congress amply establish that rebellion persists in Mindanao and public safety is significantly endangered by it. The Court, thus, holds that there exists sufficient factual basis for the further extension sought by the President and approved by the Congress in its Resolution of Both Houses No. 4<br><br>Necessarily, we do not see the merit in petitioner's theory in the Cullamat petition that the extent of threat to public safety as would justify the declaration or extension of the proclamation of martial [law] and the suspension of the privilege of the writ must be of such level that the government cannot sufficiently govern, cannot assure public safety and cannot deliver government services. Petitioners posit that only in this scenario may martial law be constitutionally permissible.<br><br>Restrained caution must be exercised in adopting petitioners' theory for several reasons. To begin with, a hasty adoption of the suggested scale, level, or extent of threat to public safety is to supplant into the plain text of the Constitution. An interpretation of the Constitution precedes from the fundamental postulate that the Constitution is the basic and paramount law to which all other laws must conform to and to which all persons, including the highest officials of the land, must defer. The consequent duty of the judiciary is to determine conflicting claims of authority under the Constitution and to establish for the parties in an actual controversy the rights which that instrument secures and guarantees to them. This must be so considering that the Constitution is the mother of all laws, sufficient and complete in itself. For the court to categorically pronounce which kind of threat to public safety justifies the declaration or extension of martial law and which ones do not, is to improvise on the text of the Constitution ideals even when these ideals are not expressed as a matter of positive law in the written Constitution. Such judicial improvisation finds no justification.<br><br>For another, if the Court were to be successful in disposing of its bounden duty to allocate constitutional boundaries, the Constitutional doctrines the Court produces must necessarily remain steadfast no matter what may be the tides of time. The adoption of the extreme scenario as the measure of threat to public safety as suggested by petitioners is to invite doubt as to whether the proclamation of martial law would at all be effective in such case considering that enemies of the State raise unconventional methods which change over time. It may happen that by the time government loses all capability to dispose of all its functions, the enemies of the government might have already been successful in removing allegiance therefrom. Any declaration then of martial law would be of no useful purpose and such could not be the intent of the Constitution. Instead, the requirement of public safety as it presently appears in the Constitution admits of flexibility and discretion on the part of the Congress.<br><br>So too, when the President and the Congress ascertain whether public safety requires the declaration and extension of martial law, respectively, they do so by calibrating not only the present state of public safety but the further repercussions of the actual rebellion to public safety in the future as well. x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br></blockquote>It is difficult to see how the <i>ponencia</i> can consider as inevitable its conclusion disagreeing with the Cullamat proposal that the danger posed to public safety must necessitate the imposition of Martial Law, and that only then can Martial Law be justifiable. Neither the difficulty posed by the process of examining necessity nor the need to adapt to different approaches in the future is sufficient reason for the Court to refuse to review the question of necessity. The automatic conclusion that as Government has established the existence and persistence of rebellion, therefore Martial Law is justifiable by its self-evident claims, is, sadly, gratuitous. It is not wrong to suspect that this halfhearted conclusion is rooted in the refusal to take seriously the doctrine of necessity.<br><br><b><i>The Doctrine of Necessity</i></b><br><br>To put texture into this discussion, it would help to recall the conversations in <i>Lagman v. Medialdea</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> where the Solicitor General called the declaration of Martial Law a "<i>Gulpi de Gulat</i>,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> an "exclamation point," and as the "calling out powers on steroids."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Note that the struggle to find a definition of Martial Law under the 1987 Constitution is, in turn, due to the need for Government to justify why it needs that kind of Martial Law. This is because, in essence, Government cannot escape facing the question of necessity.<br><br>An examination of the deliberations of the 1987 Constitutional Commission shows that our framers drew the Philippine concept of Martial Law from American law, with certain differences. As explained by Father Joaquin Bernas:<br><blockquote>Since the Philippine Constitution is traceable to American origins and was formulated by jurists reared in the tradition of American constitutional law, it is legitimate to start the quest for a definition of martial law in the Constitution by looking back to the difference nuances which the term carries in American law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br></blockquote>American cases on the concept of Martial Law show the doctrine of necessity at its very heart. The United States (US) Supreme Court's first look at Martial Law was in 1848 in <i>Luther v. Borden</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> The controversy centered on the state militia's warrantless forced entry into the home of Martin Luther<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> during a state of Martial Law in Rhode Island.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> The case was dismissed for being a political question. Chief Justice Taney wrote that the decision whether or not to impose Martial Law to combat a crisis is left to the State.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Nevertheless, <i>Luther</i> touched on the substantive issue regarding the state's authority to invoke Martial Law and thereby laid the early foundations of Martial Law in the US. In describing this power, <i>Luther</i> went on to explain:<br><blockquote>And, unquestionably, a State may use its military power to put down an armed insurrection too strong to be controlled by the civil authority. The power is essential to the existence of every government, essential to the preservation of order and free institutions, and is as necessary to the States of this Union as to any other government. The State itself must determine what degree of force the crisis demands. And if the government of Rhode Island deemed the armed opposition so formidable and so ramified throughout the State, as to require the use of its military force and the declaration of martial law, we see no ground upon which this court can question its authority.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br></blockquote>A conclusion that may be drawn from the foregoing dictum is that the state can determine when an internal unrest necessitates the declaration of Martial Law, a determination that then becomes conclusive upon the courts. Nevertheless, <i>Luther</i> went on to explain that <b>the power to make that determination is limited by the necessity of the situation</b> involved, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>And in that state of things, the officers engaged in its military service might lawfully arrest anyone who, from the information before them, they had reasonable grounds to believe was engaged in the insurrection, and might order a house to be forcibly entered and searched when there were reasonable grounds for supposing he might be there concealed. Without the power to do this, martial law and the military array of the government would be mere parade, and rather encourage attack than repel it. No more force, however, can be used than is necessary to accomplish the object. And if the power is exercised for the purposes of oppression, or any injury wilfully done to person or property, the party by whom, or by whose order, it is committed would undoubtedly be answerable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br></blockquote>Subsequently, it was in <i>Ex Parte Milligan</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> where the US Supreme Court was able to substantively explore Martial Law. The case stemmed from the arrest of Lamdin Milligan while the state was under Martial Law. Milligan was later on tried by a military commission, whose ruling was struck down by the Court. In that case, the imposition of Martial Law in Indiana was analyzed, to wit:<br><blockquote>It follows, from what has been said on this subject, that there are occasions when martial rule can be properly applied. If, in foreign invasion or civil war, the courts are actually closed, and it is impossible to administer criminal justice according to law, <i>then</i>, on the theatre of active military operations, where war really prevails, there is a necessity to furnish a substitute for the civil authority, thus overthrown, to preserve the safety of the army and society, and as no power is left but the military, it is allowed to govern by martial rule until the laws can have their free course. As necessity creates the rule, so it limits its duration; for, if this government is continued <i>after</i> the courts are reinstated, it is a gross usurpation of power. Martial rule can never exist where the courts are open and in the proper and unobstructed exercise of their jurisdiction. It is also confined to the locality of actual war.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br></blockquote>Justice Davis, speaking for the majority, clarified <b>that there could be no Martial Law unless there is an actual need for it</b>:<br><blockquote>Martial law cannot arise from a <i>threatened</i> invasion. The necessity must be actual and present; the invasion real, such as effectually closes the courts and deposes the civil administration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br></blockquote><i>Luther</i> and <i>Ex Parte Milligan</i> were decided within the context of war emergencies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> However, there were questions that remained unanswered. After the Civil War, several cases that subsequently arose allowed the US Supreme Court to further define Martial Law, this time within the context of turmoil rooted in economic crisis.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Still, the doctrine of necessity persisted.<br><br>In <i>Moyer v. Peabody</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> the Court reviewed the Colorado governor's declaration of Martial Law to address a labor dispute in the state. It also looked into the exercise of Martial Law powers, such as the arrest of Charles Moyer. The opinion of the Court penned by Justice Holmes mirrored Chief Justice Taney's dictum in <i>Luther</i>. It ruled that the governor had the power to declare Martial Law sans a significant judicial review, as long as the declaration was done in good faith. Nevertheless, <b>necessity was still deemed the primary consideration</b>, to wit:<br><blockquote>When it comes to a decision by the head of the state upon a matter involving its life, the ordinary rights of individuals must yield to what he deems the necessities of the moment. Public danger warrants the substitution of executive process for judicial process.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br></blockquote>Twenty-three years later, <i>Sterling v. Constantin</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> allowed the US Supreme Court to again review a governor's authority to declare Martial Law. This time, the governor of Texas had proclaimed Martial Law over several oil-producing counties of the state, declaring that insurrection and riot beyond civil control existed there due to the wasteful production of oil. The military force shut down the oil wells thereafter, an act the Court found to be excessive. It affirmed <i>Luther</i> and <i>Moyer</i> in that the governor's decision to declare Martial Law was conclusive upon the courts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> However, <b><i>Sterling</i> went one step further and qualified the governor's power with the so-­called "proportionality test"</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><b> - that the means employed by the governor in his exercise of Martial Law powers must bear a direct relation to the disturbance being faced</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Finding the state's actions in <i>Luther</i> and <i>Moyer</i> to be in line with the proportionality test, the Court likewise concluded that the doctrine of necessity was still at the core of its considerations. In effect, <i>Sterling</i> affinned its authority to review the executive's declaration of Martial Law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br><i>Duncan v. Kahanamoku</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> again provided the Court an opportunity to deal with the imposition of Martial Law during wartime. Set during the bombing of Pearl Harbor, the issue centered on Duncan's arrest and subsequent trial and conviction by the military commission. While the Court, through Justice Black, struck down the military tribunal's authority to try and convict Duncan, it still upheld the declaration of Martial Law in Hawaii. Nevertheless, it tested the extent of authority of the military commission against the doctrine of necessity enunciated in <i>Ex Parte Milligan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> again confirming the centrality of that doctrine in US Martial Law jurisprudence.<br><br>All of the above pronouncements, <b>taken together, lead to the understanding that Martial Law is "the law of necessity in national emergency."</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>This doctrine of necessity was translated into the Philippine concept of Martial Law through the second requisite for its proclamation as specified by the text of the 1987 Constitution: "public safety requires it."<br><br>In other words, during a state of invasion or rebellion, the necessity posed by public safety serves as the gauge for the proclamation of Martial Law, as well as its scope and duration. As explained by Fr. Bernas:<br><blockquote><b>Necessity creates the conditions for martial law and at the same time limits the scope of martial law.</b> Certainly, the necessities created by a state of invasion would be different from those created by rebellion. Necessarily, therefore, the degree and kind of vigorous executive action needed to meet the varying kinds and degrees of emergency could not be identical under all condition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><b><i>Calibration Exercise and the Proportionality Test</i></b><br><br>Unlike the US concept of Martial Law, which did not define the specific circumstance of unrest that would trigger Martial Law, the Philippine Constitution specifies actual invasion or rebellion as the requisite factual antecedents, without which Martial Law cannot be proclaimed.<br><br>It is in the context of invasion or rebellion that the doctrine of necessity is considered. More aptly called the "necessity of public safety test," a calibration exercise must be undertaken to determine whether the crisis at hand poses such a danger to public safety and good order that Martial Law becomes necessary. If so, this exercise further requires a determination of the degree of Martial Law powers necessary to address the threat to public safety. This task entails a determination of the scope, coverage, and duration of Martial Law.<br><br>The proportionality test that the US Supreme Court instituted in <i>Sterling</i> can serve as a guide in undertaking a calibration exercise. The Court in <i>Sterling</i>, after reviewing the factual bases of the governor's declaration of Martial Law, found that the overproduction of oil was not serious enough to warrant the declaration of Martial Law and the exercise of Martial Law powers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> In analyzing the proportionality between the internal unrest and the government powers invoked to address the unrest, the Court therein examined the factual findings of the district court, as follows:<br><blockquote>It was conceded that at no time has there been any actual uprising in the territory. At no time has any military force been exerted to put riots or mobs down. At no time, except in the refusal of defendant Wolters to observe the injunction in this case, have the civil authorities or courts been interfered with, or their processes made impotent. Though it was testified to by defendants that, from reports which came to them, they believed that, if plaintiffs' wells were not shut in, there would be dynamiting of property in the oil fields, and efforts to close them and any others which opened by violence, and that, if that occurred, there would be general trouble in the field, no evidence of any dynamite having been used, or show of violence practiced or actually attempted, or even threatened against any specific property in the field, was offered. We find, therefore, that not only was there never any actual riot, tumult, or insurrection which would create a state of war existing in the field, but that, if all of the conditions had come to pass, they would have resulted merely in breaches of the peace, to be suppressed by the militia as a civil force, and not at all in a condition constituting, or even remotely resembling, a state of war.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br></blockquote>In was then found that the above circumstances did not amount to an "exigency which justified the Governor in attempting to enforce by executive or military order the restriction."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> The US Court reasoned:<br><blockquote>By virtue of his duty to "cause the laws to be faithfully executed," the Executive is appropriately vested with the discretion to determine whether an exigency requiring military aid for that purpose has arisen. x x x The nature of the power also necessarily implies that there is a permitted range of honest judgment as to the measures to be taken in meeting force with force, in suppressing violence and restoring order, for, without such liberty to make immediate decisions, the power itself would be useless. Such measures, conceived in good faith, in the face of the emergency, and directly related to the quelling of the disorder or the prevention of its continuance, fall within the discretion of the executive in the exercise of his authority to maintain peace.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>It does not follow from the fact that the executive has this range of discretion, deemed to be a necessary incident of his power to suppress disorder, that every sort of action the Governor may take, no matter how unjustified by the exigency or subversive of private right and the jurisdiction of the courts, otherwise available, is conclusively supported by mere executive fiat. The contrary is well established. What are the allowable limits of military discretion, and whether or not they have been overstepped in a particular case, are judicial questions. Thus, in the theater of actual war, there are occasions in which private property may be taken or destroyed to prevent it from falling into the hands of the enemy or may be impressed into the public service, and the officer may show the necessity in defending an action for trespass. "But we are clearly of opinion," said the Court, speaking through Chief Justice Taney,<br><blockquote>"that, in all of these cases, the danger must be immediate and impending; or the necessity urgent for the public service, such as will not admit of delay, and where the action of the civil authority would be too late in providing the means which the occasion calls for. . . . Every case must depend on its own circumstances. It is the emergency that gives the right, and the emergency must be shown to exist before the taking can be justified."<i>Mitchell v. Harmony</i>, 13 How. 115, 134. See also <i>United States v. Russell</i>, 13 Wall. 623, 628.<br></blockquote>There is no ground for the conclusion that military orders in the case of insurrection have any higher sanction or confer any greater immunity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br></blockquote>The <i>Sterling</i> Court examined the previous case, <i>Moyer</i>, which also upheld the temporary detention of one believed to be a participant in the insurrection launched during Martial Law. The <i>Sterling</i> Court applied the proportionality test and agreed that the action of the governor in <i>Moyer</i> had a direct relation to the crushing of the insurrection.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Applying that model to the Texas governor's actions, the Court ultimately found that the declaration of Martial Law was not a proportional response to the crisis caused by the overproduction of oil.<br><br><b><i>Necessity of Public Safety as a Required Precursor of Martial Law</i></b><br><br>There is no dire lack of guidance or parameters in determining what sort of public safety necessity calls for a proclamation of Martial Law. It is <i>Sterling</i> that gives a clearer insight into what kind of necessity entails a Martial Law declaration. As deduced from the quoted portions above, there must be a semblance of a "state of war." Moreover, there must be a perceived inability of the civilian authority to address the crisis brought about by the "state of war." The logical consequence is the existence of a serious threat to public safety.<br><br>This finding was reiterated in <i>Duncan</i>, which ruled that Martial Law was "intended to authorize the military to act vigorously for the maintenance of an orderly civil government and for the defense of the island against actual or threatened rebellion or invasion."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> This pronouncement essentially maintained the concept of Martial Law as defined in <i>Ex Parte Milligan</i> ­ that Martial Law is proper during war when civil institutions are paralyzed to a certain extent and military operations are necessary to preserve public safety and order.<br><br>War. Military operations. Crippled civilian functions. It was along these lines that the US Supreme Court has determined the propriety of Martial Law. It is apparent from the deliberations of the 1986 Constitution Commission that the framers somehow intended to define and characterize Philippine Martial Law along the same lines. Fr. Bernas himself used the term "theatre of war" to define Martial Law:<br><blockquote>FR. BERNAS: This phrase was precisely put here because we have clarified the meaning of martial law; meaning, limiting it to martial law as it has existed in the jurisprudence in international law, that <b>it is a law for the theater of war. In a theater of war, civil courts are unable to function.</b> If in the actual theater of war civil courts, in fact, are unable to function, then the military commander is authorized to give jurisdiction even over civilians to military courts precisely because the civil courts are closed in that area. But in the general area where the civil courts are opened then in no case can the military courts be given jurisdiction over civilians. This is in reference to a theater of war where the civil courts, in fact, are unable to function.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>It would therefore be helpful for the Court to undertake its calibration exercise in weighing necessity <i>vis-a-vis</i> public safety along similar lines as well. To my mind, <b>the intensity of an invasion or a rebellion that endangers public safety must be discerned within the context of a state of significant armed conflict. In other words, the circumstances on the ground must be so severe that they entail the invocation of an extreme measure.</b><br><br><b>A balancing act is called for, specifically between the gravity of the situation and the extraordinary measure meant to address it, which is Martial Law.</b> It is the established intent of the framers of our Constitution for Martial Law to be a measure that would be utilized only in extremely urgent circumstances as the following deliberation shows:<br><blockquote>FR. BERNAS: Besides, it is not enough that there is actual rebellion. Even if we will suppose for instance that the Manila Hotel incident was an actual rebellion, that by itself would not justify the imposition of martial law or the suspension of the privilege of the writ because the Constitution further says: "when the public safety requires it." So, <b>even if there is a rebellion but the rebellion can be handled and public safety can be protected without imposing martial law or suspending the privilege of the writ, the President need not</b>. Therefore, even if we consider that a rebellion, clearly, it was something which did not call for imposition of martial law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>This intent leads to the general understanding that Martial Law is an extraordinary power to be wielded only in extraordinary circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> That is the fundamental principle that must guide the Court in the conduct of its review powers.<br><br><b><i>The Court's Power of Review</i></b><br><br>While the President and Congress are expected to engage in a calibration exercise in the process of deciding whether or not to declare or extend Martial Law, this exercise is of utmost importance to this Court, which exercises the power of review over the sufficiency of the factual bases of the proclamation or its extension.<br><br>As emphasized in my dissent in <i>Lagman v. Medialdea</i>, it is the duty of the Court to inquire into the necessity of declaring Martial Law to protect public safety. I pointed out:<br><blockquote><b>The duty of the Court to inquire into the necessity of declaring martial law to protect public safety logically and inevitably requires the determination of proportionality of the powers sought to be exercised by the President.</b> As pointed out by the <i>ponencia</i>, the exercise of the powers of the President under Section 18, Article VII "can be resorted to only under specified conditions." This means that greater powers are needed only when other less intrusive measures appear to be ineffective. When it is deemed that the power exercised is disproportional to what is required by the exigencies of the situation, any excess therefore is deemed not required to protect public safety, and should be invalidated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>To perform this duty is to engage in the same kind of calibration exercise that the <i>Sterling</i> Court undertook. Hence, the Court herein is required not only to determine the existence of an actual invasion or rebellion, but also, to analyze and determine whether the nature and intensity of the invasion or rebellion endanger public safety in a way that makes Martial Law necessary.<br><br>The calibration would necessitate a determination not just of the propriety of a Martial Law declaration, but likewise its territorial coverage. In the case of an extension of Martial Law, the Court is called upon to take one step further and likewise calibrate whether the danger posed is commensurate with the period of extension fixed by Congress. In so doing, this Court needs to apply a trial judge's reasonable mind and common sense as honed by relevant experiences and legal proficiency.<br><br>It must be emphasized that this kind of exercise is no longer new to this Court, as it has in fact undertaken a similar calibration in <i>Lansang v. Garcia</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> In that case, the Court upheld the nationwide suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>, but only after a careful examination and calibration of the danger posed by the nationwide acts of rebellion.<br><br>To refrain from undertaking a similar calibration exercise this time around would amount to an abdication of this Court's obligation under Section 18, Article VII of the Constitution. To reiterate my dissent in <i>Lagman v. Medialdea</i>:<br><blockquote>The Court cannot be defending vigorously its review power at the beginning, with respect to the sufficiency-of-factual basis question, then be in default when required to address the questions of <b>necessity, proportionality, and coverage</b>. Such luxury is not allowed this Court by express directive of the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><b><i>Help to Government</i></b><br><br>In the exchange between the undersigned and General Guerrero, an effort was made to elicit the operational necessity for Martial Law. Below is the exchange:<br><blockquote><b>CHIEF JUSTICE SERENO:</b><br><br>Can you answer for us General, can you just answer for us what particular power do you want under a martial law system? You have already concluded that it was effective, immediate but what specific aspect is important for you?<br><br><b>GENERAL GUERRERO:</b><br><br>For now, Your Honor, what martial law [has] given us is the power for us to be able to effect immediate arrest of rebels because of the suspension of the privilege of <i>habeas corpus</i>.<br><br><b>CHIEF JUSTICE SERENO:</b><br><br>But there are jurisprudence already that authorize you to do that?<br><br><b>GENERAL GUERRERO:</b><br><br>Yes, Your Honor.<br><br><b>CHIEF JUSTICE SERENO:</b><br><br>Yes.

You only need actually the declaration, the arrest, you only need, the arrest rather, you only need the declaration of the Anti-Terrorism Council, is that not correct? x x x<br><br><b>GENERAL GUERRERO:</b><br><br>Your Honor...<br><br><b>CHIEF JUSTICE SERENO:</b><br><br>Why are you not using that?

But if you are the martial law implement[e]r, that's a strong message to comply?<br><br><b>GENERAL GUERRERO:</b><br><br>Your Honor, the President is the Commander-in-Chief.<br><br>x x x x<br><br><b>CHIEF JUSTICE SERENO:</b><br><br>x x x This is what martial law does. Because even in my dissenting opinion, x x x I said, <i>Until now nobody has really answered the question of what martial law is for</i>? So, finally we have this chance, can you tell us, candidly, why do we need martial law? Because I'm open to any idea, at this point. Why?<br><br><b>GENERAL GUERRERO:</b><br><br>As I have said, the problem in Mindanao as in the other parts of the country is multi-dimensional, the armed conflict, Ma'am, is just a manifestation of a deeper problem in society.<br><br><b>CHIEF JUSTICE SERENO:</b><br><br>So, there is a deeper problem in society. So, the SOLGEN is a, there is paranoia, or I'm sorry, one of the theories propounded is there is paranoia on the part of the petitioners. But you are now presenting to us that there is a deep problem that must be addressed and we need martial law as a psychological mooring because, first, we have observed greater compliance on the part of all government entities. What else? Can you enumerate for us? Because you only concluded that it was very good but you never in your presentation and J2 never presented why it was effective? So, that's first, <i>there is more, there's easier compliance</i>. The second reason?<br><br><b>GENERAL GUERRERO:</b><br><br>It enhances climate of safety; safety and security, Your Honor.<br><br><b>CHIEF JUSTICE SERENO:</b><br><br>It enhances how?<br><br><b>GENERAL GUERRERO:</b><br><br>The people, especially in the affected areas of rebellion, (inaudible) and I was able to talk to the (inaudible), that they appreciate the implementation of martial law in their respective localities.<br><br>x x x x<br><br><b>CHIEF JUSTICE SERENO:</b><br><br>Yeah, I know, and how do they describe it?<br><br><b>GENERAL GUERRERO:</b><br><br>For instance, I was just there the other day in Basilan and I was able to talk to some of the residents there.<br><br><b>CHIEF JUSTICE SERENO:</b><br><br>Yes.<br><br><b>GENERAL GUERRERO:</b><br><br>And they said that they prefer the presence of the soldiers in the area and that they would not want the soldiers to pull out. And in fact they are supporting the implementation of martial law.<br><br><b>CHIEF JUSTICE SERENO:</b><br><br>So, <i>martial law enhances the presence of the military</i>, that's your second reason. And because it enhances the presence of the military there is greater safety on the part of the civilian population?<br><br><b>GENERAL GUERRERO:</b><br><br>Yes, Your Honor.<br><br><b>CHIEF JUSTICE SERENO:</b><br><br>Okay. What else?<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Because you know, if we are able to define really why you need martial law, we would have a breakthrough in this case. So, help me here. Third reason?<br><br><b>GENERAL GUERRERO:</b><br><br>To be honest with you, Your Honor, we have not really fully exploited the possibilities, but we can gain from the declaration of martial law, the present martial law.<br><br>x x x x<br><br><b>CHIEF JUSTICE SERENO:</b><br><br>So, there is still an ephemeral, undefinable element to martial law which you think is very effective but to some it is being characterized as paranoia, but there is fear. So, in other words, is it not the yin and yang concept here, there is the fear element, the fear enhances or the fear paralyzes and makes it possible that the civilian population will believe that their democratic rights are being endangered. Is that two sides of the same face, is it a janus situation here?<br><br><b>GENERAL GUERRERO:</b><br><br>Yes, Your Honor, and that is something that we, in the military, [are] also trying to balance in terms of perception and in terms of our actuations.<br><br><b>CHIEF JUSTICE SERENO:</b><br><br>So, fear can be used positively and fear is being said as [imposing] the cause of martial law in a negative way. So, is it not just an information campaign that needs to be done if you are going to be strong adheren[ts] to human rights that there is an information gap between the two interpretations? You agree?<br><br><b>GENERAL GUERRERO:</b><br><br>It could be, Your Honor. But I could not say for a fact because as I have said, if it would be an informational campaign then definitely it is not purely a military effort, Your Honor.<br><br><b>CHIEF JUSTICE SERENO:</b><br><br>Okay. So, what I see so far, what you have said is that there is a psychological impact on civilian authorities, there is a psychological impact on the civilian authorities in the areas where rebellion or terrorism abounds. So, [those are] the things that you have enumerated to the Court so far. So, we need these because it creates a favorable mindset for us to address the security problem in Mindanao, is that what you're saying?<br><br><b>GENERAL GUERRERO:</b><br><br>Yes, Your Honor.<br><br>x x x x<br><br><b>CHIEF JUSTICE SERENO:</b><br><br>So, you are actually asking this Court to say that there is factual basis sufficient to justify the extension of martial law because you have noted effectivity in your operations because of the martial law and you have noticed that its effectivity is brought about by the psychological impact it has on the authorities in the areas as well in the civilian population. That's a good summation?<br><br><b>GENERAL GUERRERO:</b><br><br>Partly, Your Honor. But as I have said, it's not only psychological, Your Honor. We have to look at the added dimensions as well.<br><br><b>CHIEF JUSTICE SERENO:</b><br><br>Logistical, is there a logistical efficiency?<br><br><b>GENERAL GUERRERO:</b><br><br>Yes, Your Honor. Financial.<br><br><b>CHIEF JUSTICE SERENO:</b><br><br>Why? <i>Logistical and financial</i>, why?<br><br><b>GENERAL GUERRERO:</b><br><br>Again, with the martial law authority, with the authority, enhanced authority given to us by martial law we are able to enjoin other agencies to cooperate with us and help us in addressing...<br><br><b>CHIEF JUSTICE SERENO:</b><br><br>So, without martial law, they wouldn't be fast in helping provide you with necessary transportation, fuel, etc.?<br><br><b>GENERAL GUERRERO:</b><br><br>Not necessarily fuel and transportation, Your Honor.<br><br><b>CHIEF JUSTICE SERENO:</b><br><br>But like what?<br><br><b>GENERAL GUERRERO:</b><br><br>Information, Your Honor.<br><br><i>Information</i>. Information is one. They are able to relay information faster because of martial law?<br><br><b>GENERAL GUERRERO:</b><br><br>Yes, Your Honor.<br><br><b>CHIEF JUSTICE SERENO:</b><br><br>Evacuation is helped?<br><br><b>GENERAL GUERRERO:</b><br><br>Mobilization, Your Honor.<br><br><b>CHIEF JUSTICE SERENO:</b><br><br><i>Mobilization.

We have been actually able to apply this, Your Honor, in my area when I was Eastern Mindanao Commander.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br></blockquote>Nowhere in the exchange or the pleadings is there any indication of the factual or legal basis for claiming that Martial Law makes addressing public safety in the midst of rebellion easier, other than an undocumented experiential claim. But against this experiential claim of ease in military operations are the apparently documented claims of enhanced abuses under the existing Martial Law regime in Mindanao.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> These claims bring this Court to a point of transcendental importance, one that goes into its very reason for existence when petitioners make out a case of probable excess in the exercise of power that leads to the violation of constitutional rights, and when Government is unable to categorically put its finger on why it needs Martial Law, then this Court must define the parameters according to the tests of necessity; otherwise, it ceases to genuinely exist as a bastion of democracy.<br><br><b><i>Determination of the Period of Extension</i></b><br><br>Distinction must be made between the examination by this Court of the basis for the extension of Martial Law <i>per se</i> on the one hand, and the period of extension on the other hand. This distinction is clear in the following constitutional deliberations:<br><blockquote>MR. SUAREZ: Madam President.<br><br>THE PRESIDENT: Commissioner Suarez is recognized. <br><br>MR. SUAREZ: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>I concur with the proposal of Commissioner Azcuna but may I suggest that we fix a period for the duration of the extension, because it could very well happen that the initial period may be shorter than the extended period and it could extend indefinitely. So if Commissioner Azcuna could put a certain limit to the extended period, I would certainly appreciate that, Madam President.<br><br>THE PRESIDENT: What does Commissioner Azcuna say?<br><br>MR. AZCUNA: Madam President, <b>I believe that that is a different concept and should be voted on separately so as not to confuse the issue on the limitation of the period with the extension. My amendment would merely require that any extension should have the concurrence of both the President and the Congress. Commissioner Suarez may propose an amendment to limit the period of the extension</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>The extension <i>per se</i> of Martial Law involves a two-step process. First, there must be an initiative from the President addressed to Congress requesting the extension of his prior proclamation of Martial Law. Second, Congress determines as a joint body whether or not the extension is proper. If it approves of the extension, it then likewise determines the period thereof.<br><br>The wording of the Constitution leaves an initial impression that the determination of the extension period is an exclusive congressional prerogative. However, a look into the constitutional deliberations seems to show that the determination of the period was intended to remain a joint executive-legislative act. This conclusion may be drawn from the following deliberations, which came about as a solution to Commissioner Suarez's proposal to fix a 60-day period of extension:<br><blockquote>FR. BERNAS: <b>Madam President, may I just propose something because I see the problem. Suppose we were to say: "or extend the same FOR A PERIOD TO BE DETERMINED BY CONGRESS" - that gives Congress a little flexibility on just how long the extension should be.</b><br><br>MR. REGALADO: Is the Gentleman placing his amendment after "same" and before "if"?<br><br>FR. BERNAS: Yes.<br><br>MR. SUAREZ: Maybe that can be added after the final word "it" so that the clause would read: "if the invasion or rebellion shall persist and public safety requires it, FOR A PERIOD AS MAY BE [DETERMINED] BY CONGRESS."<br><br>FR. BERNAS: It is a question of style, Madam President. It seems to be very far from the verb.<br><br>THE PRESIDENT: <b>Is that accepted by Commissioner Suarez?</b><br><br>MR. SUAREZ: <b>Yes, Madam President.</b><br><br>MR. OPLE: May I just pose a question to the Committee in connection with the Suarez amendment? Earlier, Commissioner Regalado said that that point was going to be a collective judgment between the President and the Congress. <b>Are we departing from that now in favor of giving Congress the plenipotentiary power to determine the period?</b><br><br>FR. BERNAS: <b>Not really, Madam President, because Congress would be doing this in consultation with the President, and the President would be outvoted by about 300 Members.</b><br><br>MR. OPLE: <b>Yes, but still the idea is to preserve the principle of collective judgment of that point upon the expiration of the 60 days when, upon his own initiative, the President seeks for an extension of the proclamation of martial law or the suspension of the privilege of the writ.</b><br><br>FR. BERNAS: <b>Yes, the participation of the President is there but by giving the final decision to Congress, we are also preserving the idea that the President may not revoke what Congress has decided upon.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> (Emphases supplied)<br></blockquote>The principle of collective judgment, as stated by Commissioner Ople, is retained through the following process: the President provides the facts showing the persistence of invasion or rebellion and its perceived threat to public safety. In turn, Congress evaluates the facts provided by the President and on the basis of those facts determines the period of extension.<br><br><b><i>Parameters for the Determination of the Period of Extension</i></b><br><br>Indeed, Congress has been granted final authority in the determination of the period of extension. But as any grant of discretion goes, it is not unbridled. There are parameters that must be taken into consideration in the exercise of this discretion. It is clear from the constitutional deliberations that there was no intention to completely leave that exercise to Congress. Fr. Bernas himself said that the determination only "gives Congress a little flexibility on just how long the extension should be."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> There was no complete or unlimited flexibility granted. Rather, Congress must be mindful of the following parameters in fixing the period of extension.<br><br><i>First</i>, the extension cannot be for an indefinite period of time - there must be a definite period fixed by Congress. This interpretation is apparent from the provision in Section 18, Article VII, which states that Congress may extend the proclamation of Martial Law "for a period to be determined by congress." A <i>period</i> is defined as "any point, space, or division of time."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> From Section 18 itself, it is clear that this period must be "<i>determined</i>." That is, the start and end points must be "limited," "fixed," "decided," or "settled" conclusively by Congress.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Otherwise, to effect the extension for an indefinite period would amount to Congress' abdication of the foregoing positive duty imposed upon it by the Constitution.<br><br>Further, the following discussion shows that prior to the approval of Fr. Bernas' amendment, Commissioner Suarez suggested a fixed period for the extension, supposedly to protect the interest of the citizens:<br><blockquote>MR. SUAREZ: x x x.<br><br>May we suggest that on line 7, between the words "same" and "if," we insert the phrase FOR A PERIOD OF NOT MORE THAN SIXTY DAYS, which would equal the initial period for the first declaration just so it will keep on going.<br><br>THE PRESIDENT: What does the Committee say?<br><br>MR. REGALADO: May we request a clarification from Commissioner Suarez on this proposed amendment? This extension is already a joint act upon the initiative of the President and with the concurrence of Congress. It is assumed that they have already agreed not only on the fact of extension but on the period of extension. <b>If we put it at 60 days only, then thereafter, they have to meet again to agree jointly on a further extension.</b><br><br>MR. SUAREZ: <b>That is precisely intended to safeguard the interests and protect the lives of citizens.</b><br><br>MR. REGALADO: In the first situation where the President declares martial law, there had to be a prescribed period because there was no initial concurrence requirement. And if there was no concurrence, the martial law period ends at 60 days. Thereafter, if they intend to extend the same suspension of the privilege of the writ or the proclamation of martial law, it is upon the initiative of the President this time, and with the prior concurrence of Congress. So, the period of extension has already been taken into account by both the Executive and the Legislative, unlike the first situation where the President acted alone without prior concurrence. The reason for the limitation in the first does not apply to the extension.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> (Emphases supplied)<br></blockquote>The 60-day period, however, was not approved for its perceived impracticality. Nevertheless, the commissioners did not disagree on the validity of the point made by Commissioner Suarez that there must be a fixed period. This was apparently the reason why Fr. Bernas did not negate the need for determining or fixing the period when he proposed his amendment, which was subsequently approved by the body. Only, the amendment specified Congress as the entity that shall fix the period.<br><br><i>Second</i>, the extension must be for a reasonable period. This is clear from the following deliberations:<br><blockquote>MR. REGALADO: <b>Madam President, following that is the clause "extend the same if the invasion or rebellion shall persist and public safety requires it." That by itself suggests a period within which the suspension shall be extended, if the invasion is still going on.</b> But there is already the cutoff of 60-day period. Do they have to meet all over again and agree to extend the same?<br><br>MR. SUAREZ: That is correct. <b>I think the two of them must have to agree on the period;</b> but it is theoretically possible that when the President writes a note to the Congress, because it would be at the instance of the President that the extension would have to be granted by Congress, it is possible that the period for the extension may be there. It is also possible that it may not be there. <b>That is the reason why we want to make it clear that there must be a reasonable period for the extension.</b> So, if my suggestion is not acceptable to the Committee, may I request that a voting be held on it, Madam President.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> (Emphases supplied)<br></blockquote>The question now is <i>what would make the period of extension reasonable</i>? The term "reasonable" is defined as "fair, proper, just, moderate, suitable under the circumstances."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> It is also to be understood as "rational; governed by reason."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> As can be gathered from the deliberations quoted above, and in light of the definitions provided, the question of reasonableness is closely related to the existence of the two requisites for the exercise of the authority to extend - that the invasion or rebellion persists, and public safety requires it. That is, there must be a rational match between the existence of the two requisites and the period of extension.<br><br>Therefore, to come up with a reasonable period, Congress has to conduct an independent investigation and evaluation of the persistence of invasion or rebellion and the requirement of public safety. Admittedly, there must be due consideration of what is happening on the ground, which is possible only if Congress is in close coordination with the President. It is in this manner that the determination of the period of extension remains a joint judgment of the President and Congress. It was acknowledged during the deliberations that the President has the most accurate idea of how long it would take to quell the persisting invasion or rebellion and secure the public. For Congress to conduct its own investigation of the matter would necessitate consulting the Chief Executive.<br><br>Nevertheless, a close coordination with the President does not amount to a blind submission to him - rather, Congress has to independently determine the length of extension, so that it can even reduce or increase the period proposed by the President. The following deliberations are enlightening:<br><blockquote>MR. DAVIDE: I would like to propose that instead of "AT THE INSTANCE OF," we use UPON THE PETITION OF. It will be upon the petition of the President to confirm the fact that any extension is just a matter of his request, not his prerogative.<br><br>THE PRESIDENT: Not on his own initiative?<br><br>MR. DAVIDE: No, not on his own initiative, Madam President. MR. AZCUNA: I believe the word "petition" is more proper for the courts, Madam President. <b>Maybe with the intention put on the record that this is not mandatory upon Congress to grant an extension simply because the President is requesting it</b>, I am willing to change it to INITIATIVE instead of "INSTANCE" but not "PETITION" because "petition" has more relevance to courts. So it will be "UPON THE INITIATIVE of the President."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>x x x x<br><br>MR. OPLE: May I just pose a question to the Committee in connection with the Suarez amendment? Earlier, Commissioner Regalado said that that point was going to be a collective judgment between the President and the Congress. <b>Are we departing from that now in favor of giving Congress the plenipotentiary power to determine the period?</b><br><br>FR. BERNAS: <b>Not really, Madam President, because Congress would be doing this in consultation with the President, and the President would be outvoted by about 300 Members.</b><br><br>MR.

PADILLA: According to Commissioner Concepcion, our former Chief Justice, the declaration of martial law or the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> is essentially an executive act. If that be so, and especially under the following clause: "if the invasion or rebellion shall persist and public safety requires it," I do not see why the period must be determined by the Congress. We are turning a purely executive act to a legislative act.<br><br>FR. BERNAS: I would believe what the former Chief Justice said about the initiation being essentially an executive act, but what follows after the initiation is something that is participated in by Congress.<br><br>MR. CONCEPCION: If I may add a word. <b>The one who will do the fighting is the executive but, of course, it is expected that if the Congress wants to extend, it will extend for the duration of the fighting. If the fighting goes on, I do not think it is fair to assume that the Congress will refuse to extend the period, especially since in this matter the Congress must act at the instance of the executive. He is the one who is supposed to know how long it will take him to fight. Congress may reduce it, but that is without prejudice to his asking for another extension, if necessary.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> (Emphases supplied)<br></blockquote>Ultimately, Congress must be able to clearly demonstrate the reasonableness of the period in its resolution approving the extension and fixing the period thereof.<br><br><b><i>Judicial Power of Review of Martial Law Extension and the Period Thereof</i></b><br><br>The third paragraph of Section18, Article VII of the Constitution, provides that the sufficiency of the factual basis for the extension of Martial Law may be reviewed by the Court:<br><blockquote>The Supreme Court may review, in an appropriate proceeding filed by any citizen, the sufficiency of the factual basis of the proclamation of martial law or the suspension of the privilege of the writ <b>or the extension thereof</b>, and must promulgate its decision thereon within thirty days from its filing. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>As can be gleaned from the discussions above, the extension of a proclamation of Martial Law necessarily entails a determination of the period of its extension. Therefore, the Court's exercise of its review power is not limited to a resolution of the factual sufficiency of the extension <i>per se</i>. That power likewise includes a review of the sufficiency of the factual basis of the period of extension.<br><br>While the question that faces the Court is whether or not such period is reasonable, this question can be answered through an examination of the factual basis of the extension <i>per se</i>.<br><br>Specifically, the Court has to look into the public safety element - whether the period fixed is commensurate with the necessity of public safety. This determination essentially involves a calibration exercise as previously discussed. Therefore, in the same way that this duty inevitably requires a delineation of the areas to be validly covered by Martial Law,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> the Court also has the duty to determine the length of period necessary to quell the existing threat to public safety. There must be a calibration based on the proportionality of the danger at hand to the period of extension. As a result, the Court may do one of three things: affirm the period fixed by Congress, extend it, or shorten it.<br><br><b><i>Burden of Proof</i></b><br><br><i>Lagman v. Medialdea</i> established that the President carried the burden of proof to show that there was sufficient factual basis for the proclamation of Martial Law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> The Court ruled that "the President satisfactorily discharged his burden of proof. After all, what the President needs to satisfy is only the standard of probable cause for a valid declaration of Martial Law and suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>As discussed above, the extension of the period of effectivity of the declaration of Martial Law and the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> is a joint executive-legislative act. The Constitution has vested both the President and Congress with the power of extending the Martial Law period, with the President initiating it and Congress actually extending or not extending the period. The President provides Congress with the necessary factual basis to justify his request for the extension of the Martial Law period. Congress must then assess the sufficiency of the factual basis. Both the executive and the legislative branches of Government bear the burden of proving the sufficiency of the factual basis.<br><br>In response to petitioners' claim that the President bears the burden of proving the sufficiency of the factual basis for the Martial Law extension, respondents argue that petitioners are the ones who must prove that rebellion has already been completely quelled. According to respondents, the Court in <i>Lagman v. Medialdea</i> has already ruled that rebellion exists in Mindanao and, following the doctrine of conclusiveness of judgment, the resolution of the instant case must be confined to the issue of whether or not the rebellion has been completely quelled.<br><br>In effect, respondents argue that instead of them proving that rebellion persists, the burden of proof has already shifted to petitioners to show that rebellion no longer exists.<br><br>That contention is erroneous.<br><br>To justify the extension of the period of Martial Law, the Constitution provides two requisites: (1) invasion or rebellion persists, and (2) public safety requires it. The persistence of rebellion is a factual issue that must be proven. The initial proclamation of Martial Law is distinct from its extension, and respondents cannot base their claim of the existence of rebellion merely on <i>Lagman v. Medialdea</i>. Certainly, <i>Lagman</i> was decided based on the circumstances surrounding the time of the initial proclamation of Martial Law. That actual rebellion was found to have existed then does not automatically lead to a conclusion that rebellion still persisted at the time the period was extended.<br><br>Furthermore, respondents cannot shift the burden of proof to petitioners. As held by Justice Caguioa in his Dissenting Opinion in <i>Lagman v. Medialdea</i>:<br><blockquote>[C]onsidering that the declaration of martial law and suspension of the privilege of the writ can only be validly made upon the concurrence of the requirements of the Constitution, the very act of declaration of martial law or suspension of the privilege of the writ <b>already constitutes a positive assertion</b> by the Executive <b>that the constitutional requirements have been met - one which it is in the best position to substantiate. To require the citizen to prove a lack or insufficiency of factual basis is an undue shifting of the burden of proof that is clearly not the intendment of the framers</b>. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>In fine, it can be concluded that the burden of proof remains with the Government. For purposes of fulfilling the constitutional requirements of a valid declaration of Martial Law and its extension, the burden of proof never shifts to petitioners. It is the constitutional duty of the Government to show that the requirements of the Constitution have been met.<br><br><b><i>Abandonment of the Permissive Approach</i></b><br><br>In my Dissenting Opinion in <i>Lagman v. Medialdea</i>, I espoused a permissive approach in weighing the evidence or drawing from interpretative sources. I adopted that approach considering that this was the first post-Marcos examination of Martial Law undertaken by the Court under the 1987 Constitution. No rule or jurisprudence existed then that sufficiently guided the President in crafting the Martial Law proclamation under the present Constitution.<br><br>Pursuant to this permissive approach, I examined the available evidence more closely in order to understand what the correct description of the realities in Mindanao should have been - beyond what was described in Proclamation No. 216, the President's Report to Congress, and the Comment of the Office of the Solicitor General filed before this Court.<br><br>After adopting the permissive approach, I concluded that Martial Law was valid not only in Marawi City, but in the entire province of Lanao del Sur, as well as in the provinces of Maguindanao and Sulu.<br><br>It is important, however, to emphasize that the application of the permissive approach was <i>pro hac vice</i> in view of the paucity of rules and jurisprudence to guide an evidentiary determination of the sufficiency of the factual basis for the declaration of Martial Law and the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>. Considering the views expressed in <i>Lagman v. Medialdea</i>, a permissive approach in considering the evidence in this <span style="font-style: italic;">sui generis</span> proceeding cannot remain to be the rule.<br><br>Allow me to point out that contrary to the majority's position in <i>Lagman v. Medialdea</i> that they are unable to rule on the appropriate coverage of Martial Law, I was able to demonstrate in my dissent that it was possible for this Court to undertake an <b>independent factual review of the coverage of Martial Law</b>. While I agree that the Court could recognize the unique fact-finding capabilities of the executive department, it did not follow that the conclusions derived by the President from these facts were to be adopted blindly by this Court. Rather, the Court should have been able to arrive at an independent conclusion after a careful review of the facts provided.<br><br>In the Resolution dated 5 December 2017 in <i>Lagman v. Medialdea</i>, the majority dabbled in surmises and conjectures by saying that "there is always a possibility that the rebellion and other accompanying hostilities will spill over."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Behind a sweeping generalization that "martial law is a flexible concept,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> the majority opinion posited that the precise extent or range of the rebellion and the public safety requirement could not be measured by exact metes and bounds.<br><br>However, this is not really the case. The elements of actual rebellion and public safety are inflexible requirements for the declaration of Martial Law and the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>. They also provide a sufficient guide for this Court to determine the sufficiency of the factual basis for that declaration.<br><br>Worse than the Court's act of effectively abdicating its duty to fully review the President's action under Article VII, Section 18 of the Constitution, is its failure to lay down parameters for the future review of the President's same or similar actions. Weak, sweeping statements today can encourage their misuse as precedents in future cases.<br><br><b><i>Factual Basis for the Extension of Martial Law in Mindanao</i></b><br><br>In Resolution of Both Houses (RBH) No. 4 dated 13 December 2017,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> the Congress of the Philippines determined that rebellion persists, and that public safety indubitably requires the further extension of Proclamation No. 216<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> declaring a state of Martial Law and the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> in the whole of Mindanao.

These acts resulted in the killing of 8 civilians, 3 of whom were beheaded.<br><br></li><li>In 2017, the NPA perpetrated at least 385 atrocities in Mindanao, which resulted in 41 killed and 62 wounded in action on the part of the government forces. These incidents also resulted in the killing of 23 and the wounding of 6 other civilians. The most recent incident was the ambush on 9 November 2017 that resulted in the killing of 1 and wounding of 3 Philippine National Police (PNP) personnel, as well as in the killing of a four-month-old infant and the wounding of 2 other civilians.<br><br></li><li>Apart from perpetrating these atrocities, the NPA also committed at least 59 arson incidents in Mindanao targeting businesses and private establishments and destroying an estimated P2.2 billion worth of properties. The most significant attacks were launched against the Lapanday Food Corporation in Davao City on 9 April 2017 and the Mil-Oro Mining and Frasec Ventures Corporation in Mati City, Davao Oriental, on 6 May 2017, resulting in the destruction of properties valued at P1.85 billion and P109 million, respectively.<br><br></li><li>These activities of the NPA constrained the President to issue Proclamation No. 360<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> on 23 November 2017 declaring the termination of peace negotiations with the Communist Party of the Philippines-New People's Army-National Democratic Front (CPP­ NPA-NDF).<br><br></li><li>On 5 December 2017, the President issued Proclamation No. 374<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> declaring the CPP-NPA-NDF a designated/identified terrorist organization under Republic Act No. (R.A.) 10168 (The Terrorism Financing Prevention and Suppression Act of 2012). The presidential proclamation was coupled with a directive to the Secretary of Justice to file a petition in the appropriate court praying that the CPP-NPA­ NDF be proscribed for being a terrorist organization under R.A. 9372 (Human Security Act of 2007).<br></li></ol>The request of the President to the Congress was prompted by the letter dated 4 December 2017 from Secretary of National Defense Delfin N. Lorenzana. The latter recommended "the extension of Martial Law for another 12 months or 1 year beginning January 1, 2018 until December 31, 2018 covering the whole island of Mindanao primarily to ensure total eradication of DAESH-inspired Da'awatul Islamiyah Waliyatul Masriq (DIWM), other like-minded Local/Foreign Terrorist Groups (L/FTGs) and Armed Lawless Groups (ALGs), and the communist terrorists (CTs) and their coddlers, supporters and financiers, and to ensure speedy rehabilitation, recovery and reconstruction efforts in Marawi, and the attainment of lasting peace, stability, economic development and prosperity in Mindanao."<br><br>Secretary Lorenzana indicated that the armed struggle in Mindanao was still relatively strong. He emphasized that the proposed extension would significantly help not only the AFP but also other stakeholders in quelling the ongoing DAESH-inspired DIWM groups. He also said that the extension would help put an end to the rebellion being staged by communist terrorists, as well as in restoring public order, safety and stability in Mindanao.<br><br>Secretary Lorenzana attached the letter of General Guerrero, who was also recommending the extension for compelling reasons based on "current" security assessment. The latter added the following information in support of his request for the extension of the declaration of Martial Law and the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>:<br><ol><li>The remnants of the groups of Hapilon and the Maute brothers, with the help of their sympathizers and supporters, are still capable of strengthening their organization in preparation for the conduct of more hostilities in the Lanao provinces and other vulnerable areas in Mindanao.<br><br></li><li>The Turaifie Group is undertaking propaganda to show that it is still a capable force to be reckoned with.<br><br></li><li>The BIFF is still equipped with 388 manpower and 328 firearms.<br><br></li><li>Mindanao, particularly Eastern Mindanao, continues to be the hotbed of communist insurgency and accounts for 47% of the total manpower, 48% of firearms, 51% of the affected <i>barangays</i> and 45% of guerrilla fronts nationwide.<br><br></li><li>Of the 14 active provinces in terms of communist insurgency, 10 are in Mindanao.<br><br></li><li>The Komisyon Mindanao (KOMMID) of the Communists Terrorists is now capable of sending augmentation forces, particularly party cadres, to Northern Luzon.<br><br></li><li>The infiltration, recruitment, indoctrination and political mobilization of indigenous peoples (IP) remain unabated with the support of party organizers from the urban areas.<br><br></li><li>The ASG is currently holding nine kidnap victims in captivity.<br></li></ol>In all, General Guerrero offered the following as justification for the recommended extension:<br><blockquote>1. The DAESH-inspired DIWM groups and allies continue to visibly offer armed resistance in other parts of Central, Western and Eastern Mindanao in spite of the neutralization of their key leaders and destruction of their forces in Marawi City;<br><br>2. Other DAESH-inspired and like-minded threat groups such as the BIFF, AKP, DI-Maguid, DI-Toraype, and the ASG remain capable of staging similar atrocities and violent attacks against vulnerable targets in Mindanao, including the cities of Davao, Cagayan De Oro, General Santos, Zamboanga and Cotabato;<br><br>3. The CTs have been pursuing and intensifying their political mobilization (army, party and mass-base building; rallies, pickets, and demonstrations; financial and logistical build-up), terrorism against innocent civilians and private entities, and guerrilla warfare against the security sector, and public and government infrastructures;<br><br>4. The need to intensify the campaign against the CTs is necessary in order to defeat their strategy, stop their extortion, defeat their armed component, and to stop their recruitment activities;<br><br>5. The threats being posed by the CTs, the ASG, and the presence of remnants, protectors, supporters and sympathizers of the DAESH/DIWM pose a clear and imminent danger to public safety and hinders the speedy rehabilitation, recovery and reconstruction efforts in Marawi City, and the attainment of lasting peace, stability, economic development and prosperity in Mindanao;<br><br>6. The 2<sup>nd</sup> extension of the implementation of Martial Law coupled with the continued suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> in Mindanao will significantly help not only the AFP, but also the other stakeholders in quelling and putting an end to the on-going DAESH-inspired DIWM groups and CT-staged rebellion, and in restoring public order, safety, and stability in Mindanao; and<br><br>7. In seeking another extension, the AFP is ready, willing and able to perform anew its mandated task in the same manner that it had dutifully done so for the whole duration of Martial Law to date, without any reported human rights violation and/or incidents of abuse of authority.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br></blockquote><b><i>Analysis of the Factual Claims of the Government</i></b><br><br>In <i>Lagman v. Medialdea</i>, the majority observed there was no question that there was an armed public uprising in Marawi City. The only contention of the petitioners therein was that the armed hostilities did not constitute rebellion in the absence of the element of a culpable political purpose.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> Their argument was found to be unmeritorious in view of the conclusion of the Court that the President had sufficient factual basis tending to show that actual rebellion existed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>Under Section 18, Article VII of the Constitution, an extension of the declaration of Martial Law and the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> may be made by Congress, upon the initiative of the President, for a period to be determined by it if the invasion or rebellion persists and public safety requires it.<br><br>Thus, the question posed to this Court in the instant cases is whether or not rebellion persists and public safety requires the extension.<br><br>Considering the facts alluded to by the President, Secretary of Defense Lorenzana, General Guerrero, and ultimately Congress, the answer is no. Their pronouncements in fact show that there is no armed public uprising that justifies the conclusion that rebellion persists.<br><br>With respect to RBH No. 4, the fact that the rebel groups have "continued to rebuild their organization through recruitment and training of new members and fighters to carry on the rebellion,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> or that the Turaifie Group was "monitored to be planning to conduct bombings,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> or that the remnants of the ASG "remain a serious security concern"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> shows that there is no armed public uprising or taking up of arms against the Government. At most, what the facts show is that there is danger of an armed public uprising that may turn out to be imminent.<br><br>The President can always call on the armed forces to suppress an imminent danger of rebellion. The deliberation of the Constitutional Commission is clear in this regard:<br><blockquote>FR. BERNAS: Let me just say that when the Committee decided to remove that, it was for the reason that the phrase "OR IMMINENT DANGER THEREOF" could cover a multitude of sins and could be a source of a tremendous amount of irresistible temptation. And so, to better protect the liberties of the people, we preferred to eliminate that. So, we submit it to the body for a vote.<br><br>MR. PADILLA: I would just like to state that the term OR IMMINENT DANGER THEREOF appears in the 1935 and 1973 Constitutions and it has not even resulted in a multitude of sins, temptations nor confusion.<br><br>THE PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bengzon): Will Commissioner de Castro speak in favor of the amendment?<br><br>MR. DE CASTRO: I am in favor of the amendment.<br><br>THE PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bengzon): Commissioner de Castro is recognized.<br><br>MR. DE CASTRO: Section 15 speaks of actual rebellion and actual invasion, if we eliminate "OR IMMINENT DANGER THEREOF." When there is already actual invasion or rebellion, the President no longer suspends the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> because we already have actual shooting. There is nothing more to be remedied by the Chief Executive. But when we put the words "OR IMMINENT DANGER THEREOF," perhaps they are still assembling; they are still preparing for their departure or their provisions for immediate rebellion. The Chief Executive then has the power to suspend the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>, but with the situation I mentioned there is nothing more to suspend.<br><br>MR. REGALADO: Mr. Presiding Officer.<br><br>THE PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bengzon): Commissioner Regalado is recognized.<br><br>MR. RAMA: Mr. Presiding Officer.<br><br>THE PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bengzon): The Floor Leader is recognized.<br><br>MR. REGALADO: I yield to the Floor Leader.<br><br>MR. RAMA: I ask that Commissioner Concepcion be recognized.<br><br>THE PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bengzon): Commissioner Concepcion is recognized.<br><br>MR. CONCEPCION: <b>The elimination of the phrase "IN CASE OF IMMINENT DANGER THEREOF" is due to the fact that the President may call the Armed Forces to prevent or suppress invasion, rebellion or insurrection. That dispenses with the need of suspending the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus.</b> References have been made to the 1935 and 1973 Constitutions. The 1935 Constitution was based on the provisions of the Jones Law of 1916 and the Philippine Bill of 1902 which granted the American Governor General, as representative of the government of the United States, the right to avail of the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> or the proclamation of martial law in the event of imminent danger. And President Quezon, when the 1935 Constitution was in the process of being drafted, claimed that he should not be denied a right given to the American Governor General as if he were less than the American Governor General. But he overlooked the fact that under the Jones Law and the Philippine Bill of 1902, we were colonies of the United States, so the Governor General was given an authority, on behalf of the sovereign, over the territory under the sovereignty of the United States. Now, there is no more reason for the inclusion of the phrase "OR IMMINENT DANGER THEREOF" in connection with the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>. As a matter of fact, the very Constitution of the United States does not mention "imminent danger." In lieu of that, there is a provision on the authority of the President as Commander-in-Chief to call the Armed Forces to prevent or suppress rebellion or invasion and, therefore, "imminent danger" is already included there.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>The 15 violent incidents allegedly committed by the BIFF during the Martial Law period have not been described with sufficient particularity as to enable this Court to conclude that an armed public uprising with a culpable political purpose has been mounted by the BIFF against government forces. More important, these alleged violent incidents during the Martial Law period do not by themselves justify the extension.<br><br>Neither does the letter of the President dated 8 December 2017 point to the fact that an armed public uprising is still underway. He reported that at least 185 persons who had been sought to be arrested during Martial Law remained at large and, "in all probability, are presently regrouping and consolidating their forces."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> He also stated that "Turaifie is said to be Hapilon's potential successor as Amir of DAESH Wilayat in the Philippines and Southeast Asia."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> There is enough speculation in these statements to conclude that the Government is not even sure about the gravity of the threats that these "remnants" might pose. An impression of a foreboding rebellion is also given by the statement that "[t]heir activities are geared towards the conduct of intensified atrocities and armed public uprisings in support of their objective of establishing the foundation of a global Islamic caliphate and of a Wilayat not only in the Philippines but also in the whole of Southeast Asia."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br>The President has alluded to 89 violent incidents initiated by the BIFF and 43 acts of terrorism committed by the ASG last year. Aside from the fact that these violent incidents and acts of terrorism have not been described with sufficient particularity, there is a clear possibility that most of them have already been cited as justification for the President's original proclamation of Martial Law and suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> and likewise for Congress' approval of the first extension.<br><br>That rebellion is potentially imminent is also shown by the letter of General Guerrero. He states that the remnants of the groups of Hapilon and the Maute brothers are "still capable of strengthening their organization with the help of their sympathizers and supporters in preparing for the conduct of more hostilities in the Lanao provinces and other vulnerable areas in Mindanao."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> Notably, the Turaifie Group is not even mounting an armed uprising, as it is merely undertaking "propaganda to show that it is still a capable force to be reckoned with."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br>That the BIFF is still equipped with 388 manpower and 328 firearms or that the ASG currently has nine kidnap victims held in captivity, while absolutely deplorable, cannot justify the extension of Martial Law and the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>. While the BIFF may be armed, the statement fails to show that the firearms are being used for the conduct of a public uprising coupled with a culpable political purpose. It is also difficult to see the culpable political purpose behind the kidnap of nine innocent civilians.<br><br><b><i>The Inclusion of the CPP-NPA-NDF</i></b><br><br>It is clear from the letter of the President that the "decades-long rebellion" of the NPA had very little to do with the uprising of the DAESH­ inspired DIWM, and whatever connection there was consisted mainly of their similarity in geographical location.<br><br>The Solicitor General believes otherwise. He posits that the CPP-NPA rebellion was already included as a ground for the declaration of Martial Law and the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> in Proclamation No. 216, as well as in the request to Congress for the first extension:<br><blockquote><b>JUSTICE CARPIO:</b><br><br>Thank you.

According to him, the NPA was not categorically identified in view of the then ongoing peace talks with the CPP-NPA-NDF:<br><blockquote><b>JUSTICE TIJAM:</b> Considering that the government made mentioned [sic] of the NPA rebels as one of the reasons for asking for the extension of martial law, this does not seem to fall within the ambit of the word persist since the original declaration was made on the basis of the rebellion committed by the Maute in Mindanao and no mentioned [sic] whatsoever was made of the NPA?<br><br><b>SOLICITOR GENERAL CALIDA:</b> Actually, there's a phrase there, Your Honor, that will include the NPA in the proclamation of the President, Proclamation No. 216, there's a phrase there which says, 'of other rebels.' And because there [were] peace negotiations during that time as a matter of comity and to the other party, the NPA was not explicitly included there but if you read the entire contents of the letter of the President and the proclamation of the President, Your Honor, it is very clear that all rebels including NPA which has waged the longest time of rebellion in the Philippines they are included there. In fact, Your Honor, in the recommendation of the Chief of Staff the NPA was explicitly mentioned in that recommendation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br></blockquote>Even if we were to accept the argument that the atrocities of the NPA were already included among the grounds justifying the issuance of Proclamation No. 216, the reality is that when the Court upheld the sufficiency of the factual basis for the declaration of Martial Law and the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> in <i>Lagman v. Medialdea</i>, no facts involving the NPA were examined by this Court for the determination of probable cause or of evidence showing that, more likely than not, a rebellion had been committed or was being committed.<br><br>Clearly, for the purposes of the Court in <i>Lagman v. Medialdea</i>, Proclamation No. 216 did not include the "decades-long rebellion" of the NPA as factual basis.<br><br>Thus, for the Court now to determine that rebellion "persists," it can only do so by answering the question of whether or not the rebellion of the ISIS-inspired Maute Group or of the DAESH-inspired DIWM persists. The addition of a new actor as factual basis for arguing that a rebellion persists is self-contradictory and cannot be accepted.<br><br>Whether "defanged" or not, the present extension of the period of effectivity of the declaration of Martial Law and the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> has not been shown to be necessary for public safety. Petitioners are more than justified in reminding this Court and respondents of the lessons of Martial Law past.<br><br><b>Accordingly</b>, I vote to declare that there is <b>no sufficient factual basis for the extension</b> of the period of effectivity of the declaration of Martial Law and the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> in the whole of Mindanao, and that Resolution of Both Houses No. 4 dated 13 December 2017 should be struck down as <b>unconstitutional</b>.<br><br><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="noshade" align="LEFT"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Decision, p. 34.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Id. at 57-59.

Milligan who was charged with acts of disloyalty and faced trial before a military commission in Indiana during the civil war. He was found guilty on all charges and sentenced to death by hanging. He then sought release through <i>habeas corpus</i> from a federal court. While trials of civilians by presidentially created military commissions were invalidated, the US Supreme Court recognized martial law as a necessary substitute for the civil authority in the theater of active military operations, thus:<br><blockquote>It follows from what has been said on this subject that there are occasions when martial rule can be properly applied. If, in foreign invasion or civil war, the courts are actually closed, and it is impossible to administer criminal justice according to law, <i>then</i>, on the theat[er] of active military operations, where war really prevails, <b>there is a necessity to furnish a substitute for the civil authority, thus overthrown, to preserve the safety of the army and society, and as no power is left but the military, it is allowed to govern by martial rule until the laws can have their free course</b>. As necessity creates the rule, so it limits its duration, for, if this government is continued <i>after</i> the courts are reinstated, it is a gross usurpation of power. Martial rule can never exist where the courts are open and in the proper and unobstructed exercise of their jurisdiction. It is also confined to the locality of actual war.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>This pronouncement of the US Supreme Court has no application in this jurisdiction because <i>Ex Parte Milligan</i> conflicts with the Philippine Constitution.

Contrary to the theory of petitioners, the clause "nor supplant the functioning of the civil courts or legislative assemblies" already precludes the "existence of a vacuum in civilian authority in a theater of war."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Not even the phrase "conferment of jurisdiction on military courts and agencies over civilians where civil courts are able to function" can serve as basis for the military to immediately acquire jurisdiction. Under Section 2, Article VIII of the Constitution, "Congress shall have the power to define, prescribe, and apportion the jurisdiction of various courts." Applied to military courts, this means that Congress needs to enact a law vesting military courts with jurisdiction. In other words, a state of martial law does not ipso facto confer jurisdiction on military courts over civilians. Rather, the conferment comes from Congress through a separate law.<br><br>During the oral arguments, I made the same clarification on the inapplicability of <i>Ex Parte Milligan</i>, thus:<br><blockquote>JUSTICE CARPIO:<br><br>Okay. x x x <i>Ex Parte Milligan</i> x x x.

Literally and without need of constitutional construction, the word "persist" means the continued existence of the same invasion or rebellion when martial law was initially proclaimed or the privilege of the writ was initially suspended.

Medialdea on 23 May 2017, clearly identifies the "Maute group" as the rebel group who committed the crime of rebellion by "rising (publicly) and taking arms against the [g]overnment for the purpose of removing from the allegiance to said [g]overnment." The pertinent paragraphs of Proclamation No. 216 read:<br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br>WHEREAS, Section 18 Article VII of the Constitution provides that "x x x In case of invasion or rebellion, when the public safety requires it, he (the President) may, for a period not exceeding sixty days, suspend the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> or place the Philippines or any part thereof under martial law x x x";<br><br>WHEREAS, Article 134 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.A.

In other words, the twin requirements of actual rebellion or invasion, and public safety imposed on the initial proclamation and suspension are continuing requirements for any subsequent extension of the proclamation or suspension. As aptly put by the petitioners, "what persists must be actual."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>By issuing Joint Resolution No. 4, the House of Representatives and the Senate adopted the justification of the President in extending Proclamation No. 216. The Letter dated 8 December 2017 of President Duterte to Congress reads in pertinent part:<br><blockquote>First, despite the death of Hapilon and the Maute brothers, the <b>remnants of their Groups</b> have continued to rebuild their organization through the recruitment and training of new members and fighters to carry on the rebellion. x x x<br><br>More specifically, the <b>remnants of the DAESH-inspired DIWM members</b> and their allies, together with their protectors, supporters and sympathizers, have been monitored in their continued efforts towards radicalization/recruitment, financial and logistical build-up, as well as their consolidation/reorganization in Central Mindanao. x x x<br><br>Second, the Turafie Group has likewise been monitored to be <b>planning to conduct</b> bombings, notably targeting the Cotabato area. x x x<br><br>Third, the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) continue to defy the government by perpetrating at least fifteen (15) violent incidents during the Martial Law period in Maguinadao and North Cotabato. x x x<br><br>Fourth, the <b>remnants of the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG)</b> in Basilan, Sulu, Tawi-Tawi, and Zamboanga Peninsula remain as a serious security concern. x x x<br><br>x x x x<br><br>x x x Public safety indubitably requires such further extension, not only for the sake of security and public order, but more importantly to enable the government and the people of Mindanao <b>to pursue the bigger task of rehabilitation</b> and the promotion of a stable socio-economic growth and development.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Respondents cannot rely on the <b>capability</b> of the remnants of the defeated rebels to deprive duly constituted authorities of their powers as a justification for the extension of the state of martial law or suspension of the privilege of the writ. To emphasize, <b>capability</b> to rebel, <b>absent an actual rebellion or invasion</b>, is not a ground to extend the declaration of martial law or suspension of the privilege of the writ. To allow martial law on the basis of an imminent danger or threat would unlawfully reinstate the ground of "imminent danger" of rebellion or invasion, a ground that was intentionally removed from the 1987 Constitution. This is a gross violation of the clear letter and intent of the Constitution, as gleaned from the following deliberations of the Constitutional Commission:<br><blockquote>Mr. de los Reyes. As I see it now, the <b>Committee envisions actual rebellion and no longer imminent rebellion</b>. Does the Committee mean that there should be actual shooting or actual attack on the legislature or Malacañang, for example?

Strict compliance with Section 18, Article VII of the Constitution is imperative because the provision distinguishes the initial proclamation or suspension from the subsequent extension. The former can only last for a period not exceeding 60 days, while the duration of the latter is subject to the discretion of Congress. <b>By belatedly invoking the NPA rebellion as factual basis for the extension of Proclamation No. 216, the government effectively circumvented the temporal limitation set by the Constitution that the initial proclamation of martial law or suspension of the privilege of the writ can only last for 60 days.</b> Worse, the extension set a maximum period of one year.<br><br>When the Court reviewed in <i>Lagman v. Medialdea</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> the sufficiency of the factual basis of Proclamation No. 216, the Court ruled in the affirmative on the sole basis of the Maute rebellion, to wit:<br><blockquote>After the assessment by the President of the aforementioned facts, he arrived at the following conclusions, as mentioned in Proclamation No. 216 and the Report:<br><br>1) The <b>Maute Group</b> is "openly attempting to remove from the allegiance to the Philippine Government this part of Mindanao and deprive the Chief Executive of his powers and prerogatives to enforce the laws of the land and to maintain public order and safety in Mindanao, constituting the crime of rebellion."<br><br>2) "[L]awless armed groups have taken up arms and committed public uprising against the duly constituted government and against the people of Mindanao, for the purpose of removing Mindanao - starting with the City of Marawi, Lanao del Sur - from its allegiance to the Government and its laws and depriving the Chief Executive of his powers and prerogatives to enforce the laws of the land and to maintain public order and safety in Mindanao, to the great damage, prejudice, and detriment of the people therein and the nation as a whole."<br><br>3) The May 23, 2017 events "put on public display the groups' clear intention to establish an <b>Islamic State</b> and their capability to deprive the duly constituted authorities the President, foremost - of their powers and prerogatives."<br><br>4) "These activities constitute not simply a display of force, but a clear attempt to establish the groups' seat of power in Marawi City for their planned establishment of a <b>DAESH</b> wilayat or province covering the entire Mindanao."<br><br>5) "The cutting of vital lines for transportation and power; the recruitment of young Muslims to further expand their ranks and strengthen their force; the armed consolidation of their members throughout Marawi City; the decimation of a segment of the city population who resist; and the brazen display of DAESH flags constitute a clear, pronounced, and unmistakable intent to remove Marawi City, and eventually the rest of Mindanao, from its allegiance to the Government."<br><br>6) "There exists no doubt that lawless armed groups are attempting to deprive the President of his power, authority, and prerogatives within Marawi City as a precedent to spreading their control over the entire Mindanao, in an attempt to undermine his control over executive departments, bureaus, and offices in said area; defeat his mandate to ensure that all laws are faithfully executed; and remove his supervisory powers over local governments."<br><br>7) "Law enforcement and other government agencies now face pronounced difficulty sending their reports to the Chief Executive due to the city-wide power outages. Personnel from the BJMP have been prevented from performing their functions. Through the attack and occupation of several hospitals, medical services in Marawi City have been adversely affected. The bridge and road blockades set up by the groups effectively deprive the government of its ability to deliver basic services to its citizens. Troop reinforcements have been hampered, preventing the government from restoring peace and order in the area. Movement by both civilians and government personnel to and from the city is likewise hindered."<br><br>8) "The taking up of arms by lawless armed groups in the area, with support being provided by foreign-based terrorists and illegal drug money, and their blatant acts of defiance which embolden other armed groups in Mindanao, have resulted in the deterioration of public order and safety in Marawi City; they have likewise compromised the security of the entire Island of Mindanao."<br><br>9) "Considering the network and alliance-building activities among terrorist groups, local criminals, and lawless armed men, the siege of Marawi City is a vital cog in attaining their long-standing goal: absolute control over the entirety of Mindanao. These circumstances demand swift and decisive action to ensure the safety and security of the Filipino people and preserve our national integrity."<br><br>Thus, the President deduced from the facts available to him that there was an armed public uprising, the culpable purpose of which was to remove from the allegiance to the Philippine Government a portion of its territory and to deprive the Chief Executive of any of his powers and prerogatives, leading the President to believe that there was probable cause that the crime of rebellion was and is being committed and that public safety requires the imposition of martial law and suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus. [Emphasis supplied]<br></blockquote>Similarly, when the Court examined the impact of the rebellion on public safety, the Court never attributed the acts of violence to the NPA as to warrant the proclamation of martial law or suspension of the privilege of the writ in the whole of Mindanao, thus:<br><blockquote>Invasion or rebellion alone may justify resort to the calling out power but definitely not the declaration of martial law or suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus. For a declaration of martial law or suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus to be valid, there must be a concurrence of actual rebellion or invasion and the public safety requirement. In his Report, the President noted that the <b>acts of violence perpetrated by the ASG and the Maute Group were directed not only against government forces or establishments but likewise against civilians and their properties</b>. In addition and in relation to the armed hostilities, bomb threats were issued; road blockades and checkpoints were set up; schools and churches were burned; civilian hostages were taken and killed; non-Muslims or Christians were targeted; young male Muslims were forced to join their group; medical services and delivery of basic services were hampered; reinforcements of government troops and civilian movement were hindered; and the security of the entire Mindanao Island was compromised.<br><br>These particular scenarios convinced the President that the atrocities had already escalated to a level that risked public safety and thus impelled him to declare martial law and suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus. In the last paragraph of his Report, the President declared:<br><blockquote>While the government is presently conducting legitimate operations to address the on-going rebellion, if not the seeds of invasion, public safety necessitates the continued implementation of martial law and the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus in the whole of Mindanao until such time that the rebellion is completely quelled.<br></blockquote>Based on the foregoing, we hold that the parameters for the declaration of martial law and suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus have been properly and fully complied with. Proclamation No. 216 has sufficient factual basis there being probable cause to believe that rebellion exists and that public safety requires the martial law declaration and the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Even the <i> </i> concedes that Proclamation No. 216 did not contemplate the NPA rebellion as factual basis. For one, the NPA merely "took advantage of the situation and intensified their decades-long rebellion against the government and stepped up terrorist attacks x x x, as well as guerilla warfare," all of which suggests that the perceived "intensified" insurgence happened after the issuance of Proclamation No. 216. For another, when Proclamation No. 216 was issued, the government and the NPA were undergoing peace negotiations. Hence, to belatedly expand the factual basis of Proclamation No. 216 as to include the NPA rebellion will violate Section 18, Article VII of the Constitution.<br><br>The <i> </i> holds that the inclusion of the NPA rebellion as basis for the martial law extension is justified because the NPA shares with the DAESH/ISIS-inspired rebels the same purpose of overthrowing the government and inflicts the same degree of violence as in the Marawi siege.<br><br>I disagree.<br><br>Contrary to the holding of the&nbsp;<i></i>mere identity of purpose and capacity for violence between the NPA and the DAESH/ISIS-inspired rebels cannot justify the inclusion of the NPA rebellion as factual basis for the extension of Proclamation No. 216. The Constitution limits the initial martial law declaration or suspension of the privilege of the writ to a period of 60 days. Only when this period is not enough to quell the rebellion can an extension be sought. By citing the NPA rebellion as factual basis for the extension, the government bypassed the mandatory 60-day period prescribed by the Constitution for the initial declaration of martial law and suspension of the privilege of the writ. The government can cite the NPA rebellion as a ground for the imposition of martial law and suspension of the privilege of the writ, but the initial 60-day period prescribed by the Constitution must first be observed before the government can ask for an extension of such emergency measures.<br><br>Neither can the concurrence of Congress with the President cure the unconstitutionality of the extension. The concurrent power of the legislative and the executive to extend the proclamation or suspension is circumscribed by the clause "if the invasion or rebellion shall persist and public safety requires it." To give effect to this clause, paragraph 3, Section 18, Article VII of the Constitution vests the Court with the power to review the sufficiency of the factual basis of the extension. In other words, mere concurrence of the two political branches is not enough. The Court is the final arbiter of the constitutionality of the extension.<br><br><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, I vote to <b>GRANT</b> the petitions in G.R.

I would, however, like to make some additional observations in connection with my concurrence.<br><br>At the threshold of this opinion, I do not find it amiss to note that the Martial Law in Mindanao was extended for the first time up to December 31, 2017. And yet, not one of the petitioners questioned the validity of that extension. This neglect now estops the petitioners from questioning the basis for the presently assailed extension since it is merely a continuation of the extended Martial Law covered by Proclamation No. 216.<br><br>But be that as it may, in <i>Lagman v. Medialdea</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> this Court found that <b>rebellion</b> exists in Mindanao and that public safety requires the exercise of the Martial Law powers. Thus, it concluded that Proclamation No. 216, declaring Martial Law in the region, has sufficient factual basis. This Court held:<br><blockquote>. . . [T]he following facts and/or events were deemed to have been considered by the President in issuing Proclamation No. 216, as plucked from and extant in Proclamation No. 216 itself:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>After the assessment by the President of the aforementioned facts, he arrived at the following conclusions, as mentioned in Proclamation No. 216 and the Report:<br><br>1) The Maute Group is "openly attempting to remove from the allegiance to the Philippine Government this part of Mindanao and deprive the Chief Executive of his powers and prerogatives to enforce the laws of the land and to maintain public order and safety in Mindanao, constituting the crime of rebellion."<br><br>2) "[L]awless armed groups have taken up arms and committed public uprising against the duly constituted government and against the people of Mindanao, for the purpose of removing Mindanao starting with the City of Marawi, Lanao del Sur - from its allegiance to the Government and its laws and depriving the Chief Executive of his powers and prerogatives to enforce the laws of the land and to maintain public order and safety in Mindanao, to the great damage, prejudice, and detriment of the people therein and the nation as a whole."<br><br>3) The May 23, 2017 events "put on public display the groups' clear intention to establish an Islamic State and their capability to deprive the duly constituted authorities the President, foremost - of their powers and prerogatives."<br><br>4) "These activities constitute not simply a display of force, but a clear attempt to establish the groups' seat of power in Marawi City for their planned establishment of a DAESH wilayat or province covering the entire Mindanao."<br><br>5) "The cutting of vital lines for transportation and power; the recruitment of young Muslims to further expand their ranks and strengthen their force; the armed consolidation of their members throughout Marawi City; the decimation of a segment of the city population who resist; and the brazen display of DAESH flags constitute a clear, pronounced, and unmistakable intent to remove Marawi City, and eventually the rest of Mindanao, from its allegiance to the Government."<br><br>6) "There exists no doubt that lawless armed groups are attempting to deprive the President of his power, authority, and prerogatives within Marawi City as a precedent to spreading their control over the entire Mindanao, in an attempt to undermine his control over executive departments, bureaus, and offices in said area; defeat his mandate to ensure that all laws are faithfully executed; and remove his supervisory powers over local governments."<br><br>7) "Law enforcement and other government agencies now face pronounced difficulty sending their reports to the Chief Executive due to the city-wide power outages. Personnel from the BJMP have been prevented from performing their functions. Through the attack and occupation of several hospitals, medical services in Marawi City have been adversely affected. The bridge and road blockades set up by the groups effectively deprive the government of its ability to deliver basic services to its citizens. Troop reinforcements have been hampered, preventing the government from restoring peace and order in the area. Movement by both civilians and government personnel to and from the city is likewise hindered."<br><br>8) "The taking up of arms by lawless armed groups in the area, with support being provided by foreign-based terrorists and illegal drug money, and their blatant acts of defiance which embolden other armed groups in Mindanao, have resulted in the deterioration of public order and safety in Marawi City; they have likewise compromised the security of the entire Island of Mindanao."<br><br>9) "Considering the network and alliance-building activities among terrorist groups, local criminals, and lawless armed men, the siege of Marawi City is a vital cog in attaining their long-standing goal: absolute control over the entirety of Mindanao. These circumstances demand swift and decisive action to ensure the safety and security of the Filipino people and preserve our national integrity."<br><br>Thus, the President deduced from the facts available to him that there was an armed public uprising, the culpable purpose of which was to remove from the allegiance to the Philippine Government a portion of its territory and to deprive the Chief Executive of any of his powers and prerogatives, leading the President to believe that there was probable cause that the crime of rebellion was and is being committed and that public safety requires the imposition of martial law and suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus.<br><br><u><b>A review of the aforesaid facts similarly leads the Court to conclude that the President, in issuing Proclamation No. 216, had sufficient factual bases tending to show that actual <i>rebellion</i> exists.</b></u> The President's conclusion, that there was an armed public uprising, the culpable purpose of which was the removal from the allegiance of the Philippine Government a portion of its territory and the deprivation of the President from performing his powers and prerogatives, was reached after a tactical consideration of the facts. In fine, the President satisfactorily discharged his burden of proof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></blockquote>Even petitioners at bar, as properly observed in the <i>ponencia</i>, concede the existence of rebellion that led to the declaration of Martial Law under Proclamation No. 216.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> The core of petitioners' contention is confined merely to the propriety of the further extension of the Martial Law in Mindanao. In substantiating their argument, however, petitioners neglect that <b>rebellion is a continuing crime</b>, the ultimate goal of which is to overthrow the government. The nature of rebellion as a continuing crime has often been repeated by this Court. In <i>Parong v. Enrile</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> this Court characterized rebellion as a continuing offense, <span style="font-style: italic;">viz</span>:<br><blockquote>The last argument of petitioner, namely that the detainees were not caught in flagrante delicto and therefore the arrest was illegal was refuted in the Comment thus: "Again petitioner simply misses the point. As this Court correctly observed, the crimes of subversion and <b>rebellion are continuing offenses</b>. Besides this point involves an issue of fact."<br></blockquote>A similar ruling was made in <i>Umil v. Ramos</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> where this Court observed that:<br><blockquote>. . . . [H]e (Dural) was committing an offense, when arrested, because Dural was arrested for being a member of the New People's Army, an outlawed organization, where membership is penalized, and for subversion which, like <u><b>rebellion is</b></u>, under the doctrine of Garcia vs. Enrile, a <b>continuing offense</b>, thus:<br><blockquote><b>The crimes of insurrection or rebellion</b>, subversion, conspiracy or proposal to commit such crimes, and other crimes and offenses committed in the furtherance (sic) on the occasion thereof, or incident thereto, or in connection therewith under Presidential Proclamation No. 2045, <u><b>are all in the nature of continuing offenses which set them apart from the common offenses</b></u>, aside from their essentially involving a massive conspiracy of nationwide magnitude . . .<br></blockquote>x x x Unlike other so-called "common" offenses, <span style="font-style: italic;">i.e.</span> adultery, murder, arson, etc., which generally end upon their commission, subversion and <b>rebellion are anchored on an ideological base which compels the repetition of the same acts of lawlessness and violence until the overriding objective of overthrowing organized government is attained</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br></blockquote>Further, while rebellion is the crime of the masses or multitudes, it is not perpetrated in one crowd action or in a single battle. And while the crime of rebellion consists of many acts, involving a vast movement of men and a complex net of intrigues and plots,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> these acts are not usually committed in a single instance. Rather, rebellion is pursued and committed in sporadic crimes-murders, kidnappings, arsons, sabotages, raids, hit-and-run tactics, and small skirmishes with the military-mostly by a small group of combatants by what is termed as guerilla warfare.<br><br>Rarely is rebellion now committed by a large group of identified men engaging the government in an all-out conventional war in accordance with the Geneva Conventions. It would then be simply naive to dismiss, as the petitioners have, the remaining armed groups in Mindanao as but "phantom remnants" of the defeated terrorists and rebels. The fact that they do exist and still continue fighting is by itself proof of the subsistence of the condition that compelled the administration to proclaim Martial Law in Mindanao.<br><br>More importantly, the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) has sufficiently shown that the remaining members of the Maute group, which commenced the rebellion, has not dwindled. Far from it, they have regrouped, increased in number, have been augmented by foreign terrorist fighters and have established linkages with other terrorists and rebel groups. During the oral arguments, the AFP stated thus:<br><blockquote>After the successful Marawi Operation, the Basilan-based ASG is left with 74 members; the Maute Group with 30 members; the Maguid Group has 11; and the Turaifie Group has 22 members with a total of 166 firearms.<br><br>However, <u><b>manpower increased</b></u> by more or less 400, with almost the same strength that initially stormed Marawi City, through clandestine and decentralized recruitment of the Daesh-inspired groups at their respective areas of concentration.<br><br>ASG Basilan-based recruited more or less 43 new members in Basilan; more or less 250 members by the Maute Group in the Lanao provinces; 37 by the Maguid Group in Sarangani and Sultan Kudarat, and more or less 70 by the Turaifie Group in Maguindanao. These newly recruited personalities were motivated by clannish culture as they are relatives of terrorist personalities; revenge for their killed relatives/parents during the Marawi operations; financial gain as new recruits were given an amount ranging from PhP15,000.00 to 50,000.00; and, as radicalized converts.<br><br>These newly recruited members are undergoing trainings in tactics, markmanships and bombing operations at the different areas of Mount Cararao Complex, Butig, and Piagapo all of Lanao Del Sur. Recruits with high potentials were given instruction on IED-making and urban operations.<br><br>Furthermore, the situation has become complicated with the influx of Foreign Terrorist Fighters (FTFs), capitalizing on the porous maritime boundaries in Southern Philippines, in the guise as tourists and businessmen. As of this period, 48 FTFs were monitored joining the Daesh-inspired groups, particularly the Maute Group in Lanao and Turaifie Group in Central Mindanao. The closeness of these two groups is predominant with @ Abu DAR who has historically established links with Turaifie.<br><br>On Dawlah Islamiyah-initiated violent incidents, these have increased to 100% for the 2<sup>nd</sup> Semester.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br></blockquote>Consequently, the burden is upon the petitioners to prove that the rebellion has been quelled by the government forces and has ceased to exist Petitioners, however, failed to discharge this burden. Instead, petitioners have presented nary a competent and adequate evidence that could refute the facts presented by the AFP and relied upon by the President in requesting the extension of Martial Law. Bare allegations and unfounded conclusions, without more, cannot debunk the finding of both the executive and legislative branches of the government that rebellion continues to pose a danger to the public safety in Mindanao and requires the imposition of Martial Law.<br><br>If this Court is to accord due regard to the principle of comity that should exist among the three branches of the Government, it must observe utmost restraint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> It must not modify, much less annul, the action of the other two branches of government as embodied in the assailed Resolution of Both Houses No. 4, unless there is hard and strong evidence that the extension has no factual basis. As no such evidence was presented by the petitioners, there is nothing to offset the "presumption of constitutionality"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> of Resolution of Both Houses No. 4.<br><br>Surely, as an act of both the executive and the legislative branches, Resolution of Both Houses No. 4 has in its favor the presumption of constitutionality,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> which was explained by this Court as follows:<br><blockquote>. . . . This presumption is rooted in the doctrine of separation of powers which enjoins upon the three coordinate departments of the Government a becoming courtesy for each other's acts. The theory is that every law, <b>being the joint act of the Legislature and the Executive, has passed careful scrutiny to ensure that it is in accord with the fundamental law</b>. This Court, however, may declare a law, or portions thereof, unconstitutional, where a petitioner has shown a clear and unequivocal breach of the Constitution, not merely a doubtful or argumentative one. <b>In other words, the grounds for nullity must be beyond reasonable doubt, for to doubt is to sustain.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br></blockquote>The burden of proving the invalidity of this joint exercise of discretion that is the extension of Martial Law rests on those who challenge it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> In this case, petitioners failed to present any proof, much less clear and convincing evidence, that will convince this Court beyond reasonable doubt of the nullity of the assailed Resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Hence, in the absence of the required proof of the unequivocal infraction of the Constitution committed by the President and both houses of Congress, this Court will indulge the presumption of constitutionality of the assailed Resolution of Both Houses No. 4. The validity of the extension of Martial Law embodied therein must perforce prevail.<br><br>Past experiences under Martial Law may have led the petitioners to doubt its necessity, efficacy, and the good that it may serve. However, the stark realities of the moment should temper our wariness of the Martial Law powers. We need not fear employing them when necessary for the promotion of public safety and the promotion of public welfare. After all, <b>it is not a power that can be employed without corresponding responsibility</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> In the vein of my opinion in <i>Lagman</i>, <b><u>Martial Law is by no means an arbitrary license</u></b> conferred on the President and the armed forces. As it is borne out of necessity, so it is limited by necessity.<br><br>To assuage the fears stoked by the implementation of Martial Law, I deem it proper to restate my opinion in <i>Lagman</i> discussing some of the safeguards and constraints that bind the hands of the President and the military that employ the Martial Law powers:<br><blockquote>. . . the source from which the power to proclaim Martial Law springs must be considered. Hence, <b>if there is no Constitutional provision or statute expressly allowing an intrusion or limitation of a civil liberty, then it is <u><i>not</i> and will <i>not</i> be</u> allowed</b>.<br><br><b>Public defense can and should be attained without a total abrogation of all individual rights.</b> Otherwise, "it could be well said that a country, preserved at the sacrifice of all the cardinal principles of liberty, is not worth the cost of preservation." Thus, while this Court recognized in <i>David</i> that "arrests and seizures without judicial warrants" can be made during Martial Law, the circumstances justifying such warrantless arrests and seizures under the Rules of Court and jurisprudence must still obtain. Pertinently, Section 5, Rule 113 reads:<br><blockquote>SECTION 5. Arrest Without Warrant; When Lawful. - A peace officer or a private person may, without a warrant, arrest a person:<br><br>(a) When, in his presence, the person to be arrested has committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to commit an offense;<br><br>(b) When an offense has just been committed and he has <b>probable cause</b> to believe based on personal knowledge of facts or circumstances that the person to be arrested has committed it; and<br><br>(c) When the person to be arrested is a prisoner who has escaped from a penal establishment or place where he is serving final judgment or is temporarily confined while his case is pending, or has escaped while being transferred from one confinement to another.<br></blockquote>As the basis for the declaration of Martial Law - rebellion - is a <b>continuing crime</b>, the authorities may resort to warrantless arrests of <i>persons suspected of rebellion</i> under the foregoing provision of the Rules of Court. It must, however, be emphasized that the <i>suspicion of rebellion</i> upon which a warrantless arrest is made must be based on a <b>probable cause</b>, <i>i.e.</i>, the ground of suspicion is supported by personal knowledge of facts and circumstances sufficiently strong in themselves to warrant a cautious man's belief that the person sought to be arrested has "committed or is actually committing" the crime of rebellion. Thus, parenthetically, the general arrest orders must be issued by the Armed Forces on the basis of probable cause. Alternatively, it must be shown that the person to be arrested was caught <i><b>in flagrante delicto</b></i> or has committed or is actually committing an overt act of rebellion or any other offense in the presence of the arresting officer.<br><br>In sustaining an arrest without a judicial warrant, Justice Holmes, in <i>Moyer v. Peabody</i>, ratiocinated that the "public danger warrants the substitution of executive process for judicial process." However, I subscribe to the position that even during Martial Law, <b>the jurisdiction of and inquiry by the courts are merely postponed, not ousted or superseded</b>. Hence, the same tests that would be applied by the civil courts in an inquiry into the validity of a government action must be applied by the military during a Martial Law.<br><br>In line with this, searches and seizures without judicial warrants can only be had in the following cases: (1) search of moving vehicles; (2) seizure in plain view; (3) customs searches; (4) waiver or consented searches; (5) stop and frisk situations (Terry search); (6) search incidental to a lawful arrest; (7) exigent and emergency circumstance; and (8) search of vessels and aircraft, where, again, probable cause exists that an offense has been committed and the objects sought in connection with the offense are in the place sought to be searched.<br><br>In the restriction of the freedom of speech and of the press, the military must still be guided by the <b>clear and present danger</b> test - that words are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that the military has a right to prevent. Thus, the military can prohibit the dissemination of vital information that can be used by the enemy, e.g., they can ban posts on social media if there is a clear and present danger that such posts will disclose their location. The same test, the presence of clear and present danger, governs the power of the military to disperse peaceable assemblies during Martial Law. As this Court held, tolerance is the rule and limitation is the exception. Otherwise stated, in the absence of clear and present danger, the military is bound by the rules of maximum tolerance under Batas Pambansa Blg. (BP) 880, otherwise known as the "The Public Assembly Act of 1985."<br><br>As to the "take-over of news media" mentioned in <i>David</i>, Section 17, Article XII of the 1987 Constitution states that: "In times of national emergency, when the public interest so requires, the State may, during the emergency and under reasonable terms prescribed by it, temporarily take over or direct the operation of any privately-owned public utility or business affected with public interest." Prescinding therefrom, this Court, in <i>Agan, Jr. v. Philippine International Air Terminals Co., Inc.</i>, held that police power justifies a temporary "take over [of] the operation of any business affected with public interest" by the State in times of national emergency:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>This Court, however, has held that it is the legislature, not the executive, which is the constitutional repository of police power, the existence of a national emergency, such as a rebellion or invasion, notwithstanding. Accordingly, <b>the power to temporarily take over or direct the operation of any privately-owned public utility or business affected with public interest can only be done whenever there is a law passed by Congress authorizing the same</b>. This Court, in <i>David</i>, explained as much:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Indeed, <u><b>the military must still be guided by law and jurisprudence and motivated by good faith in the exercise of the supreme force of the State even during a Martial law</b></u>. Thus, in its endeavor to restore peace and preserve the state, the military must still make proper adjustments to the safeguards of constitutional liberty under the following legislations intended to protect human rights:<br><blockquote>1. Republic Act No. 7438 (<i>An Act Defining Certain Rights of Person Arrested, Detained or Under Custodial Investigation as well as the Duties of the Arresting, Detaining and Investigating Officers and Providing Penalties for Violations Thereof</i>)<br><br>2.

Medialdea</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> I wish to restate here that a special civil action such as a petition for <i>certiorari</i> is one of the appropriate proceedings to question the factual basis of a declaration of martial law or the suspension of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> or the extension of such declaration and/or suspension. In the said Separate Concurring Opinion I stated:<br><blockquote>As for concerns that a petition for <i>certiorari</i>, prohibition or <i>habeas corpus</i> imposes procedural constraints that may hinder the Court's factual review of the sufficiency of the basis for a declaration of martial law or the suspension of the privilege of <i>habeas corpus</i>, these may all be addressed with little difficulty. In the hierarchy of legal authorities binding on this Court, constitutional provisions must take precedence over rules of procedure. It is Section 18, Article VII of the 1987 Constitution which authorizes the Court to review factual issues in order to determine the sufficiency of the factual basis of a martial law declaration or a suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> and, as discussed above, the Court may employ the most suitable procedure in order to carry out its jurisdiction over the issue as mandated by the Constitution. Time and again, the Court has stressed that it has the inherent power to suspend its own rules when the interest of justice so requires.<br><br>The Court should be cautious that it does not take a position in these consolidated cases that needlessly restricts our people's judicial remedies nor carelessly clips our own authority to take cognizance of the issue of constitutional sufficiency under Section 18, Article VII in <b><i>any</i></b> appropriate action that may be filed with the Court. Such would be antagonistic to the clear intent of the framers of the 1987 Constitution to empower our citizens and the Judiciary as a vital protection against potential abuse of the executive power to declare martial law and suspend the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>. (Citation omitted.)<br></blockquote>Joint Resolution No. 4 of both Houses of Congress, implements the provision of Section 18, Article VII of the Constitution which vests upon the Congress the power to extend the presidential proclamation of martial law as follows:<br><blockquote>Sec. 18. The President shall be the Commander-in-Chief of all armed forces of the Philippines and whenever it becomes necessary, he may call out such armed forces to prevent or suppress lawless violence, invasion or rebellion. In case of invasion or rebellion, when the public safety requires it, he may, for a period not exceeding sixty days, suspend the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> or place the Philippines or any part thereof under martial law. Within forty-eight hours from the proclamation of martial law or the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>, the President shall submit a report in person or in writing to the Congress. The Congress, voting jointly, by a vote of at least a majority of all its Members in regular or special session, may revoke such proclamation or suspension, which revocation shall not be set aside by the President. <b>Upon the initiative of the President, the Congress may, in the same manner, extend such proclamation or suspension for a period to be determined by the Congress, if the invasion or rebellion shall persist and public safety requires it.</b><br><br>The Congress, if not in session, shall, within twenty-four hours following such proclamation or suspension, convene in accordance with its rules without need of a call.<br><br>The Supreme Court may review, in an appropriate proceeding filed by any citizen, the sufficiency of the factual basis of the proclamation of martial law or the suspension of the privilege of the writ <b>or the extension thereof</b>, and must promulgate its decision thereon within thirty days from its filing.<br><br>A state of martial law does not suspend the operation of the Constitution, nor supplant the functioning of the civil courts or legislative assemblies, nor authorize the conferment of jurisdiction on military courts and agencies over civilians where civil courts are able to function, nor automatically suspend the privilege of the writ.<br><br>The suspension of the privilege of the writ shall apply only to persons judicially charged for rebellion or offenses inherent in or directly connected with invasion.<br><br>During the suspension of the privilege of the writ, any person thus arrested or detained shall be judicially charged within three days, otherwise he shall be released. (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote>The above-quoted provision of Section 18, Article VII unequivocally empowers Congress, upon the initiative of the President, to extend the proclamation of martial law or the suspension of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> under the following conditions: (1) the invasion or rebellion shall persist or continue; (2) the public safety requires it; and (3) the extension is decided, by a joint majority vote of Congress in a regular or special session.<br><br>Regarding the first two requirements to justify the extension of said proclamation or suspension, it is appropriate to reiterate my disquisition in my Separate Concurring Opinion in <i>Lagman</i>, to wit:<br><blockquote>The concept of rebellion in our penal law was explained in the leading case of <i>People v. Hernandez</i>, where the Court ruled that the word "rebellion" evokes, not merely a challenge to the constituted authorities, but, also, civil war, on a bigger or lesser scale, with all the evils that go with it; and that all other crimes, which are committed either <b>singly</b> or <b>collectively</b> and as a necessary means to attain the purpose of rebellion, or in connection therewith and in furtherance thereof, constitute only the simple, not complex, crime of rebellion. The Court also underscored that political crimes are those directly aimed against the political order and that the decisive factor in determining whether a crime has been committed to achieve a political purpose is the <b>intent</b> or <b>motive</b> in its commission.<br><br>While rebellion is considered as an act of terrorism under the law, the latter can be used to achieve a political end, such as removing from allegiance to the State any part of the national territory or overthrowing the duly constituted authorities. Even so, such lawless elements engaged in terrorism will never acquire any status recognized under International Humanitarian Law. Yet, acts of terrorism may be taken into account in the context of determining the necessity for a declaration of martial law within our constitutional framework.<br><br>Plainly then, rebellion can be committed through an offense or a violation of any special law so long as it is done as necessary means to attain, or in furtherance of, the purpose of rebellion. In <i>Ponce Enrile v. Amin</i>, the Court held <b>that the offense of harboring or concealing a fugitive</b>, or a violation of Presidential Decree No. 1829, <b>if committed in furtherance of the purpose of rebellion, should be deemed to form part of the crime of rebellion instead of being punished separately</b>. The Court explained:<br><blockquote>All crimes, whether punishable under a special law or general law, which are mere components or ingredients, or committed in furtherance thereof, become absorbed in the crime of rebellion and cannot be isolated and charged as separate crimes in themselves. Thus:<br><blockquote>"This does not detract, however, from the rule that the ingredients of a crime form part and parcel thereof, and hence, are absorbed by the same and cannot be punished either separately therefrom or by the application of Article 48 of the Revised Penal Code. x x x" (Citing People v. Hernandez)<br></blockquote>The <i>Hernandez</i> and other related cases mention common crimes as absorbed in the crime of rebellion. These common crimes refer to all acts of violence such as murder, arson, robbery, kidnapping, <i>etc</i>. as provided in the Revised Penal Code. The attendant circumstances in the instant case, however, constrain us to rule that the theory of absorption in rebellion cases must not confine itself to common crimes but also to offenses under special laws which are perpetrated in furtherance of the political offense.<br></blockquote>In his dissenting opinion in <i>Fortun</i>, Justice Velasco states that the Constitution does not require precision in establishing the fact of rebellion. In support of this, he cites an excerpt from the Brief of <i>Amicus Curiae</i> Fr. Joaquin Bernas, S.J., as follows:<br><blockquote>From all these it is submitted that the focus on public safety adds a nuance to the meaning of rebellion in the Constitution which is not found in the meaning of the same word in Article 134 of the Penal Code. The concern of the Penal Code, after all, is to punish <i>acts of the past</i>. But the concern of the Constitution is to counter threat to public safety both <i>in the present and in the future</i> arising from present and past acts. Such nuance, it is submitted, gives to the President a degree of flexibility for determining whether rebellion constitutionally exists as basis for martial law even if facts cannot obviously satisfy the requirements of the Penal Code whose concern is about past acts. To require that the President must first convince herself that there can be proof beyond reasonable doubt of the existence of rebellion as defined in the Penal Code and jurisprudence can severely restrict the President's capacity to safeguard public safety for the present and the future and can defeat the purpose of the Constitution.<br><br><b>What all these point to are that the twin requirements of "actual rebellion or invasion" and the demand of public safety are inseparably entwined. But whether there exists a need to take action in favour of public safety is a factual issue different in nature from trying to determine whether rebellion exists.</b> The need of public safety is an issue whose existence, unlike the existence of rebellion, is not verifiable through the visual or tactile sense. Its existence can only be determined through the application of prudential estimation of what the consequences might be of existing armed movements. Thus, in deciding whether the President acted rightly or wrongly in finding that public safety called for the imposition of martial law, the Court cannot avoid asking whether the President acted wisely and prudently and not in grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.&nbsp; Such decision involves the verification of factors not as easily measurable as the demands of Article 134 of the Penal Code and can lead to a prudential judgment in favour of the necessity of imposing martial law to ensure public safety even in the face of uncertainty whether the Penal Code has been violated. This is the reason why courts in earlier jurisprudence were reluctant to override the executive's judgment.<br><br>In sum, since the President should not be bound to search for proof beyond reasonable doubt of the existence of rebellion and since deciding whether public safety demands action is a <b>prudential matter</b>, the function of the President is far from different from the function of a judge trying to decide whether to convict a person for rebellion or not. <b>Put differently, looking for rebellion under the Penal Code is different from looking for rebellion under the Constitution.</b>&nbsp; x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> (Emphasis supplied; citation omitted.)<br></blockquote></blockquote>I also cited the case of <i>Aquino v. Ponce Enrile</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> where the Court expounded on the sophisticated and widespread nature of a modem rebellion, which has now even exacerbated with the advancement of technology. <i>Aquino</i> relevantly discussed:<br><blockquote>It [rebellion] does not consist simply of armed clashes between organized and identifiable groups on fields of their own choosing. It includes subversion of the most subtle kind, necessarily clandestine and operating precisely where there is no actual fighting. Underground propaganda, through printed news sheets or rumors disseminated in whispers; recruitment of armed and ideological adherents, raising of funds, procurement of arms and materiel, fifth­ column activities including sabotage and intelligence all these are part of the rebellion which by their nature are usually conducted far from the battle fronts. They cannot be counteracted effectively unless recognized and dealt with in that context.<br></blockquote>Rebellion in contemporary times has acquired a graver complexion. In Section 3(b) of Republic Act No. 9372, the "Human Security Act of 2007," rebellion is considered as an act of terrorism. Acts of terrorism can be directed towards the attainment of political objectives just as in the case of rebellion namely, to remove the allegiance to the State of any part of the national territory or to overthrow the duly constituted authorities. It is within the context of the ever increasingly ominous global threat posed by terrorism to national sovereignty and public safety that the sufficiency of the factual grounds invoked by the President and sustained by Congress must be evaluated by the Court. Particularly, the factual basis is encapsulated in the preambulatory clause of Joint Resolution No. 4 of Congress quoted below:<br><blockquote>WHEREAS, the President informed the Congress of the Philippines of the remarkable progress made during the period of Martial Law, but neverthess reported the following essential facts, which as Commander-in-Chief of all armed forces of the Philippines, he has personal knowledge of: First, despite the death of Hapilon and the Maute brothers, the remnants of their groups have continued to rebuild their organization through the recruitment and training of new members and fighters to carry on the rebellion; Second, the Turaifie Group has likewise been monitored to be planning to conduct bombings, notably targeting the Cotabato area; Third, the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters continue to defy the government by perpetrating at least fifteen (15) violent incidents during the Martial Law period in Maguindanao and North Cotabato; Fourth, the remnants of the Abu Sayyaf Group in Basilan, Sulu, Tawi-Tawi and Zamboanga Peninsula remain a serious security concern; and last, the new People's Army took advantage of the situation and intensified their decades-long rebellion against the government and stepped up terrorist acts against innocent civilians and private entities, as well as guerilla warfare against the security sector and public and government infrastructure, purposely to seize political power through violent means and supplant the country's democratic form of government with Communist rule[.]<br></blockquote>There is evident constitutional basis to sustain the declaration of martial law and the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> as well as their extension outside of the existence of or the absence of a "theater of war" where civilian authorities are unable to function. This is found in Section 18, Article VII of the Constitution which pertinently provides that "a state of martial law does not suspend the operation of the Constitution, nor supplant the functioning of civil courts, or legislative assemblies, nor authorize the conferment of jurisdiction and military courts and agencies over civilians where civil courts and agencies over civilians where civil courts are able to function, nor automatically suspend the privilege of the writ."<br><br>Furthermore, it should be stressed that Congress is empowered by the aforecited Section 18, Article VII to determine the period of extension of the martial law proclamation or suspension of the privilege of the writ, in like manner that it can exercise its power to revoke such proclamation or suspension. Thus, both the aforesaid revocation and extension shall be done by the "Congress, voting jointly, by a vote of at least a majority or all its Members in regular or special session."<br><br>The underlying reason articulated in the course of the deliberation of the 1986 Constitutional Commission of the manner of voting is to avoid the possibility of deadlock and to facilitate the process of revocation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Presumably, the Constitutional Commission adopted the same manner of voting for the extension of the declaration of martial law and the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> for the same reason, that the Congress may with facility and without the possibility of a stalemate decide on the said extension.<br><br>The <i>ponencia</i> of the Honorable Justice Noel Gimenez Tijam has detailed the sufficient factual bases undeniably demonstrating that rebellion persists and that public safety requires the extension of the declaration of martial law and the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> in the whole of Mindanao for a period of one (1) year from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2018.<br><br>Both the Senate and the House of Representatives decisively resolved to extend Presidential Proclamation No. 216 by two hundred forty (240) affirmative votes. The collective decision of the Executive and the Legislative Branches of the Government to extend for one (1) year the said proclamation, which was arrived at through a constitutionally mandated process can be the long awaited strong political will that will restore the elusive peace and promote prosperity in the whole of Mindanao.<br><br>Accordingly, I vote to <b>DISMISS</b> the petitions in G.R.

It must appear clearly from the law or it will not be held to exist.<br><br>A plain reading of the afore-quoted Section 18, Article VII reveals that it specifically grants authority to the Court to determine the sufficiency of the factual basis of the proclamation of martial law or suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus.<br><br><i>b) "In an appropriate proceeding" does not refer to a petition for certiorari filed under Section 1 or 5 of Article VIII</i><br><br>It could not have been the intention of the framers of the Constitution that the phrase "in an appropriate proceeding" would refer to a Petition for Certiorari pursuant to Section 1 or Section 5 of Article VIII. The standard of review in a petition for certiorari is whether the respondent has committed any grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in the performance of his or her functions. Thus, it is not the proper tool to review the sufficiency of the factual basis of the proclamation or suspension. It must be emphasized that under Section 18, Article VII, the Court is tasked to review the sufficiency of the factual basis of the President's exercise of emergency powers. Put differently, if this Court applies the standard of review used in a petition for certiorari, the same would emasculate its constitutional task under Section 18, Article VII.<br></blockquote>In my Separate Opinion in <i>Lagman I</i>, I agreed with the proposition that the <i>appropriate proceeding</i> mentioned in the third paragraph of Section 18, Article VII of the 1987 Constitution is different and distinct from the proceeding relating to the Court's exercise of the power of judicial review, whether traditional or expanded. I explicitly indicated then:<br><blockquote>The third paragraph of Section 18 suffices to confer on the Court the exclusive and original jurisdiction to determine the sufficiency of the factual bases of the proclamation of martial law. To equate the <i>appropriate proceeding</i> to the <i>certiorari</i> action authorized under Section 5(1), in relation to the second paragraph of Section 1, is erroneous. As earlier pointed out, the third paragraph of Section 18 defines the legal duty to review the sufficiency of the factual basis for the proclamation of martial law upon the filing of the petition for the purpose by any citizen. The Court has then to discharge the duty.<br><br>The silence of Section 5(1) on what the <i>appropriate proceeding</i> is should be of no consequence because Section 5 is not the sole repository of the cases or situations coming under the Court's jurisdiction.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The check-and-balance constitutional design set down in Section 18 of Article VII of the 1987 Constitution establishes a structure of collaboration among the three great branches of the Government in the matter of the proclamation of martial law. Although the power of proclaiming martial law over the country or any part of it is exclusively lodged in the President, he or she is nonetheless required to report to Congress on the proclamation, and Congress shall then decide whether to revoke or extend the state of martial law. The Court, being a passive institution, <i>may be</i> called upon to review and determine the sufficiency of the factual basis of the proclamation, and whether the public safety requires it, only upon the petition for the purpose by any citizen.<br><br>The invocation of the third paragraph of Section 18 by the petitioning citizen suffices to initiate this Court's power to review the sufficiency of the factual bases of the declaration of martial law. This initiation, which triggers the inquiry or review by the Court, albeit unique, conforms to the constitutional design.<br><br>The appropriate proceeding, once commenced, should not focus on whether the President gravely abused his or her discretion or not in determining the necessity for proclaiming martial law. Instead, the 1987 Constitution mandates the Court to examine and sift through the factual basis relied upon by the President to justify his proclamation of martial law and to determine whether the factual basis is sufficient or not. To rule that a finding of grave abuse of discretion is essential is to confine the discharge of the duty by the Court within limits not considered at the time of the ratification of the 1987 Constitution. Doing so may also produce impractical results. Consider this hypothetical scenario. Supposing that the President cites 10 factual bases for his proclamation of martial law, and the Court, upon its assiduous review of the factual bases, considers nine of the 10 as manufactured or fabricated or inadequate, leaving but one as true or authentic. Under the thesis of the OSG, the Court would necessarily nullify the proclamation simply because the President was found to have gravely abused his or her discretion. The Court would thereby act indifferently towards the one true or authentic justification on the ground that the grave abuse of discretion as to the nine tainted the proclamation.<br><br>Moreover, the determination of sufficiency or insufficiency of the factual bases for the proclamation of martial law is usually a matter of validating the good judgment of the President of the facts or information known to or made available to him or her. This goes without saying that such facts must have occurred <i>prior to</i> or <i>about</i> the time the determination by the President is made. Whether or not such facts are later shown by subsequent events to be fabricated or false or inadequate is not a decisive factor unless the President is credibly shown to have known of the fabrication or falsity or inadequacy of the factual bases at the time he or she issued the proclamation of martial law. In that situation, the main consideration is definitely not whether or not grave abuse of discretion intervened.<br><br>My reading of the third paragraph of Section 18 tells me that the term <i>appropriate proceeding</i> is different from the proceedings or actions that the Court may take cognizance of under Section 5(1) or Section 1. My foremost reason for so holding is that the third paragraph of Section 18 textually mandates the Court to be a trier of facts, an office and function that the Court is not generally called upon to discharge under either Section 5(1) or Section 1. It is true that the Court is not always precluded from reviewing facts. There are occasions when it assumes the role of a trier of facts, like, to name some, in criminal appeals; in appeals from rulings of the Court of Appeals in proceedings for the writ of <i>amparo</i>; or when it sits as the Presidential Electoral Tribunal.<br><br>In fine, I deem it to be plainly erroneous to subsume the <i>appropriate proceeding</i> allowed in the third paragraph of Section 18 to the certiorari jurisdiction vested by Section 5(1) in relation to the expanded jurisdiction defined in second paragraph of Section 1.<br></blockquote>The Majority opinion adopts several procedural steps that, to me, are not relevant or controlling in this kind of proceedings.<br><br>The Majority opinion takes issue with the fact that all petitions except that in G.R. No. 2236145 (Rosales petition) did not implead the Congress despite its being an indispensable party. The Majority opinion states that impleading an indispensable party is jurisdictional, and insists that any proceeding undertaken without an indispensable party is null and void for want of authority to act, not only as to the unimpleaded party but even as to the party impleaded; and that impleading an indispensable party is not a trivial matter.<br><br>I do not share the view stated in the Majority opinion.<br><br>In my humble view, the requirement of the Rules of Court for the joinder of the indispensable party is not applicable in this kind of proceeding wherein the Court is called upon by the 1987 Constitution to exercise a special and exclusive jurisdiction that is different from the exercise of the Court's judicial power vested under either Section 1, Article VIII or Section 5(1), Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution.<br><br>The requirement of impleading an indispensable party, which is found in Section 7, Rule 3 of the <i>Rules of Court</i>, demands that a party in interest without whom no final determination can be had of an action <i>shall be</i> joined either as a plaintiff or a defendant. Hence, the joinder of the indispensable party is mandatory. Without the presence of the indispensable party, no judgment of a court exercising judicial power can attain real finality because the controversy is not at all thereby resolved, or because the relief proper for the case is not granted. The absence of the indispensable party renders all subsequent acts of the court null and void for want of authority to act, not only as to the absent parties but even as to those present.<br><br>Yet, the requirement of impleading the indispensable party can be true only in proceedings in which the courts exercise judicial power under either Section 1, Article VIII or Section 5(1), Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution, not to the present proceedings under the third paragraph of Section 18, Article VII of the 1987 Constitution. The distinction arises from the fact that the former are proceedings instituted to resolve actual controversies between litigants holding or asserting adverse rights and interests in property or other matters, while the latter are proceedings that focus only on the determination of the sufficiency of the factual basis for the extension of the declaration of martial law made by the Congress and do not involve any actual controversy or dispute about rights and interests of parties in interest. In short, the present proceedings are not concerned with rights and interests, thereby removing the need for the mandatory impleading of any person or entity.<br><br><b>NONETHELESS</b>, I vote to <b>DISMISS</b> the petitions.<br><br><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="noshade" align="LEFT"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> G.R.

Medialdea</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> the Court upheld the constitutionality of Proclamation No. 216, declaring a state of martial law and suspending the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> in the whole of Mindanao. The Court, in that case, found that "parameters for the declaration of martial law and suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> [i.e. 1] actual rebellion or invasion, and 2) public safety requirement have been properly and fully complied with."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Hence the court ruled that, "Proclamation No. 216 has sufficient factual basis, there being probable cause to believe that the rebellion exists, and that public safety requires the martial law declaration and the suspension of the privelege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>Using the same parameters as in <i>Lagman</i>, the Court is now tasked to review the sufficiency of the factual bases of Resolution of Both Houses No. 4, further extending the proclamation of martial law and the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> in the whole of Mindanao from January 1 to December 31, 2018, to wit:<br><blockquote>First, despite the death of Hapilon and the Maute brothers, the remnants of their groups have continued to rebuild their organization through the recruitment and training of new members and fighters to carry on the rebellion;<br><br>Second, the Turaifie Group has likewise been monitored to be planning to conduct bombings, notably targeting the Cotabato area;<br><br>Third, the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters continue to defy the government by perpetrating at least fifteen (15) violent incidents during the Martial Law period in Maguindanao and North Cotabato;<br><br>Fourth, the remnants of the Abu Sayyaf Group in Basilan, Sulu, Tawi-Tawi, and Zamboanga Peninsula remain a serious security concern;<br><br>and last the New People's Army took advantage of the situation and intensified their decades-long rebellion against the government and stepped up terrorist acts against innocent civilians and private entities, as well as guerrilla warfare against the security sector and public and government infrastructure, purposely to seize political power through violent means and supplant the country's democratic form of government with Communist rule;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br></blockquote><b><i>Existence of Actual Rebellion</i></b><br><br>In <i>Lagman</i>, the Court found that actual rebellion existed in the whole of Mindanao. In this case, the question is whether the same rebellion still exists.<br><br>I am convinced that it does as the "liberation of Marawi" did not end the rebellion. Marawi, as found by the Court in <i>Lagman</i> was only the staging point of the rebellion as the target was the whole of Mindanao.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> The fact that the surviving members of the Maute group have not surrendered and are even recruiting new members despite the death of Hapilon and the Maute brothers clearly proves that the rebellion persists. The violent incidents perpetrated by the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) in Mindanao likewise negate petitioners' position that the rebellion has been quelled by the "liberation of Marawi." Thus, I believe that while the government may have won the battle in Marawi, the war against the rebellion is still ongoing.<br><br>Moreover, I agree with the <i>ponencia</i> that the inclusion of the New Peoples Army (NPA) as basis for the further extension will not render void Resolution of Both Houses No. 4. Although the NPA group was not expressly included in Proclamation No. 216 as one of the "other rebel groups," their attacks may nevertheless be used as factual bases for the extension considering that these contributed to the violence and even aggravated the situation in Mindanao.<br><br>To put things in perspective, let us say Country A invades Mindanao and immediately thereafter, the President issues a proclamation declaring martial law in the entire Mindanao. After two weeks, Country B then decides to join the war in the hope of taking over a portion of Mindanao. Under the circumstances, is the President still required to make another proclamation for the invasion by Country B? Obviously not - as it would be superfluous and impractical considering the President already declared martial law to stop the invasion of Mindanao. So, instead of promulgating a separate declaration of martial law, the President may just ask Congress for an extension based on the original invasion, which continues to exist, with the invasion by Country B as an additional factual basis for the extension.<br><br>In this case, the attacks carried out by the NPA are but additional factual bases which may be used to support the findings of the President and the Congress that the rebellion persists in the whole of Mindanao. In fact, whether or not the NPA group was used as a basis for the extension does not change the fact that the rebellion started by Hapilon and the Maute brothers continues to exist in Mindanao.<br><br><b><i>Theater of War</i></b><br><br>Citing portions of the deliberations of the framers of the 1987 Constitution, petitioners Rosales, et al. and Monsod, et al. advance the theory that for martial law to be valid, it must be in the context of an actual "theater of war" due to a rebellion or invasion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Under this theory, martial law can only be declared in an area where there is actual armed conflict.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>There is, however, nothing in the deliberations to support their theory. Quoted below are the pertinent portions of the deliberations:<br><blockquote>SR. TAN: Yes. Thank you.<br><br>The other question is also on the same section. Would martial law automatically give the President the power of legislation through decrees?<br><br>MR. SUMULONG: We will ask Commissioner Concepcion to answer. <br><br>MR. CONCEPCION: It is stated in Section 15:<br><br>A state of martial law does not suspend the operation of the Constitution, nor supplant the functioning of the civil courts or legislative assemblies, nor authorize the conferment of jurisdiction on military courts . . .<br><br>The Commissioner's question is whether martial law decreases or increases the power of the President?<br><br>SR. TAN: Decreases?<br><br>MR. CONCEPCION: Not necessarily.<br><br>SR. TAN: So, what specific power is necessary before the President can proclaim martial law?<br><br>MR. CONCEPCION: In general, in case of invasion, the President would have all the powers of a general in the army.<br><br>MR. SUMULONG: We ask Commissioner Bernas to answer.<br><br>FR. BERNAS: That same question was asked during the meetings of the Committee: What precisely does martial law add to the power of the President to call on the armed forces? The first and second lines in this provision state:<br><br>A state of martial law does not suspend the operation of the Constitution, nor supplant the functioning of the civil courts or legislative assemblies . . .<br><br>The provision is put there, precisely, to reverse the doctrine of the Supreme Court. I think it is the case <i>Aquino vs. COMELEC</i> where the Supreme Court said that in times of martial law, the President automatically has legislative power. So these two clauses denied that. A state of martial law does not suspend the operation of the Constitution; therefore, it does not suspend the principle of separation of powers.<br><br>The question now is: During martial law, can the President issue decrees? The answer we gave to that question in the Committee was: During martial law, the President may have the powers of a commanding general in a <b>theatre of war</b>. In actual war when there is fighting in an area, the President as the commanding general has the authority to issue orders which have the effect of law but strictly in a <b>theatre of war</b>, not in the situation we had during the period of martial law. In other words, there is an effort here to return to the traditional concept of martial law as it was developed especially in American jurisprudence, where martial law has reference to the <b>theatre of war</b>.<br><br>SR. TAN: Thank you.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>x x x x<br><br>MR. FOZ: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>May I go to the next question? This is about the declaration of martial law or the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> on page 7, on the second to the last paragraph of Section 15. Is it possible to delete the clause "where civil courts are able to function"? In the earlier portion of the same sentence, it says, "nor supplant the functioning of the civil courts x x x" I was just thinking that if this provision states the effects of the declaration of martial law - one of which is that it does not supplant the functioning of the civil courts - I cannot see how civil courts would be unable to function even in a state of martial law.<br><br>MR. SUMULONG: May we refer that interpellation to Commissioner Bernas?<br><br>FR. BERNAS: This phrase was precisely put here because we have clarified the meaning of martial law; meaning, limiting it to martial law as it has existed in the jurisprudence in international law, that it is a law for the <b>theater of war</b>. In a <b>theater of war</b>, civil courts are unable to function. If in the actual <b>theater of war</b> civil courts, in fact, are unable to function, then the military commander is authorized to give jurisdiction even over civilians to military courts precisely because the civil courts are closed in that area But in the general area where the civil courts are opened then in no case can the military courts be given jurisdiction over civilians. This is in reference to a theater of war where the civil courts, in fact, are unable to function.<br><br>MR. FOZ: It is a state of things brought about by the realities of the situation in that specified critical area.<br><br>FR. BERNAS: That is correct.<br><br>MR. FOZ: And it is not something that is brought about by a declaration of the Commander-in-Chief.<br><br>FR. BERNAS: It is not brought about by a declaration of the Commander in Chief. The understanding here is that the phrase "nor authorize the conferment of jurisdiction on military courts and agencies over civilians" has reference to the practice under the Marcos regime where military courts were given jurisdiction over civilians. We say here that we will never allow that except in areas where civil courts are, in fact, unable to function and it becomes necessary for some kind of court to function.<br><br>MR. FOZ: Thank you, Madam President.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br></blockquote>It appears that Father Demas mentioned the concept of the "theater of war" twice during the deliberations.<br><br>First was in answer to the question of "[whether] martial law automatically give[s] the President the power of legislation through decrees,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> to which Father Bernas answered in the negative. He explained that, "the President may have the powers of a commanding general in a theatre of war. In actual war when there is fighting in an area, the President as the commanding general has the authority to issue orders which have the effect of law but strictly in a theatre of war, not in the situation we had during the period of [Marcos] martial law."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Simply put, Father Bernas mentioned the "theater of war" only to make it clear that under the 1987 Constitution, a declaration of martial law does not automatically grant the President the power to legislate, as the 1987 Constitution expressly provides that "a state of martial law does not suspend the operation of the Constitution, nor supplant the functioning of the civil courts or legislative assemblies, nor authorize the conferment of jurisdiction on military courts and agencies over civilians where civil courts are able to function, nor automatically suspend the privilege of the writ."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Second was in response to the suggestion of deleting the phrase "where civil courts are able to function." Father Bernas rejected this suggestion as the phrase delimits the effects of martial law so that the "practice under the Marcos regime where military courts were given jurisdiction over civilians"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> would not happen again. He explained that during martial law, the Commander-in-Chief has no power to confer jurisdiction on military courts and agencies over civilians, except in a "theater of war" or in the area where there is actual war because of which the civil courts are unable to function.<br><br>Considering that the framers of the 1987 Constitution only mentioned the term "theater of war" in the context of describing and defining the powers of the President during martial law, it is highly specious for petitioners to use the same to support its theory. In fact, the Court in <i>Lagman</i> quoted the same portions of the deliberations only to describe what happens during a state of martial law. Thus, contrary to the view of petitioners, there is nothing in the 1987 Constitution that limits the scope of martial law to the actual "theater of war." As the Court has declared in <i>Lagman</i>, the discretion to determine the territorial coverage of martial law lies with the President,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> subject of course to the safeguards laid down in Section 18, Article VII of the 1987 Constitution.<br><br><b><i>Public Safety Requirement</i></b><br><br>As to the second requirement, petitioners assert that the public safety contemplated in Section 18, Article VII of the 1987 Constitution "entails a breakdown of civilian government"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> or "a vacuum in civilian authorities."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Such assertion has no legal basis as there is nothing in the 1987 Constitution and in the records of the deliberations of the Constitutional Commission to indicate that such was the intended definition of the framers. Besides, unless technical terms are employed, words used in the Constitution should be given their ordinary meaning and as much as possible its language should be understood in its common usage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Thus, in <i>Lagman</i>, the Court defined public safety simply as one that "involves the prevention of and protection from events that could endanger the safety of the general public from significant danger, injury/harm, or damage, such as crimes or disasters."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>With this definition and in light of the tactual circumstances indicated in the letter of the President and the Resolution of Both Houses No. 4, I believe that public safety requires the extension of martial law. Undeniably, the acts of violence committed, and being committed, by the rebels in various areas in Mindanao continue to endanger the lives of the people in Mindanao.<br><br><b><i>Period of Extension</i></b><br><br>Finally, as to the period of extension, Section 18, Article VII of the 1987 Constitution states that, "upon the initiative of the President, the Congress may, in the same manner, extend such proclamation or suspension for a period to be determined by the Congress, if the invasion or rebellion shall persist and public safety requires it." The provision is clear: the determination of the period of the extension, as well as the number of extensions, lies with the Congress.<br><br>In view of the foregoing, I vote to <b>DISMISS</b> the Petitions and <b>AFFIRM</b> the constitutionality of Resolution of Both Houses No. 4.<br><br><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="noshade" align="LEFT"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Lagman v.

Medialdea</i>, I have explained that the term "sufficient factual basis" under Section 18, Article VII is a conceptually novel and distinct parameter of review, which should not be equated to the gauge of arbitrariness (as in the standard of grave abuse of discretion in <i>certiorari</i> cases) but should, instead, be construed in its generic sense - that is, adequate proof of compliance with the constitutional requisites. Thus, insofar as reviewing the President's proclamation of martial law, the parameter and its underlying considerations were summed up as follows:<br><blockquote>[T]he parameter "sufficient factual basis" under Section 18, Article VII of the Constitution simply means that there is adequate proof to show that the President had complied with the two requisites to impose martial law. These requisites are: (1) that there exists an actual invasion or rebellion; and (2) that the public safety so requires the same.<br><br>There is adequate poof that the President complied with the first requisite if the elements of rebellion as defined in Article 134 of the RPC concur; this means that the rebellion is not merely imminent but has been actually consummated.<br><br>On the other hand, there is adequate proof that the President complied with the second requisite if it is shown that the public safety demands the imposition of martial law under a particular territorial extent; since public safety is a malleable concept, the Court should then gauge whether or not there is a reasonable need to impose martial law in light of the exigencies of the situation and concomitantly, whether its territorial extent is rationally commensurate to the said exigencies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br></blockquote>Although the parameter of review remains the same, the object of review in this case is different. Here, the object of review is not the President's initial proclamation of martial law - as in Proclamation No. 216 decided in <i>Lagman v. Medialdea</i> - but rather, the Congress' extension of the President's martial law proclamation, as embodied in Resolution of Both Houses No. 4 dated December 13, 2017. As such, there is no reason to apply the principle of conclusiveness of judgment as respondents would suppose.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Notably, while Congress had, in fact, earlier extended Proclamation No. 216<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> through Resolution of Both Houses No. 2<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> dated July 22, 2017,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> the Constitution does not proscribe any limitation on either (<i>a</i>) the number of times an extension may be made, or (<i>b</i>) the duration of time for which a particular extension may be made. Thus, contrary to petitioners' postulation,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Congress is not precluded from either extending martial law for a second time or extending martial law for a period of more than sixty (60) days.<br><br>Pursuant to Section 18, Article VII, the power to extend martial law belongs to Congress; however, the exercise of this power is "[u]pon the initiative of the President":<br><blockquote>Section 18. The President shall be the Commander-in-Chief of all armed forces of the Philippines and whenever it becomes necessary, he may call out such armed forces to prevent or suppress lawless violence, invasion or rebellion. In case of invasion or rebellion, when the public safety requires it, he may, for a period not exceeding sixty days, suspend the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> or place the Philippines or any part thereof under martial law. Within forty-eight hours from the proclamation of martial law or the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>, the President shall submit a report in person or in writing to the Congress. The Congress, voting jointly, by a vote of at least a majority of all its Members in regular or special session, may revoke such proclamation or suspension, which revocation shall not be set aside by the President. <u><b>Upon the initiative of the President, the Congress may, in the same manner, extend such proclamation or suspension for a period to be determined by the Congress, if the invasion or rebellion shall persist and public safety requires it</b></u>.<br><br>x x x x (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Being a power specifically conferred unto Congress, it is not bound by the recommendation of the President regarding any proposed extension; thus, it may engage in its own independent examination on the matter, and consequently, may arrive at its own reasons in deciding on whether or not to extend martial law. In this sense, Congress - being composed of the duly­elected representatives of the people - acts as a legislative body in deciding whether or not to extend martial law in our country, and necessarily, if an extension is so decided, sets the extension's terms as it deems fit.<br><br>However, as observed during the deliberations on the 1987 Constitution, Congress' decision-making process would necessarily be in consultation with the President.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> This is because it is the President who not only seeks the proclamation's extension but also ultimately possesses the information and expertise to deal with a persisting invasion or rebellion. As pointed out in <i>Lagman v. Medialdea</i>:<br><blockquote>"It is for the President as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces to appraise these [classified evidence or documents/]reports and be satisfied that the public safety demands the suspension of the writ." Significantly, respect to these so-called classified documents is accorded even "when the authors of or witnesses to these documents may not be revealed."<br><br>In fine, not only does the President have a wide array of information before him, he also has the right, prerogative, and the means to access vital, relevant, and confidential data, concomitant with his position as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br></blockquote>While Congress makes the final decision, this necessary interaction between the political branches of government shows that the entire process of extending the proclamation of martial law is - as described by the Framers - a "joint executive and legislative act,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> animated by the "principle of collective judgment."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Meanwhile, same as reviewing the President's power to proclaim martial law, the Court acts as a check to the Congress' power to extend martial law. In the latter respect, the Court's task, upon the institution of the appropriate proceeding by any citizen, is to determine if there is sufficient factual basis to show that: (<i>a</i>) the invasion or rebellion still persists; and (<i>b</i>) public safety requires the extension. Pursuant to Section 18, Article VII of the 1987 Constitution, these two (2) requirements ought to be satisfied by Congress before it may properly decree a martial law extension.<br><br><center><b>II. Persistence of Rebellion.</b><br></center><br>In my Separate Opinion in <i>Lagman v. Medialdea</i>, I have discussed the unique nature of rebellion and in such light, broached how the concept of "actual rebellion" should be understood under the Constitution's martial law provision:<br><blockquote>[I]n light of the nature of rebellion (1) as a movement, (2) as a complex net of intrigues and plots, (3) as a continuing crime, and (4) as a political offense, it is my view that this Court cannot confine the concept of rebellion to the actual exchange of fire between the accused rebels and the forces of the government. As above-intimated, the taking up of arms against the government is only what consummates the crime of rebellion in order to prosecute those accused thereof under the RPC. <u><b>However, up until that movement stops (for instance, when the rebels surrender or are caught by government operatives), it is my opinion that the rebellion continues to survive in legal existence.</b></u><br><br>x x x x<br><br>[T]he crime of rebellion defies our ordinary impression that a crime's occurrence can be pinpointed to a definite territory, much less its existence bounded to a particular moment in time. Because of its nature, rebellion is hardly compatible with the norms of spatial and temporal limitability, as usually applied in our criminal law. It is in this specific light that we should understand the concept of an actual rebellion under the Constitution's martial law provision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br></blockquote>As above-highlighted, it has been my position that a rebellion, because of its peculiar conceptual features, survives in legal existence up until the rebellious movement stops, such as when the rebels have already surrendered or that they are caught by government operatives. As it may, however, be impractical, if not impossible, to accurately ascertain if all the members of a rebel movement have surrendered or have been killed or captured at a certain point in time, then a satisfactory showing of the rebel movement's substantial inactivity or loss of capability to mount a public uprising would reasonably suffice.<br><br>In this case, however, there is no evidence to show that the rebel movement in Mindanao, comprised of the Maute-Hapilon Group and other rebel groups under the DAESH/ISIS<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> front, has been substantially inactive or has lost the capability to mount a public uprising. On the contrary, respondents have competently proven that these rebels have, in fact, regrouped, thereby demonstrating that the rebellion still persists.<br><br>Records show that respondents' determination was arrived at based on field reports and technical data coming from no less than the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the Philippine National Police (PNP). The information gathered by our troops on the ground was then conveyed by the President in his December 8, 2017 letter to Congress:<br><blockquote>On 04 December 2017[,] I received a letter from Secretary of National Defense Delfin N. Lorenzana, as Martial Law Administrator, stating that "based on current security assessment made by the Chief of Staff, Armed Forces of the Philippines, the undersigned recommends the extension of Martial Law for another twelve (12) months or one (1) year beginning January 1, 2018 until December 31, 2018 covering the whole island of Mindanao primarily to ensure total eradication of DAESH­-inspired Da'awatul Islamiyab Waliyatul Masriq (DIWM), other like­minded Local/Foreign Terrorist Groups (L/FTGs) and Armed Lawless (ALGs), and the communist terrorists (CTs) and their coddlers, supporters, and financiers x x x." A copy of Secretary Lorenzana's letter (together with a copy of the letter of AFP Chief Guerrero) is attached for your convenient reference.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br></blockquote>In the same letter, the President summed up the security assessment of the AFP, as supported by the PNP, into five (5) integral points. These points constitute the reasons which impelled the President to seek a further extension of martial law from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018:<br><blockquote>The security assessment submitted by the AFP, supported by a similar assessment by the Philippine National Police (PNP), highlights certain essential facts that I, as Commander-in-Chief of all armed forces of the Philippines, have personal knowledge of.<br><br><u><b>First</b></u>, despite the death of Hapilon and the Maute brothers, the remnants of their Groups have continued to rebuild their organization through the recruitment and training of new members and fighters to carry on the rebellion. You will please note that at least one hundred eighty-five (185) persons listed in the Martial Law Arrest Orders have remained at-­large and, in all probability, are presently regrouping and consolidating their forces.<br><br>More specifically, the remnants of DAESH-inspired DIWM members and their allies, together with their protectors, supporters and sympathizers, have been monitored in their continued efforts towards radicalization/recruitment, financial and logistical build-up, as well as in their consolidation/ reorganization in Central Mindanao, particularly in the provinces of Maguindanao and North Cotabato and also in Sulu and Basilan. These activities are geared towards the conduct of intensified atrocities and armed public uprisings in support of their objective of establishing the foundation of a global Islamic caliphate and of a <i>Wilayat</i> not only in the Philippines but also in the whole of Southeast Asia.<br><br><u><b>Second</b></u>, the Turaifie Group has likewise been monitored to be planning to conduct bombings, notably targeting the Cotabato area. Turaifie is said to be Hapilon's potential successor as Amir of DAESH [<i>Wilayat</i>] in the Philippines and Southeast Asia.<br><br><b><u>Third</u></b>, the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) [continues] to defy the government by perpetrating at least fifteen (15) violent incidents during the Martial Law period in Maguindanao and North Cotabato. For this year, the BIFF has initiated at least eighty-nine (89) violent incidents, mostly harassments and roadside bombings against government troops.<br><br><b><u>Fourth</u></b>, the remnants of the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) in Basilan, Sulu, Tawi-Tawi, and Zamboanga Peninsula remain as a serious security concern. Reports indicate that this year they have conducted at least forty­-three (43) acts of terrorism, including attacks using Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), harassments, and kidnappings which have resulted in the killing of eight (8) civilians, three (3) of whom were mercilessly beheaded.<br><br><b><u>Last</u></b>, but certainly not the least, while the government was preoccupied with addressing the challenges posed by the DAESH-inspired DIWM and other Local Terrorist Groups (LTGs), the New People's Army (NPA) took advantage of the situation and intensified their decades-long rebellion against the government and stepped up terrorist acts against innocent civilians and private entities, as well as guerilla warfare against the security sector and public and government infrastructure, purposely to seize political power through violent means and supplant the country's democratic form of government with Communist rule.<br><br>x x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> (Emphases and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Notably, Congress adopted these same considerations as evinced from the text of Resolution of Both Houses No. 4:<br><blockquote>WHEREAS, the President informed the Congress of the Philippines of the remarkable progress made during the period of Martial Law, but nevertheless reported the following essential facts, which as Commander-in-Chief of all armed forces of the Philippines, he has personal knowledge of: First, despite the death of Hapilon and the Maute brothers, the remnants of their groups have continued to rebuild their organization through the recruitment and training of new members and fighters to carry on the rebellion; Second, the Turaifie Group has likewise been monitored to be planning to conduct bombings, notably targeting, the Cotabato area; Third, the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters [continues] to defy the government by perpetrating at least fifteen (15) violent incidents during the Martial Law period in Maguindanao and North Cotabato; Fourth, the remnants of the Abu Sayyaf Group in Basilan, Sulu, Tawi-Tawi, and Zamboanga Peninsula remain a serious security concern; and last, the New People's Army took advantage of the situation and intensified their decades-long rebellion against the government and stepped up terrorist acts against innocent civilians and private entities, as well as guerilla warfare against the security sector and public and government infrastructure, purposely to seize political power through violent means and supplant the country's democratic form of government with Communist rule[.]<br></blockquote>As correctly observed by the <i>ponencia</i>, "[t]he reasons cited by the President in his request for further extension [of martial law] indicate that the rebellion, which caused him to issue Proclamation No. 216, continues to exist and its 'remnants' have been resolute in establishing a DAESH/ISIS territory in Mindanao, carrying on through the recruitment and training of new members, financial and logistical build-up, consolidation of forces[,] and continued attacks."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> These "remnants", as explained by the respondents, "are capable of launching retaliatory attacks against the Government and sowing acts of terrorism against the civilian population to wrest control of Mindanao and continue their bid to establish a <i>wilayah</i> in the region. In addition, they have established linkages with other rebel groups such as the BIFF, AKP, ASG, DI Maguid, DI Turaifie who are capable of perpetrating strategic and well-coordinated mass casualty attacks to overthrow the present government."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>As further elaborated upon by the AFP during the oral arguments of this case, the manpower of the <i>Dawlah Islamiyah</i>, which is the DAESH­ affiliate organization in the Philippines responsible for the Marawi Siege and is composed of several local terrorist groups, "increased by more or less 400, with almost the same strength that initially stormed Marawi City, through clandestine and decentralized recruitment of the [DAESH]-inspired groups at their respective areas of concentration."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> "These newly recruited personalities were motivated by clannish culture as they are relatives of terrorist personalities; revenge for their killed relatives and parents during the Marawi operations; financial gain as new recruits were given an amount ranging from Php15,000.00 to Php50,000.00; [and] as radicalized converts."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Furthermore, the AFP has expressed concerns that "the situation has [in fact] become [more] complicated with the influx of Foreign Terrorist Fighters (FTFs), capitalizing on the porous maritime boundaries in Southern Philippines, in the guise as tourists and business men. As of this period, 48 [FTFs] were monitored joining the [DAESH]-inspired groups, particularly the Maute Group in Lanao and Turaifie Group in Central Mindanao. The closeness of these two groups is predominant with Abu DAR who has historically established link with Turaifie."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Based on this information, it is thus highly apparent that the rebellion subject of Proclamation No. 216 still persists. Petitioners did not only fail to refute the data presented to this Court by the government, but more so, have mistakenly equated the end of the rebellion with the so-called liberation of Marawi City. While it is true that the President had himself declared the liberation of Marawi City on October 17, 2017,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> this declaration only signifies the fact that the actual firefighting between the rebels and government forces in the said city had been halted. However, as stated in my Separate Opinion in <i>Lagman v. Medialdea</i>, the rebellion survives in legal existence up until the rebellious movement stops.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> The cessation of the actual exchange of fire between the rebels and government forces is not enough to declare an end to the rebellion as these rebels may as well regroup and shore up their strength, as in fact, what happened in this case. Besides, as aptly noted by the <i>ponencia</i>, the announced liberation of Marawi City (on October 17, 2017) was made "nearly two months before the President's request for extension in December 2017. Such declaration does not preclude the occurrence of supervening events as the AFP discovered through its monitoring efforts."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> As held in <i>Lagman v. Medialdea</i>, "Congress may take into consideration not only data available prior to, but likewise events supervening the declaration."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>To clarify, these supervening events should not only pertain to the regrouping efforts of the aforestated rebel "remnants" but also the inclusion of other rebel groups, such as the BIFF, the Turaifie Group and the NPA, whose rebellious activities during the supervening period may have amplified - if not, complicated - the situation. As the Constitution reads, the persistence of an invasion or rebellion (together with the public requirement) is sufficient for an extension to be decreed. Nowhere has it been required that the extension should solely relate to the supervening activities of the same rebel group covered by the initial proclamation. If such were the case, then (<i>a</i>) the Constitution would have so stated or the Framers would have so discussed this requirement; or (<i>b</i>) the President would have to impractically issue a separate martial law proclamation just to cover the supervening activities of other rebel groups when, in reality, the government has to deal with the entire impact of a state of rebellion.<br><br>Besides, while not specifically identified in Proclamation No. 216, the President mentioned of "other rebel groups" therein and had, in fact, considered the siege of Marawi City as a demonstration of the capability of the Maute Group, as well as of these "other rebel groups" "to sow terror, and cause death and damage to property not only in Lanao del Sur but also in other parts of Mindanao."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> As such, it can be reasonably inferred that the identification of the Maute Group in Proclamation No. 216 was not meant to be exclusive. In this relation, the Court in <i>Lagman v. Medialdea</i>, had, in fact, recognized "the widespread atrocities in Mindanao and the linkages established among rebel groups," concluding that "the armed uprising that was initially staged in Marawi cannot be justified as confined only to Marawi."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Thus, the President and the Congress' consideration of these other rebel groups, while not specifically named in Proclamation No. 216, should be deemed as reasonable. Finally, while the NPA has been recognized to be a "decades-long rebellion," the <i>ponencia</i> correctly states that its "intensified insurgence clearly bears a significant impact on the security of Mindanao and the safety of its people, which were the very reasons for the martial law proclamation and its initial extension."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Thus, the NPA's inclusion should not render the subject extension void.<br><br><b>III. Public Safety Requires the Extension of Martial Law.</b><br><br>The Constitution not only requires the persistence of rebellion but also, that public safety still requires its extension. As earlier stated, not only does Congress have the power to decide whether or not to extend a proclamation of martial law, it also has the power to dictate the terms of extension, which includes, of course, the extension's length.<br><br>In my Separate Opinion in <i>Lagman v. Medialdea</i>, I have discussed that "the second requirement [on public safety] is a more malleable concept of discretion, whereby deference to the prudential judgment of the President, as Commander-in-Chief, to meet the exigencies of the situation should be properly accorded."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> However, I have qualified that "our deference x x x must be circumscribed within the bounds of truth and reason[:]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> truth relates to the Court's duty to ascertain the veracity of the facts presented by the government, whereas reasonableness may be determined through an overall appreciation of the surrounding circumstances. With respect to the latter, the Court may consider "the reported armed capabilities, resources, influence, and connections of the rebels"; "the historical background of the rebel movement"; and further, "the President's estimation of the rebels' future plan of action. If the estimation, when taken together with all the foregoing factors, does not seem implausible or farfetched, then this Court should defer to the President's military strategy."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>In this case, the President requested Congress to extend martial law over the entire Mindanao from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018 based on his prudential estimation that it would take such period of time to quell the rebellion:<br><blockquote>A further extension of the implementation of Martial Law and suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> in Mindanao will help the AFP, the [PNP], and all other law enforcement agencies to quell completely and put an end to the on-going rebellion in Mindanao and prevent the same from escalating to other parts of the country. Public safety indubitably requires such further extension, not only for the sake of security and public order, but more importantly to enable the government and the people of Mindanao to pursue the bigger task of rehabilitation and the promotion of a stable socio-economic growth and development.<br><br>For all these reasons, I ask the Congress of the Philippines to further extend the proclamation of Martial Law and the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> in the whole of Mindanao for a period of one (1) year, from 01 January 2018 to 31 December 2018, or for such other period of time as the Congress may determine, in accordance with Section 18, Article VII of the 1987 Philippine Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br></blockquote>After due deliberation, Congress had overwhelmingly acceded to this request, thereby showing its deference to the President as this country's chief military strategist:<br><blockquote>WHEREAS, on December 13, 2017, after thorough discussion and extensive debate, the Congress of the Philippines in a Joint Session, by two hundred forty (240) affirmative votes comprising the majority of all its Members, has determined that rebellion persists; and that public safety indubitably requires the further extension of the Proclamation of Martial Law and the Suspension of the Privilege of the Writ of <i>Habeas Corpus</i> in the Whole of Mindanao: Now, therefore, be it.<br><br><i>Resolved by the Senate and the House of Representatives in a Joint Session Assembled</i>, To further extend Proclamation No. 216, Series of 2017, entitled "Declaring a State of Martial Law and Suspending the Privilege of the Writ of <i>Habeas Corpus</i> in the Whole of Mindanao" for a period of one (1) year from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br></blockquote>As explained by Associate Justice Marvic M.V.F Leonen in his Dissenting Opinion in <i>Lagman v. Medialdea</i>, "Congress deals primarily with the wisdom behind the proclamation x x x" and "<b>[m]uch deference is x x x accorded to [it] x x x when it comes to determining the wisdom behind the imposition or <u>continued imposition of martial law or the suspension of the writ</u></b>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>The <i>ponencia</i> finds that "[t]he facts as provided by the Executive and considered by Congress amply establish that rebellion persists in Mindanao and public safety is significantly endangered by it."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> As detailed in the <i>ponencia</i>, the following circumstances and events demonstrate the public necessity to extend martial law over the entire Mindanao:<br><blockquote>(a) No less than 185 persons in the Martial Law Arrest Orders have remained at large. Remnants of the Hapilon and Maute groups have been monitored by the AFP to be reorganizing and consolidating their forces in Central Mindanao, particularly in Maguindanao, North Cotabato, Sulu and Basilan, and strengthening their financial and logistical capability.<br><br>(b) After the military operation in Marawi City, the Basilan-based ASG, the Maute Group, the Maguid Group and the Turaifie Group, comprising the DAESH-affiliate Dawlah Islamiyah that was responsible for the Marawi siege, was left with 137 members and a total of 166 firearms. These rebels, however, were able to recruit 400 new members, more or less, in Basilan, the Lanao Provinces, Sarangani, Sultan Kudarat and Maguindanao.<br><br>(c) The new recruits have since been trained in marksmanship, bombing and tactics in different areas in Lanao del Sur. Recruits with great potential are trained in producing Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and urban operations. These new members are motivated by their clannish culture, being relatives of terrorists, by revenge for relatives who perished in the Marawi operations, by money as they are paid P15,000.00 to P50,000.00, and by radical ideology.<br><br>(d) 48 FTFs have joined said rebel groups and are acting as instructors to the recruits. Foreign terrorists, from Southeast Asian countries, particularly from Indonesia and Malaysia, will continue to take advantage of the porous borders of the Philippines and enter the country illegally to join the remnants of the DAESH/ISIS-inspired rebel groups.<br><br>(e) In November 2017, 15 Indonesian and Malaysian DAESH­-inspired FTFs entered Southern Philippines to augment the remnants of the Maguid group in Sarangani province. In December 2017, 16 Indonesian DAESH-inspired FTFs entered the Southern Philippines to augment the ASG-Basilan and Maute groups in the Lanao province. In January 2018, an unidentified Egyptian DAESH figure was monitored in the Philippines.<br><br>(f) At least 32 FTFs were killed in the Marawi operations. Other FTFs attempted to enter the main battle area in Marawi, but failed because of checkpoints set up by government forces.<br><br>(g) "The DAESH-inspired DIWM groups and their allies continue to visibly offer armed resistance in other parts of Central, Western and Eastern Mindanao in spite of the neutralization of their key leaders and destruction of their forces in Marawi City." There were actually armed encounters with the remnants of said groups.<br><br>(h) "Other DAESH-inspired and like-minded threat groups such as the BIFF, AKP, DI-Maguid, DI-Toraype [Turaifie], and the ASG remain capable of staging similar atrocities and violent attacks against vulnerable targets in Mindanao, including the cities 'Of Davao, Cagayan de Oro, General Santos, Zamboanga, and Cotabato."<br><br>(i) The Turaifie [G]roup conducts roadside bombings and attacks against government forces, civilians and populated areas in Mindanao. The group plans to set off bombings in Cotabato.<br><br>(j) The Maute Group, along with foreign terrorists, were reported to be planning to bomb the cities of Zamboanga, Iligan, Cagayan de Oro and Davao.<br><br>(k) The remaining members of the ASG-Basilan have initiated five violent attacks that killed two civilians.<br><br>(l) In 2017, the remnants of the ASG in Basilan, Sulu, Tawi-Tawi and Zamboanga Peninsula, conducted 43 acts of violence, including IED attacks and kidnapping which resulted in the killing of eight innocent civilians, three of whom were mercilessly beheaded. Nine kidnap victims are still held in captivity.<br><br>(m) Hapilon's death fast-tracked the unification of the Sulu and Basilan-based ASG to achieve the common goal of establishing a DAESH-ISIS wilayat in Mindanao. This likely merger may spawn retaliatory attacks such as IED bombings, in urban areas, particularly in the cities of Zamboanga, Isabela and Lamitan.<br><br>(n) By AFP's assessment, the ISIS' regional leadership may remain in the Southern Philippines and with the defeat of ISIS in many parts of Syria and Iraq, some hardened fighters from the ASEAN may return to this region to continue their fight. The AFP also identified four potential leaders who may replace Hapilon as emir or leader of the ISIS forces in the Philippines. It warned that the Dawlah Islamiyah will attempt to replicate the Marawi siege in other cities of Mindanao and may conduct terrorist attacks in Metro Manila and Davao City as the seat of power of the Philippine Government. With the spotlight on terrorism shifting from the Middle East to Southeast Asia following the Marawi siege, the AFP likewise indicated that the influx of FTFs in the Southern Philippines will persist. The AFP further referred to possible lone-wolf attacks and atrocities from other DAESH-inspired rebel groups in vulnerable cities like Cagayan de Oro, Cotabato, Davao, General Santos, Iligan and Zamboanga.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioners, for their part, have failed to disprove the occurrence of the foregoing circumstances and events. They instead, harp on the allegation that due to the liberation of Marawi City, martial law is not anymore necessary to preserve the public's safety.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Clearly, such narrow reasoning cannot prevail over the President and the Congress' holistic appreciation of the case. With intelligence reports showing that the Maute Group has, in fact, regrouped and that other rebel groups have either linked with the DAESH/ISIS front or have taken advantage of the situation and intensified their operations, the threat to public safety undoubtedly remains present. As to whether or not the objective of resolving such threat can be achieved in one (1) year - to my mind this Court is hardly competent to provide a precise estimation. The Court's task is to determine the sufficiency of the extension's factual basis and in so doing, (a) vet if the facts presented are true, and (b) assess if the decreed extension is reasonable. As earlier intimated, if the President's estimation does not appear to be implausible or farfetched, then this Court should defer to his plan of action, especially so since Congress has further given its assent.

It assures an environment conducive to the emergence of an authoritarian.<br><br>At issue in this case is whether a longer second extension of martial law should be constitutionally allowed considering declarations of victory in Marawi as well as progress in the interdiction of terrorists.<br><br>There are no facts that support the length of the extension. There are no facts that support why martial law and the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus should be applied throughout the entirety of Mindanao. The declaration of martial law does not specify the additional powers that will be granted to the Commander-in-Chief and the military.<br><br>The President inserts a new reason for the longer second extension of martial law which was not present in Proclamation No. 216, Series of 2017: the Maoist Marxist Leninist rebellion of the Communist Party of the Philippines-New Peoples' Army-National Democratic Front. Yet, even assuming that this was constitutionally permissible, the facts as alleged by the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) show that this fifty-year protracted insurgency is declining, the result of their successes even without martial law.<br><br>The government failed to show why the normal legal framework and the professional work of the military, police and local government units are insufficient to meet the threats that they describe. The facts they present are not sufficient to support the use of the extraordinary powers of the Commander in Chief to declare martial law and the suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus.<br><br>The majority surrenders the Constitutional mandate of both Congress and this Court to do a reasonable, conscientious, and sober check on the use of the most awesome powers of the President as Commander-in-Chief. More than any constitutional organ, this Court should be the last to succumb to fear stoked by a pastiche of incidents without context. More than ever, this Court is called upon to practice its studied independence. It should show that it is an institution that can look beyond political pressure. It should be the constitutional body that does a sober and conscientious review amid the hysteria of the moment. This Court should be the last to succumb to false and simplified dichotomies.<br><br>The presentations of the government are simply allegations of reality whose basis in fact remain illegible and invisible, hidden under the cloak of the military's concept of confidentiality. Even if true, the numbers they present do not match the constitutional exigencies required.<br><br>The deliberation in Congress was hobbled by the belated request for extension from the President and the imposition of a rule by its "supermajority" clearly designed to produce no other result than accession to the wishes of the President without serious deliberation. Each representative of the House of Representatives and each Senator were to reveal the preferences of their constituents in just three (3) minutes. Three (3) minutes were all that each of them had to raise questions, clarify, and express dissent, if any. The Congress' leadership's resolute persistence to keep to such time limits sacrificed democratic parliamentary deliberation. This was grave abuse of discretion.<br><br>The Constitution requires that on a matter as important as martial law, this Court should not defer even as Congress renders itself unable to meet the expectations of democratic deliberation. The revisions introduced in 1987 guard against grave abuse of discretion as well as the failure of legislative inquiry into the sufficiency of the factual basis for invoking the Commander-in-Chief powers to declare a state of martial law and the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus.<br><br>The Constitution does not allow us to blind ourselves with any version of the political question doctrine. The majority opinion, in its proposal for a type of deferential factual review, is nothing but a reincarnation of the political question doctrine similar to that in <i>Aquino v. Enrile</i> and <i>Morales v. Enrile</i> during the darker days of martial law declared by Ferdinand E. Marcos.<br><br>We do not know the extraordinary powers that will be wielded under the rubric of martial law.

Secretary Lorenzana said:<br><blockquote>Due to compelling reasons and based on current security assessment made by the Chief of Staff, Armed Forces of the Philippines, the undersigned recommends the extension of Martial Law for another 12 months or 1 year beginning January 1, 2018 until December 31, 2018 covering the whole island of Mindanao primarily to ensure total eradication of DAESH-inspired Da'awatul Islamiyah Waliyatul Masriq (DIWM), other like-minded Local/Foreign Terrorist Groups (L/FTGs) and Armed Lawless Groups (ALGs), and the communist terrorists (CTs) and their coddlers, supporters and financiers, and to ensure speedy rehabilitation, recovery and reconstruction efforts in Marawi, and the attainment of lasting peace, stability, economic development and prosperity in Mindanao.<br><br>The previous Martial Law declaration which is still in effect until end of December 2017 has resulted in remarkable achievements, such as the death of Hapilon and the Maute brothers. However, the remnants of their groups were monitored to be continuously rebuilding their organization through the recruitment and training of new members/fighters.

Second, the Turaifie Group has likewise been monitored to be planning to conduct bombings, notably targeting the Cotabato area; Third, the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters continue to defy the government by perpetrating at least fifteen (15) violent incidents during the Martial Law period in Maguindanao and North Cotabato; Fourth, the remnants of the Abu Sayyaf Group in Basilan, Sulu, Tawi-Tawi, and Zamboanga Peninsula remain a serious security concern; and last, the New People's Army took advantage of the situation and intensified their decades-long rebellion against the government and stepped up terrorist acts against innocent civilians and private entities, as well as guerrilla warfare against the security sector and public and government infrastructure, purposely to seize political power through violent means and supplant the country's democratic form of government with Communist rule;<br><br>WHEREAS, Section 18, Article VII of the 1987 Constitution authorizes the Congress of the Philippines to extend, at the initiative of the President, such proclamation or suspension for a period to be determined by the Congress of the Philippines, if the invasion or rebellion shall persist and public safety requires it;<br><br>WHEREAS, on December 13, 2017, after thorough discussion and extensive debate, the Congress of the Philippines in a Joint Session, by two hundred forty (240) affirmative votes comprising the majority of all its Members, has determined that rebellion persists, and that public safety indubitably requires the further extension of the Proclamation of Martial Law and the Suspension of the Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus in the Whole of Mindanao; Now, therefore, be it<br><br>Resolved by the Senate and the House of Representatives in a Joint Session Assembled, To further extend Proclamation No. 216, Series of 2017, entitled "Declaring a State of Martial Law and Suspending the Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus in the Whole of Mindanao" for a period of one (1) year from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018.<br></blockquote>Thus, four (4) petitions<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> were filed before this Court, assailing Congress' act of extending martial law and the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus, as well as the President's act of recommending it.

It is a derogation of the elaborate balance of civil governance and limited government laid out in the Constitution. Martial law is a label or rubric for a set of extraordinary powers to be exercised by the President in a situation of extreme exigency. Regardless of the incumbent, the possible scope of the powers that can be exercised intrinsically calls for an examination of how it affects the fundamental individual and collective rights embedded in our constitutional order.<br><br>Martial law generally allows more powers to the AFP. The clear intent of the Constitution is for the sovereign through both its elected representatives as well as the Supreme Court to do an exacting review of a declaration of martial law.<br><br>The heightened scrutiny in Article VII, Section 18 already includes the power to review whether the President in his proclamation or request for extension, or the Congress in its decision to extend, has gravely abused its discretion. The Supreme Court does not lose its powers under Article VIII, Section 1<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> simply with an invocation of Article VII, Section 18. The result would be the absurd situation of hobbling judicial review when the Constitution requires the Court to exercise its full powers.<br><br>Besides, both powers were properly invoked in the consolidated petitions.<br><br>There can be no rational review if the powers that the President wishes to exercise are not clearly defined. There can be no rational review if all that we are presented with is a declaration of the state of martial law-a description, label, or rubric-not the actual powers that the Commander-in­-Chief, through the military, is willing to exercise in derogation of the regular powers already granted by the Constitution and statutes. A declaration of a state of martial law is superfluous when ambiguous or when it simply reiterates powers which can be exercised by the Chief Executive.<br><br>This is the situation we have in this case. We have an ambiguous declaration of martial law with no unique powers over an area that is too broad, where the fear of skirmishes in which imminence has not also been proven to exist. There are no actual debilitating confrontations deserving of martial law powers. There are no confrontations that could not be solved by the calling out powers of the President or the surgical application of the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus.<br><br>There is no rebellion that endangers public safety as required by the Constitution as basis for the declaration of martial law or the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus.<br><br>Article VII, Section 18, when properly invoked, raises issues with respect to (a) the reasonability of the extension of the declaration of the state of martial law or the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, and (b) the sufficiency of the factual basis for the declaration of the state of martial law and the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus. These two relate to each other. Both must pass both congressional and judicial inquiry.<br><br>On one hand, the reasonability of the extension of the state of martial law and the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus will depend on the following inquiries:<br><br>(a) whether the powers originally granted were properly exercised and it was not the inability to effectively and efficiently wield them that caused the extension;<br><br>(b) whether the past application of defined powers, under the declaration of a state of martial law and the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus, was conducted in a manner which did not unduly interfere with fundamental rights. In other words, the Court needs to be convinced that the powers requested under martial law were and will be exercised in a manner least restrictive of fundamental rights;<br><br>(c) whether the proposed extension has clear, reasonable, and attainable targets, and therefore, whether the period requested is supported by these aims;<br><br>(d) whether there are credible and workable rules of engagement for the exercise of the powers properly disseminated through the ranks of the military that will implement martial law; and<br><br>(e) whether there is basis for the scope of the area requested for the extension of the declaration of martial law and the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus.<br><br>On the other hand, the sufficiency of the factual basis for the declaration or the suspension consists of two (2) elements. Both elements must prove rebellion and the necessity of the extraordinary powers for public safety purposes.<br><br>The first element of this part of the inquiry is the concept of "factual basis." It must not only depend on factual assertions made by the military. The basis for the factual assertions must be presented in a reasonable manner. That is, that this Court must distinguish and evaluate the relationship between <i>factum probandum</i> and <i>factum probans</i>-between the ultimate facts alleged and the evidentiary facts used, and the reasonability of the inferences to arrive at the allegations.<br><br>The second element of this inquiry is the concept of the "sufficiency" of the factual basis. This means that it should relate to the powers necessary for the evil it seeks to prevent.<br><br>The "evil" sought to be addressed by clearly defined powers under a state of martial law is the presence of actual-not imminent-rebellion, and "public safety" is a necessity for the exercise of such powers. "Public safety" cannot be the damage or injury inherent in acts of rebellion. If that is so, then there would have been no necessity to make it a textual requirement in Article VII, Section 18. Rather, it should mean more. In examining the history of martial law in general, and the clear expressed desire to avoid the kind of martial law imposed through Proclamation 1081 in 1972, we see that martial law is imposed in a situation where civil and/or judicial authority could not exercise its usual powers. The history of martial law in this country also implies that such exigency should require a measured and definitive timetable, target, and strategy.<br><br>In both general inquiries, the extraordinary powers-as well as their scope and limitations-should be clear. Apart from making them clear to those that will review, they should be made public and transparent. They cannot be confidential.<br><br>Both Congressional and judicial reviews include these two (2) basic inquiries: whether there are clear, transparent, and necessary powers articulated under martial law, and whether the declaration of such kind of martial law is supported by sufficient factual basis.<br><br>Unlike the Court, Congress may provide for oversight in the exercise of powers by the President as Commander-in-Chief. Such oversight may be to ensure that the fundamental rights of citizens are guaranteed even under a state of martial law or with the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus. The possible abuse of discretion in the lack of oversight exercised by Congress is not in issue in this case but, in my view, should likewise be justiciable due to the extraordinary nature of these Commander­-in-Chief prerogatives.<br><br>Both the President and Congress also gravely abused their discretion when they failed to make public the powers that are to be exercised by the military, the remedies, and the strategy. Public participation in quelling the rebellion, assuming that it exists, should always be encouraged. There should no longer be any secret decrees.<br><br>Congress gravely abused its discretion in that it extended the proclamation of a state of martial law and the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus (a) without a proper presentation of all the facts in their proper context; (b) without examining the basis of the conclusions inherent in the allegations of facts by the military; (c) without knowing the powers that will be exercised that are unique to the declaration of a state of martial law; and (d) without ascertaining why there needed to be a longer extension in the same area even with the declaration of continued victories by the military.<br><br>All these were unexamined because of the existence of the fifth ground that rendered the extension unconstitutional. There was (e) a lack of deliberation. The deliberation was hobbled by the late request submitted by the President to extend the declaration and the rules of Congress which unconstitutionally restricted discussion. Each representative of each district and each nationally elected Senator were given only three minutes to interpellate, clarify, and express their dissent, if any.<br><br>The facts presented were generalized and meant to justify extraordinary powers on the basis of general fears of what might happen. They listed a litany of violent confrontations, past and present, with no coherent timeline.<br><br>Terrorism and rebellion are vastly different. Even the aims of each group categorized as terrorists and enumerated in the presentations of the government are different. Some of the groups are separated in terms of ideology and methods. Many of these groups are continuously driven by internal and violent divisions. It is illogical and deceiving to present them as a coordinated enemy, and therefore, accumulate their collective strengths to stoke fear of potential catastrophe. This is fear mongering at its best and this Court should provide the sobriety called for by the Constitution.<br><br>More importantly, the government has not highlighted its victories. It has not presented how its normal law enforcement abilities have been able to disrupt and interdict past attempts to sow chaos and discord. It has not shown why its ordinary capabilities remain short to address all the law-and­-order problems it enumerates.<br><br><center><b>III</b><br></center><br>Judicial review, properly invoked, is not a privilege of this Court. It is its sworn duty.<br><br>The textual evolution of Article VII, Section 18 of the Constitution and the context in which it was formulated reveals a mandate for this Court not to give full deference to the Executive when the Commander-in-Chief powers are exercised. The present text entails a heightened and stricter mode of review.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Under the Malolos Constitution, the President of the Republic was granted very broad Commander-in-Chief powers.

The Governor General was given the power to "suspend the privileges of the writ of habeas corpus, <i>or place the Islands, or any part thereof under martial law</i>" but only "in case of rebellion or invasion, or imminent danger thereof." In the exercise of these powers, legislative concurrence was not necessary. The Governor General, however, was required to notify the President of the United States of such declaration. Only the President may vacate the action of the Governor General.<br><br>The 1935 Constitution also gave the President the power to call out the armed forces, and to suspend the writ of habeas corpus or to place the Philippines or any part thereof under martial law:<br><blockquote>Section 10<br><br>...<br><br>(2) The President shall be commander-in-chief of all armed forces of the Philippines, and, whenever it becomes necessary, he may call out such armed forces to prevent or suppress lawless violence, invasion, insurrection, or rebellion.

This was challenged in <i>Montenegro v. Castañeda</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Similar to <i>Barcelon</i>, a policy of non-interference was adopted in <i>Montenegro</i>.

Courts may, therefore, inquire whether the power was exercised in accordance with the Constitution:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><blockquote>Indeed, the grant of power to suspend the privilege is neither absolute nor unqualified. The authority conferred by the Constitution, both under the Bill of Rights and under the Executive Department, is limited and conditional. The precept in the Bill of Rights establishes a general rule, as well as an exception thereto. What is more, it postulates the former in the <i>negative</i>, evidently to stress its importance, by providing that "(t)he privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> shall <i>not</i> be suspended . . . ." It is only by way of <i>exception</i> that it permits the suspension of the privilege "in cases of invasion, insurrection, or rebellion" -or, under Art. VII of the Constitution, "imminent danger thereof" - "when the public safety requires it, in any of which events the same may be suspended wherever during such period the necessity for such suspension shall exist." <i>Far from being full and plenary, the authority to suspend the privilege of the writ is thus circumscribed, confined and restricted, not only by the prescribed setting or the conditions essential to its existence, but, also, as regards the time when and the place where it may be exercised.</i> These factors and the aforementioned setting or conditions mark, establish and define the extent, the confines and the limits of said power, beyond which it does not exist. And, like the limitations and restrictions imposed by the Fundamental Law upon the legislative department, adherence thereto and compliance therewith may, within proper bounds, be inquired into by courts of justice. Otherwise, the explicit constitutional provisions thereon would be meaningless. Surely, the framers of our Constitution could not have intended to engage in such a wasteful exercise in futility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Despite these pronouncements, this Court upheld the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> ruling that the existence of a rebellion and that public safety required such suspension.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>In In the <i>Matter of the Petition for Habeas Corpus of Aquino et al. v.

The majority of this Court in <i>Aquino</i> held that the declaration of martial law was purely political in nature and therefore, may not be inquired into by this Court.<br><br>The 1973 Constitution reiterated the President's Commander-in-Chief powers under the 1935 Constitution. Article VII, Section 11 provides:<br><blockquote>Section 11. The President shall be commander-in-chief of all armed forces of the Philippines and, whenever it becomes necessary, he may call out such armed forces to prevent or suppress lawless violence, invasion, insurrection, or rebellion. In case of invasion, insurrection, or rebellion, or imminent danger thereof, when the public safety requires it, he may suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, or place the Philippines or any part thereof under martial law.<br></blockquote>This Court in <i>In the Issuance of the Writ of Habeas Corpus for Parong et al. v. Enrile,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> expressly reverted to the doctrine in Barcelon and Montenegro regarding deference to the President upon the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus:<br><blockquote>In times of war or national emergency, the legislature may surrender a part of its power of legislation to the President. Would it not be as proper and wholly acceptable to lay down the principle that during such crises, the judiciary should be less jealous of its power and more trusting of the Executive in the exercise of its emergency powers in recognition of the same necessity? Verily, the existence of the emergencies should be left to President's sole and unfettered determination. His exercise of the power to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus on the occasion thereof, should also be beyond judicial review. Arbitrariness, as a ground for judicial inquiry of presidential acts and decisions, sounds good in theory but impractical and unrealistic, considering how well-nigh impossible it is for the courts to contradict the finding of the President on the existence of the emergency that gives occasion for the exercise of the power to suspend the privilege of the writ. For the Court to insist on reviewing Presidential action on the ground of arbitrariness may only result in a violent collision of two jealous powers with tragic consequences, by all means to be avoided, in favor of adhering to the more desirable and long-tested doctrine of "political question" in reference to the power of judicial review.<br><br>Amendment No. 6 of the 1973 Constitution, as earlier cited, affords further reason for the reexamination of the Lansang doctrine and reversion to that of Barcelon vs. Baker and Montenegro vs. Castañeda.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Shortly after the promulgation of Parong, this Court ruled upon <i>In the Matter of the Petition for Habeas Corpus of Morales, Jr. v.

The propriety of the declaration of martial law and the suspension of the privilege of the writ is therefore "justiciable and within the ambit of judicial review."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> This Court is further mandated to promulgate its decision within a period of 30 days from the filing of an "appropriate proceeding" by "any citizen."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>The active roles of the two (2) branches of government were further differentiated in my dissenting opinion in <i>Lagman v. Medialdea</i>:<br><blockquote>The framers also intended for the Congress to have a considerably broader review power than the Judiciary and to play an active role following the President's proclamation of martial law or suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>. Unlike the Court which can only act upon an appropriate proceeding filed by any citizen, Congress may, by voting jointly and upon a majority vote, revoke such proclamation or suspension. The decision to revoke is not premised on how factually correct the President's invocation of his Commander-in-Chief powers are, rather, Congress is permitted a wider latitude in how it chooses to respond to the President's proclamation or suspension. While the Court is limited to reviewing the sufficiency of the factual basis behind the President's proclamation or suspension, Congress does not operate under such constraints and can strike down the President's exercise of his Commander-in-Chief powers as it pleases without running afoul of the Constitution.<br><br>With its veto power and power to extend the duration of martial law upon the President's initiative and as a representative of its constituents, Congress is also expected to continuously monitor and review the situation on the areas affected by martial law. Unlike the Court which is mandated to promulgate its decision within thirty (30) days from the time a petition questioning the proclamation is filed, Congress is not saddled with a similar duty. While the Court is mandated to look into the sufficiency of the factual basis and whether or not the proclamation was attended with grave abuse of discretion, Congress deals primarily with the wisdom behind the proclamation or suspension. Much deference is thus accorded to Congress and is treated as the President's co-equal when it comes to determining the wisdom behind the imposition or continued imposition of martial law or suspension of the writ.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br></blockquote>The 1987 Constitution also makes it easier to question the propriety of the declaration of martial law or the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus in that it allows "any citizen" to file an appropriate proceeding. The provision, in effect, relaxes the rules on <i>locus standi</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>The heightened level of judicial scrutiny will be further discussed in this opinion.<br><br><center><b>IV</b><br></center><br>Public respondents failed to address the requirement that public safety requires for the extension of martial law.<br><br>The first paragraph of Article VII, Section 18 of the Constitution mentions the phrase "public safety requires it" twice. The first reference in the constitutional text refers to the original proclamation of martial law or the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus. The second reference to the requirement of public safety refers to the extension of any proclamation, thus:<br><blockquote>Section 18. The President shall be the Commander-in-Chief of all armed forces of the Philippines and whenever it becomes necessary, he may call out such armed forces to prevent or suppress lawless violence, invasion or rebellion. In case of invasion or rebellion, <b><i>when the public safety requires it</i></b>, he may, for a period not exceeding sixty days, suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus or place the Philippines or any part thereof under martial law. Within forty-eight hours from the proclamation of martial law or the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, the President shall submit a report in person or in writing to the Congress. The Congress, voting jointly, by a vote of at least a majority of all its Members in regular or special session, may revoke such proclamation or suspension, which revocation shall not be set aside by the President. Upon the initiative of the President, the Congress may, in the same manner, extend such proclamation or suspension for a period to be determined by the Congress, if the invasion or rebellion shall persist <b><i>and public safety requires it</i></b>. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>The Constitution requires that martial law may be imposed not only if there is rebellion or invasion. It also requires that <b><i>it is indispensable to public safety</i></b>. The resulting damage or injuries cannot simply be the usual consequences of rebellion or invasion. It must be of such nature that the powers to be exercised under the rubric of martial law or with the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus are indispensable to address the scope of the conflagration. The mere allegation of the existence of rebellion is not enough.<br><br>A review of the history of the concept of martial law in general and as applied to our jurisdiction is necessary in order to understand what the present provision requires.<br><br>The beginnings of the concept of martial law in England from 1300 to 1638 are discussed in The Early History of Martial Law in England from the Fourteenth Century to the Petition of Right<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup>:<br><blockquote>The term martial law refers to a summary form of criminal justice, exercised under direct or delegated royal authority by the military or police forces of the Crown, which is independent of the established processes of the common law courts, the ecclesiastical courts, and the courts which administered the civil law in England. Martial law is not a body of substantive law, but rather summary powers employed when the ordinary rule of law is suspended. "It is not law," wrote Sir Matthew Hale, "but something rather indulged than allowed as a law . . . and that only in cases of necessity."<br><br>. . . .<br><br>From the beginnings of summary procedure against rebels in the reign of Edward I until the mid-sixteenth century, martial law was regarded in both its forms as the extraordinary usages of war, to be employed only in time of war or open rebellion in the realm, and never as an adjunct of the regular criminal law. Beginning in the mid-1550s, however, the Crown began to claim the authority to expand the hitherto carefully circumscribed jurisdiction of martial law beyond situations of war or open rebellion and into territory which had been the exclusive domain of the criminal law . . .<br></blockquote>Comparatively, in <i>Duncan v.

However, General Order No. 3 removed from the jurisdiction of the judiciary the following cases:<br><br>1. Those involving the validity, legality or constitutionality of Proclamation No. 1081 dated September 21, 1972, or of any decree, order or acts issued, promulgated or [performed] by me or by my duly designated representative pursuant thereto.

However, under his version of martial law, President Marcos placed all his actions beyond judicial review and vested in himself the power to "legally," by virtue of his General Orders, do anything, without limitation. It was clearly not necessary to make President Marcos a dictator to enable civil government to maintain peace and order. President Marcos also prohibited the expression of dissent, prohibiting "rallies, demonstrations, and other forms of group actions" in the premises not only of public utilities, but schools, colleges, and even companies engaged in the production of products of exports. Clearly, these powers were not necessary to enable the civil government to execute its functions and maintain peace and order, but rather, to enable him to continue as self-­made dictator.<br><br>President Marcos' implementation of martial law was a total abuse and bastardization of the concept of martial law. A reading of the powers which President Marcos intended to exercise makes it abundantly clear that there was no public necessity that demanded that the President be given those powers. Martial law was a stratagem. It was an artifice to hide the weaknesses of his leadership as people rose up to challenge him. It was ruse to perpetuate himself in power despite the term limitations in the 1973 Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br></blockquote>It is in this context that the 1987 Constitution imposed further safeguards. It was in response to the authoritarian tendencies that a commander-in-chief may display. It was part of a constitution ratified by the sovereign Filipino people that lived through these abuses. <b><i>Among others, it required not simply the allegation of facts showing rebellion, but a showing of the necessity to exercise specific extraordinary powers to ensure public safety.</i></b><br><br><b><i>The 1987 Constitution returned to the original concept of martial law: a set of extraordinary powers arising only from a clear necessity, declared because civil governance is no longer possible. The authority to place the Philippines or any part thereof under martial law is not a definition of a power, but a declaration of a status - that there exists a situation wherein there is no capability for civilian government to continue. It is a declaration of a condition on the ground, that there is a vacuum of government authority, and by virtue of such vacuum, military rule becomes necessary. Further, it is a temporary state, for military rule to be exercised until civil government may be restored.</i></b><br><br>This Court cannot dictate the parameters of what powers the President may exercise under a state of martial law to address a rebellion or invasion. For this Court to tell the President exactly how to govern under a state of martial law would be undue interference with the President's powers. There may be many different permutations of governance under a martial law regime. It takes different forms, as may be necessary.<br><br><b><i>However, while this Court cannot state the parameters for the President's martial law, this Court's constitutional role is to require that the President provide the parameters himself, upon declaring martial law. The Constitution, in my reading, requires Congress to examine the powers to be wielded in relation to the facts provided. The proclamation and any extension must contain the powers he intends to wield. The powers under the rubric of martial law must reasonably relate to the exigency.</i></b><br><br>In these consolidated cases, both the President, in requesting for the extension of the "state of martial law" and the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus, as well as Congress, in granting the extension, committed grave abuse of discretion. Proclamation No. 216 s. 217, the President's request for extension and the Resolution of Both Houses No. 4 does not define the powers to be wielded. It is a carte blanche grant of extraordinary power to the President, which the Constitution does not sanction.<br><br>The absence of the public safety necessity for a declaration of martial law and the suspension of the privilege of the writ is clear from the documents presented.

In his Letter to Congress, he stated that "<b><i>[p]ublic safety indubitably requires such further extension, not only for the sake of security and public order, but more importantly to enable the government and the people of Mindanao to pursue the bigger task of rehabilitation and the promotion of a stable socio-economic growth and development</i></b>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> Certainly, these objectives could be achieved through the ordinary efforts of the local government units concerned. <b><i>These are not bases for the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus or the declaration of martial law.

There must be a showing that these groups are committing rebellion and that the rebellion has become of such magnitude that public safety requires the imposition of martial law.<br><br><center><b>V</b><br></center><br>This Court can only assess whether the public safety requires the imposition of martial law or its extension if it sees the reasonability of the specific remedy sought, in relation to the facts established.

In other words, we should not content ourselves with the <i>factum probandum</i> or what is alleged. We should also review the <i>factum probans</i> as well. A proper review of the "sufficiency of the factual basis" requires that this Court examine the evidentiary facts that would tend to prove the ultimate facts and the premises of the inferences used to arrive at the conclusions made by the government.<br><br>The government, through the AFP, regaled this Court with its allegations of fact. This was accepted by the majority in Congress and the majority in this Court. There was no effort to reveal the general sources of this intelligence information, the nuances in the analysis of the various groups, and the premises used to make the inferences from the sources which they gathered.<br><br>In other words, the majority accepts only the allegations of fact of the Armed Forces and the President. Certainly, this cannot meet the Constitutional requirement that this Court review the "sufficiency of the factual basis" of the declaration of martial law or the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus.<br><br>This Court often discusses the difference between ultimate and evidentiary facts in relation to pleadings, and what must be alleged to establish a cause of action. Ultimate facts are the facts that constitute a cause of action. Thus, a pleading must contain allegations of ultimate facts, so that a court may ascertain whether, assuming the allegations to be true, a pleading states a cause of action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> Of course, the veracity of the ultimate facts will be established during trial, generally through the presentation of evidence that will prove evidentiary facts. In <i>Tantuico, Jr. v. Republic</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> this Court explained:<br><blockquote>The rules on pleading speak of two (2) kinds of facts: the first, the "ultimate facts", and the second, the "evidentiary facts." In Remitere vs. Vda. de Yulo, the term "ultimate facts" was defined and explained as follows:<br><blockquote>"The term 'ultimate facts' as used in Sec. 3, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court, means the essential facts constituting the plaintiff's cause of action. A fact is essential if it cannot be stricken out without leaving the statement of the cause of action insufficient . . . ." (Moran, Rules of Court, Vol. 1, 1963 ed., p. 213).<br><br>"Ultimate facts are important and substantial facts which either directly form the basis of the primary right and duty, or which directly make up the wrongful acts or omissions of the defendant. The term does not refer to the details of probative matter or particulars of evidence by which these material elements are to be established. It refers to principal, determinate, constitutive facts, upon the existence of which, the entire cause of action rests."<br></blockquote>while the term "evidentiary fact" has been defined in the following tenor: <br><blockquote>"Those facts which are necessary for determination of the ultimate facts; they are the premises upon which conclusions of ultimate facts are based. Womack v. Industrial Comm., 168 Colo. 364, 451 P.2d 761, 764. Facts which furnish evidence of existence of some other fact."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br></blockquote></blockquote>Another basic rule that this Court must not lose sight of in its undertaking is that a bare allegation is not evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> Surmise is not evidence,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> conjecture is not evidence,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> suspicion is not evidence,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> and probability is not evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br>Worth noting is the emphasis on the importance of credible evidence.

Republic</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><blockquote>Basic is the rule that bare allegations, unsubstantiated by evidence, are not equivalent to proof, i.e., mere allegations are not evidence. Based on the records, this Court finds that there exists insufficient factual or legal basis to conclude that Felipe's sexual infidelity and irresponsibility can be equated with psychological incapacity as contemplated by law. We reiterate that there was no other evidence adduced. Aside from the psychologist, petitioner did not present other witnesses to substantiate her allegations on Felipe's infidelity notwithstanding the fact that she claimed that their relatives saw him with other women. Her testimony, therefore, is considered self-serving and had no serious evidentiary value.<br></blockquote>Thus, although a psychologist testified as to the link between the husband's infidelity and psychological incapacity in <i>Castillo</i>, this Court reiterated that the courts, in all the cases they try, must base judgments on the totality of evidence adduced during their proceedings:<br><blockquote>It bears repeating that the trial courts, as in all the other cases they try, must always base their judgments not solely on the expert opinions presented by the parties but on the totality of evidence adduced in the course of their proceedings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br></blockquote>Likewise in <i>Dela Llana v.

However, none of these pieces of evidence show the causal relation between the vehicular accident and the whiplash injury. In other words, <b>Dra. dela Llana, during trial, did not adduce the <i>factum probans</i> or the evidentiary facts by which the <i>factum probandum or the ultimate fact can be established</i></b>, as fully discussed below.<br><br>Dra. dela Llana contends that the pictures of the damaged car show that the massive impact of the collision caused her whiplash injury. We are not persuaded by this bare claim. Her insistence that these pictures show the causation grossly belies common logic. These pictures indeed demonstrate the impact of the collision. However, it is a far-fetched assumption that the whiplash injury can also be inferred from these pictures.<br></blockquote>Also, in <i>Gomez v. Gomez</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><blockquote>Before proceeding further, it is well to note that the <i>factum probandum</i> petitioner is trying to establish here is still the alleged intercalation of the Deeds of Donation on blank pieces of paper containing the signatures of Consuelo. The <i>factum probans</i> this time around is the alleged payment of the Donors Tax after the death of Consuelo.<br><br><b>Firstly, it is apparent at once that there is a failure of the <i>factum probans</i>, even if successfully proven, to prove in turn the <i>factum probandum</i>.</b> As intimated by respondents, payment of the Donors Tax after the death of Consuelo does not necessarily prove the alleged intercalation of the Deeds of Donation on blank pieces of paper containing the signatures of Consuelo.<br><br><b>Secondly, petitioner failed to prove this <i>factum probandum</i>.</b><br><br>Ariston, Jr. never testified that Consuelo herself physically and personally delivered PCIB Check No. A144-73211 to the BIR.

Neither did petitioner present any evidence that the records of the BIR Commissioner were falsified or antedated, thus, letting the presumption that a public official had regularly performed his duties stand. This is in contrast to respondents direct evidence attesting to the payment of said tax during the lifetime of Consuelo. With respect to respondents evidence, all that petitioner could offer in rebuttal is another speculation totally unsupported by evidence: the alleged fabrication thereof.</b><br></blockquote>In <i>Vda. de Viray v.

They were, however, unsuccessful in adducing the <i>factum probans</i> or the evidentiary facts by which the <i>factum probandum</i> or ultimate fact can be established.</b><br></blockquote>Finally, in <i>People v.

The complainants duly proved by their respective testimonies that said accused was involved in the entire recruitment process. Their testimonies in this regard, being clear and positive, were declared sufficient to establish that <i>factum probandum</i>.<br><br>Indeed, the trial court was justified and correct in accepting the version of the prosecution witnesses, their statements being positive and affirmative in nature. This is more worthy of credit than the mere uncorroborated and self-serving denials of appellant. The lame defense consisting of such bare denials by appellant cannot overcome the evidence presented by the prosecution proving her guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<br></blockquote>To establish that the factual basis for the extension of martial law is sufficient, the government has to show evidence for its factual allegations as well as the context for its inference. An enumeration of violent incidents containing nothing but the area of the incident, the type of violent incident, and the date of the incident, without its sources and the basis for its inference, does not meet the sufficiency of the factual basis to show persisting rebellion and the level of threat to public safety that will support a declaration of martial law or the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus.<br><br>There are two (2) <i>facta probanda</i>, or ultimate facts, necessary to establish that martial law was properly extended, namely: (1) the persistence of an actual rebellion; and (2) that public safety requires the extension of martial law.<br><br>Of course, no single piece of evidence can establish these ultimate facts. There must be an attempt to establish them through evidentiary facts, which must, in turn, be proved by evidence-not bare allegations, not suspicion, not conjecture.<br><br>Letters stating that rebellion persists and that public safety requires the extension of martial law do not prove the <i>facta probanda</i>. The letters only prove that the writers thereof wrote that rebellion persists and public safety requires the extension of martial law. Lists of violent incidents do not prove the <i>facta probanda</i>; they only tend to prove the <i>factum probans</i> that there were, in fact, violent incidents that occurred. But, assuming the evidence is credible to prove the <i>factum probans</i> that violent incidents have occurred, this <i>factum probans</i>, without context, is insufficient to show that rebellion persists.<br><br>We do not conflate the <i>factum probandum</i> with the <i>factum probans</i>. Muddling the two undermines the review required by the Constitution. It will lead this Court to simply accept the allegations of the government without any modicum of review.<br><br><center><b>VII</b><br></center><br>Put differently, the factual basis for the proclamation of martial law and its extension must not only be those that are alleged, but also that the allegation must be sufficient or credible. The facts can only be judicially deemed sufficient if their basis is transparent and legible. The basis relied upon for the proclamation of martial law or its extension must be shown, to a certain degree of confidence, to be factually true based upon the credibility of its intelligence sources and the viability of its inferences. Sufficient validation must be shown in terms of the suggestions made by intelligence sources, as well as checking on the reliability of the process of reaching a conclusion. The conclusion must be factually sufficient as of the time of the review both by Congress and then by this Court.<br><br>The President cannot be expected to personally gather intelligence information from the ground. He or she would have to rely on intelligence reports given by those under his or her command.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> That it is based on intelligence information does not mean that Congress and the Court cannot inquire further because of its confidentiality. Otherwise, there will be no sense in the review of the factual sufficiency for the exercise of the powers of the Commander-in-Chief.<br><br>Intelligence information is gathered through five (5) intelligence information disciplines namely: (1) signals intelligence; (2) human intelligence; (3) open-source intelligence; (4) geospatial intelligence; and (5) measurement and signatures intelligence. I described these intelligence information disciplines in my dissenting opinion in <i>Lagman</i>:<br><blockquote>Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) refers to the interception of communications between individuals and "electronic transmissions that can be collected by ships, planes, ground sites, or satellites."<br><br>Human Intelligence (HUMINT) refers to information collected from human sources either through witness interviews or clandestine operations.<br><br>By the term itself, Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) refers to readily-­accessible information within the public domain. Open-Source Intelligence sources include "traditional media, Internet forums and media, government publications, and professional or academic papers."<br><br>Newspapers and radio and television broadcasts are more specific examples of Open-Source Intelligence sources from which intelligence analysts may collect data.<br><br>Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) pertains to imagery of activities on earth. An example of geospatial intelligence is a "satellite photo of a foreign military base with topography[.]"<br><br>Lastly, Measures and Signatures Intelligence (MASINT) refers to "scientific and highly technical intelligence obtained by identifying and analyzing environmental byproducts of developments of interests, such as weapons tests." Measures and Signatures Intelligence has been helpful in "identify[ing] chemical weapons and pinpoint[ing] the specific features of unknown weapons systems."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Intelligence reports must be shown to have at least undergone a rigorous analytical process for them to be considered truthful and worthy of belief. It is not enough that facts are gathered through the five (5) intelligence collection disciplines. Good intelligence requires good analysis. The information gathered must be analyzed through the application of specialized skills and the use of analytical tools. For instance, levels of confidence may be ascribed to determine the quality and reliability of the information. Information, assumptions, and judgments may also have to be differentiated so as not to muddle established facts with mere assumptions. All these processes require the use of sound logic.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br>In this case, there is no sufficient factual basis that would support Congress' act of extending the proclamation of martial law in Mindanao.<br><br>No intelligence information-other than possibly a power point presentation-was given to each member of the House of Representatives and the Senate from which they could assess if an extension of martial law in Mindanao was warranted.

Strangely however, the AFP claims that "both factions still reinforce each other"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup> and that some BIFF elements "also coddle and provide support to their comrades and relatives under the group of former Vice Chairman for Internal Affairs Abu Turaifie."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup> Again, no evidence was presented to indicate coordination between the two (2) factions or the coordination of some BFF elements with Turaifie. As such, these claims remain to be mere allegations. The reasons for the factionalism have not been presented. The motive to move together in joint operations have not been presented. Neither have cases been presented as to their ability to join forces in the past.<br><br>The AFP's assessment that "[o]ther DAESH-inspired and like-minded rebel groups remain capable of staging similar atrocities and violent attacks against vulnerable targets in Mindanao"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup> also does not appear to be supported by any evidence. Assuming that this assertion is truthful and accurate, the capability to commit atrocities does not conclusively or even remotely establish that rebellion exists, that it is imminent, or that the requirement of public safety as required by the constitution exists.<br><br>The AFP assessed that the Dawlah Islamiyah is attempting "to replicate the siege of Marawi in other cities or areas in Mindanao to achieve their goal of establishing a wilayat."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup> However, this assessment is only based on the alleged continuous recruitment and training activities of these groups and on the alleged "support of Foreign Terrorist Fighters."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup> These allegations were further not substantiated by the AFP during their presentation.<br><br>The woeful numbers of terrorist personnel (537) and the belief in the possibility of their coordination alone does not support this portrayal of being able to establishing a <i>wilayat</i>. It is not based on credible evidence.<br><br>Worse, the portrayal is inaccurate, even <i>beyond conjecture</i>, as it is incompatible with the known context here in the Philippines. Even a cursory look at the context of Islam in the Philippines would reveal that the portrayal of the DAESH-inspired groups is incongruous with the current understanding of ISIS, DAESH, the local terrorist groups, or the ARMM and its populace.<br><br>As discussed in my dissenting opinion in <i>Lagman</i>, adherence to DAESH ideology would naturally alienate the Muslim population throughout Mindanao.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup> The DAESH brand of Islam is fundamentally nihilistic and apocalyptic, and unabashedly medieval.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> DAESH has been described as following Salafi-jihadis.

The President asked and Congress approved that the implementation of martial law and the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus cover the entire Mindanao area. It is true that law enforcement will be required to disrupt any nefarious intention. Certainly, however, justifying law enforcement is a world apart from justifying the factual sufficiency for martial law or the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus.<br><br><center><b>XI</b><br></center><br>Fourth, the President and his advisers failed to explain why Congress should "further extend the proclamation of Martial Law and the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus in the whole of Mindanao for a period of one (1) year or from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018. Likewise, there is no explanation why the original period of 60 days was insufficient. There was likewise no explanation why the first extension of a few months was also not enough.<br><br>At the very least, the recommendation of AFP Chief of Staff General Guerrero should have enumerated targets or specific objectives that the AFP intended to accomplish during the extension. No success indicators were even mentioned in his recommendation to the President. The request for a one (1)-year extension of martial law, therefore, appears to be unreasonable and arbitrary as there is no correlation between the objectives of the extension to the requested time frame.<br><br>The President, through the recommendation of AFP Chief of Staff General Guerrero, stated that the extension of martial law and the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus in Mindanao would help all law enforcement agencies to "quell completely and put an end to the on-going rebellion in Mindanao and prevent the same from escalating to other parts of the country,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[121]</sup> without stating the powers he would be requiring to accomplish these objectives. The ambiguous objective seems to guarantee further extensions. The failure of the majority to see that the facts are not sufficient to support an extension almost guarantees those extensions.<br><br>Strangely, the AFP seeks the extension of martial law and the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus in Mindanao not to "gain any extra power . . . but to hasten the accomplishment of the AFP's mandated task in securing the safety of our people in Mindanao, in particular and the whole country, in general."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup> The AFP did not specify in its presentation what powers they would use during the extension of martial law.

It appears to be an afterthought to bolster the factual milieu in view of the military successes in relation to the alleged DAESH-related groups.<br><br>The insurrection by the related groups under the wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines or the New Peoples' Army or the National Democratic Front was not in the proclamation or used as basis for the first extension of the declaration of the state of martial law and the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup> There is also no explanation why this ongoing insurrection should be the basis for extending martial law or suspending the writ of habeas corpus only throughout Mindanao considering that there are isolated incidents of violence attributed to this group in other parts of the country. Nor was there any explanation why the exercise of these Commander-in-Chief powers will be for one year considering that the engagement with the army has been for more than fifty years. It is not clear what is sought to be achieved within this one-year period in relation to this group.<br><br>The initial declaration of martial law was based on the acts of the Maute group on May 23, 2017. Proclamation No. 216 reads, in part:<br><blockquote>WHEREAS, today 23 May 2017, the same Maute terrorist group has taken over a hospital in Marawi City, Lanao del Sur, established several checkpoints within the City, burned down certain government and private facilities and inflicted casualties on the part of Government forces, and started flying the flag of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) in several areas, thereby openly attempting to remove from the allegiance to the Philippine Government this part of Mindanao and deprive the Chief Executive of his powers and prerogatives to enforce the laws of the land and to maintain public order and safety in Mindanao, constituting the crime of rebellion; and<br><br>WHEREAS, this recent attack shows the capability of the Maute group and other rebel groups to sow terror, and cause death and damage to property not only in Lanao del Sur but also in other parts of Mindanao.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[124]</sup><br></blockquote>A perusal of Proclamation No. 216 reveals that the true intent of the initial declaration of martial law was to quell the rebellion allegedly carried out by the Maute group and other DAESH-inspired groups. It was premised solely on the alleged fslan of the DAESH-inspired groups to establish a <i>wilayah</i> in Mindanao.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[125]</sup> Proclamation No. 216 referred to and highlighted the atrocities that the DAESH-inspired groups committed but nowhere did it mention the communist insurgency led by the NPA or acts attributable to the NPA.<br><br>That Proclamation No. 216 was limited in its scope to the DAESH­ inspired groups is even more magnified by the Solicitor General's admission in this case that the focus of the initial proclamation of martial law "was the Marawi S[ie]ge . . . and the Daesh inspired rebellious groups"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[126]</sup> as well as evidence presented by the government in <i>Lagman v.

Around one thousand seven hundred twenty-two (1,722) residents of Marawi City had been rescued and a total of sixteen (16) barangays had been declared clear of DIWM presence. During clearing operations conducted by the AFP, approximately Seventy-Five Million Pesos (P75,000,000.00) in cash and cheques were recovered from a house in Marawi City.<br><br>Operations against other rebel groups likewise yielded positive results.

On the part of the civilians, these atrocities resulted in the killing of 23 and the wounding of 6. The most recent was the November 9, 2017 ambush in Talakag, Bukidnon, resulting in the killing of 1 PNP personnel and wounding of 3 others as well as the killing of a four-month old infant and the wounding of 2 civilians.<br><br>Apart from these, 59 arson incidents were carried out by the NPA in Mindanao for this year, targeting businesses and private establishments that destroyed an estimated Php2.2B-worth of properties.

It is a tragic and violent reality that we must address head-on. However, military rule is not the solution that will extinguish all acts of terrorism. This conclusion is replete in the relevant literature and expressed by the most experienced experts.<br><br>In <i>Fifteen Years On, Where Are We in the "War on Terror"?</i>, Brian Michael Jenkins, a former Green Beret who has served on the White House Commission on Aviation Safety and Security and as an advisor to the National Commission on Terrorism of the United States of America, explores the complex issues that face those addressing terrorism.<br><br>An effective understanding of the implications of terrorist events is difficult to achieve without delving deeper into the context behind the events. Numbers alone and gut reactions should not replace scrutiny. Terrorists are opportunistic. They succeed when they can manipulate and capitalize on gut reactions and imperfect knowledge.<br><br>Jenkins points out that the so-called "War on Terror" is complicated by issues such as the ambiguity of the enemy's identity, conflated by the ever-changing political environment adding to the list of enemies; society's fears of terrorism being driven and increased by news coverage; and the constant flux of world events. To gain a more accurate picture of what the acts of terrorism convey, Jenkins proposes a more global and balanced appreciation of the situation:<br><blockquote>A thorough appreciation of the current situation requires assessing progress in different fields of action and different geographic theatres . . .<br><br>. . . In some areas, counterterrorism efforts have been successful; in others, less so. And for every plus or minus entry, there is a "however". Moreover, as shown in the preceding discussion, the situation has been and continues to be dynamic.<br><br>On the plus side, our worst fears have not been realized. There have been no more 9/11s, none of the worst cases that post-9/11 extrapolations suggested. The 9/11 attacks now appear to be a statistical outlier, not a forerunner of further escalation. Terrorists have not used weapons of mass destruction, as many expected they would do. (At least they have not used them yet, many would add.) While the Islamic State appears to have recruited some chemical weapons specialists, the terrorist arsenal remains primitive, although lethal within bounds.<br><br>Contrary to the inflated rhetoric of some in government, the operational capabilities of al-Qa'ida and the Islamic State remain limited. Both enterprises are beneficiaries of fortune (they would argue, of "God's will"). They are successful opportunists. The Islamic State's military success in Syria and Iraq reflects the collapse of the government's forces, not military prowess. With its legions of foreign fighters and deep financial pockets, the Islamic State theoretically could launch a global terrorist offensive, but the surge would probably be brief. This is not, as some have suggested, World War III.<br><br><i>Neither al-Qa'ida nor the Islamic State has become a mass movement, although both organizations attract sympathy in Muslim countries.</i> The vast majority of Muslims polled over the years express negative views of jihadist organizations, but a significant minority expresses favorable views of al-Qa'ida and, more recently, of the Islamic State . . .<br><br><i>The constellation of jihadist groups is not as meaningful as it appears to be.</i> Competing for endorsements, al-Qa'ida and the Islamic State have attracted declarations of loyalty from local groups across Africa, the Middle East, and Asia and have established a host of affiliates, provinces, and jihadist footholds. This is growth by acquisition and branding. A lot of it is public relations. Many of these groups are the products of long-standing local grievances and conflicts that would continue if there were no al-Qa'ida or Islamic State. Some are organizational assertions that represent only a handful of militants. The militants share a banner but are, for the most part, focused on local quarrels rather than a global jihad. There is no central command. There are no joint operations. The groups operate autonomously. Their connections in many cases are tenuous, although, with time, they could evolve into something more connected. The split between al-Qa'ida and the Islamic State has divided the groups. A number of them are beset by further internal divisions.<br><br>Like all terrorists, jihadis can kill, destroy, disrupt, alarm, and oblige governments to divert vast resources to secure against their attacks, but terrorists cannot translate their attacks into permanent political gain. Yet this is not the way they measure things. They tend to see their mission as continuing operations to demonstrate their commitment and awaken others.<br><br><i>The Islamic State is losing territory and can be defeated.</i> With coalition air support and other external assistance, government forces in Iraq and U.S.-backed Kurdish and Arab fighters in Syria have been able to retake territory held by the Islamic State. Progress is slow, though faster than many analysts initially anticipated. This is not just a military challenge; it is also an effort to put something in place to govern recovered towns and cities.<br><br><i>Al-Qa'ida Central's command has been reduced to exhorting others to fight.</i> The Islamic State has made very effective use of social media to reach a broader audience. Its advertisement of atrocity as evidence of its authenticity appears to have been a magnet for marginal and psychologically disturbed individuals.

Thus, to effectively address terrorism, a clear program for countering violent extremism (CVE) requires a multi-faced approach.<br><br>No such program was presented before Congress or this Court. The context of martial law to address public safety was inadequately provided by the government.<br><br>It is enlightening to compare this to how other countries are comprehensively addressing terrorism. Unfortunately, respondents have manifested that they preferred not to declassify and make public this government's program to counter violent extremism.<br><br>One such program belongs to the United Kingdom (UK), which faces threats from AI Qa'ida, as well as its affiliates, associated groups, and "lone­ wolf" terrorists, while also facing the violence associated with Northern Ireland-related terrorism. The UK has developed and improved upon its own Counter Terrorism Strategy (CONTEST). In CONTEST the Secretary of State for the Home Department details to parliament the comprehensive strategy that the UK is adopting to counter terrorism. Through CONTEST, the messaging is clear as to what the UK's goals are and what areas across all fields must be worked on in order to keep Britain safe from terrorist attacks.<br><br>CONTEST was designed with the following principles in mind:<br><blockquote>• Effective: we will regularly assess the progress we are making and the outcomes of this strategy;<br><br>• Proportionate: we will ensure that the resources allocated to CONTEST, and the powers that are used for counter-terrorism work are proportionate to the risks we face and necessary to reduce those risks to a level we judge is acceptable;<br><br>• Transparent: wherever possible and consistent with our security we will seek to make more information available about the threats we face, the options we have and the response we have decided on;<br><br>. . . .<br><br>• Flexible: terrorists will seek new tactics to exploit vulnerabilities in our protective security; we will regularly re-assess the risks we face and ensure that risk assessment is the foundation of our work; <br><br>• Collaborative: countering terrorism requires a local, national and international response. We will continue to work with foreign governments, the private sector, non-governmental organizations and the public; and<br><br>• Value for money: to deliver a counter-terrorism that is sustainable over the long term we will try to reduce costs while we maintain our core capabilities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[145]</sup><br></blockquote>Further, the UK's CONTEST is organized around four (4) areas of activity, namely, "Pursue," "Prevent," "Protect," and "Prepare."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[146]</sup><br><br>Pursue is concerned with stopping terrorist attacks within the UK and against UK interests worldwide. This involves the early detection, investigation, and disruption of terrorist activity before it poses a danger to the public.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[147]</sup> Among the planned Pursue activities are a continued assessment of counter-terrorism powers to ensure they are both effective and proportionate; an improvement of the ability to prosecute and deport people for terrorist-related offenses; an increase of capabilities to detect, investigate, and disrupt terrorist threats; the improvement of the ability to handle sensitive and secret materials during judicial proceedings to promote justice and national security; and to enable the UK to better tackle threats at their source by working with other countries as well as multilateral organizations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[148]</sup><br><br>Prevent aims to stop people from supporting terrorism, or becoming terrorists themselves.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[149]</sup> It is recognized as a key part of CONTEST. The primary objectives of the UK in relation to Prevent are to:<br><blockquote>• Respond to the ideological challenge of terrorism and the threat we face from those who promote it;<br><br>• Prevent people from being drawn into terrorism and ensure that they are given appropriate advice and support; and <br><br>• Work with a wide range of sectors (including education, criminal justice, faith, charities, the internet and health) where there are risks of radicalization which we need to address.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[150]</sup><br></blockquote>Protect is intended to strengthen the UK's protection against a terrorist attack within the country, or against its interests abroad. CONTEST recognizes that priorities under Protect must be informed by an assessment of facts: what the terrorists are trying to do, what their targets may be, and the vulnerabilities in said targets.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[151]</sup> The government's objectives in relation to Protect are to:<br><blockquote>• Strengthen UK border security; <br><br>• Reduce the vulnerability of the transport network; <br><br>• Increase the resilience of the UK's infrastructure; and <br><br>• Improve protective security for crowded places.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[152]</sup><br></blockquote>Prepare is intended to mitigate the impact of terrorist attacks that cannot be stopped.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[153]</sup> Among the government's objectives here are to:<br><blockquote>• Continue to build generic capabilities to respond to and recover from a wide range of terrorist and other civil emergencies; <br><br>• Improve preparedness for the highest impact risks in the National Risk Assessment;<br><br>• Improve the ability of the emergency services to work together during a terrorist attack; and<br><br>• Enhance communications and information sharing for terrorist attacks.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[154]</sup><br></blockquote>The foregoing objectives reflect the UK government's recognition, that it is essential to have a strategy that is both effective and proportionate, more focused and more precise, "which uses powers selectively, carefully and in a way that is as sparing as possible."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[155]</sup><br><br><center><b>XIV</b><br></center><br><b><i>The government's presentation contained no sophistication in relation to how martial law, as generally conceived, can contribute to addressing the different types of violence it sought to address.</i></b> They were not required by Congress or by the majority of this Court.

Many of these young men were university students. T.J. Macabalang, on the other hand, was a motorcycle shop-owner with a drag racing club, who took up information technology at the University of Visayas in Cebu. In 2014, having become fascinated by the establishment of a caliphate, and having become committed to ISIS through his exploration of ISIS online, he reached out to Fakhrudin. In January, 2015, Fakhrudin invited T.J. in his home in Cotabato, and they proceeded with fifteen (15) others to the AKP camp in Butril, Palimbang, where most of them underwent a 40-day military training course. However, in December, 2015, Fakhrudin told T.J. he was breaking with AKP and its commander over a variance of views.<br><br>In January 2016, T.J. and Fakhrudin met Abdullah Maute in Butig, Lanao del Sur, and subsequently, Fakhrudin moved to Butig to join the Maute group. With Fakhrudin gone, T.J. replaced him as amir of the Cotabato cell.<br><br>Members of T.J.'s drag racing club joined, and they likewise brought others into the group. At the time of the Davao bombing, the cell had around thirty (30) members, despite the fact that T.J. did not have substantial religious knowledge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[157]</sup><br><br>Noting that the key to radicalization in this instance was not poverty, and noting further that basic data-gathering from detainees has not yet been done by Philippine authorities, this IPAC report proposes that the following steps be taken to provide a basis for an effective counter-radicalization program:<br><blockquote>• A mapping of university-based recruitment into extremist based both on detainee data as well as research in tertiary institutions by researchers who understand the distinctions among different streams of Islam.<br><br>• A compilation of the narratives used to draw recruits into pro-ISIS activity, both in religious study discussions as well as during military training.<br><br>• A systematic focus on cities other than Cotabato where radical cells were known to be active, using detainee information to try and draw a more complete picture of how these cells worked. We know, for example, that the organization initially known as Khilafah Islamiyah Mindanao (KIM) was founded in Cagayan de Oro by a man who became part of Maute's inner circle in Marawi, Ustadz Humam Abdul Najid alias Owayda (also known as Wai). Mapping the connections in Cagayan and understanding Owayda's role there remain essential.<br><br>• A mapping of mosques known to have hosted discussions with pro-­ISIS preachers. The Salaf mosque in Cotabato is one example but there will surely be many others. Local ulama councils may want to work out a mechanism by which they can share information about known extremists to try and prevent mosques and other institutions from being recruitment centers.<br><br>• A detailed understanding of the role of women and why and through whom women became involved as financiers, propagandists and combatants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[158]</sup><br></blockquote>In the context of these insights, a general declaration of martial law without specifying the types of powers that will be exercised different from ordinary law enforcement action appears simplistic. The factual basis, apart from being too generalized, unsupported by evidence and incoherent, simply is not sufficient to support the finding that the declaration of martial law and the suspension of the privilege of the writ is needed to address the kind of danger to public safety that is existing in various parts of Mindanao.<br><br><center><b>XV</b><br></center><br>This was because the deliberations in Congress did not provide for any reasonable space for democratic deliberation.<br><br>As a general rule, this Court will not interfere with the proceedings of Congress. In <i>Baguilat, Jr. v. Alvarez</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[159]</sup> this Court recognized Congress' sole authority to promulgate rules to govern its proceedings. However, this is not equivalent to an unfettered license to disregard its own rules. Further, the promulgated rules must not violate fundamental rights.<br><br>As loathe as this Court is to examine the internal workings of a co­ equal branch of government, there are circumstances where this Court's constitutional duty needs such examination.<br><br>In <i>Baguilat</i>, I stressed the need for this Court to fulfill its duty to uphold the Constitution even if it involves inquiring into the proceedings of a co-equal branch. I pointed out the danger in refusing this duty, where the proceedings are designed to stifle dissent:<br><blockquote>Caution must be exercised in having a complete hands-off approach on matters involving grave abuse of discretion of a co-equal branch. This Court has come a long way from our pronouncements in <i>Mabanag v. Vito</i>.<br><br>In <i>Mabanag</i>, the Congress voted on the "Resolution of Both Houses Proposing an Amendment to the [1935] Constitution of the Philippines to be Appended as an Ordinance Thereto." The Resolution proposed to amend the 1935 Constitution to give way for the American parity rights provision, which granted United States citizens equal rights with Filipinos in the exploitation of our country's natural resources and the operation of public utilities, contrary to Articles XIII and XIV of the 1935 Philippine Constitution.<br><br>Article XV, Section 1 of the 1935 Constitution required the affirmative votes of three-fourths (3/4) of all members of the Senate and the House, voting separately, before a proposed constitutional amendment could be submitted to the people for approval or disapproval. The Senate was then composed of 24 members while the House had 98 members. Two (2) House representatives later resigned, leaving the House membership with only 96 representatives. Following the Constitutional mandate, the required votes to pass the Resolution were 18 Senators and 72 Representatives.<br><br>The Senate suspended three (3) Senators from the Nacionalista Party, namely, Ramon Diokno, Jose O. Vera, and Jose E. Romero, for alleged irregularity in their elections. Meanwhile, the House also excluded eight (8) representatives from taking their seats. Although these eight (8) representatives were not formally suspended, the House nevertheless excluded them from participating for the same reason. Due to the suspension of the Senators and Representatives, only 16 out of the required 18 Senators and 68 out of the 72 Representatives voted in favor of the Resolution.<br><br><i>Mabanag</i> recognized that had the excluded members of Congress been allowed to vote, then the parity amendment that gave the Americans rights to our natural resources, which this Court ruled impacted on our sovereignty, would not have been enacted.<br><br>Nevertheless, the absence of the necessary votes of three-fourths (3/4) of either branch of Congress, voting separately, did not prevent Congress from passing the Resolution. Petitioners thus assailed the Resolution for being unconstitutional. This Court, ruling under the 1935 Constitution upheld the enactment despite the patent violation of Article XV, Section 1.<br><br><i>Mabanag</i> ruled that Congress in joint session already certified that both Houses adopted the Resolution, which was already an enrolled bill. Thus, this Court had no more power to review as it was a political question:<br><blockquote>In view of the foregoing considerations, we deem it unnecessary to decide the question of whether the senators and representatives who were ignored in the computation of the necessary three-fourths vote were members of Congress within the meaning of Section 1 of Article XV of the Philippine Constitution.<br></blockquote>Justice Perfecto's dissent, however, considered the matter a constitutional question - that is to say, deciding whether respondents violated the requirements of Article XV of the 1935 Constitution was within this Court's jurisdiction.<br><br>Subsequent rulings have since delimited and clarified the political question doctrine, especially under the 1987 Constitution. It bears stressing that Article VIII, Section 1 explicitly grants this Court the power "to determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government."<br><br>We cannot again shy away from this constitutional mandate.<br><br>The rule of law must still prevail in curbing any attempt to suppress the minority and eliminate dissent.<br><br>In <i>Estrada v. Desierto</i>:<br><blockquote>To a great degree, the 1987 Constitution has narrowed the reach of the political question doctrine when it expanded the power of judicial review of this [C]ourt not only to settle actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable but also to determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of government. Heretofore, the judiciary has focused on the "thou shalt not's" of the Constitution directed against the exercise of its jurisdiction. With the new provision, however, courts are given a greater prerogative to determine what it can do to prevent grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of government. Clearly, the new provision did not just grant the Court power of doing nothing. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Any attempt by the dominant to silence dissent and take over an entire institution finds no room under the 1987 Constitution. Parliamentary practice and the Rules of the House of Representatives cannot be overruled in favor of personal agenda.<br><br>It is understandable for the majority in any deliberative body to push their advantages to the consternation of the minority. However, in a representative democracy marked with opportunities for deliberation, the complete annihilation of any dissenting voice, no matter how reasonable, is a prelude to many forms of authoritarianism. While politics speaks in numbers, many among our citizens can only hope that those political numbers are the result of mature discernment. Maturity in politics is marked by a courageous attitude to be open to the genuine opposition, who will aggressively point out the weaknesses of the administration, in an orderly fashion, within parliamentary forms. After all, if the true interest of the public is in mind, even the administration will benefit by criticism.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[160]</sup><br></blockquote>In this case, the rules of the Joint Session of Congress<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[161]</sup> appear to have been designed to stifle discourse and genuine inquiry into the sufficiency of factual basis for the extension of martial law.

Not only were the members of Congress given an inadequate three (3) minutes to interpellate resource persons during the Joint Session, but they were also only provided with three (3) letters as basis for their vote. Although the three (3) letters contained some factual allegations, no basis for the factual allegations was provided to the members of Congress during their Joint Session:<br><blockquote>JUSTICE LEONEN:<br><br>. . . .<br><br>Congressman Lagman, I am sure that you were given the operational orders or the OPORD while you were conducting the congressional hearings that you were given the OPORD, the Operational Directive of the Chief of Staff to the Service Command for the extension of Martial Law, is that not correct?<br><br>CONGRESSMAN LAGMAN: <br><br>Well, we were given the letter of the President . . .<br><br>JUSTICE LEONEN: <br><br>I'm sorry Congressman Lagman.

Petitioner Lagman was present during the entire joint session of the Congress on December 13, 2017 when the request of the President for a yearlong extension of martial law and the suspension of the writ in Mindanao was summarily granted by the Congress. He is absolutely certain there was no PowerPoint presentation made by the resource persons from the military and police establishments and executive department during the joint session.<br><br>12. He was also present during the all-Member caucus of the House of Representatives held in the afternoon of December 12, 2017 when the military and police establishments briefed the Members of the House of Representatives on the security situation in Mindanao. There was a PowerPoint presentation made principally by General Alex Monteagudo, the Chief of the National Intelligence Coordinating Agency (NICA). But the caucus was not the body charged with approving the extension.<br><br>13. The PowerPoint presentation, which included the assessment/conclusions of the military-police establishment, was not substantiated by independent hard data and validated accounts. It was bereft of verified and verifiable basis. It was not supported by documentary evidence. Verily, the PowerPoint presentation lacks the disclosure of the factual data on which it was based.<br><br>14. When sensitive questions were asked, the usual answer was that they involved classified information which are confidential in nature and any disclosure may endanger national security.<br><br>15. It was during his briefing that General Monteagudo said that "Marawi is only the tip of the iceberg", an understatement to justify alleged looming bigger terrorist threats and attacks. This estimation was not backed up with facts.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>19.

Not only that, but the limitation of three (3) minutes to interpellate resource persons during the Joint Session suggests an intention to suppress any inquiry into the factual premise for the extension of martial law.<br><br>The discussion of Congress was crammed in one (1) day towards the end of a Congressional session. This was due to the belated request for extension communicated by the president.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[164]</sup><br><br>By passing and enforcing the joint rules, Congress shirked its own constitutionally mandated duty to determine, first, whether the actual rebellion persists and, second, whether public safety requires the extension of martial law on account of the persisting actual rebellion. The rules provided by Congress ensured that those members who wished to perform their roles and inquire as to the facts were prevented from doing so. Time for deliberation and reconsideration by their colleagues were clearly curtailed.<br><br>Congress' deliberations, or manifest lack thereof, should be enough to encourage this Court to approach this case with more rigor and less deference. The Congress could have been more critical and analytical in its review of the facts presented through PowerPoint presentations.<br><br><center><b>XVI</b><br></center><br>The majority in this Court presents its decision in the context of a choice between terrorism and rebellion on the one hand and martial law on the other. This is a false dichotomy.<br><br>There are peace and order problems in Mindanao. Indeed, these are to be addressed convincingly and decisively with law enforcement and with a strategic program to counter violent extremism. Terrorism and isolated acts of rebellion require comprehensive solutions that sincerely addresses the causes of the emergence of radical ideologies hand in hand with military and police actions to disrupt and suppress violence. Martial law is not the only option.<br><br>To label the law enforcement problems in Mindanao simplistically as rebellion in order to grant a carte blanche authority for the President under the rubric of martial law is dangerous sophistry.<br><br>Accepting the allegations of the government, without any effort to determine its quality in terms of the evidence supporting it and to examine its logic in its entirety, amounts to a failure to do our constitutional duty to examine not only grave abuse of discretion but the factual sufficiency of the exercise of extraordinary Commander-in-Chief powers. To be blind to the kind of deliberation that was done in Congress is to fail our covenant with the sovereign Filipino people.<br><br>In the 1970s, there was a Court which painfully morphed into a willing accomplice to the demise of fundamental rights through tortured readings of their clear constitutional mandate in order to accommodate a strongman. What followed was one of the darkest episodes in our history. Slowly but surely, soldiers lost their professionalism. Thousands lost their freedoms. Families suffered from involuntary disappearances, torture, and summary killings. Among them are some of the petitioners in this case.<br><br>Regardless of the motives of the justices then, it was a Court that was complicit to the suffering or our people. It was a Court that degenerated into a willing pawn diminished by its fear of the impatience of a dictator.<br><br>The majority's decision in this case aligns us towards the same dangerous path. It erodes this Court's role as our society's legal conscience. It misleads our people that the solution to the problems of Mindanao can be solved principally with the determined use of force. It is a path to disempowerment.<br><br>Contrary to the text and spirit of the Constitution, the decision in this case provides the environment that enables the rise of an emboldened authoritarian.<br><br>This is far from the oath to the Constitution that I have taken.

Thus, I concluded that there was an actual rebellion and the threat to public safety necessitated the President's declaration of martial law and suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> in Mindanao.<br><br>The Court's jurisdiction under Section 18, Article VII is again invoked, this time to determine the sufficiency of the factual basis for the <i>extension</i> of the President's declaration. If upheld, martial law will continue to be implemented and the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> suspended in the whole of Mindanao until December 31, 2018. The <i>ponencia</i> finds that there is sufficient factual basis for the extension.<br><br>I dissent and write this Opinion to explain my conclusion.<br><br><center>I<br></center><br>Section 18, Article VII of the Constitution provides:<br><blockquote>Sec. 18. The President shall be the Commander-in­-Chief of all armed forces of the Philippines and whenever it becomes necessary, he may call out such armed forces to prevent or suppress lawless violence, invasion or rebellion. <b>In case of invasion or rebellion, when the public safety requires it, he may, for a period not exceeding sixty days, suspend the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> or place the Philippines or any part thereof under martial law.</b> Within forty-eight hours from the proclamation of martial law or the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>, the President shall submit a report in person or in writing to the Congress. The Congress, voting jointly, by a vote of at least a majority of all its Members in regular or special session, may revoke such proclamation or suspension, which revocation shall not be set aside by the President. <b>Upon the initiative of the President, the Congress may, in the same manner, extend such proclamation or suspension for a period to be determined by the Congress, if the invasion or rebellion shall persist and public safety requires it.</b><br><br>The Congress, if not in session, shall, within twenty-­four hours following such proclamation or suspension, convene in accordance with its rules without need of a call.<br><br><b>The Supreme Court may review, in an appropriate proceeding filed by any citizen, the sufficiency of the factual basis of the proclamation of martial law or the suspension of the privilege of the writ or the extension thereof, and must promulgate its decision thereon within thirty days from its filing.</b><br><br>A state of martial law does not suspend the operation of the Constitution, nor supplant the functioning of the civil courts or legislative assemblies, nor authorize the conferment of jurisdiction on military courts and agencies over civilians where civil courts are able to function, nor automatically suspend the privilege of the writ.<br><br>The suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> shall apply only to persons judicially charged for rebellion or offenses inherent in or directly connected with invasion.<br><br>During the suspension of the privilege of the writ, any person thus arrested or detained shall be judicially charged within three days, otherwise he shall be released. (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote>The text of the Constitution is clear. Two conditions must concur before a President can suspend the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> or place the Philippines or any part thereof under martial law: (1) actual rebellion or invasion; and (2) when public safety requires it. Much has been said about the concept of rebellion within the meaning of Section 18, Article VII. I myself have advanced views on this matter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> My present analysis is concerned not so much with the issue as to the existence of an actual rebellion as used under Section 18. In fact, given the facts and my proposed definition of rebellion within the meaning of Section 18,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> which is simply armed public resistance to the government, I find the Government's claim that actual rebellion is continuously being waged in Mindanao to be not unreasonable.<br><br>I have very grave concerns, however, with the suggestion that the existence or persistence of a rebellion <i>per se</i> necessarily endangers public safety for purposes of Section 18, Article VII. According to the Government:<br><blockquote>84. Since Cullamat, et al. admit the existence of rebellion in Mindanao, they cannot begrudge the Congress from agreeing to the extension of the proclamation and suspension in the interest of public safety. The danger posed by rebellion on public safety cannot be discounted. The crime of rebellion consists of many acts. It is a vast movement of men and a complex net of intrigues and plots. x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br></blockquote>Otherwise stated, the Government's proposition is that since a rebellion, by definition, is carried out by a "vast movement of men," any rebellion, regardless of <b>scale</b>, may call for an exercise by the President of his extraordinary powers. I strongly disagree.<br><br><center>II<br></center><br>It is my view that the second requirement of "when public safety requires it" introduced a level of <b>scale</b> as to qualify the first requirement of the existence of an actual rebellion or invasion. "Scale" is defined as "the relative size or extent of something."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> It is synonymous with "scope, magnitude, dimensions, range, breadth, compass, degree, reach, spread, sweep."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> The public safety requirement under Section 18, Article VII operates to limit the exercise of the President's extraordinary powers only to rebellions or invasions <i>of a certain scale</i> as to sufficiently threaten public safety. This conclusion, I find, is supported by: (a) the deliberations of the Constitutional Commission; (b) our law and jurisprudence on the concept of public safety as used in specific relation to the exercise of government powers which result in an impairment of civil rights; and (c) the experience of the Court both in this case and in <i>Lagman v. Medialdea</i> where it upheld the President's original declaration of martial law and suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> in Mindanao.<br><br><center>A <br>Deliberations of the Constitutional Commission<br></center><br>A careful reading of the deliberations of the Constitutional Commission would clearly show that there was no intention to interpret the public safety requirement simply as a foregone consequence of the existence of the first requirement, <i>i.e.</i>, actual rebellion or invasion. Rather, it seems that the intention was to qualify the first requirement such that <b>not all cases of rebellion or invasion can be considered sufficient for purposes of the exercise of the President's extraordinary powers</b>:<br><blockquote>MR. DELOS REYES: As I see it now, the Committee envisions actual rebellion and no longer imminent rebellion. Does the Committee mean that there should be actual shooting or actual attack on the legislature or Malacañang, for example? Let us take for example a contemporary event this Manila Hotel incident everybody knows what happened. Would the Committee consider that an act of rebellion?<br><br>MR. REGALADO: If we consider the definition of rebellion under Articles 134 and 135 of the Revised Penal Code, that presupposes an actual assemblage of men in an armed public uprising for the purposes mentioned in Article 134 and by the means employed under Article 135. I am not trying to pose as an expert about this rebellion that took place in the Manila Hotel, because what I know about it is what I only read in the papers. I do not know whether we can consider that there was really an armed public uprising. Frankly, I have my doubts on that because we were not privy to the investigations conducted there.<br><br>Commissioner Bernas would like to add something.<br><br><b>FR. BERNAS: Besides, <u>it is not enough that there is actual rebellion</u>. Even if we will suppose for instance that the Manila Hotel incident was an actual rebellion, that by itself would not justify the imposition of martial law or the suspension of the privilege of the writ because the Constitution further says: "when the public safety requires it." So, <u>even if there is a rebellion but the rebellion can be handled and public safety can be protected without imposing martial law or suspending the privilege of the writ</u>, the President need not. Therefore, even if we consider that a rebellion, clearly, it was something which did not call for imposition of martial law.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied.)<br></blockquote>The following exchange between Commissioners Jose N. Nolledo and Crispino M. De Castro further clarified that while the President <i>can</i> call out the armed forces to address actual rebellion or invasion, it is only when the situation has posed a <i>severe enough</i> threat to public safety is he empowered to resort to his extraordinary powers of declaring martial law or suspending the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>:<br><blockquote>MR. NOLLEDO: x x x<br><br>Does Commissioner de Castro agree with me that the President need not declare martial law or suspend the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> if there is actual invasion [or] rebellion because he is authorized under Section 15 of the committee report to call out such Armed Forces to prevent or suppress lawless violence, invasion or rebellion?<br><br>MR. DE CASTRO: We are talking of the next sentence with the words "in case of invasion or rebellion." This becomes a useless sentence. In fact, the questions of Honorable Suarez and the statements of Honorable Ople do not fall on these two situations.<br><br>MR. NOLLEDO: No, the first sentence is very material because if there is an invasion, the President can immediately call upon the Armed Forces.<br><br><center>x x x<br></center><br>MR. DE CASTRO: That is why I said in case of actual invasion or actual rebellion. [T]he President will have no more time to say "I declare martial law." He will just order the Armed Forces to go there and repel the enemy.<br><br>MR. NOLLEDO: Madam President, the argument of Commissioner de Castro seems to indicate that the President is powerless without declaring martial law. <b>The first sentence is very clear, that in case of lawless violence, invasion or rebellion, the President may immediately call the Armed Forces to prevent or suppress the same. And <u>it is only when public safety requires it that the President may decide to declare martial law or suspend the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i></u>.</b> So, I would like to correct the impression that the President has no power to meet the invasion or rebellion without declaration of martial law.<br><br><center>x x x<br></center><br>MR. GARCIA: x x x<br><br>I also would like to remind ourselves that very often the doctrine of national security is given as a reason to impose extraordinary measures which, once begun, leads to many other violations. I believe this is something that we must guard against from the very beginning.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied.)<br></blockquote>Mere invocations of issues of national security and public safety, without more, are not enough. The Constitution requires that there is sufficient factual basis to show not only that actual rebellion or invasion exists, but that the situation has reached such <i>scale</i> as to threaten public safety.<br><br><center>B <br>Public safety in Philippine law and jurisprudence<br></center><br>There is no one concept of public safety in Philippine law and jurisprudence, but attempts have been made to arrive at accepted meanings of the term. Public safety, for example, has been interpreted to be "synonymous" with the concept of "national security" and "security of the state,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> but narrower than those matters falling under the concept of "interest of the state."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> On the other hand, dangers to public safety have been held to include traffic congestion;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> hazards of traffic in the evening;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> business establishments which give rise to conflagrations and explosions;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> open canals, manholes, live wires and other similar hazards to life and property;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> presence of motorcycles in toll ways;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> billboards and signages in times of typhoons;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> unrestricted right to travel of court employees;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> and the failure of railroad companies to install, maintain and repair safety equipment and signages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>For purposes of my analysis of "when public safety requires" within the meaning of Section 18, Article VII, however, I find that the interpretation of "public safety" in relation to the impairment of the liberty of travel<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> to be most proximate/appropriate in that both involve the derogation of civil rights to give way to a "higher" state interest.<br><br>In interpreting whether then President Corazon C. Aquino could legally ban the Marcoses from returning to the Philippines, the Court in <i>Marcos v. Manglapus</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> voting eight to seven, upheld the restriction on the Marcoses' right to travel as part of the President's residual power as "protector of the peace."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> For me, however, the gripping dissents made for a more compelling analysis on how public safety may, in a proper case, be invoked by the Government to curtail fundamental rights. Justice Teodoro Padilla, for example, opined that:<br><blockquote>Mr. Marcos, I repeat, comes before the Court <i>as</i> a <i>Filipino</i>, invoking a specific constitutional right, i.e., the right to return to the country. <b>Have the respondents presented sufficient evidence to <u>offset or override</u> the exercise of this right invoked by Mr. Marcos?</b> Stated differently, have the respondents shown to the Court sufficient factual bases and data which would justify their reliance on national security and public safety in negating the right to return invoked by Mr. Marcos?<br><br>I have given these questions a searching examination. I have carefully weighed and assessed the "briefing" given the Court by the highest military authorities of the land last 28 July 1989. I have searched, but in vain, for convincing evidence that would defeat and overcome the right of Mr. Marcos <i>as a Filipino</i> to return to this country. <b>It appears to me that the apprehensions entertained and expressed by the respondents, including those conveyed through the military, <u>do not, with all due respect, escalate to proportions of national security or public safety</u>.</b> They appear to be more speculative than real, obsessive rather than factual. Moreover, such apprehensions even if translated into realities, would be "under control," as admitted to the Court by said military authorities, given the resources and facilities at the command of government. But, above all, the Filipino people themselves, in my opinion, will know how to handle any situation brought about by a political recognition of Mr. Marcos' right to return, and his actual return, to this country. <b>The Court, in short, should not accept respondents' general apprehensions, concerns and perceptions at face value, in the light of a countervailing and even irresistible, specific, clear, demandable, and enforceable right asserted by a <i>Filipino</i>.</b><br><br>Deteriorating political, social, economic or exceptional conditions, if any, are not to be used as a pretext to justify derogation of human rights.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied, citations omitted, italics in the original.)<br></blockquote>Similarly, in his Dissent, Justice Hugo Gutierrez, Jr. stated that while there may be disturbances which may be directly attributable to the Marcoses' return to the country, they are "not of a <b>magnitude</b> as would compel this Court to resort to a doctrine of non-justiciability and to ignore a plea for the enforcement of an express Bill of Rights guarantee:"<br><blockquote>And except for citing breaches of law and order, the more serious of which were totally unrelated to Mr. Marcos and which the military was able to readily quell, the respondents have not pointed <b>to any <u>grave exigency</u> which permits the use of untrammeled Governmental power in this case and the indefinite suspension of the constitutional right to travel</b>.<br><br><center>x x x<br></center><br>Significantly, we do not have to look into the factual bases of the ban Marcos policy in order to ascertain whether or not the respondents acted with grave abuse of discretion. Nor are we forced to fall back upon <i>judicial notice</i> of the implications of a Marcos return to his home to buttress a conclusion.<br><br>In the first place, there has never been a pronouncement by the President that a clear and present danger to national security and public safety will arise if Mr. Marcos and his family are allowed to return to the Philippines. It was only after the present petition was filed that the alleged danger to national security and public safety conveniently surfaced in the respondents' pleadings. Secondly, <b>President Aquino herself limits the reason for the ban Marcos policy to ­(1) national welfare and interest and (2) the continuing need to preserve the gains achieved in terms of recovery and stability</b>. x x x <b><u>Neither ground satisfies the criteria of national security and public safety.</u></b> The President has been quoted as stating that the vast majority of Filipinos support her position. x x x We cannot validate her stance simply because it is a popular one. Supreme Court decisions do not have to be popular as long as they follow the Constitution and the law. The President's original position "that it is not in the interest of the nation that Marcos be allowed to return at this time" has not changed. x x x On February 11, 1989, the President is reported to have stated that "considerations of the highest national good dictate that we preserve the substantial economic and political gains of the past three years" in justifying her firm refusal to allow the return of Mr. Marcos despite his failing health. x x x <b>"Interest of the nation," "national good," and "preserving economic and political gains," cannot be equated with national security or public order. They are too generic and sweeping to serve as grounds for the denial of a constitutional right.</b> The Bill of Rights commands that the right to travel may not be impaired except on the stated grounds of national security, public safety, or public health and with the added requirement that such impairment must be "as provided by law." <b>The constitutional command cannot be negated by mere generalizations.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied, italics in the original.)<br></blockquote>Justice Isagani A. Cruz, for his part, found "mere conjectures of political and economic destabilization without any single piece of concrete evidence to back up their apprehensions" to be insufficient to overcome the Marcoses' right to travel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Justice Edgardo L. Paras, on the other hand, stated that while there may be some danger to national safety and national security as claimed by the Government, "there is no showing as to the <b>extent</b>" as to warrant the curtailment of the Marcoses' rights.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Justice Abraham F. Sarmiento, Sr. similarly objects, thus, "[i]t is his constitutional right, a right that cannot be abridged by personal hatred, fear, founded or unfounded, and by speculations of the man's 'capacity' 'to stir trouble.'"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> These dissents, to me, clearly present a powerful case to require of the Government a clear showing of danger to national security or public safety <i>of such scale</i> sufficient to defeat the right to travel guaranteed by the Constitution to Filipino citizens.<br><br>I submit that no less than this same requirement should be demanded of the Government in this case.<br><br>For, the powers to declare martial law and suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus implicate not only one's right to travel, but many other basic civil liberties, including the most fundamental, namely, "individual freedom."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> There was thus a conscious effort on the part of our Framers to reserve their exercise only in the <b>direst</b> of situations and under the <b>strictest</b> of conditions. The realization that a declaration of martial law and suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus impacts our most basic and fundamental rights was foremost on the minds of the members of the Constitutional Commission:<br><blockquote>FR. BERNAS: I quite realize that that is the practice and, precisely, in proposing this, I am consciously proposing this as an exception to this practice because of <b>the tremendous effect on the nation when the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> is suspended and then martial law is imposed</b>.

It does not matter whether it is one day, one hour, or 60 days.</b> So, I would like to express my agreement to Commissioner Monsod's amendment because yesterday we already took away the condition of prior concurrence of Congress; and now, Commissioner Monsod agrees that we have to provide a better safeguard by insertinff this particular amendment of a joint decision of Congress.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote>It stands to reason that the President may exercise his extraordinary powers only when the danger to public safety has reached such scale that some restriction of fundamental rights becomes constitutionally permissible, under the circumstances.<br><br><center>C<br>Appreciation of scale is evident in the experience of the Court in both martial law cases<br></center><br><i>First</i>. The characterization by the Government of the evidence they presented to justify the proclamation, and later, extension, of martial law and suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> would show that it admits scale is an element of the public safety requirement. In the presentation in this case made by the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) before the Court, they described the manpower and number of firearms of the rebels/terrorist groups to be of such "magnitude" as to "endanger the public safety" in this wise:<br><blockquote><center>The <b>magnitude</b> as well as the presence of rebel groups endanger the public safety.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]<br><br></sup></center><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="1"><tbody><tr><td width="25%"><div align="center"><strong>REBEL/TERRORIST GROUPS</strong></div></td><td width="25%"><div align="center"><strong>MANPOWER</strong></div></td><td width="25%"><div align="center"><strong>FIREARMS</strong></div></td><td width="25%"><div align="center"><strong>CONTROLLED BARANGAYS </strong></div></td></tr><tr><td>Communist Rebels</td><td><div align="center">1,748</div></td><td><div align="center">2,123</div></td><td><div align="center">426</div></td></tr><tr><td>Dawlah Islamiyah </td><td><div align="center">137</div></td><td><div align="center">162</div></td><td><div align="center">-</div></td></tr><tr><td>BIFF</td><td><div align="center">388</div></td><td><div align="center">328</div></td><td><div align="center">59</div></td></tr><tr><td>ASG</td><td><div align="center">508</div></td><td><div align="center">598</div></td><td><div align="center">52</div></td></tr><tr><td><strong>TOTAL</strong></td><td><div align="center"><strong>2,781</strong></div></td><td><div align="center"><strong>3,211</strong></div></td><td><div align="center"><strong>537</strong></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>Thereafter, the Government attempted to pack the record with statistics to show that the "magnitude of scope"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> of the threat to public safety was such as to put the security of Mindanao at stake. To support this conclusion about "magnitude" and "magnitude of scope," they presented specifics as to the number of violent incidents initiated by the different rebel groups,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> the number of victims,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> the amounts received as a result of kidnap-for-ransom activities,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> intensification of recruitment activities,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> and presence of foreign-trained terrorist fighters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> These, to me, show a clear admission on the part of the Government that the public safety requirement under Sectionl8, Article VII involves a showing of scale.<br><br>Second, the Court, in <i>Lagman v. Medialdea</i>, defined public safety as "involv[ing] the prevention of and protection from events that could endanger the safety of the general public from <b>significant</b> danger, injury/harm, or damage, such as crimes or disasters."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Again, this clearly acknowledged scale by using the word "significant"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> to qualify any existing danger, injury/harm or damage to public safety. While it would continue to state that "public safety is an <i>abstract</i> term" whose "range, extent or scope could not be physically measured by metes and bounds,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> the Court, after an analysis of all the evidence presented, nevertheless found that they have reached a <i>level</i> of danger sufficient to risk public safety:<br><blockquote>Invasion or rebellion alone may justify resort to the calling out power but definitely not the declaration of martial law or suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>. For a declaration of martial law or suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> to be valid, there must be a concurrence of actual rebellion or invasion and the public safety requirement. In his Report, the President noted that the acts of violence perpetrated by the ASG and the Maute Group were directed not only against government forces or establishments but likewise against civilians and their properties. In addition and in relation to the armed hostilities, bomb threats were issued; road blockades and checkpoints were set up; schools and churches were burned; civilian hostages were taken and killed; non-Muslims or Christians were targeted; young male Muslims were forced to join their group; medical services and delivery of basic services were hampered; reinforcements of government troops and civilian movement were hindered; and the security of the entire Mindanao Island was compromised.<br><br><b>These particular scenarios convinced the President that the atrocities had already <u>escalated to a level that risked public safety</u> and thus impelled him to declare martial law and suspend the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>. In the last paragraph of his Report, the President declared:</b><br><blockquote>While the government is presently conducting legitimate operations to address the on-going rebellion, if not the seeds of invasion, public safety necessitates the continued implementation of martial law and the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> in the whole of Mindanao until such time that the rebellion is completely quelled.<br></blockquote>Based on the foregoing, we hold that the parameters for the declaration of martial law and suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> have been properly and fully complied with. Proclamation No. 216 has sufficient factual basis there being probable cause to believe that rebellion exists and that public safety requires the martial law declaration and the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied, citations omitted.)<br></blockquote>Significantly, it appears to me that all the other members of the Court, including myself, who voted to sustain the President's proclamation of martial law and suspended the privilege of the writ in Mindanao appreciated (whether instinctively or deliberately) to a certain extent the scale to which public safety has been endangered by the situation in Marawi City.<br><br>Justice Tijam, in his Separate Concurring Opinion for example, also considered essentially the same circumstances to arrive at his conclusion that the President's proclamation was firmly grounded on the requirements of public safety, that is: (1) destruction of government and privately-owned properties; (2) significant number of casualties; (3) government inability to deliver basic services; (3) government inability to send troop reinforcements to restore peace in Marawi City; and (4) lack of easy access for civilians and government personnel to and from the City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br><center>III <br>Scale as a measure for determining the existence of the public safety requirement; Proposed indicators of scale<br></center><br>The <i>ponencia</i> cites an <i>Amicus Curae</i> Brief submitted by esteemed constitutionalist Father Joaquin G. Bernas, S.J., in <i>Fortun v. Macapagal­-Arroyo</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> to justify a "permissive approach" to the President's assessment of the public safety requirement under Section 18, Article VII.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> The portion quoted reads:<br><blockquote>From all these it is submitted that the focus on public safety adds a nuance to the meaning of rebellion in the Constitution which is not found in the meaning of the same word in Article 134 of the Penal Code. The concern of the Penal Code, after all, is to punish acts of the past. <b>But the concern of the Constitution is to counter threat to public safety both in the present and in the future arising from present and past acts.</b> Such nuance, it is submitted, gives to the President a degree of flexibility of determining whether rebellion constitutionally exists as basis for martial law even if facts cannot obviously satisfy the requirements of the Penal Code, whose concern is about past acts. To require that the President must first convince herself that there can be proof beyond reasonable doubt of the existence of rebellion as defined in the Penal Code and jurisprudence can severely restrict the President's capacity to safeguard public safety for the present and the future and can defeat the purpose of the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br></blockquote>While I am in complete agreement with Father Bernas' statement, I disagree with the conclusion reached by the <i>ponencia</i> on account thereof.<br><br><i>First</i>, I believe Father Bernas' statement was given in the context of a discussion regarding the definition of "rebellion" as it is used in the Constitution. The conclusion of the statement was that while the Revised Penal Code definition may be considered, the President is not bound to assume "the function of a judge trying to decide whether to convict a person for rebellion or not."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> It was not meant to define public safety requirements or otherwise proscribe the future provision of guidelines for its determination.<br><br><i>Second</i>. Father Bernas' statement that the determination of the requirements of public safety "involves the verification of factors not as easily measurable"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> is not conceptually incompatible or irreconcilable with the identification of minimum reasonable indicators, "verifiable through the visual or tactile sense,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> through which to determine whether public safety requires the exercise of the President's extraordinary powers. Indeed, when our Framers tasked the Court to determine the sufficiency of the factual basis for the proclamation of martial law or suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>, it certainly did not mean for the Court to verify only the factual bases for the alleged rebellion and "permissively" rely on the President's assessment of the public safety requirement given the facts presented.<br><br>For the Court to take such an approach goes against the very reason why it was given the specific mandate under Section 18, Article VII in the first place. Such an approach defeats the deliberate intent of our Framers to "shift [the] focus of judicial review to determinable facts, as opposed to the manner or wisdom of the exercise of the power" and "[create] an objective test to determine whether the President has complied with the constitutionally prescribed conditions."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>In fact, I realize that I have previously articulated some views on public safety which may seem opposed to the views I now embrace. I initially took the position that since the requirements of public safety appear to be phrased in discretionary terms, it would be difficult to set parameters <i>in a vacuum</i> as to what predicate facts should exist. The facts and experience from this case, however, have opened my eyes to the mischief that a "permissive" approach to the President's "prudential estimation" of the public safety requirement can cause. Permissive deference can be used to justify the imposition or extension of martial law by the simple expedient of alleging the existence or persistence of "rebel" groups <i>capable</i> of opposing the Government. I fail to see the difference between sustaining the extension of martial law based on the <i>capability</i> of hostile "rebel" groups to sow discord against the Government and sustaining martial law on the basis of an imminent danger of rebellion. That would be a movement back to the <i>Lansang</i> formulation, and an abject abdication of this Court's "newly assumed power" to review the declaration, or extension, of martial law based on sufficiency of factual basis.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>Worse, it would open the country to the possibility of a permanent state of martial law, as the Philippines has a long history of rebellions motivated by diverse religious, ideological, regional, and other interests. That rebellion is a continuing crime is a handle for the prosecution of rebels wherever they may be. This criminal law doctrine, however, was never envisioned to be a justification to declare martial law and/or suspend the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> whenever and wherever a rebel may operate or be found. Our history and the evidence presented in this case and in <i>Lagman v. Medialdea</i> have shown that there are rebellions and rebellions. Each rebellion is episodic and will have, as shown in the cases of the Maute Group, the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG), the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) and the New People's Army (NPA), their ebbs and flows.<br><br>I believe a proper and principled approach to deciding this and future cases require this Court to identify some <i>reasonable indicators</i> which can be used as guides to determine scale for purposes of the public safety requirement. Certainly, we will not be able to catalogue all indicators with mathematical precision. Such an endeavor, while difficult, is nevertheless doable using all aids available to us, including interpretative aids and knowledge derived from past experience.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Surely, in deciding this and future cases, the Court is not limited in determining the sufficiency of the factual basis of the requirements of public safety to the extremes of an "<i>I know it when I see it</i>" and "<i>the President knows better</i>" analysis.<br><br>As I have endeavored to show above, there were incidents which were considered by the <i>ponencia</i> in <i>Lagman v. Medialdea</i> as <i>indicators of the scale</i> of the danger to public safety which may justify a declaration of martial law and/or suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus. These are: (1) "armed hostilities" directed not only against government forces or establishments but likewise against civilians and their properties; (2) bomb threats; (3) set up of road blockades and checkpoints by the hostile groups; (4) burning of schools and churches; (5) taking and killing of civilian hostages; (6) targeting of non-Muslims or Christians; (7) forced recruitment of young male Muslims; (8) hampering of the delivery of medical and other basic services; and (9) hindrance to movements of civilians and troop reinforcements.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>Building on the indicators provided in <i>Lagman v. Medialdea</i>, there appears to be two <b>minimum</b> indicators of scale as to reasonably meet the public safety requirement necessary for a declaration of martial law and suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>. These are: (1) the presence of hostile groups engaged in <i>actual and sustained armed hostilities</i> with government forces;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> and (2) these groups have actually <i>taken over, and are holding</i>, territory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Following our experience in Marawi, these indicators may further result in, or may be attended by, the interruption in the sending of troop reinforcements or local authorities being prevented, or unable to, perform their regular functions,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> including law enforcement and the delivery of basic services. Bomb threats, burning of schools or churches, kidnapping of civilian hostages, and forced recruitment of young male Muslims only fall under the rubric of lawless violence; they do not, by themselves, satisfy the requirements of public safety. When, as in the Marawi crisis, however, these acts of lawless violence are being committed at or about the same time, and within the same defined territory, they may indicate a significant enough breakdown of general peace and order as to reasonably meet the public safety requirement under Section 18, Article VII.<br><br>The <i>ponencia</i> argues that "[t]he adoption of the extreme scenario as the <b>measure</b> of threat to public safety as suggested by petitioners is to invite doubt as to whether the proclamation of martial law would be at all effective in such case considering that enemies of the State raise unconventional methods which change over time."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> It posits that to require parameters may result in a situation where the declaration of martial law "would be of no useful purpose and such could not be the intent of the Constitution."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>Again, and with respect, I disagree. Our experience in Marawi has proven this to not be the case. At the time, armed hostile groups opposed to the government have already succeeded in overrunning a large part of the city. They engaged government troops in sustained firefights, forcing many of the city's residents to evacuate their homes and flee to temporary shelters outside the city.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> In the end, however, our military forces were still able to restore peace and order and not without great sacrifice. No "unconventional methods" were alleged to have been resorted to by these hostile groups which were beyond the experience and capacity of our government forces to meet. The <i>mere possibility</i> that hostile groups may, in the future, be able to devise such unconventional methods is, however, not an acceptable reason to do away with reasonable proof of scale for purposes of the public safety requirement under Section 18, Article VII. The requisite scale of the danger to public safety <b>must</b> be shown in every exercise of the President's extraordinary powers, regardless of the unconventionality of their causing.<br><br>Finally, that there are laws in place which would rectify possible abuses <i>after the fact</i> also does not justify this "permissive" approach. The best safeguard is still vigilance on the part of the agencies tasked to check the exercise of the power <i>in the first place</i>. Ensuring that the President has enough flexibility and discretion on when to impose martial law is not sufficient justification for taking on a "permissive" approach. If at all, the identification of reasonable indicators to determine whether the danger to public safety has reached such scale as to warrant the exercise of the President's extraordinary powers is recognition of the extreme nature of the extraordinary powers and its tremendous effect on civilian lives.<br><br><center>IV <br>Conclusion: No sufficient factual basis to show that public safety requires the continued implementation of martial law and suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> in Mindanao<br></center><br>The weight of concerns about the continued implementation of martial law and suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> in Mindanao seem to stem from the absence of a categorical statement on the part of the Court on what martial law means under our Constitution. It cannot mean the assumption by the military, headed by the President, of either judicial or legislative power, at least not in the sense that it was used and abused by the former President Marcos. The 1987 Constitution textually prohibited such results. What then does martial law entail?<br><br>Quoting Willoughby, Father Bernas enumerates three types of "martial law:" (1) Military Law Proper, that is, the body of administrative laws created by Congress for the government of the army and navy as an organized force; (2) the principles governing the conduct of military forces in time of war, and in the government of occupied territory; and (3) Martial Law in <i>sensu strictiore</i>, or that law which has application when the military arm does not supersede civil authority but is called upon to aid it in the execution of its civil functions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>According to Father Bernas, martial law as it is understood in our jurisdiction cannot refer to the first meaning because it "refers to a body of administrative laws which are operative all the time, whereas martial law in the Constitution can be operative only 'in case of invasion or rebellion, when the public safety requires it."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> After differentiating between the second (military government) and third (martial rule) types of martial law, he concludes that martial law <i>under our Constitution</i> is simply martial rule, that is, the military "takes the place of certain governmental agencies which tor the time being are unable to cope with existing conditions in a locality which remains subject to the sovereignty."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> It is a "public exigency which may rise in time of war or peace" and "ceases when the district is sufficiently tranquil to permit the ordinary agencies of government to cope with existing situations."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>Otherwise stated, martial law as allowed under our Constitution, is simply authority for the military to act vigorously for the maintenance of an ordinary civil government. It is brought about by necessity,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> an exigency brought about by <b>extreme</b> danger to public safety, that its object is simply the "preservation of the public safety and good order."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> Since necessity calls it forth and defines its scope, it is imperative that the Government sufficiently establish the necessity. There must be proof of the graveness of the exigency confronting the Government as to call for the imposition of martial law. Without this, the Court is obliged, if not compelled, to strike down its exercise.<br><br>I have examined the written submissions of the Government and listened closely to the briefing provided by representatives from the AFP on the factual bases behind the continued implementation of martial law and suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> in Mindanao. As earlier stated, the Government, through the AFP, sought to prove the "<b>magnitude of scope</b>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> of the threat to public safety was such as to put the security of Mindanao at stake. Aside from the data on manpower, arms, and controlled barangays, the following 2017 statistics were also presented: (1) total of 116 BIFF-initiated violent incidents;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> (2) total of 44 ASG-initiated violent incidents;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> (3) total of 53 Dawlah Islamiyah-initiated violent incidents;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> and (4) total of 422 communist-initiated incidents of rebellion in Mindanao.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> When tested, however, against the <i>minimum reasonable indicators</i> above proposed, none of the evidence presented were similar to, or at least somewhat approximating, the scale of the situation which obtained in Marawi City during the initial Proclamation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> There is nothing in the record to show that there are hostile groups engaged in actual and sustained armed hostilities with government forces. Neither are there allegations, much less, proof of hostile groups actually taking over and holding territory, or otherwise causing a significant breakdown of the general peace and order situation as to prevent local civilian authorities from going about their regular duties. Neither is there evidence presented to support the claimed linkages with foreign terrorist groups. The Islamic State, with its blitzkrieg campaign for the re-founding of an Islamic caliphate, has seen a dramatic decline in its influence in 2017, with its last stronghold, the city of Raqqa, tailing into the hands of US-led coalition of Syrian Kurdish and Arab fighters in October of last year.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> And while several Philippine factions of radical Islamic leanings may have pledged allegiance to the Islamic State, the AFP has not presented evidence that the organization has reciprocated, or that the Islamic State has publicly acknowledged an official <i>wilayat</i> or franchise in the country, or extended logistical, financial, manpower, or armament support to any, some or all of such factions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>Lest I be misunderstood, I am not discounting or belittling the damage to life, limb, and property caused by the reported continued attacks of the hostile groups.

While it acknowledged that the law on obscenity at the time was not as developed as to clearly/textually show that it was beyond the protection of the Fourth Amendment, the Court nevertheless found "sufficiently contemporaneous evidence to show that obscenity, too, was outside the protection intended for speech and press." Over the course of several years, and several cases later, the Court would continue to grapple with the "intractable obscenity problem," refining, testing and improving the Roth test until 1973, when it decided <i>Miller v.

Later on it was looked upon as disturbing, but finally it was believed.</i>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>Shorn of its legal niceties, martial law is an emergency governance response involving the imposition of military jurisdiction over civilian population, designed to complement the emergency armed force response to an actual armed uprising. Force is met with force. The might of the military is summoned and flexed to prevent the dismemberment of the Republic caused by an actual rebellion or invasion, with martial law suspending certain civil liberties to facilitate the armed response. But, when the rebellion is quelled, or the invasion is repelled, the normal state of affairs must return.<br><br>The declaration and extension of martial law in the absence of the exigencies justifying the same reduces such extraordinary power to a mere tool of convenience and expediency. Thus, the baseless imposition of martial law constitutes, in itself, a violation of substantive and procedural due process, as it effectively bypasses, if not renders totally nugatory, the conditions and limitations explicitly spelled out in the Constitution for the protection of individual citizens. <b>This violation merits consideration in the resolution of this Petition, for it stands independent of the acts of abuse that may be, or have been perpetrated in furtherance thereof.</b><br><br>In these consolidated petitions, the Court reviews anew the sufficiency of the factual basis of the extension of martial law for one year in the entire Mindanao.<br><br><b><i>The power to extend is subject to constitutional conditions.</i></b><br><br>Article VII, Section 18 of the Constitution contains the standards with which all three coordinate branches of government must comply in relation to the declaration or extension of martial law, and its review.<br><br>It enshrines the extraordinary powers of the President as Commander­-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) - (i) the power to call out the armed forces to prevent or suppress lawless violence, invasion or rebellion; (ii) the power to suspend the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>; and (iii) the power to proclaim martial law. In <i>Lagman v. Medialdea</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> (<i>Lagman</i>) the Court characterized these powers as graduated in nature, such that each may only be resorted to under specified conditions. As for the declaration of martial law, the relevant portion reads:<br><blockquote>In case of invasion or rebellion, when the public safety requires it, he may, for a period not exceeding sixty days, suspend the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> or place the Philippines or any part thereof under martial law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br></blockquote>The Court, in <i>Lagman</i>, stated that Section 18, Article VII sets the parameters for determining the sufficiency of the factual basis for the declaration of martial law and/or the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>, "namely (1) actual invasion or rebellion, and (2) public safety requires the exercise of such power"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> and thereupon proceeded with the analysis consistent with those standards. <i>Lagman</i> also instructs that the President is given the prerogative to determine which extraordinary power to wield in a given set of circumstances, <i>provided</i>, however, that <b>the conditions required by the Constitution for the use of these extraordinary powers exist</b>, for while the exercise of the calling-out power is primarily left to the President's discretion,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> the power to suspend the privilege of the writ and declare martial law are not.<br><br>As for the extension by the Congress of the declaration of martial law, the same first paragraph of Section 18 provides:<br><blockquote>Upon the initiative of the President, the Congress may, in the same manner, extend such proclamation or suspension for a period to be determined by the Congress, if the invasion or rebellion shall persist and public safety requires it.<br></blockquote>Staying faithful to the above text and consistent with <i>Lagman</i>, the parameters of determining the sufficiency of the factual basis of the extension requires the Court to examine whether (1) the invasion or rebellion persists, and (2) public safety requires the exercise of such power.<br><br>Several points become instantly clear from a plain reading of the above text: (1) the invasion or rebellion furnishing the first requirement for the extension indubitably refers to the invasion or rebellion that triggered the declaration sought to be extended, and (2) the requirement of public safety must require the extension. The mere fact of a persisting rebellion or existence of rebels, standing alone, cannot be basis for the extension.<br><br>The Court's power and duty to review under Section 18 contemplates the determination of the existence of the conditions upon which the President's extraordinary powers may be exercised. In the context of an extension of a prior proclamation or suspension, the Court's duty thus equates to the determination of whether the factual basis therefor, then "sufficient, truthful, accurate, or at the very least, credible,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> persists.<br><br><b><i>The Executive and Legislative Departments bear the burden of proof to show sufficient factual basis.</i></b><br><br>The question of burden of proof in the review of the declaration of martial law has been settled in <i>Lagman</i>-the Executive bears the burden of proof. For the same reasons I stated in my <i>Dissent</i> in that case, given the nature of a Section 18 proceeding as a neutral fact-checking mechanism, the Executive and Legislative departments continually bear the burden of proving sufficient factual basis for the extension.<br><br>The Court has recognized that martial law poses a severe threat to civil liberties;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> fittingly, a review of its declaration or extension must require proof. Even the less stringent review in <i>Lansang v. Garcia</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> required that minimum.<br><br>Consequently - and I reiterate to the point of being tedious - the presumptions of constitutionality or regularity do not apply to the Executive and Legislative departments in a Section 18 proceeding. These presumptions cannot operate to require the petitioners to prove a lack or insufficiency of factual basis or to produce countervailing evidence because this amounts to an undue shifting of the burden of proof absent in the language of the provision, and clearly was not the intendment of the framers. As well, while the Executive and Legislative departments cannot be compelled to produce evidence to prove the sufficiency of factual basis, these presumptions cannot operate to gain judicial approbation in the face of the refusal to adduce evidence, or presentation of insufficient evidence. For otherwise, the ruling that fixes the burden of proof upon the Executive and Legislative departments becomes illusory, and logically inconsistent: the Court cannot rule on the one hand that respondents in a Section 18 proceeding bear the burden of proof, and then on the other, rule that the presumptions of constitutionality and regularity apply. In short, the Court cannot say that the respondents must present evidence showing sufficient factual basis, but if they do not or cannot, the Court will presume that sufficient factual basis exists. To insist otherwise is to argue the absurd.<br><br>Indeed, if the Court needs to rely upon presumptions during a Section 18 review, then it only goes to show that the Executive and Legislative departments failed to show sufficient factual basis for the declaration or extension. Attempts at validation on this ground is equivalent to the Court excusing the political departments from complying with the positive requirement of Section 18.<br><br><b><i>The requirements for the extension of Proclamation 216 have not been met.</i></b><br><br>Again, the parameters for determining the sufficiency of the factual basis are now well-settled. As stated in <i>Lagman</i>, they are: (i) the existence of an actual rebellion or invasion; and (ii) that public safety necessitates such declaration or suspension. I find that the extension fails the test of sufficiency of factual basis, <b>as <u>both</u> these requirements <u>do not exist</u> to justify the extension</b>.<br><br><b><i>The existence of an actual rebellion was not established with sufficient evidence.</i></b><br><br>A valid declaration of martial law presupposes the existence of rebellion as a matter of fact and law. As defined in the Revised Penal Code (RPC),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> the following elements are necessary for the crime of rebellion to exist:<br><br><i>First</i>, that there be (a) a public uprising and (b) taking arms against the government; and<br><br><i>Second</i>, that the purpose of the uprising or movement is either (a) to remove from the allegiance to said government or its laws (i) the territory of the Philippines or any part thereof, or (ii) any body of land, naval or other armed forces; or (b) to deprive the Chief Executive or Congress, wholly or partially, of any of their powers or prerogatives.<br><br>Simplified, the elements of rebellion are reducible to (i) an overt act of armed public uprising and (ii) a specific purpose. Both elements must concur and be proved independently of each other, as explained by the Court in <i>People v. Lovedioro</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>:<br><blockquote>From the foregoing, it is plainly obvious that it is not enough that the overt acts of rebellion are duly proven. Both purpose and overt acts are essential components of the crimes. With either of these elements wanting, the crime of rebellion legally does not exist. In fact, even in cases where the act complained of were committed simultaneously with or in the course of the rebellion, if the killing, robbing, or etc., were accomplished for private purposes or profit, without any political motivation, it has been held that the crime would be separately punishable as a common crime and would not be absorbed by the crime rebellion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br></blockquote>Based on the foregoing standards, the point of inquiry therefore is whether the Congress had sufficient factual basis to conclude that rebellion persists - that the concurrence of the elements of rebellion obtaining during the time of the declaration still exists - thus justifying the extension of the proclamation of martial law. Necessarily, the relevant window of time to be considered is shortly before the Congress' receipt of the President's Letter dated December 8, 2017.<br><br><u><i>i. The element of an armed public uprising no longer exists</i></u><br><br>My dissent is largely premised on a simple fact: there is no more armed public uprising - thus, it cannot be said that the rebellion necessitating the declaration persists. In this regard, a review of the key evidence is in order.<br><br>a.

Now there are warnings of a repeat of the siege,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> and of a "continuing rebellion".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Significantly, there is nothing in the Subject Letter that would show that the said rebellion has maintained or intensified in strength. On the contrary, the phrases "rebuild[ing] their organization," "presently regrouping and consolidating their forces," "radicalization/recruitment," "financial and logistical build-up," all connote that the armed public uprising had been quashed and that the rebel groups were recuperating or, at most, reduced to engaging in preparatory acts toward some unspecified end. As if removing all doubt, the Subject Letter is couched in the future tense as it states that the activities of the DAESH-inspired fighters "are geared towards the conduct of x x x armed public uprisings" and that the Turaifie Group is "planning to conduct bombings."<br><br><b>To state the obvious, to say that a rebel group is engaged in activities geared towards the conduct of an armed public uprising is to say that no armed public uprising is, as of yet, existing. As well, to claim, as the respondents do, that the commission of acts preparatory to an armed public uprising <i>a priori</i> constitutes an actual rebellion is an argument in a circle. It is illogical and completely fails to persuade.</b><br><br>While it is true that rebellion is characterized as a "continuing offense," which constitutes a series of repeated acts,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> it is equally true that these overt acts must be anchored on a common ideological base<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> and committed in furtherance thereof. In the context of a martial law extension, this unity in purpose must be clearly ascertainable from the acts in question. Stated differently, there must be a clear showing that the acts cited as basis for the extension are in fact done in furtherance of the rebellion subject of the initial proclamation. Again, I echo the warning of Justice Feliciano in <i>Lacson v. Perez</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> on this point:<br><blockquote>My final submission, is that, the doctrine of "continuing crimes," which has its own legitimate function to serve in our criminal law jurisprudence, cannot be invoked for weakening and dissolving the constitutional guarantee against warrantless arrest. <b>Where no overt acts comprising all or some of the elements of the offense charged are shown to have been committed by the person arrested without warrant, the "continuing crime" doctrine should not be used to dress up the pretense that a crime, begun or committed elsewhere, continued to be committed by the person arrested in the presence of the arresting officer. <u>The capacity for mischief of such a utilization of the "continuing crimes" doctrine, is infinitely increased where the crime charged does not consist of unambiguous criminal acts with a definite beginning and end in time and space (such as the killing or wounding of a person or kidnapping and illegal detention or arson) but rather of such problematic offenses as membership in or affiliation with or becoming a member of, a subversive association or organization.</u></b> For in such cases, the overt constitutive acts may be morally neutral in themselves, and the unlawfulness of the acts a function of the aims or objectives of the organization involved. Note, for instance, the following acts which constitute <i>prima facie</i> evidence of "membership in any subversive association[.]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied.)<br></blockquote>Justice Feliciano's observations find particular relevance in this Petition, for unlike in <i>Lagman</i> where an armed public uprising was shown to have taken place in Marawi City, no such circumstance has been shown to <b>persist</b> in Marawi City or <i>any</i> part of Mindanao. As I had stated in my <i>Dissent</i> in <i>Lagman</i>, the concept of rebellion as a continuing crime does not thereby extend the existence of actual rebellion wherever these offenders may be found, or automatically extend the public necessity for martial law based only on their presence in a certain locality.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> The requirement of actual rebellion serves to <u><b>localize</b></u> the scope of martial law to cover only the areas of armed public uprising. Necessarily, martial law is confined to the place where there is actual rebellion, meaning, concurrence of the normative act of armed public uprising and the specific purpose.<br><br>Nevertheless, in the Joint Resolution, the Congress resolved to extend the proclamation of martial law over the entire Mindanao for the second time, based essentially on the same set of facts set forth in the Subject Letter. Thus:<br><blockquote>WHEREAS, the President informed the Congress of the Philippines of the remarkable progress made during the period of Martial Law, but nevertheless reported the following essential facts, which as Commander-in-Chief of all armed forces of the Philippines, he has personal knowledge of: First, despite the death of Hapilon and the Maute brothers, the <b>remnants</b> of their groups have <b>continued to rebuild their organization</b> through the <b>recruitment and training of new members</b> and fighters to carry on the rebellion; Second, the Turaifie Group has likewise been monitored to be <b>planning to conduct bombings</b>, notably targeting the Cotabato area; Third, the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters continue to defy the government by perpetrating at least fifteen (15) violent incidents during the Martial Law period in Maguindanao and North Cotabato; Fourth, the <b>remnants</b> of the Abu Sayyaf Group in Basilan, Sulu, Tawi-Tawi, and Zamboanga Peninsula remain a serious security concern; and last, the New People's Army took advantage of the situation and intensified their decades-long rebellion against the government and stepped up terrorist acts against innocent civilians and private entities, as well as guerilla warfare against the security sector and public and government infrastructure, purposely to seize political power through violent means and supplant the country's democratic form of government with Communist rule;<br><br>x x x x<br><br>WHEREAS, on December 13, 2017, after thorough discussion and extensive debate, the Congress of the Philippines in a Joint Session, by two hundred forty (240) affirmative votes comprising the majority of all its Members, has determined that rebellion persists, and that public safety indubitably requires the further extension of the Proclamation of Martial Law and the Suspension of the Privilege of the Writ of <i>Habeas Corpus</i> in the Whole of Mindanao; x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>It is not unusual as it is, in fact, expected that a defeated army will have its own share of survivors. Our own colonial history bears witness to this fact. Hence, that some enemy fighters remain alive does not mean that a battle has not been won. In this case, to require first the "total eradication" of rebel groups before a rebellion can be considered quelled goes against plain logic and human experience. Meaning to say, the rebels' survival and the concomitant perpetuation of their ideology do not <i>ipso facto</i> mean that there is still an armed public uprising. And where there is no more armed public uprising, there can be no rebellion persisting as contemplated in the Constitution.<br><br>Respondents attempt to cover up this gaping hole by extending, through some legal fiction, the rebellion subject of <i>Lagman</i> to the present case. Using the Court's declaration in <i>Lagman</i> that actual rebellion existed in Mindanao, respondents claim that the issue of whether rebellion still exists should have already been "laid to rest."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> In effect, respondents are telling the Court that the armed public uprising then existing during the first declaration of martial law on May 23, 2017 still persists, purportedly on the basis of the principle of conclusiveness of judgment. This is egregious error.<br><br>As pointedly discussed in the <i>ponencia</i>, with which I fully agree, the issue in the earlier <i>Lagman</i> case refers to the existence of a state of rebellion that would call for the President's initial declaration of martial law, while in this case, the issue refers to the persistence of the same rebellion that would justify the extension of martial law by the Congress. Moreover, given the nature of an armed public uprising, it follows that the Court's judgment on the sufficiency of factual basis for the declaration of martial law is transitory<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> and relevant only to the state of affairs during that specific period in time.<br><br>b. Presentation of Respondents during the Oral Arguments held on January 17, 2018<br><br>Among the data presented by respondents are lists of violent incidents in Mindanao. It must be stressed, however, that most of the data presented are <u><b>irrelevant</b></u> for the simple reason that most of the attacks listed occurred during periods irrelevant to the controversy at hand. Evidence, to be admissible, must be relevant to the fact in issue, that is, it must have a relation to the fact in issue as to induce belief in its existence or non­existence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Again, the relevant window of time to be considered is shortly before the Congress' receipt of the President's letter dated December 8, 2017. Thus, events that took place: (i) prior to the declaration of martial law on May 23, 2017 being the set of facts that the President considered when he issued Proclamation No. 216; and (ii) the intervening period from May 23, 2017 to July 18, 2017, which is when the President requested a first extension from Congress and which in turn is the supposed set of facts that Congress considered when it extended Proclamation No. 216 until December 31, 2017 are irrelevant for the purpose of showing that rebellion persists from the time martial law was first declared and extended.<br><br>Synthesizing the data, therefore, from the time Marawi was declared liberated on October 17, 2017, only seven (7) BIFF-initiated violent incidents were reported, all occurring within the Province of Maguindanao. The same can be said of the "Abu Sayyaf Rebel Group List of Violent Activities," which reported all incidents beginning January 6, 2017 until December 24, 2017. Only five (5) ASG-related incidents were reported between October 17, 2017 (when Marawi was liberated) until December 13, 2017.<br><br>To my mind, what stands out from the foregoing data is the apparent pattern of violence in Mindanao <u><b>even before</b></u> the "Marawi Siege." <b>This glaring fact, in effect, dilutes respondents' claim that the incidents of violence following the declaration of martial law was in pursuance of the actual rebellion in <i>Lagman</i>.</b> Hence, without more, respondents' evidence remains ambiguous, to say the least.<br><br>Meanwhile, without delving into specifics, respondents also introduced a list of pending criminal cases for rebellion. However, a cursory reading of the list would reveal that the most recent development was the issuance of a Resolution dated <b>July 27, 2017</b>, or almost three (3) months before Marawi's liberation, finding probable cause to indict several respondents for the crime of rebellion. Clearly, this specie of evidence is irrelevant in the Congress' determination of whether there is sufficient factual basis to extend martial law from beyond its first extension of until December 31, 2017.<br><br>In the same vein, the list of "Arrested Personalities" provided by respondents is likewise of no consequence. As clearly stated in its heading, the said list only covers arrests "as of 23 October 2017," or a few days after Marawi's liberation, a date that is too far removed from the Congress' deliberation leading to the Joint Resolution.<br><br>All things considered, I am fully convinced that respondents have failed to establish the persistence of an actual rebellion as a constitutional requirement for the extension of martial law. While they argue that the rebellion in <i>Lagman</i> was still persisting at the time the Joint Resolution was issued, the evidence and their own admissions say otherwise - that is - that the armed public uprising has already ceased. Respondents can no longer resurrect what the law considers dead.<br><br><i>ii. <u>The specific purpose</u></i><br><br>Following <i>Lovedioro</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> it must be proved that the armed public uprising was for any of the purposes enumerated in Article 134 of the RPC. Specific purpose is akin to intent, the existence of which, being a state of the mind, is proven by overt acts of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Proceeding from the above discussion, the data in the presentation of respondents during the Oral Arguments held on January 17, 2018 failed to take into account the purpose for such violent incidents. By merely listing attacks made by certain armed groups, respondents cannot summarily conclude that the same are geared towards the accomplishment of the purposes of rebellion under the RPC. Absent any more data indicating purpose, the Court cannot, without violating the standards of the Constitution, rely on surmises and hasty conclusions.<br><br>To illustrate, the incidents are described as "IED attack," "attack," "grenade explosion," "kidnapping," "harassment," which are all highly generic terms, making it impossible to determine intent. Even the targets of these attacks were not supplied. At most, only the data with respect to the pending criminal cases are competent to prove intent as there was already a finding of probable cause for the crime of rebellion. However, as already discussed above, the said information is inconsequential and could not have been used by Congress to determine the necessity of extending martial law.<br><br>Another point. The <i>ponencia</i> cites as basis for its conclusion that the rebellion persists is the reported increase in manpower of the "remnants" of the rebel groups. I submit, however, that respondents were unable to prove the component of specific purpose due to their own admissions to the contrary. As quoted at length in the <i>ponencia</i>:<br><blockquote>After the successful Marawi Operation, the Basilan-based ASG is left with 74 members; the Maute Group with 30 members; the Maguid Group has 11; and the Turaifie Group has 22 members with a total of 166 firearms.<br><br>However, <b>manpower increased by more or less 400</b>, with almost the same strength that initially stormed Marawi City, through clandestine and decentralized recruitment of the Daesh-inspired groups at their respective areas of concentration.<br><br>ASG Basilan-based recruited more or less <b>43</b> new members in Basilan; more or less <b>250</b> by the Maute Group in the Lanao provinces; <b>37</b> by the Maguid Group in Sarangani and Sultan Kudarat, and more or less 70 by the Turaifie Group in Maguindanao. <b>These newly recruited personalities were motivated by clannish culture as they are relatives of terrorist personalities; revenge for their killed relatives/parents during the Marawi operations; financial gain as new recruits were given an amount ranging from PhP15,000.00 to 50,000.00; and, as radicalized converts.</b><br><br>These newly recruited members are undergoing trainings in tactics, marksmanships and bombing operations at the different areas of Mount Cararao Complex, Butig, and Piagapo all of Lanao Del Sur. Recruits with high potentials [sic] were given instruction on IED-making and urban operations.<br><br>Furthermore, the situation has become complicated with the influx of Foreign Terrorist Fighters (FTFs), capitalizing on the porous maritime boundaries in Southern Philippines, in the guise as tourists and business men. As of this period, 48 FTFs were monitored joining the Daesh-­inspired groups, particularly the Maute Group in Lanao and Turaifie Group in Central Mindanao. The closeness of these two groups is predominant with @Abu DAR who has historically established link with Turaifie.<br><br>On Dawlah Islamiyah-initiated violent incidents, these have increased to 100% for the 2nd Semester.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>As admitted by respondents themselves, the motivations of (i) clannish culture, (ii) revenge for their killed relatives, and (iii) financial gain, are <u><b>not</b></u> among the purposes contemplated in the RPC, which are, to repeat: (a) to remove from the allegiance to said government or its laws (i) the territory of the Philippines or any part thereof, or (ii) any body of land, naval or other armed forces; or (b) to deprive the Chief Executive or Congress, wholly or partially, of any of their powers or prerogatives.<br><br>I also submit that the reliance of the <i>ponencia</i> on the atrocities committed by the New People's Army (NPA) in extending martial law stands on shaky ground. The Subject Letter reads in part:<br><blockquote>Last, but certainly not the least, while the government was preoccupied with addressing the challenges posed by the DAESH-inspired DIWM and other Local Terrorist Groups (LTGs), <b>the New People's Army (NPA) took advantage of the situation and intensified their decades-long rebellion against the government</b> and stepped up <b>terrorist acts against innocent civilians and private entities</b>, as well as guerilla warfare against the security sector and public government infrastructure, purposely to seize political power through violent means and supplant the country's democratic form of government with Communist rule.<br><br><b>This year</b>, the NPA has perpetrated a total of <b>at least three hundred eight-five (385) atrocities</b> (both terrorism and guerilla warfare) <b>in Mindanao</b>, which resulted in forty-one (41) Killed-in-Action (KIA) and sixty-two (62) Wounded-in-Action (WIA) on the part of government forces. On the part of the civilians, these atrocities resulted in the killing of twenty-three (23) and the wounding of six (6) persons. The most recent was the ambush in Talakag, Bukidnon on 09 November 2017, resulting in the killing of one (1) PNP personnel and the wounding of three (3) others, as well as the killing of a four (4)-month-old infant and the wounding of two (2) civilians.<br><br>Apart from these, <b>at least fifty-nine (59) arson incidents</b> have been carried out by the NPA in Mindanao <b>this year, targeting businesses and private establishments</b> and destroying an estimated P2.2 billion­ worth of properties. Of these, the most significant were the attack on Lapanday Food Corporation in Davao City on 09 April 2017 and the burning of facilities and equipment of Mil-Oro Mining and Frasec Ventures Corporation in Mati City, Davao Oriental on 06 May 2017, which resulted in the destruction of properties valued at P1.85 billion and P109 million, respectively. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>The Constitution cannot be any clearer: the Congress may extend the President's proclamation of martial law if <u><b>the same</b></u> rebellion necessitating such proclamation shall <b><u>persist</u></b>. However, despite the express parameters of Section 18, the <i>ponencia</i> finds no error in the inclusion of the NPA in the Subject Letter as basis for the extension. <b>Indeed, it is incredible how a "decades-long rebellion" can be used as basis for extending Martial Law triggered by a rebellion that took place only months ago, especially considering that both movements were mounted by different groups inspired by distinct ideologies.</b><br><br>If there is indeed an actual rebellion by the NPA as contemplated in Section 18, it must be covered by a new declaration.<br><br>In this scenario espoused by the <i>ponencia</i>, violent attacks by different armed groups could easily form the basis of an endless chain of extensions, so long as there are "overlaps" in the attacks. To this end, the <i>ponencia</i> is accommodating practical concerns over the clear mandate of the country's fundamental law. This precedent dangerously supports the theoretical possibility of perpetual martial law. This precedent dangerously suggests a perpetual violation of people's Constitutional rights. As well, to anchor the Court's review to the fallback position that the "government can lift the state of martial law once actual rebellion no longer persists and that public safety is amply secured" is to abdicate the duty of the Court to determine for itself the sufficiency of factual basis for the extension.<br><br>Likewise, following the discussion above, the factual narration in the Subject Letter presented is highly ambiguous, if not amorphous.<br><br><i>First</i>, the timeline of the violent incidents is unclear as the information merely reflects the total number of the atrocities for "this year," which is the entire 2017. Again, these figures do not present an accurate picture because they include incidents already relied upon for the initial declaration and the first extension, and for that reason, are far-removed from the question of persistence of rebellion when Congress was deliberating on the second extension of martial law.<br><br><i>Second</i>, some details in the Subject Letter strongly negate rebellion as the attacks were described as "terrorist acts against innocent civilians and private entities," and "arson incidents x x x targeting businesses and private establishments." Needless to state, terrorist acts and destruction of property, no matter how grave, are for entirely different ends than that of rebellion under Article 134. In fact, these and analogous factual bases have been relied upon by the Executive when it called out the armed forces in Proclamation No. 55, s. 2016,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> without any showing that there was an escalation of violence that necessitated the extension.<br><br><i>Third</i>, the claim of "intensified" rebellion of the NPA is vague in light of the "decades-long rebellion" already existing. Considering the known fact of protracted violence in different areas of Mindanao, the Subject Letter provides no standard by which Congress, and consequently, this Court, could determine whether indeed there is a considerable rise in violent incidents that make martial law a necessity. Without such standard, Congress will be left to guesswork and blind adherence to the word of the President.<br><br>All told, weighing the totality of evidence adduced by respondents, I find that there is insufficient factual basis to justify an extension of martial law.<br><br><i>iii. <u>The evidence suggests a mere threat of rebellion</u></i><br><br>The foregoing discussion does not mean, however, that I am turning a blind eye to the situation in Mindanao. The facts, as they stand, while falling short of establishing an existing rebellion, indicate a threat thereof.<br><br>However, under the framework of our present Constitution, it is only in cases of an <b>actual</b> rebellion or insurrection that the President may, when public safety requires it, place the Philippines or any part thereof, under martial law.

CONCEPCION. <b>The elimination of the phrase "IN CASE OF IMMINENT DANGER THEREOF" is due to the fact that the President may call the Armed Forces to prevent or suppress invasion, rebellion or insurrection. That dispenses with the need of suspending the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>.</b> References have been made to the 1935 and 1973 Constitutions. The 1935 Constitution was based on the provisions of the Jones Law of 1916 and the Philippine Bill of 1902 which granted the American Governor General, as representative of the government of the United States, the right to avail of the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> or the proclamation of martial law in the event of imminent danger. And President Quezon, when the 1935 Constitution was in the process of being drafted, claimed that he should not be denied a right given to the American Governor General as if he were less than the American Governor General. But he overlooked the fact that under the Jones Law and the Philippine Bill of 1902, we were colonies of the United States, so the Governor General was given an authority, on behalf of the sovereign, over the territory under the sovereignty of the United States. Now, there is no more reason for the inclusion of the phrase "OR IMMINENT DANGER THEREOF" in connection with the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>. As a matter of fact, the very Constitution of the United States does not mention "imminent danger." <b>In lieu of that, there is a provision on the authority of the President as Commander-in-Chief to call the Armed Forces to prevent or suppress rebellion or invasion and, therefore, "imminent danger" is already included there.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>The demonstrable capacity to launch a rebellion, absent an overt act in pursuance thereof, is <u><b>not</b></u> actual rebellion.

In making such a finding, the Court does not thereby assume to do the calibration in the President's stead, but only checks the said calibration in hindsight, as Section 18 empowers and mandates the Court to do.<br><br>As correctly observed by petitioner Rosales, necessity, in the context of martial law, is dictated not merely by the gravity of the rebellion sought to be quelled, but also the necessity of martial law to address the exigencies of a given situation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>The Constitutional deliberations elucidate:<br><blockquote>MR.

But is not the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> and the imposition of martial law more of the preparatory steps before the President should call the Armed Forces of the Philippines as Commander-in-Chief? In other words, before calling the Armed Forces of the Philippines should he not take the preparatory step of suspending the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> or imposing martial law?<br><br>MR. REGALADO. As a matter of fact, the former President outlined the steps and we have put them here as follows: (1) When it is only imminent danger, although, of course, he did not use that term, he can already call out the Armed Forces just to prevent or suppress violence; (2) if the situation has worsened and there is a need for stronger measures, then aside from merely calling out the Armed Forces he goes into the suspension of the privilege of the writ; (3) but if both measures calling out the Armed Forces and the suspension of the privilege of the writ still prove unavailing in the face of developments and exacerbated situation, this time he goes to the ultimate which would be martial law.<br><br>MR.

BERNAS. Besides, it is not enough that there is actual rebellion. Even if we will suppose for instance that the Manila Hotel incident was an actual rebellion, that by itself would not justify the imposition of martial law or the suspension of the privilege of the writ because the Constitution further says: "when the public safety requires it." <b>So, <u>even if there is a rebellion but the rebellion can be handled and public safety can be protected without imposing martial law or suspending the privilege of the writ, the President need not</u>.

FOZ: x x x<br><br>May I go to the next question? This is about the declaration of martial law or the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> on page 7, on the second to the last paragraph of Section 15. Is it possible to delete the clause "where civil courts are able to function"? In the earlier portion of the same sentence, it says, "nor supplant the functioning of the civil courts . . ." I was just thinking that if this provision states the effects of the declaration of martial law - one of which is that it does not supplant the functioning of the civil courts-I cannot see how civil courts would be unable to function even in a state of martial law.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>FR. BERNAS. This phrase was precisely put here because we have clarified the meaning of martial law; meaning, limiting it to martial law as it has existed in the jurisprudence in international law, that it is a law for the theater of war. <b>In a theater of war, civil courts are unable to function. If in the actual theater of war civil courts, in fact, are unable to function, then the military commander is authorized to give jurisdiction even over civilians to military courts precisely because the civil courts are closed in that area.</b> But in the general area where the civil courts are opened then in no case can the military courts be given jurisdiction over civilians. <b>This is in reference to a theater of war where the civil courts, in fact, are unable to function.</b><br><br>MR.

Because in the example given by Justice Carpio, if only two people rebel how can public safety be endangered. So there can be rebellion without [the] public [being] endangered. So the proper breeding of the second requirement is not that rebellion, rebellion is not required to be present (sic). It must always be present but (sic) that public safety requires the imposition of martial law. <b>In other words, you will still go back to the idea of the need to calibrate the powers sought to be exercised by the President.</b><br><br>x x x x<br><br><b>CHIEF JUSTICE SERENO:</b><br><br>x x x I was thinking that the proper interpretation is that rebellion is there, and therefore, public safety requires the imposition of martial law, rather the public safety requires the imposition of martial law in a situation where in the first place rebellion or invasion has been already established.

The necessity of martial law therefore requires a showing that it is necessary for the military to perform civilian governmental functions or acquire jurisdiction over civilians to ensure public safety.<br><br>This is consistent with my vote in <i>Lagman</i> wherein I found the existence of an actual rebellion but found that the requirement of public safety only necessitated the imposition of martial law over the areas of Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao, and Sulu, as areas intimately or inextricably connected to the armed uprising then existing in Marawi City.<br><br>Hence, I find as completely unfounded the assertion that the lifting of Proclamation No. 216 will render the Executive unable to meet the current situation in Mindanao.<br><br>As confirmed by Commissioner Bernas:<br><blockquote>FR. BERNAS. <b>Let me just add that when we only have imminent danger, the matter can be handled by the first sentence: "The President . . . may call out such armed forces to prevent or suppress lawless violence, invasion or rebellion." <u>So we feel that that is sufficient for handling imminent danger</u>.</b><br><br>MR. DE LOS REYES. So actually, if a President feels that there is imminent danger of invasion or rebellion, instead of imposing martial law or suspending the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>, he must necessarily have to call the Armed Forces of the Philippines as their Commander-in-Chief. Is that the idea?<br><br>MR. REGALADO. That does not require any concurrence by the legislature nor is it subject to judicial review.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>The <i>ponencia</i> finds that the submissions of the respondents show that the continued implementation of martial law in Mindanao is necessary to protect public safety. As basis, the <i>ponencia</i> cites the following events and circumstances disclosed by the President and AFP:<br><blockquote>(a) No less than 185 persons in the Martial Law Arrest Orders have remained at large.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><b>Remnants of the Hapilon and Maute groups have been monitored by the AFP to be reorganizing and consolidating their forces</b> in Central Mindanao, particularly in Maguindanao, North Cotabato, Sulu and Basilan, and strengthening their financial and logistical capability.<br><br>(b) After the military operation in Marawi City, the Basilan-based ASG, the Maute Group, the Maguid Group and the Turaifie Group, comprising the DAESH-affiliate Dawlah Islamiyah that was responsible for the Marawi siege, was left with 137 members and a total of 166 firearms. These rebels, however, were able to <b>recruit</b> 400 new members, more or less, in Basilan, the Lanao Provinces, Sarangani, Sultan Kudarat and Maguindanao.<br><br>(c) The new recruits have since been trained in marksmanship, bombing and tactics in different areas in Lanao del Sur. Recruits with great potential are trained in producing Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and urban operations. These new members are motivated by their clannish culture, being relatives of terrorists, by revenge for relatives who perished in the Marawi operations, by money as they are paid P15,000.00 to P50,000.00, and by radical ideology.<br><br>(d) 48 FTFs have joined said rebel groups and are acting as instructors to the recruits. Foreign terrorists from Southeast Asian countries, particularly from Indonesia and Malaysia, will continue to take advantage of the porous borders of the Philippines and enter the country illegally to join the remnants of the DAESH/ISIS-inspired rebel groups.<br><br>(e) In November 2017, 15 Indonesian and Malaysian DAESH­-inspired FTFs entered Southern Philippines to augment the remnants of the Maguid group in Sarangani province. In December 2017, 16 Indonesian DAESH-inspired FTFs entered the Southern Philippines to augment the ASG-Basilan and Maute groups in the Lanao province. In January 2018, an unidentified Egyptian DAESH figure was monitored in the Philippines.<br><br>(f) At least 32 FTFs were killed in the Marawi operations. Other FTFs attempted to enter the main battle area in Marawi, but failed because of checkpoints set up by government forces.<br><br>(g) "The DAESH-inspired DIWM groups and their allies continue to visibly offer armed resistance in other parts of Central, Western and Eastern Mindanao in spite of the neutralization of their key leaders and destruction of their forces in Marawi City." There were actually armed encounters with the remnants of said groups.<br><br>(h) "Other DAESH-inspired and like-minded threat groups such as the BIFF, AKP, DI-Maguid, DI-Toraype, and the ASG remain capable of staging similar atrocities and violent attacks against vulnerable targets in Mindanao, including the cities of Davao, Cagayan de Oro, General Santos, Zamboanga and Cotabato."<br><br>(i) The Turaifie group conducts roadside bombings and attacks against government forces, civilians and populated areas in Mindanao. The group <b>plans</b> to set off bombings in Cotabato.<br><br>(j) The Maute Group, along with foreign terrorists, were reported to be <b>planning</b> to bomb the cities of Zamboanga, Iligan, Cagayan de Oro and Davao.<br><br>(k) The remaining members of the ASG-Basilan have initiated five violent attacks that killed two civilians.<br><br>(l) In 2017, the remnants of the ASG in Basilan, Sulu, Tawi-Tawi and Zamboanga Peninsula, conducted 43 acts of violence, including IED attacks and kidnapping which resulted in the killing of eight innocent civilians, three of whom were mercilessly beheaded. Nine kidnap victims are still held in captivity.<br><br>(m) Hapilon's death fast-tracked the unification of the Sulu and Basilan-based ASG to achieve their common goal of establishing a DAESH-ISIS <i>wilayat</i> in Mindanao. This <b>likely merger</b> may spawn retaliatory attacks such as IED bombings, in urban areas, particularly in the cities of Zamboanga, Isabela and Lamitan.<br><br>(n) By AFP's assessment, the ISIS' regional leadership <b>may remain</b> in the Southern Philippines and with the defeat of ISIS in many parts of Syria and Iraq, some hardened fighters from the ASEAN may return to this region to continue their fight. The AFP also identified four potential leaders who may replace Hapilon as emir or leader of the ISIS forces in the Philippines. It warned that the Dawlah Islamiyah will attempt to replicate the Marawi siege in other cities of Mindanao and may conduct terrorist attacks in Metro Manila and Davao City as the seat of power of the Philippine Government. With the spotlight on terrorism shifting from the Middle East to Southeast Asia following the Marawi siege, the AFP likewise indicated that the influx of FTFs in the Southern Philippines will persist. The AFP further referred to <b>possible lone-wolf attacks and atrocities from other DAESH-inspired rebel groups in vulnerable cities</b> like Cagayan de Oro, Cotabato, Davao, General Santos, Iligan and Zamboanga.<br><br>The rising number of these rebel groups, their training in and predilection to terrorism, and their resoluteness in wresting control of Mindanao from the government, pose a serious danger to Mindanao. The country had been witness to these groups' capacity and resolve to engage in combat with the government forces, resulting in severe casualties among both soldiers and civilians, the displacement of thousands of Marawi residents, and considerable damage to their City. In a short period after the Marawi crisis was put under control, said rebel groups have managed to increase their number by 400, almost the same strength as the group that initially stormed Marawi. Their current number is now more than half the 1,010 rebels in Marawi which had taken the AFP five months to neutralize. To wait until a new battleground is chosen by these rebel groups before We consider them a significant threat to public safety is neither sound nor prudent.<br><br>(o) Furthermore, in 2017 alone, the BIFF initiated 116 hostile acts in North Cotabato, Sultan Kudarat and Maguindanao, consisting of ambuscade, firing, arson, IED attacks and grenade explosions. 66 of these violent incidents were committed during the martial law period and by the AFP's assessment, the group will continue to inflict violence and sow terror in central Mindanao.<br><br>(p) In 2017, the ASG, which is the predominant local terrorist group in the Southern Philippines based in Tawi-Tawi, Sulu, Basilan and Zamboanga, with its 519 members, 503 firearms, 66 controlled barangays and 345 watch-listed personalities, had perpetrated a total of 13 acts of kidnapping against 37 individuals, 11 of whom (including 7 foreigners) remain in captivity. Their kidnap-for-ransom activities for last year alone have amassed a total of P61.2 million.<br><br>(q) Mindanao remains the hotbed of communist rebellion considering that 47% of its manpower, 48% of its firearms, 51% of its controlled barangays and 45% of its guerilla fronts are in this region. Of the 14 provinces with active communist insurgency, 10 are in Mindanao. Furthermore, the communist rebels' Komisyon Mindanao (KOMMID) is now capable of sending augmentation forces, particularly "Party Cadres," in Northern Luzon.<br><br>(r) The hostilities initiated by the communist rebels have risen by 65% from 2016 to 2017 despite the peace talks. In 2017 alone, they perpetrated 422 atrocities in Mindanao, including ambush, raids, attacks, kidnapping, robbery, bombing, liquidation, landmine/IED attacks, arson and sabotage, that resulted in the death of 47 government forces and 31 civilians. An ambush in Bukidnon in November 2017 killed one PNP personnel, two civilians and a four-month old baby. 59 incidents of arson committed by the Communist rebels against business establishments in Mindanao last year alone destroyed P2.378 billion worth of properties. Moreover, the amount they extorted from private individuals and business establishments from 2015 to the first semester of 2017 has been estimated at P2.6 billion.<br><br>(s) Among the most significant attacks by the communist rebels on business establishments took place in April and May 2017 when they burned the facilities of Lapanday Food Corporation in Davao City and those of Mil-Oro Mining and Frasec Ventures Corporation in Mati City, Davao Oriental, which resulted in losses amounting to P1.85 billion and P109 million, respectively. According to the AFP, business establishments in the area may be forced to shut down due to persistent NPA attacks just like in Surigao del Sur.<br><br>(t) By AFP's calculation, the aforesaid rebel groups (excluding the 400 newly recruited members of the Dawlah Islamiyah) are nearly 2,781- men strong, equipped with 3,211 firearms and control 537 barangays in Mindanao.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote>These events and circumstances, while worthy of severe condemnation, do not show the existence of an actual rebellion in a theater of war. <u><b>At most</b></u>, as I stressed earlier, these indicate the <b>threat</b> of imminent danger brought about by the reorganization, consolidation, recruitment and reinforcement activities, as well as isolated planned attacks undertaken by various armed groups.<br><br>Verily, <b>in the absence of an armed public uprising which imperils the operation of the civil government, a declaration of martial law or any extension thereof necessarily fails the test of sufficiency, as such absence negates not only the existence of an actual rebellion, <u>but also refutes the respondents' assertion that said declaration or extension is necessitated by the requirements of public safety</u></b>. It is settled that the imminent danger of a rebellion, assuming one exists, cannot serve as sufficient basis for the proclamation of martial law; perforce, the threatened rebirth of a rebellion which the law considers dead cannot, with more reason, justify an extension thereof.<br><br><b><i>The continued implementation of martial law without sufficient basis constitutes a violation of due process.</i></b><br><br>There appears to be no right more fundamental in a modem democracy than the right to due process. In <i>White Light Corp. v. City of Manila</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> (<i>White Light</i>), the Court explained how the concept of due process must be understood, thus:<br><blockquote>Due process evades a precise definition. <b>The purpose of the guaranty is to prevent arbitrary governmental encroachment against the life, liberty and property of individuals.</b> The due process guaranty serves as a protection against arbitrary regulation or seizure. Even corporations and partnerships are protected by the guaranty insofar as their property is concerned.<br><br>The due process guaranty has traditionally been interpreted as imposing two related but distinct restrictions on government, "procedural due process" and "substantive due process." Procedural due process refers to the procedures that the government must follow before it deprives a person of life, liberty, or property. Procedural due process concerns itself with government action adhering to the established process when it makes an intrusion into the private sphere. Examples range from the form of notice given to the level of formality of a hearing.<br><br>If due process were confined solely to its procedural aspects, there would arise absurd situation of arbitrary government action, provided the proper formalities are followed. <b>Substantive due process completes the protection envisioned by the due process clause. It inquires whether the government has sufficient justification for depriving a person of life, liberty, or property.</b><br><br>The question of substantive due process, moreso than most other fields of law, has reflected dynamism in progressive legal thought tied with the expanded acceptance of fundamental freedoms. Police power, traditionally awesome as it may be, is now confronted with a more rigorous level of analysis before it can be upheld. The vitality though of constitutional due process has not been predicated on the frequency with which it has been utilized to achieve a liberal result for, after all, the libertarian ends should sometimes yield to the prerogatives of the State. Instead, the due process clause has acquired potency because of the sophisticated methodology that has emerged to determine the proper metes and bounds for its application.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>In essence, the right to due process had been specifically adopted by the framers of the Constitution to protect individual citizens from the abuses of government. The importance that the Constitution ascribes to the right to due process is clear. As well, the need to afford primacy to due process in the resolution of this Petition is evident, if not compelling.<br><br>To recall, martial law operates to grant the AFP jurisdiction over civilians when and where the civil government is unable to function as a consequence of an actual rebellion or invasion. As exhaustively discussed, the imposition of martial law operates as a matter of necessity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> The conditions necessary to authorize its imposition are not only fixed but also exacting, for the imposition of martial law constitutes an encroachment on the life, liberty and property of private individuals.<br><br>To me, this is the significance of this case: as earlier stated, the imposition of martial law in the absence of the exigencies justifying the same reduces such extraordinary power to a mere tool of convenience and expediency. The baseless imposition of martial law constitutes, in itself, a violation of substantive and procedural due process, as it effectively bypasses and renders nugatory the explicit conditions and limitations clearly spelled out in the Constitution for the protection of individual citizens.<br><br>The Court must disabuse itself of the notion that martial law is required to quell the rebellion, or to empower the military and the police to engage the lawless elements in Mindanao. The Executive is fully empowered to deploy the armed forces as necessary to suppress lawless violence, and even rebellion, whether actual or imminent, without martial law. Martial law is an emergency governance response that is directed <b>against the civilian population</b> - allowing the military to perform what are otherwise civilian government functions and vesting military jurisdiction over civilians.<br><br><b>It is through this lens that the Court should view the pressing question of whether or not there was sufficient basis to extend Martial Law.</b><br><br>To stress, the Court's function in a Section 18 review is to be an avenue for the restoration of the normal workings of government and the enjoyment of individual liberties should there be a showing of insufficient factual basis.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> A ruling that sanctions the extension of martial law as a matter of expediency defeats this function and stands as a danger to public safety in itself, for it jeopardizes, for the sake of convenience, the fundamental freedoms guaranteed by the Bill of Rights - that from warrantless arrests and searches, without prior determination of probable cause.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>To be sure, what fans the flames of rebellion, whether a lasting peace is achievable in Mindanao, whether the military option is the way to address the violence in Mindanao - these are questions that can be debated <i>ad nauseum</i>. Who the so-called enemies of the Republic are and who and what their targets may be will certainly be the subject of endless speculation. At present, there are the Mautes, BIFFs, ASGs, NPAs, and other armed groups. There may be others which have not been identified by the military.<br><br>Without doubt, the threats to the country's internal and external peace and security are incessant and always present. Armed hostilities in all the islands of the country exist and will continue to exist. There is as well the specter of terrorism throughout the world.<br><br>And yet, in the face of all these, what should not be forgotten, overlooked or considered trivial is that the present Constitution has excised "imminent danger" from its martial law provision. What is required by the Constitution is actual rebellion or invasion for martial law to be declared or to persist. The respondents have not presented proof of actual rebellion, or any ongoing armed uprising between the government's armed forces and any of the so-called rebel groups, in any part of Mindanao. Even in Marawi City, the actual rebellion there no longer exists. To be sure, the reconstruction and rehabilitation of Marawi is already underway. The respondents' proof, consisting of the presence of "remnants" of the Maute group that are carrying on recruitment and training of new forces, financial and logistical build-up, consolidation of forces, and isolated attacks, as well as the increase in the Basilan-based ASG's manpower with its newly recruited members undergoing trainings in tactics, marksmanships and bombing operations, may present an "imminent danger" situation - but they do not rise to meet the Constitution's conditions.<br><br>In the end, as the country grapples with all these conflicts, it cannot fall into the slippery slope of expediency as the standard with which to attempt to solve these problems. No matter how beneficial or preferable the psychic effects the state of martial law may have upon government officials and the population at large, it cannot be wielded in the absence of the conditions required by the Constitution for its imposition. In the end, the fundamental law that binds all citizens of this country is the Constitution one that demands public safety and necessity as basis for curtailing fundamental Constitutional freedoms. That is what the Constitution mandates. That, in turn, points the Court to where its duty lies - to ensure that the true state of facts is made known, that is, that the rebellion has not persisted, and that public safety does not require the extension anymore.<br><br><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, I vote to <b>GRANT</b> the petitions in G.R.

Guerrero (<i>Gen. Guerrero</i>) recommended, for compelling reasons based on current security assessment, the further extension of martial law and the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus for twelve (12) months beginning 1 January until 31 December 2018 in the whole island of Mindanao. The reasons cited by Gen. Guerrero in his letter to justify his recommendation were as follows:<br><blockquote>1. The DAESH-inspired DIWM groups and allies continue to visibly offer armed resistance in other parts of Central, Western, and Eastern Mindanao in spite of the neutralization of their key leaders and destruction of their forces in Marawi City;<br><br>2. Other DAESH-inspired and like-minded threat groups such as the BIFF, AKP, DI-Maguid, DI-Toraifie, and the ASG remain capable of staging similar atrocities and violent attacks against vulnerable targets in Mindanao, including the cities of Davao, Cagayan de Oro, General Santos, Zamboanga, and Cotabato;<br><br>3. The CTs have been pursuing and intensifying their political mobilization (army, party, and mass base building, rallies, pickets and demonstrations, financial and logistical buildup), terrorism against innocent civilians and private entities, and guerilla warfare against the security sector and public government infrastructures;<br><br>4. The need to intensify the campaign against the CTs is necessary in order to defeat their strategy, stop their extortion, defeat their armed component, and to stop their recruitment activities;<br><br>5. The threats being posed by the CTs, the ASG, and the presence of remnants, protectors, supporters and sympathizers of the DAESH/DIWM pose a clear and imminent danger to public safety and hinders the speedy rehabilitation, recovery, and reconstruction efforts in Marawi City, and the attainment of lasting peace, stability, economic development, and prosperity in Mindanao;<br><br>6. The second extension of the implementation of Martial Law coupled with the continued suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus in Mindanao will significantly help not only the AFP, but also the other stakeholders in quelling and putting an end to the ongoing DAESH-inspired DIWM groups and CT-staged rebellion, and in restoring public order, safety and stability in Mindanao; and<br><br>7. In seeking another extension, the AFP is ready, willing and able to perform anew its mandated task in the same manner that it had dutifully done for the whole duration of Martial Law to date, without any reported human rights violation and/or incident of abuse of authority.<br></blockquote>On 1 December 2017, DND Secretary Delfin N. Lorenzana (<i>Sec. Lorenzana</i>) wrote President Duterte recommending the further extension of martial law for a period of one year beginning 1 January until 31 December 2018 "covering the whole island of Mindanao primarily to ensure total eradication of DAESH-inspired Da'awatul Islamiyah Waliyatul Masriq (DIWM), other like-minded Local/Foreign Terrorist Groups (L/FTGs) and Armed Lawless Groups (ALGs), the communist terrorists (CTs) and their coddlers, supporters, and financiers, to ensure speedy rehabilitation, recovery and reconstruction efforts in Marawi, and the attainment of lasting peace, stability, economic development, and prosperity in Mindanao."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>In his letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated 8 December 2017, President Duterte informed the Senate and the House of Representatives about the letters he received from Sec. Lorenzana and Gen. Guerrero. President Duterte stated in his letter that, as Commander in Chief, he has personal knowledge of the security assessment submitted by the AFP and which was supported by a similar assessment by the Philippine National Police (PNP), to wit:<br><blockquote>First, despite the death of Hapilon and the Maute brothers, the remnants of their groups have continued to rebuild their organization through the recruitment and training of new members and fighters to carry on the rebellion. You will please note that at least one hundred eighty-five (185) persons listed in the Martial Law Arrest Orders have remained at large and, in all probability, are presently regrouping and consolidating their forces.<br><br>More specifically, the remnants of DAESH-inspired DIWM members and their allies, together with their protectors, supporters, and sympathizers, have been monitored in their continued efforts towards the radicalization/recruitment, financial and logistical build up, as well as in their consolidation/reorganization in Central Mindanao, particularly in the provinces of Maguindanao and North Cotabato and also in Sulu and Basilan. <b>These activities are geared towards the conduct of intensified atrocities and armed public uprisings in support of their objective of establishing the foundation of a global Islamic caliphate and a Wilayat not only in the Philippines but also in the whole of Southeast Asia.</b><br><br>Second, the Turaifie Group has likewise been monitored to be planning to conduct bombings, notably targeting the Cotabato area. Turaifie is said to be Hapilon's potential successor as Amir of DAESH Wilayat in the Philippines and Southeast Asia.<br><br>Third, the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) continue to defy the government by perpetrating at least fifteen (15) violent incidents during the martial law period in Maguindanao and North Cotabato. For this year, the BIFF has initiated at least eighty-nine (89) violent incidents, mostly harassment and roadside bombings against government troops.<br><br>Fourth, the remnants of the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) in Basilan, Sulu, Tawi-Tawi, and Zamboanga Peninsula remain as a serious security concern. Reports indicate that this year they have conducted at least forty­-three (43) acts of terrorism, including attacks using Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), harassments, and kidnappings which have resulted in the killing of eight (8) civilians, three (3) of whom were mercilessly beheaded.<br><br>Last, but certainly not the least, while the government was preoccupied with addressing the challenges posed by the DAESH-inspired DIWM and other Local Terrorist Groups (LTGs), the New People's Army (NPA) took advantage of the situation and intensified their decades-long rebellion against the government and stepped up terrorist acts against innocent civilians and private entities, as well as guerilla warfare against the security sector and public and government infrastructure, <b>purposely to seize political power through violent means and supplant the country's democratic form of government with Communist rule</b>.<br><br>x x x<br></blockquote>Corollary to the above assessments, President Duterte asked that the Congress further extend martial law and the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus in the whole of Mindanao for a period of one (1) year, i.e., from 1 January to 31 December 2018, or for such other period of time as the Congress may determine in accordance with Section (<i>Sec</i>.) 18, Article (<i>Art</i>.) VII of the 1987 Constitution. President Duterte offered the following explanation:<br><blockquote>A further extension of the implementation of martial law and suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus in Mindanao will help the AFP, the x x x PNP, and all other law enforcement agencies to quell completely and put an end to the ongoing rebellion in Mindanao and prevent the same from escalating to other parts of the country. Public safety indubitably requires such further extension, not only for the sake of security and public order, but more importantly to enable the government and the people of Mindanao to pursue the bigger task of rehabilitation and the promotion of a stable socio-economic growth and development.<br></blockquote>In the Resolution of Both Houses (<i>RBH</i>) No. 4,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> dated 13 December 2017, the Senate and the House of Representatives approved President Duterte's request for another extension of martial law and the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus for the period 1 January to 31 December 2018.<br><br>Hence, the present petitions.<br><br>In G.R. No. 235935, petitioners anchored their petition on the following:<br><blockquote><center>I.<br></center><br>The leadership and supermajority of both chambers of the Congress of the Philippines baselessly and with brazen alacrity acceded to the President's initiative of extending the duration of martial law in Mindanao for one full year by relying on the mere say-so of the military and police authorities on the purported "continuing rebellion" by remnants of terrorist groups in Mindanao.<br><br><center>II.<br></center><br>The leadership of the House of Representatives and of the Senate, as supported by the supermajority, unduly constricted the period of deliberation and interpellation on the President's request for extension of martial law to an indecent three hours and 35 minutes for considering favorably an extension which will endure for 8,760 hours in 2018 in the entire Mindanao.<br><br><center>III.<br></center><br>The threats of violence and terrorism alleged by the President, Philippine National Police (PNP) and Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) from remnants of the terrorist groups do not constitute a constitutional ground for the re-extension of martial law in Mindanao.<br><br><center>IV.<br></center><br>The extension of one year from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018 of the period of martial law in Mindanao defies the Constitution's unmistakable mandate of a limited duration of the declaration of martial law and its extension.<br><br><center>V.<br></center><br>The leadership and supermajority of both Chambers of the Congress of the Philippines wantonly violated and exceeded the congressional authority under the Constitution for a one-time extension of the original proclamation (Proclamation No. 216), and not to re-extend a previous extension or grant a series of extensions amounting to "perpetuity."<br><br><center>VI.<br></center><br>Verily, the approval of the extension of martial law and the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus in Mindanao utterly lacks sufficient factual basis because there is no actual rebellion in Mindanao and the re-extension is extremely long even as the approval was made with undue haste and unscrupulous imprudence.<br><br><center>VII.<br></center><br>The leadership and supermajority of both Chambers of the Congress of the Philippines in extending martial law and the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus in Mindanao committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.<br><br><center>VIII.<br></center><br>While martial law does not confer any significant additional powers to the President as well as to the military and police establishments, its imposition and extension emboldens government forces to indiscriminately attack and kill perceived enemies of the State and conduct warrantless arrests, searches and seizures even as the civilian courts are functioning.<br><br><center>IX.<br></center><br>Without extending martial law in Mindanao, the President has the constitutional power as Commander in Chief to call out all the armed forces to prevent or suppress lawless violence, invasion or rebellion in Mindanao.<br></blockquote>In G.R. No. 236061, petitioners raised this sole issue:<br><blockquote>THE PRIMORDIAL ISSUE IS WHETHER THERE IS SUFFICIENT FACTUAL BASIS FOR THE ONE-YEAR EXTENSION OF MARTIAL LAW AND THE SUSPENSION OF THE PRIVILEGE OF THE WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS IN THE ENTIRE MINDANAO.<br></blockquote>Petitioners in G.R. No. 236145 tried to fortify their petition through the following premises:<br><blockquote><center>I.<br></center><br>THE INSTANT PETITION SATISFIES THE REQUISITES FOR THE EXERCISE OF THE HONORABLE COURT'S POWER OF JUDICIAL REVIEW.<br><br><center>II.<br></center><br>THE HONORABLE COURT MUST TEST THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE EXTENSION OF PROCLAMATION NO. 216 IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MEANING AND PURPOSE OF MARTIAL LAW AS INTENDED BY THE CONSTITUTIONAL COMMISSION, AND AS ARTICULATED BY THE HONORABLE COURT IN <i>LAGMAN V. MEDIALDEA</i>.<br><br><center>III.<br></center><br>ABSENT AN ACTUAL INVASION OR REBELLION, THERE CAN BE NO SUFFICIENT FACTUAL BASIS FOR THE CONTINUED IMPOSITION OF MARTIAL LAW IN MINDANAO.<br></blockquote>In G.R. No. 236155, the petitioners raised the following justifications to grant their petition, to wit:<br><blockquote><center>A.<br></center><br>THE HONORABLE COURT HAS THE POWER AND CONSTITUTIONAL MANDATE TO INDEPENDENTLY DETERMINE THE SUFFICIENCY OF THE FACTUAL BASES FOR THE EXTENSION OF PROCLAMATION NO. 216 AND IF IT SO DETERMINES, NULLIFY THE SAME.<br><br><center>B.<br></center><br>THE PRESIDENT'S REQUEST FOR, AND CONGRESS' SUBSEQUENT JOINT RESOLUTION TO FUTHER EXTEND THE EFFECTIVITY OF PROCLAMATION NO. 216 UNTIL 31 DECEMBER 2018, LACK SUFFICIENT FACTUAL BASIS, AND ARE THEREFORE NULL AND VOID.<br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b>DISCUSSION</b><br></div><br><b><i>The President is immune from suit during his tenure.</i></b><br><br>We note that in G.R. Nos. 236061 and 236145, President Duterte was named as a respondent.<br><br>Jurisprudence dictates that the presidential immunity from suit remains preserved in the system of government of this country, even though not expressly reserved in the 1987 Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Addressing a concern of his co-members in the 1986 Constitutional Commission on the absence of an express provision on the matter, Fr. Joaquin Bernas, S.J., observed that it was already understood in jurisprudence that the President may not be sued during his or her tenure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> The President is granted the privilege of immunity from suit to assure the exercise of Presidential duties and functions free from any hindrance or distraction, considering that the position of Chief Executive of the Government requires all of the office-holder's time and demands undivided attention to his duties as Head of State.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> This ruling was further amplified in <i>David v. Macapagal-Arroyo</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>Incidentally, it is not proper to implead President Arroyo as respondent. Settled is the doctrine that the President, during his tenure of office or actual incumbency, may not be sued in any civil or criminal case, and there is no need to provide for it in the Constitution or law. It will degrade the dignity of the high office of the President, the Head of State, if he can be dragged into court litigations while serving as such. Furthermore, it is important that he be freed from any form of harassment, hindrance or distraction to enable him to fully attend to the performance of his official duties and functions. Unlike the legislative and judicial branch, only one constitutes the executive branch and anything which impairs his usefulness in the discharge of the many great and important duties imposed upon him by the Constitution necessarily impairs the operation of the Government. However, this does not mean that the President is not accountable to anyone. Like any other official, he remains accountable to the people but he may be removed from office only in the mode provided by law and that is by impeachment.<br></blockquote>Considering the foregoing, President Duterte should be dropped as respondent in G.R. Nos. 236061 and 236145.<br><br><b><i>The act of declaring martial law differs from the act of extending martial law.</i></b><br><br>Sec. 18, Article VII of the 1987 Constitution reads:<br><blockquote><b>Section 18.</b> The President shall be the Commander in Chief of all armed forces of the Philippines and whenever it becomes necessary, he may call out such armed forces to prevent or suppress lawless violence, invasion or rebellion. In case of invasion or rebellion, when public safety requires it, he may, for a period not exceeding sixty days, suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus or place the Philippines or any part thereof under martial law. Within forty-eight hours from the proclamation of martial law or the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, the President shall submit a report in person or in writing to the Congress. The Congress, voting jointly, by a vote of at least a majority of all its Members in regular or special session, may revoke such proclamation or suspension, which revocation shall not be set aside by the President. Upon the initiative of the President, the Congress may, in the same manner, extend such proclamation or suspension for a period to be determined by the Congress, if the invasion or rebellion shall persist and public safety requires it.<br></blockquote>The Congress, if not in session, shall, within twenty-four hours following such proclamation or suspension, convene in accordance with its rules without need of a call.<br><br>The Supreme Court may review, in an appropriate proceeding filed by any citizen, the sufficiency of the factual basis of the proclamation of martial law or the suspension of the privilege of the writ or the extension thereof, and must promulgate its decision thereon within thirty days from its filing.<br><br>A state of martial law does not suspend the operation of the Constitution, nor supplant the functioning of the civil courts or legislative assemblies, nor authorize the conferment of jurisdiction on military courts and agencies over civilians where civil courts are able to function, nor automatically suspend the privilege of the writ.<br><br>The suspension of the privilege of the writ shall apply only to persons judicially charged for rebellion or offenses inherent in or directly connected with invasion.<br><br>During the suspension of the privilege of the writ, any person thus arrested or detained shall be judicially charged within three days, otherwise he shall be released.<br><br>The act pertaining to the declaration of martial law differs from the extension of martial law. The act of declaring martial law is an executive act, i.e., <i>the President as the Commander in Chief of all armed forces of the Philippines, whenever it becomes necessary, may call out such armed forces to prevent or suppress lawless violence, invasion or rebellion</i>. The act of declaring martial law is the sole prerogative of the President.<br><br>The act of extending martial law on the one hand, is a joint executive­legislative act brought into motion by the initiative of the President. The extension of martial law is given life because the Congress voting jointly, by a vote of at least a majority of all its Members in regular or special session, has determined that actual invasion or rebellion persists, and that public safety requires it. This conforms to the constitutional requirement that it should be "<i>in the same manner</i>" that the Congress undertook its legislative review of the declaration of martial law that it should determine whether or not to extend martial law. It must be stressed, however, that Congress cannot <i>motu proprio</i> extend martial law as it must first await the request of the President stating the need for the extension, i.e., <i>upon the initiative of the President</i>.<br><br>On record is Proclamation No. 216<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> issued by President Duterte, on 23 May 2017, through Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea, declaring the state of martial law in the Mindanao group of islands for a period not exceeding sixty days.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> On the one hand, in view of the President's initiative, the Congress issued RBH Nos. 2 and 4<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> whereby the Senate and the House of Representatives resolved to further extend Proclamation No. 216 until 31 December 2017, and from 1 January to 31 December 2018, respectively.<br><br>The act of declaring martial law is subject to an automatic review by Congress, i.e., <i>The Congress, voting jointly, by a vote of at least a majority of all its Members in regular or special session, may revoke such proclamation or suspension, which revocation shall not be set aside by the President</i>. Hence, extant from the records are Senate Resolution No. 49<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> and House Resolution No. 1050<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> which documented the final determination of both bodies, in the exercise of their automatic review power, not to revoke Proclamation No. 2016.<br><br>Since the matter of extending martial law is an act of Congress, it would be absurd that the same body would subject its determination to its own review. It is only logical to deduce that the Congress, voting jointly, had already threshed out all the issues and concerns before coming to a decision on whether or not to extend martial law.<br><br>The duration of martial law as declared by the President should not exceed sixty (60) days, while the life span of an extension of martial law would be subject to its determination by Congress. But whether it is an executive or joint executive-legislative act, martial law can only be justified by the existence of an actual invasion or rebellion and that public safety should require it. It is in this stage that the wisdom of the Court is summoned when it is asked to review, in an appropriate proceeding filed by any citizen, the sufficiency of the factual basis for the proclamation of martial law or the extension thereof. Thus, whether it is an executive act of declaration of martial law or the executive-legislative act for the extension thereof, the Court can always be called upon to review the sufficiency of the factual basis of the proclamation or extension of martial law.<br><br><b><i>The requisites for the extension of martial law</i></b><br><br>Considering that the term "rebellion" has not been defined in the Constitution, the Court has deferred to the definition in the Revised Penal Code, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>Art. 134. <i>Rebellion or insurrection; How committed.</i> - The crime of rebellion or insurrection is committed by rising publicly and taking arms against the Government for the purpose of removing from the allegiance to said Government or its laws, the territory of the Philippine Islands or any part thereof, of any body of land, naval or other armed forces, depriving the Chief Executive or the Legislature, wholly or partially, of any of their powers or prerogatives.<br></blockquote>In <i>Lagman v. Medialdea</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> the Court held that for rebellion to exist the following must be present: (1) there is a (a) public uprising and (b) taking arms against the Government; and (2) the purpose of the uprising or movement is either (a) to remove from the allegiance to the Government or its laws (i) the territory of the Philippines or any part thereof; or (ii) any body of land, naval, or other armed forces; or (b) to deprive the Chief Executive or Congress, wholly or partially, of any of their powers and prerogatives.<br><br>The Court has ruled that in "determining the existence of rebellion, the President only needs to convince himself that there is probable cause or evidence showing that more likely than not a rebellion was committed or is being committed. To require him to satisfy a higher standard of proof would restrict the exercise of his emergency powers."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> It merely necessitates an average man [to weigh] the facts and circumstances without resorting to the calibration of the rules of evidence of which he has no technical knowledge.<br><br>He [merely] relies on common sense [and] x x x needs only to rest on evidence showing that, more likely than not, a crime has been committed x x x by the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> It is in view of this required standard that the Court established the metes and bounds to determine the sufficiency of the factual basis of martial law, <i>viz</i>: 1) actual rebellion or invasion; 2) public safety requires it; the first two requirements must concur; and 3) there is probable cause for the President to believe that there is actual rebellion or invasion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Having ascertained that it is upon the initiative of the President that Congress undertake a determination on whether the extension of martial law is warranted, the issue that comes to the fore is the resolution of the parameter that should be observed by the august body in making such determination.<br><br>To restate, Sec. 18, Art. VII of the 1987 Constitution provides: "x x x Upon the initiative of the President, the Congress may, <b>in the same manner</b>, extend such proclamation or suspension for a period to be determined by the Congress, <b>if the invasion or rebellion shall persist and public safety requires it</b>." In observing this provision, there is certainty that the same parameter used in determining the sufficiency of factual basis in the declaration of martial law equally applies to its extension, i.e., 1) actual rebellion or invasion persists as required by the Constitution; 2) public safety requires the extension, with the first two requirements present; and 3) there is probable cause for the President and the Congress to believe that actual rebellion or invasion persists.<br><br><b><i>a. Actual rebellion persists.</i></b><br><br>Petitioners invariably claim that there is no actual rebellion to support the extension of martial law.<br><br>It must be emphasized that in extending martial law, the President and the legislators need only to convince themselves that there is probable cause or evidence showing that more likely than not the rebellion persists.<br><br>In his letter dated 8 December 2017, President Duterte stated that the grounds on which he anchored his request for the extension of martial law from 1 January to 31 December 2018 were based on the security assessment submitted by the AFP and the PNP. He claims that he has personal knowledge of the circumstances constituting the security assessment. He clearly acknowledged the persistence of rebellion when he stated that the extension of martial law and the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus will help the AFP, the PNP, and other law enforcement agencies to quell completely the ongoing rebellion in Mindanao and prevent its escalation to other parts of the country. Additionally, the recent developments involving the National Democratic Front, the Communist Party of the Philippines, and the New People's Army (NDF-CPP-NPA) portend intensified armed hostilities, which together with the other security concerns continue to make Mindanao a hotbed for rebellion.<br><br>On the one hand, after four hours of discussion and extensive debate, the Congress, in a joint session with two hundred forty affirmative votes comprising the majority of all its m mbers, determined that rebellion persists and that public safety indubitably required the further extension of martial law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>At this point, there is a need to repeat the ruling in Lagman that "the purpose of judicial review is not the determination of accuracy or veracity of the facts upon which the President anchored his declaration of martial law or suspension of the privilege of the writ ofhabeas corpus; rather, only the sufficiency of the factual basis as to convince the President that there is probable cause that rebellion exists." That same purpose applies to the present judicial review insofar as it would determine the sufficiency of the factual basis as to convince the President and the Congress that there is probable cause that rebellion persists.<br><br>The records confirm that the President and the Congress have separately determined and were convinced that rebellion persists in Mindanao. The Court cannot supplant its own findings with those made by the President and the Congress because to do so would be tantamount to encroaching on the well-safeguarded and independent dominion of the executive and the legislature.<br><br>The contention of the petitioners that the President should have exercised his extraordinary power of calling out the armed forces instead of requesting the extension of martial law, has no basis. The Court cannot tread on this issue as it clearly recognizes that its power of judicial review does <i>not</i> extend to calibrating the President's decision as to which extraordinary power to avail of given a set of facts or conditions. To do so would be an incursion into the exclusive domain of the executive and an infringement on the prerogative that solely, at least initially, lies with the President.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>In the same vein, the issue as to the duration of the martial law extension is better left to the decision of the Congress considering that the Constitution plainly provides that the august body, in resolving whether or not to extend martial law, shall likewise determine the period for the extension.<br><br>The contention that the congressional authority is for a one-time extension of the original proclamation, is without basis. A reading of Sec. 18, Art. VII of the 1987 Constitution evinces that there is nothing that would indicate such limitation. For sure, even the contention that the series of extensions may amount to "perpetuity" is specious considering that there are established parameters for Congress in extending martial law, which extension may even be subject to the Court's judicial review.<br><br><b><i>b. Public safety requires the extension of martial law.</i></b><br><br>"Public safety, which is another component element for the declaration of martial law, 'involves the prevention of and protection from events that could endanger the safety of the general public from significant danger, injury/harm, or damage, such as crimes or disasters.' Public safety is an <i>abstract</i> term; it does not take any physical form. Plainly, its range, extent or scope could not be physically measured by metes and bounds."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>The letter of Pres. Duterte detailing the security assessment by the AFP and the PNP satisfies the public safety requirement for the extension, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>First, despite the death of Hapilon and the Maute brothers, the remnants of their groups have continued to rebuild their organization through the recruitment and training of new members and fighters to carry on the rebellion. <i>You will please note that at least one hundred eighty-five (185) persons listed in the Martial Law Arrest Orders have remained at large and, in all probability, are presently regrouping and consolidating their forces.</i><br><br><i>More specifically, the remnants of DAESH-inspired DIWM members and their allies, together with their protectors, supporters, and sympathizers, have been monitored in their continued efforts towards the radicalization/recruitment, financial and logistical buildup, as well as in their consolidation/reorganization in Central lvfindanao, particularly in the provinces of Maguindanao and North Cotabato and also in Sulu and Basilan.</i> <b>These activities are geared towards the conduct of intensified atrocities and armed public uprisings in support of their objective of establishing the foundation of a global Islamic caliphate and a Wilayat not only in the Philippines but also in the whole of Southeast Asia.</b><br><br><i>Second, the Turaifie Group has likewise been monitored to be planning to conduct bombings, notably targeting the Cotabato area.</i> Turaifie is said to be Hapilon's potential successor as Amir of DAESH Wilayat in the Philippines and Southeast Asia.<br><br><i>Third, the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) continue to defy the government</i> by perpetrating at least fifteen (15) violent incidents during the martial law period in Maguindanao and North Cotabato. For this year, the BIFF has initiated at least eighty-nine (89) violent incidents, mostly harassments and roadside bombings against government troops.<br><br><i>Fourth, the remnants of the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) in Basilan. Sulu, Tawi-Tawi, and Zamboanga Peninsula remain as a serious security concern.</i> Reports indicate that this year they have conducted at least forty­-three (43) acts of terrorism, including attacks using Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), harassments, and kidnappings which have resulted in the killing of eight (8) civilians, three (3) of whom were mercilessly beheaded.<br><br><i>Last, but certainly not the least, while the government was preoccupied with addressing the challenges posed by the DAESH-inspired DIWM and other Local Terrorist Groups (LTGs), the New People's Army (NPA) took advantage of the situation and intensified their decades long rebellion against the government and stepped up terrorist acts against innocent civilians and private entities, as well as guerilla warfare against the security sector and public and government infrastructure, <b>purposely to seize political power through violent means and supplant the country's democratic form of government with Communist rule</b>.</i> (italics supplied)<br></blockquote>Petitioners averred that even President Duterte, in his letter requesting for the extension of martial law, referred to "remnants" of the terrorist groups purportedly recruiting fighters to launch new attacks. Petitioners claimed that "(A)lmost comically, martial law is extended in Mindanao to subdue residual phantoms."<br><br>True, the word "remnants" was used by President Duterte in his letter, but this does not mean that the remaining forces of the terrorist groups were not as powerful, or even more powerful as its founders and original fighters. It cannot even be validly claimed that the resolve of the "remnants" to establish a global Islamic caliphate and a <i>Wilayat</i> had lessened or was completely shattered when the DAESH-inspired fighters and their leaders were neutralized. On the contrary, the death of their fighters and leaders could even have wrongly enlightened the remnants of the alleged nobleness of their cause and would have converted this belief into a stronger resolve to continue to fight the government.<br><br>The remnants are not specters who do not deserve any attention from the government. The immense havoc created by the DAESH-inspired DIWM, BIFF, and ASG in Marawi is real. The huge number of dead civilians and military personnel, and the vast amount of funds needed to rebuild Marawi cannot be denied. There is the lingering plausibility that greater massive destruction would result after these groups would have regrouped and consolidated their forces. There is even the possibility that the NDF-CPP-NPA, which have successfully sown acts of terrorism in different parts of the country, and the Turaifie group, the potential successor of Hapilon as Amir of DAESH Wilayat in the Philippines and in Southeast Asia, would join the remnants, albeit these groups do not gravitate towards the same goal. And with the assistance of well-funded and highly equipped foreign terrorist groups, it is undeniable that the "remnants" would be a formidable force to reckon with.<br><br>Equally significant is the actual need of the government to forthwith contain these terrorist groups in specific areas rather than allow them all over the country. It cannot be denied that it took the government five months to neutralize the DAESH-inspired fighters despite the fact that the terrorist attacks were mostly confined in Marawi. The number of dead civilians and military personnel as well as the huge amount of funds needed to weed out the terrorist groups easily defused whatever victory the government had claimed in neutralizing this terrorist group. Indeed, the ruins in Marawi are painful reminders to the government that its success sadly mirrors the great failures behind it.<br><br>The volatile situation in Mindanao right now spawns a good breeding ground for terrorists and their coddlers, supporters, and financiers. The government cannot sit idly by and wait for these terrorist groups to make their move. The arduous task of crushing the terrorist groups must start posthaste otherwise, another victory, though bittersweet it may be, may not be possible at all for the government if these groups are allowed to proliferate all over the country.<br><br>The Court has emphasized that time is paramount in situations necessitating the proclamation of martial law or suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Considering that an extension of martial law is ineludibly moored on the existence of an actual rebellion that persists and that public safety requires it, there is a paramount urgency for the President and Congress to act quickly to protect the country.<br><br><b><i>c. There is probable cause for the President and the Congress to believe that actual rebellion persists.</i></b><br><br>Records will confirm that both the President and the Congress have separately determined whether actual rebellion persists in Mindanao, and in the process are convinced that there exists probable cause that actual rebellion persists. Worth noting, the President has a wide range of information available to him, and that he has the right, prerogative, and the means to access vital, relevant, and confidential data, concomitant with his position as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> The President has the prerogative to share these information with Congress in fortifying his request for the extension of martial law, which information the Court may not even be privy to.

VII of the 1987 Constitution does not refer to a petition for certiorari pursuant to Sec. 1 or 5 of Art. VIII, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>It could not have been the intention of the framers of the Constitution that the phrase "in an appropriate proceeding" would refer to a Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> pursuant to Section 1 or Section 5 of Article VIII. The standard of review in a petition for <i>certiorari</i> is whether the respondent has committed any grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in the performance of his or her functions. Thus, it is not the proper tool to review the sufficiency of the factual basis of the proclamation or suspension. It must be emphasized that under Section 18, Article VII, the Court is tasked to review the sufficiency of the <i>factual</i> basis of the President's exercise of emergency powers. Put differently, if this Court applies the standard of review used in a petition for <i>certiorari</i>, the same would emasculate its constitutional task under Section 18, Article VII.<br></blockquote>Clearly, petitioners erred when they invoked Sections 1 or 5, Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution in mooring their assertion that the Senate and the House of Representatives committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in the performance of their functions.<br><br><b><i>Congress is clothed by the Constitution with the authority to determine its rules of proceedings.</i></b><br><br>Sec. 16(3), Art.

A penalty of suspension, when imposed, shall not exceed sixty days.<br></blockquote>It was obviously pursuant to this constitutional provision that the Congress had adopted the rules that governed the Joint Session when it resolved to extend martial law from 1 January to 31 December 2018.

The factual milieu and legal environment surrounding the present martial law in Mindanao are totally different from those prevailing during martial rule in 1972.<br><br>The declaration of martial law in 1972 was premised on the alleged intensified communist insurgency and perceived threat by the NPA as shown by the alleged series of bombings and assassination attempts throughout the country.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> This was permitted by Article VII, Section 11 of the 1935 Constitution which provided for justifications for declaration of martial law not present under the 1987 Constitution. In particular, under the 1935 Constitution, the President of the Philippines, as Commander in Chief of the armed forces, may suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus or place the Philippines or any part thereof under martial law when there is lawless violence, invasion, insurrection, or rebellion, when the public safety requires it.<br><br>On the other hand, the present martial law in Mindanao is based on the actual threat presented by a local terrorist group aligned with a foreign terrorist organization when they attacked government and other vital facilities, and took over Marawi City. These facts led President Duterte to believe that there was an armed public uprising with the purpose of removing a portion of the territory of the Republic of the Philippines from its allegiance thereto.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Further, while Article VII, Section 11 of the 1935 Constitution gave the President virtually unbridled powers under Martial Law, the same cannot be said under the present Constitution.<br><br>Indeed, the unrestricted commander in chief powers under the 1935 Constitution allowed then President Marcos to, among others, place the entire Philippines under martial law for more than eight (8) years from 23 September 1972, until it was officially lifted on 17 January 1981, with the issuance of Proclamation No. 2045, series of 1981; to arrogate unto himself the powers of the legislature; and to authorize military courts to have jurisdiction over civilians. The opportunities for such abuses have been curtailed by the present Constitution.<br><br>The 1987 Constitution has already established sufficient safeguards and parameters to prevent government abuse during martial law from happening again.<br><br><i>First</i>, the 1987 Constitution mandates that any declaration of martial law shall be valid only for sixty (60) days and any extension thereof shall require the concurrence of Congress voting jointly, by a vote of at least a majority of all its members.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> The present martial law in Mindanao was extended twice following this rule.<br><br><i>Second</i>, the President, even during the effectivity of martial law, cannot assume the legislative powers of Congress, or give the military courts jurisdiction over civilians because a state of martial law does not suspend the operation of the Constitution, nor supplant the functioning of the civil courts, nor authorize the conferment of jurisdiction on military courts and agencies over civilians where civil courts are able to function, nor automatically suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> And in such instance where the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus is also suspended, such suspension applies only to those judicially charged with rebellion or offenses connected with invasion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>The President, through the DND, recognized such limitation and even reminded the Armed Forces of the Philippines, through its Chief of Staff, that "any arrest, search, and seizure executed or implemented in the area or place where Martial Law is effective, including the filing of charges, should comply with the Revised Rules of Court and applicable jurisprudence."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> This directive only indicates the disposition and willingness of the present administration to follow the rule of law despite the declaration of martial law, and there is no reason for the Court to believe otherwise, unless convincing evidence to the contrary is shown.<br><br>In fine, the extraordinary powers enjoyed by President Marcos during the 1972 martial law are no longer available under the 1987 Constitution and therefore could not be applied by President Duterte.

Duterte (<i>President Duterte</i>). The said letter, in turn, was based on the letters of AFP General Rey Leonardo B. Guerrero (<i>General Guerrero</i>) and Secretary of National Defense Delfin Lorenzana<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> (<i>Secretary Lorenzana</i>), which state:<br><blockquote>The AFP strongly believes that on the basis of the foregoing assessment, the following are cited as justification for the recommended extension, to wit:<br><br>The DAESH-Inspired DIWM groups and allies continue to visibly offer armed resistance in other parts of Central, Western, and Eastern Mindanao in spite of the neutralization of their key leaders and destruction of their forces in Marawi City;<br><br>Other DAESH-inspired and like-minded threat groups such as [the] BIFF, AKP, DI-Maguid, DI-Toraype, and the ASG remain capable of staging similar atrocities and violent attacks against vulnerable targets in Mindanao, including the cities of Davao, Cagayan de Oro, General Santos, Zamboanga and Cotabato;<br><br>The CTs have been pursuing and intensifying their political mobilization (army, party and mass base building, rallies, pickets and demonstrations, financial and logistical build up), terrorism against innocent civilians and private entities, and guerilla warfare against [both] the security sector, and public government infrastructures;<br><br>The need to intensify the campaign against the CTs is necessary in order to defeat their strategy, stop their extortion, defeat their armed component, and to stop their recruitment activities;<br><br>The threats being posed by the CTs, ASG, and the presence of remnants, protectors, supporters and sympathizers of the DAESH/DIWM pose a clear and imminent danger to public safety and hinders the speedy rehabilitation, recovery and reconstruction efforts in Marawi City, and the attainment of lasting peace, stability, economic development and prosperity in Mindanao;<br><br>The 2<sup>nd</sup> extension of the implementation of Martial Law coupled with the continued suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> in Mindanao will significantly help not only the AFP, but also the other stakeholders in quelling and putting an end to the on-going DAESH­-inspired DIWM groups and CT-staged rebellion, and in restoring public order, safety, and stability in Mindanao; and<br><br>In seeking for another extension, the AFP is ready, willing and able to perform anew its mandated task in the same manner that it had dutifully done so for the whole duration of Martial law to date, without any report of human rights violation and/or incident of abuse of authority.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br></blockquote>During the oral arguments, General Guerrero presented data which justified the further extension of martial law and the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> in the whole Mindanao, to wit:<br><blockquote>After the successful Marawi Operation, the Basilan-based ASG is left with 74 members; the Maute Group with 30 members; the Maguid Group has 11; and the Turaifie Group has 22 members with a total of 166 firearms.<br><br>However, manpower increased by more or less 400, with almost the same strength that initially stormed Marawi City, through clandestine and decentralized recruitment of the Daesh-inspired groups at their respective area[s] of concentration.<br><br>ASG Basilan-based recruited more or less 43 new members in Basilan; more or less 250 by the Maute Group in Lanao provinces; 37 by the Maguid Group in Saranggani and Sultan Kudarat, and more or less 70 by the Turaifie Group in Maguindanao. These newly recruited personalities were motivated by clannish culture as they are relatives of terrorist personalities; revenge for their killed relatives/parents during the Marawi operations; financial gain[s] as new recruits were given an amount ranging from Php15,000.00 to 50,000.00; and as radicalized converts.<br><br>These newly recruited members are undergoing trainings in tactics, marksmanships and bombing operations at different area of Mount Cararao Complex, Butig, and Piagapo all of Lanao Del Sur. Recruits with high potentials [sic] were given instruction on IED-making and urban operations.<br><br>Furthermore, the situation has become complicated with the influx of Foreign Terrorist Fighters (FTFs), capitalizing on the porous maritime boundaries in Southern Philippines, in the guise as tourists and businessmen. As of this period, 48 FTFs were monitored joining the Daesh­-inspired groups, particularly the Maute Group in Lanao and Turaifie Group in Central Mindanao. The closeness of these two groups is predominant with Abu Dar who was historically established link[s] with Turaifie.<br><br>On Dawlah Islamiyah-initiated violent incidents, these have increased to 100% for the 2<sup>nd</sup> Semester.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br></blockquote>As gleaned above, the approval of the extension of martial law in Mindanao is not arbitrary but has sufficient factual basis. It must be remembered that in <i>Lagman v. Medialdea</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> (<i>Lagman</i>), the Court held that there was sufficient factual basis that actual rebellion exists in Mindanao and that public safety requires martial law, particularly in Marawi where there was intensive firefighting initiated by the Maute Group. Notably, even after President Duterte declared the liberation of Marawi City on October 17, 2017, the Maute Group was still able to recruit new members and increase their number to 250 as of December 2017. Other terrorist groups in Mindanao were able to increase their memberships as well.<br><br>General Guerrero stated that the said increase in membership was due to several factors, such as the clannish culture of the groups; revenge for their fallen relatives; and financial gain ranging from P15,000.00 to P50,000.00. He also pointed out that foreigners have been joining these terrorists group in guise of businessmen or tourists, particularly the Maute Group in Lanao and Turaifie Group in Central Mindanao.<br><br>Indeed, with these factual bases, the military needs to intensify their efforts against these terrorist groups through the continued imposition of martial law. Lifting martial law would remove the leverage of the military against these terror groups during their on-going operations and would weaken the rigorous campaign against them and allow them to continuously threaten the civilian population. These facts establish a <i>prima facie</i> case in justifying the extension of the period of martial law and the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> in the whole Mindanao because actual rebellion persists and public safety requires it.<br><br>The petitioners failed to impeach the factual basis and prima facie case presented by the respondents. Notably, in this <i>sui generis</i> petition to determine the sufficiency of the factual basis for an extension of martial law or suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>, the movants should focus on assailing the factual basis to support such declaration. Regrettably, instead of citing specific factual allegations to counter the respondents' position, the petitioners resorted to raising questions of law and even questions regarding the wisdom in extending martial law. Such tssues, however, should not be raised in this present <i>sui generis</i> proceeding.<br><br><i>Rebellion as a continuing offense</i><br><br>As stated in <i>Umil v. Ramos</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> (<i>Umil</i>), a case decided under the 1987 Constitution, the crimes of rebellion, subversion, conspiracy or proposal to commit such crimes, and crimes or offenses committed in furtherance thereof or in connection therewith constitute direct assaults against the State and are in the nature of continuing crimes. Unlike other so-called "common" offenses, such as adultery, murder, arson, etc., which generally end upon their commission, subversion and rebellion are anchored on an ideological base, which compels the repetition of the same acts of lawlessness and violence until the overriding objective of overthrowing organized government is attained.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>It was also established in <i>Umil</i> that the arrest of persons involved in the rebellion whether as its fighting armed elements, or for committing non­violent acts but in furtherance of the rebellion, is more an act of capturing them in the course of an armed conflict, to quell the rebellion, than for the purpose of immediately prosecuting them in court for a statutory offense. The arrest, therefore, need not follow the usual procedure in the prosecution of offenses which requires the determination by a judge of the existence of probable cause before the issuance of a judicial warrant of arrest and the granting of bail if the offense is bailable. Obviously, the absence of a judicial warrant is no legal impediment to arresting or capturing persons committing overt acts of violence against government forces, or any other milder acts but equally in pursuance of the rebellious movement. <b>The arrest or capture is thus impelled by the exigencies of the situation that involves the very survival of society and its government and duly constituted authorities.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>The Court stressed in <i>Umil</i> that arrest of persons involved in the rebellion whether as its fighting armed elements, <b>or for committing non­violent acts but in furtherance of the rebellion</b>, is more an act of capturing them in the course of an armed conflict, to quell the rebellion, than for the purpose of immediately prosecuting them in court for a statutory offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Consequently, even if the firefighting stopped temporarily, offenders could still be arrested by State agents if they continue to perform non-violent acts in furtherance of the rebellion, such as recruitment of members, financing of rebellious groups, or planning the next unlawful attack.<br><br>In spite of the cessation of firefighting, the crime of rebellion is continuing because the ideological base persists, which requires the repetition of the acts of lawlessness and violence until the objective of overthrowing organized government is realized. Thus, hostilities and acts of terrorism committed afterwards, pursuant to the ideological purpose, continue to form part of the crime of rebellion.<br><br>In this case, while the firefighting in Marawi City have ceased, the goal of the Maute Group to overthrow the government remains. Their continuing goal is evident in the incessant recruitment of members in the Lanao area and the financing of the rebel group. While non-violent, these acts are still considered in the furtherance of rebellion. Indeed, these acts are part and parcel of the crime of rebellion seeking to achieve their illegitimate purpose. Thus, as of December 2017, General Guerrero reported to the Court that the Maute Group has recruited a total of 250 members, a significant number capable of committing other atrocities against the civilian population.<br><br>Aside from the Maute Group, the Turaifie Group in the Cotabato Area; the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters in Maguindanao and North Cotabato; the Abu Sayaff Group in Basilan, Sulu and Tawi-Tawi; and the New People's Army are continuing their rebellious goals through their rampant recruitment and clashes with the military. Notably, the New People's Army engaged in armed conflict with the government even though there were on­going peace negotiations. These continued firefighting threaten the general populace in Mindanao, which affects public safety.<br><br>In the course of the oral arguments, General Guerrero stated that rebellion in Mindanao is still on-going in spite of the culmination of the Marawi siege, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>JUSTICE BERNABE:<br><br>Now, why is the second extension significantly longer than the first when in fact it was already publicly declared that Marawi City has been liberated from the Maute?<br><br>GENERAL GUERRERO:<br><br>As I've said, Your Honor, Marawi is just a part of the whole problem. After the liberation of Marawi, there are still other areas that we need to address.<br><br>x x x<br><br>JUSTICE BERNABE:<br><br>I mean, Marawi City had already been liberated so there is this escalating conflict already, shouldn't this diminish the public safety needed to continue with martial law over the entire Mindanao?<br><br>GENERAL GUERRERO:<br><br><b>The conflict in Marawi is distinct and separate from what is happening in the other parts of the area, in the Lanao, particularly. Although, as I have said, the conflict in Marawi has already been resolved but still there are some elements there that continue to operate. As I have said, we had just addressed the armed component and for as long as we have not addressed the other factors that have brought this conflict into existence they will still be able to continue to recruit other rebels and continue with the atrocities, Your Honor.</b><br><br>x x x<br><br>JUSTICE BERNABE:<br><br>What is the objective behind this extension of martial law, the one­year extension? Is it still to quell the Maute-Japilon led rebellion?<br><br>GENERAL GUERRERO:<br><br>Yes...<br><br>JUSTICE BERNABE:<br><br>Or is it generally put an end to all communist or terrorist activities in the entire Mindanao?<br><br>GENERAL GUERRERO:<br><br><b>The rebellion has not been quelled, Your Honor. What we have done is we have been able to resolve the Marawi conflict but the rebellion continues to exist.</b><br><br>JUSTICE BERNABE:<br><br>So, the objectives are both, to still quell the Maute-Japilon led Rebellion and as well as to put an end to all communist or terroristic activities?<br><br>GENERAL GUERRERO:<br><br>That is the objective, Your Honor, to address the other rebel groups.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br></blockquote>Certainly, with these set of facts and with the concept of rebellion as a continuing offense, there is sufficient factual basis that actual rebellion in Mindanao persists and public safety requires the extension of the period of martial law and the suspension of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> in the whole of Mindanao for a period of one (1) year, as reasonably authorized by Congress.<br><br><i>Current concept of rebellion</i><br><br>The petitioners argue that the US cases of <i>Ex Parte Milligan</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> (<i>Milligan</i>) and <i>Duncan v. Kahanamoku, Sheriff</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>(<i>Duncan</i>), which required that there must be an actual theater of war to justify the President's declaration of martial law, must be applied by the Court.<br><br>I disagree.<br><br>In <i>Milligan</i>, martial law was declared because there was an on-going rebellion in the Confederate states. The US Court held that martial law is the will of the commanding officer of an armed force or of a geographical military department, expressed in time of war, within the limits of his military jurisdiction, as necessity demands and prudence dictates, restrained or enlarged by the orders of his military or supreme executive chief. It was also ruled therein that the military tribunals only have jurisdiction where civil courts are not functioning. But where the civil courts are functioning and there is no need for bayonets or military aid to execute its jurisdiction, military tribunals cannot try civilians.<br><br>Similarly, in <i>Duncan</i>, martial law was declared because Hawaii was in an actual theater of war arising from the Japanese armed invasion on December 7, 1941 and there was, at all times, a danger of invasion in the nature of commando raids or submarine attacks. The US Court ruled therein that since the civil courts were opened later on February 24, 1944, the petitioners could not be tried by military courts under martial law.<br><br>In the case at bench, the concept of actual invasion or rebellion is not the same as that of <i>Milligan</i>, decided in 1866, and <i>Duncan</i>, decided in 1946. During those times, the actual invasion or rebellion was appreciated in the traditional sense where the enemies use bayonets, cannons, commando raids or submarine attacks and conflicts were concentrated within a specific location or state. However, during the deliberations of the present Constitution, the framers discussed the possibility of modem tactics in rebellion or invasion, to wit:<br><blockquote>MR. DE LOS REYES. I ask that question because I think <b>modern rebellion can be carried out nowadays in a more sophisticated manner because of the advance of technology, mass media and others</b>. Let us consider this for example: There is an obvious synchronized or orchestrated strike in all industrial firms, then there is a strike of drivers so that employees and students cannot attend school nor go to their places of work, practically paralyzing the government. Then in some remote barrios, there are ambushes by so-called subversives, so that the scene is that there is an orchestrated attempt to destabilize the government and ultimately supplant the constitutional government. Would the Committee call that an actual rebellion, or is it an imminent rebellion?<br><br>MR. REGALADO: At the early stages, where there was just an attempt to paralyze the government or some sporadic incidents in other areas but without armed public uprising, that would only amount to sedition under Article 138, or it can only be considered as a tumultuous disturbance.<br><br>MR. DE LOS REYES: The public uprising are not concentrated in one place, which use to be the concept of rebellion before.<br><br>MR. REGALADO: No.<br><br>MR. DE LOS REYES: But the public uprisings consists of isolated attacks in several places - for example in one camp here; another in the province of Quezon; then in another camp in Laguna; no attack in Malacañang but there is complete paralysis of the industry of the whole country. If we place these things together, the impression is clear there is an attempt to destabilize the government in order to supplant it with a new government.<br><br>MR. REGALADO: <b>It becomes a matter of factual appreciation and evaluation.</b> The magnitude is to be taken into account when we talk about tumultuous disturbance, to sedition, then graduating to rebellion. All these things are variances of magnitude and scope. <b>So, the President determines, based on the circumstances, if there is presence of rebellion.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> (emphases supplied)<br></blockquote>The Constitutional framers foresee the possibility that modem rebellion will involve a more sophisticated manner of execution with the use of advanced technology and even mass media. They discussed the possibility that rebels may conduct isolated attacks in different places but would be orchestrated to paralyze the country and destabilize the government. In such case, Justice Regalado suggested it would be a matter of factual appreciation and evaluation of the President, based on the circumstances, in determining if rebellion exists. Thus, the traditional concept of rebellion where there must be actual use of weapons concentrated in a single place is not the sole concept of actual rebellion envisioned under the 1987 Constitution.<br><br><i>Defanged Martial Law</i><br><br>Martial law, while it has no precise definition, is employed to authorize the military to act vigorously for the maintenance of an orderly civil government and for the defense of the State against actual rebellion or invasion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> In the Philippines, the power to declare martial law rests in the hands of the President. History dictates that the 1935 and 1973 Constitutions allowed the President to exploit its power in declaring martial law due to the following reasons:<br><blockquote>1. That the proclamation of martial law automatically suspends the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>;<br><br>2. That the President as Commander-in-Chief can promulgate proclamations, orders and decrees during the period of martial law essential to the security and preservation of the Republic, to the defense of the political and social liberties of the people, and to the institution of reforms to prevent resurgence of rebellion or insurrection or secession or the threat thereof as well as to meet the impact of a world recession, inflation or economic crisis;<br><br>3. That the President, as legislator during the period of martial law, can legally create military commission or court martials to try not only members of the armed forces but also civilian offenders for specified offenses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br></blockquote>Thus, when the framers of the present Constitution discussed the power of the President to declare martial law and suspend the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>, they ensured that such abuses would not be repeated. Commissioner Monsod even noted that the martial law of then President Marcos was an aberration in history and that the grounds for the imposition of martial law and suspension of the privilege were reduced, and that <b>should a second Marcos arise, there would be enough safeguards in the new Constitution to take care of such eventuality</b>. Accordingly, the following safeguards are now in place to limit the Chief Executive's power to declare martial law:<br><blockquote>1. The initial declaration of martial law has a time limit of sixty (60) days;<br><br>2. The President is required to submit a report in person or in writing to the Congress to substantiate his declaration of martial law;<br><br>3. There is a process for its review and possible revocation of Congress;<br><br>4. There is also a review and possible nullification by the Supreme Court based on the sufficiency of factual basis;<br><br>5. The removal of the phrases "imminent danger thereof" and "insurrection" as grounds for declaring martial law;<br><br>6. A state of martial law does not suspend the operation of the Constitution, nor supplant the functioning of the civil courts or legislative assemblies, nor authorize the conferment of jurisdiction on military courts and agencies over civilians where civil courts are able to function. Thus, during the martial law, the President can neither promulgate proclamations, orders and decrees when legislative assemblies are functioning nor create military courts to try civilians when the civil courts are open.<br><br>7. The declaration of martial law does not automatically suspend the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>;<br><br>8. During the suspension of the writ, any person thus arrested or detained shall be judicially charged within three days, otherwise he shall be released.<br><br>9. The extension of the declaration of martial law initiated by the President shall only take effect when approved by Congress for a period reasonably determined by it.<br></blockquote>The numerous safety measures embodied under the present Constitution ensure that the President cannot abuse its power anymore to the detriment of the citizens. The said measures defanged martial law. As can be gleaned in <i>Lagman</i>, the safeguards and processes were fully operational and the declaration of martial law by President Rodrigo Duterte over the whole Mindanao was thoroughly scrutinized by Congress and the Court. In said case, the Court concluded that the President, in issuing Proclamation No. 216, had sufficient factual bases to show that actual rebellion exists and that public safety requires the declaration of martial law and suspension of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>.<br><br>During the oral arguments, it was confirmed by Commissioner Monsod, one of the petitioners, that martial law under the Constitution has been restricted, to wit:<br><blockquote>JUSTICE BERSAMIN:<br><br>Okay, Iwill agree for the moment with you. But the thing is, you have a version of martial law that does not replicate the Marcos version, it is now emasculated. Is that, will you agree with that?<br><br>CHAIRMAN MONSOD: <br><br>Yes.<br><br>JUSTICE BERSAMIN:<br><br><i>Emasculated.</i><br><br>CHAIRMAN MONSOD:<br><br>Not <i>emasculated</i>, there's a narrowed discretion of the President because...<br><br>JUSTICE BERSAMIN:<br><br>Narrowed, restricted to tie the hands of the President, if I may put it that way. It cannot be anymore as pervasive as the martial law that was under the 1935 Constitution because we had no other experience in martial law since that time, since that time.<br><br>CHAIRMAN MONSOD: <br><br>Yes, Your Honor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br></blockquote>It was also discussed that martial law under the present Constitution is unique because it does not confer additional powers to the President, the Constitution is continuously upheld, the agencies of the government and the courts continue to function, and human rights and international humanitarian laws are still observed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> General Guerrero also shared his view that the only benefits generated by the present declaration of martial law are the immediate arrest of the rebels;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> civilian authorities are readily compliant with the requests of the AFP;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> increased military presence;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> and logistical benefit due to the increased information gathering and dissemination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br><i>Flexibility in Extending Martial Law</i><br><br>The petitions at bench also question the procedural validity of the extension of martial law. Under the Constitution, the said extension is different from the initial proclamation of martial law, to wit:<br><blockquote>SECTION 18. The President shall be the Commander-in-Chief of all armed forces of the Philippines and whenever it becomes necessary, he may call out such armed forces to prevent or suppress lawless violence, invasion or rebellion. In case of invasion or rebellion, when the public safety requires it, he may, for a period not exceeding sixty days, suspend the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> or place the Philippines or any part thereof under martial law. Within forty-eight hours from the proclamation of martial law or the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>, the President shall submit a report in person or in writing to the Congress. The Congress, voting jointly, by a vote of at least a majority of all its Members in regular or special session, may revoke such proclamation or suspension, which revocation shall not be set aside by the President. <b>Upon the initiative of the President, <u>the Congress may</u>, in the same manner, extend such proclamation or suspension for a period to be determined by the Congress, if the invasion or rebellion shall persist and public safety requires it.</b> (emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>As stated above, in the initial declaration of martial law, it is the President as the Commander-in-Chief of all armed forces of the Philippines that declares martial law for a maximum period of sixty (60) days. Upon its declaration, it shall become immediately effective. It is subject to a review by Congress within forty-eight (48) from its declaration.<br><br>With respect to the extension of martial law, the last sentence of the first paragraph of Section 18 clearly states that Congress is empowered to extend the duration of martial law. The President's only role in such an extension is that he is the one who initiates it. Notably, even if the President initiates the said extension, it is not immediately effective. It is only when Congress grants the extension, after determining that invasion or rebellion persists and public safety requires it, that it becomes operational. Evidently, the power of Congress is more potent than that of the President when it comes to the extension of martial law. Stated differently, when there is an extension of the duration of martial law, the Constitution confers on Congress the authority to grant or deny it. If Congress does not find any basis to grant the requested extension, then it shall not exceed the sixty (60) day period of its initial declaration.<br><br>Congress' power to extend the proclamation of martial law is observed in the following Constitutional deliberations:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="15%"><div align="justify">MR.

And if there was no concurrence, the martial law period ends at 60 days. Thereafter, if they intend to extend the same suspension of the privilege of the writ or the proclamation of martial law, it is upon the initiative of the President this time, with the prior concurrence of Congress. So, the period of extension has already been taken into account by both the Executive and the Legislative, unlike the first situation where the President acted alone without prior concurrence.

The one who will do the fighting is the executive but, of course, it is expected that if the Congress wants to extend, it will extend for the duration of the fighting. If the fighting goes on, I do not think it is fair to assume that the Congress will refuse to extend the period, especially since in this matter the Congress must act at the instance of the executive. <strong>He is the one who is supposed to know how long it will take him to fight.

It was emphasized therein that the final decision to extend the said declaration rests with Congress. Whether the President states a specific period of extension or not, Congress ultimately decides on the said period. Until it grants the extension, the sixty (60) day period of the initial declaration of martial law prevails. In effect, by becoming the granting authority, Congress limits the President's power to extend the period of martial law.<br><br>During the Constitutional deliberations, it was recognized that there are many limitations and encumbrances in the President's power to declare martial law. Commissioner Ople even raised apprehension that the encumbrances of martial law under the constitutional provision may compel the President to simply declare a revolutionary government. However, such apprehension did not prevail because the present wording of the Constitution grants Congress the ultimate authority to decide whether the period of martial law should be extended. Manifestly, there is no specific period stated in the extension of the period of martial law because the Constitution leaves it to Congress to decide the reasonable period for such an extension. In the event that the President requires more time to quell a rebellion or invasion beyond the granted period of extension, then his remedy is to ask for another extension from Congress. Manifestly, as discussed by Commissioner Concepcion, the framers also considered the possibility that there will be more than one (1) extension should the first extension be insufficient.<br><br>Thus, Congress has the prerogative to determine for itself the period of the extension of martial law. In this case, it used the flexibility granted to it by the Constitution to determine that the reasonable period of extension of martial law over Mindanao should be for one (1) year or until December 31, 2018. The petitioners cannot deny the flexibility of Congress in determining the extended period for martial law. They should have focused on assailing the sufficiency of the factual basis for extending the period of martial law. However, as discussed supra, the petitioners failed to assail the said factual basis. In the absence of compelling evidence to the contrary, the reasonable period of extension as determined by Congress must stand.<br><br><i>Extent of review of Congress and the Supreme Court differs</i><br><br>The role of Congress in granting the extension of martial law is vital. Due to the essential authority of Congress, it is proper to examine the review it can undertake to determine the propriety of granting such extension initiated by the President. It was thoroughly discussed in <i>Lagman</i> that the power of Congress to review a declaration of martial law is independent from that of the Court. Congress has a greater scope of review compared to the Court, to wit:<br><blockquote>The Court may strike down the presidential proclamation in an appropriate proceeding filed by any citizen on the ground of lack of sufficient factual basis. On the other hand, Congress may revoke the proclamation or suspension, which revocation shall not be set aside by the President.<br><br>In reviewing the sufficiency of the factual basis of the proclamation or suspension, the Court considers only the information and data available to the President prior to or at the time of the declaration; it is not allowed to "undertake an independent investigation beyond the pleadings." On the other hand, Congress may take into consideration not only data available prior to, but likewise events supervening the declaration. Unlike the Court which does not look into the absolute correctness of the factual basis as will be discussed below, Congress could probe deeper and further; it can delve into the accuracy of the facts presented before it.<br><br>In addition, the Court's review power is passive; it is only initiated by the filing of a petition "in an appropriate proceeding" by a citizen. On the other hand, Congress' review mechanism is automatic in the sense that it may be activated by Congress itself at any time after the proclamation or suspension was made.<br><br>Thus, the power to review by the Court and the power to revoke by Congress are not only totally different but likewise independent from each other although concededly, they have the same trajectory, which is, the nullification of the presidential proclamation. Needless to say, the power of the Court to review can be exercised independently from the power of revocation of Congress.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br></blockquote>In this case, the President sent a letter dated December 8, 2017, to the Senate President and House Speaker requesting further extension of the period of martial law and the suspension of the privilege of the writ.of <i>habeas corpus</i> in Mindanao for an additional year. The letter contained several grounds justifying the extension.<br><br>On December 12, 2017, the AFP officials presented and explained the different justifications of the request for the extension of martial law before the Senate and the House of Representatives.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> On December 13, 2017, Congress held a joint session to discuss whether the extension of martial law in Mindanao was warranted. Each member of Congress was granted a maximum of three (3) minutes to explain his allotted time pursuant to Section 7 of Rule IV of the Joint Session of Congress.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> The said three (3) minute rule excluded the time given to resource persons. After thorough discussion and extensive debates, two hundred forty (240) members of Congress affirmed that rebellion persists and that public safety requires the further extension of martial law and the suspension of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> for one (1) year in Mindanao.<br><br>I concur with the <i>ponencia</i> that Congress complied with its constitutional duty to review the extension of martial law before granting the same. From the onset, the Constitutional framers intended that the procedure of review by Congress under Section 18 should be accelerated and simplified due to the pressing need of the President and the people when there is actual invasion or rebellion and public safety requires it, to wit:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="15%"><div align="justify">FR.

The said congressional rule even excluded the time allocated to resource speakers invited by Congress. To hold otherwise, where each member of Congress is given an unlimited time to interpolate, will no longer serve the purpose of expediently resolving the extension of martial law. Verily, as long as the members of Congress are all given equal opportunity to voice their opinions, then they can effectively review the significant action taken by the President.<br><br>Moreover, the procedure laid down by the Joint Session Rules of Congress is pursuant to its power to determine its own rules of proceedings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> The rule-making power of Congress is a grant of full discretionary authority in the formulation, adoption and promulgation of its own rules.

Absent any evidence of arbitrariness, the proceedings during the joint session of Congress on December 13, 2017 must be upheld.
