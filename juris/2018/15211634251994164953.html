Appellant and "XXX" live in x x x Laguna together with "XXX's" two younger siblings, "YYY''and her brother, "AAA". </p> <p>On June 2, 2005, "XXX," who was then thirteen (13) years old, was sleeping on the floor of their room while her siblings were sleeping with their father on the bed. "XXX" was suddenly awakened when her father lay [beside her]. She asked him what he was doing. Appellant did not answer, then slowly he raised her shirt. He whispered "Sundin mo na lang ako at pag hindi mo ako sinunod ay papatayin ko ang mga kapatid mo at guguluhin ko ang nanay mo x x x," then he told "XXX" ''ibaba mo ang jogging pants at panty mo." Because of fear, ''XXX'' followed her father's order. Appellant then started kissing her and inserted his finger into her vagina. She told her father to stop but he continued what he was doing. "XXX'' cried as she felt pain in her vagina. She did not ask for help because she was afraid of her father's threat. After a few minutes, appellant removed his finger and returned to bed.</p> <p> The following day, June 3, 2005; ''XXX" was awakened when her father lay on top of her. He started kissing her lips, neck and breast then he removed her jogging pants and panty. Appellant inserted his penis into "XXX's" vagina. She begged him to stop, saying ''Papa masakit" but he just ignored her and did a pumping motion for few minutes, then went back to bed.</p> <p> Meanwhile, "YYY," "XXX's" younger sister, who was sleeping on the bedside beside the mat where "XXX'' was sleeping was awakened when she saw appellant on top of the latter. Moments later, appellant removed his penis and returned to his bed. The following morning, "YYY'' told "XXX" that she saw what the appellant did to her. That same day, June 4, 2005, appellant inserted again his finger into ''XXX's" vagina.</p> <p> On September 30, 2005, "XXX" was awakened when her father removed her clothes and inserted his penis into her vagina. The following morning, ''XXX" noticed a white discharge on her panty.</p> <p> "XXX" was prompted to proceed to the house of her mother x x x to report what appellant did to her when the latter hurt her brother. Immediately, they went to the police station and filed a complaint.</p> <p> Dr. Roy Camarillo, Medico-Legal Officer, PNP Crime Laboratory, Camp Vicente Lim, conducted a laboratory examination on "XXX.'' The Medical Legal Report contained the following findings and conclusions:</p> <blockquote> <p> Fairly-nourished, normally-developed, conscious. coherent, ambulatory female subject. Breasts are conical in shape with light brown areola and nipples from which no secretions could be pressed out. Abdomen is soft and flat.</p> <p> There's scanty growth of pubic hairs.

In Criminal Case No. 13943-06-C, the Court finds the accused Emiliano De Chavez guilty beyond reasonable doubt of [the] crime of sexual assault defined under paragraph 2 of Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code and hereby sentences him to imprisonment of ten years of <em>prision mayor</em> as minimum to twenty years of<em> reclusion temporal</em> as maximum. The accused is further ORDERED to indemnify the private complainant "XXX" the amounts of P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P75,000.00 as moral damages and P25,000.00 as exemplary damages.</p> <p> With costs against the accused.</p> <p> SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> <b><i>Ruling of the Court of Appeals</i></b> </p> <p>Appellant elevated the case to the CA. </p> <p> On June 20, 2014, the CA rendered the assailed Decision, affirming the Consolidated Decision with modification, to wit:</p> <blockquote> <p> WHEREFORE, the appeal is DENIED. The Consolidated Decision dated February 27, 2011 is AFFIRMED WITH MODIFICATION that exemplary damages in the amount of P30,000.00 is awarded for each offense.</p> <p> SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Hence, appellant filed the instant appeal.</p> <p> On July 22, 2015, the Court required both parties to file their respective supplementary briefs; however, they opted not to file the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></p> <p align="center"> <b>The Court's Ruling</b></p> <p> In assailing his conviction, appellant put in issue the inconsistencies in the testimonies of the prosecution's witnesses, which he believes is an indication that they were coached.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Thus, he claims that the prosecution was not able to prove the accusations against him beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></p> <p> The Court is not persuaded.</p> <p> Inaccuracies and inconsistencies in the testimony of a rape victim is not unusual considering that the painful experience is oftentimes not remembered in detail as "[i]t causes deep psychological wounds that scar the victim for life and which her conscious and subconscious mind would opt to forget."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Besides, the determination of the credibility of a witness is best left to the trial court, which had the opportunity to observe the deportment and demeanor of the witness while testifying.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></p> <p> Moreover, the Court has consistently ruled that there is sufficient basis to conclude the existence of carnal knowledge when the testimony of a rape victim is corroborated by the medical findings of the examining physician as ''[l]acerations, whether healed or fresh, are the best physical evidence of forcible defloration."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></p> <p> In this case, the victim's testimony is corroborated not only by her sister but also by the medical findings of the examining physician, who testified that the presence of deep healed lacerations on the victim's genitalia is consistent with the dates the alleged sexual acts were committed. Accordingly, the Court finds no reason to disturb the findings of the RTC, which was affirmed by the CA. It bears stressing that factual findings of the trial court, when affirmed by the CA, are generally binding and conclusive upon the Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></p> <p> In fine, we affirm the ruling of the courts below finding appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of two counts of qualified rape and two counts of rape by sexual assault.</p> <p> As regards the penalty imposed in Criminal Case Nos. 13941-06-C and 13942-06-C for qualified rape, both the trial court and the CA properly imposed the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> in view of the proscription on the imposition of the death penalty. We agree with the courts below that the prosecution had satisfactorily established the minority of "XXX" and the qualifying circumstance of relationship, <i>i.e</i>., that appellant is the father of "XXX."</p> <p> However, in order to conform to prevailing jurisprudence,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> the Court finds it necessary to increase the amounts of damages awarded in these cases. Thus, the amounts of exemplary damages, civil indemnity and moral damages are increased to P100,000.00 each for each count.</p> <p> As regards Criminal Case Nos. 13940-06-C and 13943-06-C for rape by sexual assault, we modify the penalty to eight (8) years and one (1) day of <em>prision mayor</em>, as minimum, to seventeen (17) years and four (4) months of <em>reclusion temporal</em>, as maximum.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> In addition, the awards of civil indemnity and moral damages are modified to P30,000.00 each tor each count of sexual assault.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> The award of exemplary damages at P30,000.00 for each count is sustained.</p> <p> In addition, all damages awarded shall earn legal interest at the rate of 6% <i>per annum</i> from the date of finality of judgment until fully paid.</p> <p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the appeal is <b>DISMISSED</b>.</p> <p> The June 20, 2014 Decision of the Court of Appeals finding appellant Emiliano De Chavez guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the charges against him is <strong>AFFIRMED with MODIFICATIONS </strong>that in Criminal Case Nos. 13941-06-C and 13942-06-C, the awards of civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages are each increased to P100,000.00 for each count.
