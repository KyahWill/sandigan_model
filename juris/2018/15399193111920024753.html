In an assignment letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> dated November 15, 2002, EYLLP confirmed Strickland's assignment to Manila as a partner and summarized the working arrangement, specifying the following provisions: (1) assignment and the terms; (2) compensation and benefits; (3) tax; (4) change of circumstances; (5) repatriation; and (6) acceptance.<br><br>In July 2004, the transactional relationship between the parties went awry.

Salud, then president of NHMFC. In that meeting, Mr. Salud asked that P&amp;A and EYAPFS continue with the project and remain as financial advisors to NHMFC. But he also proposed that NHMFC will hire Mr. Strickland for a nominal compensation from NHMFC so that Mr. Strickland can continue to participate in the project and work together with us. Right after that meeting, P&amp;A and EYAPFS x x x decided to accept its proposal in order to finally resolve this pending matter. However, before anything can be finalized, a change in the management of NHMFC occurred. We sought to meet with the new president, Mr. Celso delos Angeles, and were able to meet with him on October 20, 2004. In that meeting, it was confirmed by both parties that NHMFC will hire Mr. Strickland and this engagement will be the basis for moving forward. We then proceeded to conclude with Mr. Strickland the discussion about his compensation which was proposed to come out of the success fee for the engagement. We also drew up the draft agreement that was submitted on November 19, 2004 to both NHMFC and Mr. Strickland for their review.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br></blockquote>PA objected to Strickland's proposed amendments, specifically on the terms of compensation, which now contemplated PA's engagement of Strickland as subcontractor for the closing of the UHLP Project.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>By May 23, 2005, counsel for Strickland wrote PA asking for "equitable compensation for professional services" rendered to NHMFC on the UHLP Project from the time of his separation from EYLLP and/or EYAPFS in July 2004 "up and through the recent Signing and Closing Ceremony held on 22 April 2004 and his continued provision of services as the final closing approaches."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>On June 2, 2005, counsel for PA responded, categorically denying any contractual relationship with Strickland and his assertion that he effectively substituted EYLLP and/or EYAPFS for the portion of the work he carried out in the UHLP Project.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Succeeding events are fairly summarized by the CA in CA-G.R. SP No. 120897:<br><blockquote>Thus, [Strickland] filed a Complaint, dated May 17, 2005, which included [EYAPFS], [PA] and NHMFC among the defendants, seeking the following reliefs:<br><blockquote>"<i>Based on the foregoing, [Strickland] respectfully prays for judgment directing defendants, either jointly or severally or solidarily, or one or some or all defendants as may be deemed appropriate after trial, to pay [Strickland] Eighteen Million Pesos (=P=18,000,000.00) as equitable compensation for services rendered or actual or nominal damages, moral damages, and attorney's fees as may be proved.</i>"<br></blockquote>Subsequent to the complaint, [EYLLP and/or EYAPFS] filed a "Motion to Refer to Arbitration," dated February 27, 2006.<br><br>In the meantime, x x x Strickland filed an Amended Complaint, dated June 29, 2006, adding more causes of action and including Strickland's replacement Mark Grinis as a party-defendant while deleting several defendants but retaining [EYLLP and/or EYAPFSJ, NHMFC and [PA].<br><br>The trial court admitted the Amended Complaint in its Order, dated December 6, 2006. Subsequently, it also issued an Order, dated January 2, 2007, denying [EYAPFS'] Motion To Refer to Arbitration, thus:<br><blockquote>"<i>The dispute between the defendants and </i><span style="font-style: italic;">[Strickland] covers</span><i> domestic arbitral proceedings and cannot be categorized as a commercial dispute of an international character since the dispute arose from their professional and service relationship and does not cover matters arising from a relationship of a commercial nature or commercial intercourse that would qualify as commercial.

SP No. 102805. The same was resolved by the Seventh Division in a Decision, dated June 17, 2010, annulling the ruling of the trial court, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>"<i><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the Petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.

In G.R. No. 193782, whether the CA erred in referring the dispute between Strickland and EYLLP to arbitration and ordering that EYLLP be dropped as defendant in Civil Case No. 05-692.<br><br>1.1 Whether the Partnership Agreement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> was properly alleged and proven according to Section 7, Rule 8 of the Rules of Court on actionable documents; and<br><br>1.2 Whether the dispute between Strickland and EYLLP based on Strickland's complaint is arbitrable.<br><br>2. In G.R. No. 210695, whether the CA erred anew when it suspended the proceedings in Civil Case No. 05-692 pending the arbitration between Strickland and EYLLP.<br><br>2.1 Whether PA is an agent of EYLLP; and<br><br>2.2 Whether Strickland's causes of action against all the defendants are intricately intertwined such that the separate causes of action against PA and the other impleaded defendants cannot independently proceed from the arbitration between Strickland and EYLLP.<br><br>We deny the petitions.<br><br><center>I<br></center><br>In annulling the January 2, 2007 and January 16, 2008 Orders of the RTC, the CA ruled that: (1) EYLLP substantially complied with Section 7, Rule 8 of the Rules of Court o setting forth actionable documents in a pleading; (2) the Partnership Agreement indeed contained a valid arbitration clause; and (3) applying processual presumption, albeit EYLLP failed to prove the applicable foreign law, the dispute between EYLLP and Strickland falls under the category of international commercial arbitration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Strickland contends that the CA's referral of the dispute between EYLLP and Strickland to arbitration is grave error since EYLLP failed to properly allege and prove the Partnership Agreement. Absent an actionable Partnership Agreement, there is no existing arbitration clause.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>We are not persuaded. We do not find reversible error in the Decision of the CA in CA-G.R. SP No. 102805.<br><br>Section 7, Rule 8 of the Rules of Court provides:<br><blockquote>Sec. 7. <i>Action or defense based on document</i>. Whenever an action or defense is based upon a written instrument or document, the substance of such instrument or document shall be set forth in the pleading, and the original or a copy thereof shall be attached to the pleading as an exhibit, which shall be deemed to be a part of the pleading, or said copy may with like effect be set forth in the pleading.<br></blockquote>In this case, EYLLP initially only quoted the provisiOn of the Partnership Agreement on Dispute Resolution, including a section on Arbitration, in its answer<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> dated February 15, 2006. Eventually, it submitted a copy of the Partnership Agreement in a manifestation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> dated March 15, 2006. Thus, we agree with the holding of the CA that EYLLP substantially, and ultimately, complied with the provision given that Strickland himself did, and does not even deny, the Partnership Agreement nor the arbitration clause.<br><br>In <i>Cargill Philippines, Inc. v. San Fernando Regala Trading, Inc.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> we discussed at length the nature of an arbitration clause as a contract in itself and the continued referral of a dispute to arbitration despite a party's repudiation of the main contract:<br><blockquote>Arbitration, as an alternative mode of settling disputes, has long been recognized and accepted in our jurisdiction. R.A. No. 876 authorizes arbitration of domestic disputes. Foreign arbitration, as a system of settling commercial disputes of an international character, is likewise recognized. The enactment of R.A. No. 9285 on April 2, 2004 further institutionalized the use of alternative dispute resolution systems, including arbitration, in the settlement of disputes.<br><br>A contract is required for arbitration to take place and to be binding. Submission to arbitration is a contract and a clause in a contract providing that all matters in dispute between the parties shall be referred to arbitration is a contract. The provision to submit to arbitration any dispute arising therefrom and the relationship of the parties is part of the contract and is itself a contract.<br><br><center>x x x x<br></center><br>The CA ruled that arbitration cannot be ordered in this case, since petitioner alleged that the contract between the parties did not exist or was invalid and arbitration is not proper when one of the parties repudiates the existence or validity of the contract. x x x<br><br><center>x x x x<br></center><br>However, the <i>Gonzales</i> case, which the CA relied upon for not ordering arbitration, had been modified upon a motion for reconsideration in this wise:<br><blockquote>"x x x <b>The adjudication of the petition in G.R. No. 167994 effectively modifies part of the Decision dated 28 February 2005 in G.R. No. 161957. Hence, we now hold that the validity of the contract containing the agreement to submit to arbitration does not affect the applicability of the arbitration clause itself. A contrary ruling would suggest that a party's mere repudiation of the main contract is sufficient to avoid arbitration. That is exactly the situation that the separability doctrine, as well as jurisprudence applying it, seeks to avoid.</b> We add that when it was declared in G.R. No. 161957 that the case should not be brought for arbitration, it should be clarified that the case referred to is the case actually filed by Gonzales before the DENR Panel of Arbitrators, which was for the nullification of the main contract on the ground of fraud, as it had already been determined that the case should have been brought before the regular courts involving as it did judicial issues."<br></blockquote>In so ruling that the validity of the contract containing the arbitration agreement does not affect the applicability of the arbitration clause itself, we then applied the doctrine of separability, thus:<br><blockquote>"The doctrine of separability, or severability as other writers call it, enunciates that an arbitration agreement is independent of the main contract. The arbitration agreement is to be treated as a separate agreement and the arbitration agreement does not automatically terminate when the contract of which it is a part comes to an end.<br><br>The separability of the arbitration agreement is especially significant to the determination of whether the invalidity of the main contract also nullifies the arbitration clause.

Meanwhile, domestic arbitration is governed by the Arbitration Law as amended by the ADR Act.<br><br>To determine the applicable law here, the nature of the arbitration sought to be undertaken must be looked at. The ADR Act defines domestic arbitration negatively by stating that it is one that is not international as defined in the Model Law[].

The explanatory footnote to Article 1(l) of the Model Law explains that "[t]he term 'commercial' should be given a wide interpretation so as to cover matters arising from all relationships of a commercial nature, whether contractual or not." It also states that relationships of a commercial nature include the following transactions among others:<br><blockquote>"any trade transaction for the supply or exchange of goods or services; distribution agreement; commercial representation or agency; factoring; leasing; construction of works; consulting; engineering; licensing; investment; financing; banking; insurance; exploitation agreement or concession; <b>joint venture and <u>other forms of industrial or business co-operation</u></b>; carriage of goods or passengers by air, sea, rail or road." x x x<br></blockquote>The meaning attached to the term "commercial" by the Model Law is broad enough to cover a partnership. The Civil Code x x x defines a partnership as a contract where "two or more persons bind themselves to contribute money, property, or industry to a common fund, with the intention of dividing the profits among themselves." Hence, considering that EYLLP and Strickland had a partnership relationship, which was not changed during his assignment [to] Manila for the Project, the request for arbitration here has a commercial character. The dispute between the said parties relates to Strickland's and EYLLP's association with each other.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> x x x (Emphasis and underscoring in the original; citations omitted.)<br></blockquote>The following factors further militate against Strickland's insistence on Philippine courts to primarily adjudicate his claims of tortious conduct, and not commercial arbitration, as stipulated in the Partnership Agreement:<br><br>1. From his complaint and amended complaint, Strickland's causes of action against EYLLP and PA hinge primarily on contract, i.e., the Partnership Agreement, and the resulting transactions and working relationship among the parties, where Strickland seeks to be paid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>2. The Partnership Agreement is bolstered by the assignment letter of EYLLP to Strickland confirming his assignment to Manila as partner and which assignment letter contains a choice of law provision:<br><blockquote><b>I.

The allegations in Strickland's complaint, specifically his narration of facts, admit that the entire controversy stems from his working relationship with EYLLP as a partner, thus:<br><blockquote>(<s>14</s>)<u>(9)</u> When the NHMFC Agreement was signed, [Strickland] was a Partner in E&amp;Y and held the title of Managing Director of Ernst &amp; Young Asia Pacific Financial <u>Solutions</u> LLC ("EYAPFS"), a 100% owned and controlled subsidiary of Ernst &amp; Young LLP ("E&amp;Y").<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> x x x<br></blockquote>On the whole, the dispute between Strickland and EYLLP, even considering the former's allegations of tortious conduct, were properly referred by the CA to arbitration.<br><br><center>II<br></center><br>In its Decision in CA-G.R.

We affirm the CA's ruling.<br><br><i>First</i>. PA was unequivocally an agent of EYLLP at the time it executed, as Philippine Member of the EYLLP global company, the FASA with NHMFC for the UHLP Project.<br><br>The records bear out in at least two documents that PA represented EYLLP/EYAPFS in the FASA with NHMFC for the UHLP Project, to wit:<br><br>1. The April 15, 2002 letter of PA to Strickland:<br><blockquote>Dear Dale,<br><br>Ernst &amp; Young, as represented by Punongbayan &amp; Araullo, the Ernst &amp; Young member firm in the Philippines (P&amp;A/ERNST &amp; YOUNG) and Ernst &amp; Young Asia Pacific Solutions LLC (EY/APFS) was chosen as the exclusive Financial Advisor for National Home Mortgage Finance Corporation (NHMFC) with respect to the liquidation of its Php40 Billion Unified Home Lending Program (UHLP) portfolio (or the "Transaction"). <b>P&amp;A/ERNST &amp; YOUNG acted as the contracting party, on behalf of EY/APFS, and signed the contract with NHMFC to officially kick-off the engagement.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote>2. The March 26, 2002 letter covering the FASA between NHMFC and PA, where PA, as one of the parties, was designated in all references as "P&amp;A/ERNST &amp; YOUNG" or "P&amp;A/E&amp;Y."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>This fact of agency relationship between PA and EYLLP cannot be denied and avoided by Strickland, given Articles 1868 and 1873 of the Civil Code which provides, thus:<br><blockquote>Art. 1868. By the contract of agency a person binds himself to render some service or to do something in representation or on behalf of another, with the consent or authority of the latter.<br><br>Art. 1873. If a person specially informs another or states by public advertisement that he has given a power of attorney to a third person, the latter thereby becomes a duly authorized agent, in the former case with respect to the person who received the special information, and in the latter case with regard to any person.<br><br><center>x x x x<br></center></blockquote>Clearly, with the foregoing documents, PA is considered an agent of EYLLP. We quote with favor the analysis of the CAin CA-G.R. SP No. 120897:<br><blockquote>x x x Strickland admitted the following: (1) that he is an employee of Ernst &amp; Young Asia, assigned to different projects in Korea, Japan, Thailand, China and the Philippines; and (2) that x x x P&amp;A is an agent of Ernst &amp; Young Asia. Such agency is also reflected in the letter addressed to Strickland, dated April 15, 2002, stating that P&amp;A was representing Ernst &amp; Young Asia, being its member firm located in the Philippines. P&amp;A, as agent of Ernst &amp; Young Asia, was authorized to act in behalf of the latter with regard to the liquidation of the UHLP as financial advisor for NHMFC.<br><br>Having established the fact of agency, there is no question that P&amp;A derives its authority for the UHLP liquidation from Ernst &amp; Young Asia. As such agent, P&amp;A cannot sue and be sued on the contract of employment between Strickland and Ernst &amp; Young Asia. As explained by a recognized authority in civil law:<br><blockquote>"<i>(a) Normally, the agent has neither rights nor liabilities as against the third party. <b>He cannot sue or be sued on the contract. Since the contract may be violated only by the parties thereto against each other, the real party-in-interest, either as plaintiff or defendant in an action upon that contract must, generally be a party to said contract.</b></i>"<br></blockquote>In this case, the conflict arose from the terms of Strickland's employment contract with Ernst &amp; Young Asia and P&amp;A's involvement in the same was a mere consequence that the termination occurred while the UHLP was ongoing. The fact of agency in itself and the aforequoted discussion of its effects shows that [PA's] liability is anchored on that of Ernst &amp; Young Asia, giving rise to a reason why the trial court's proceedings must be suspended in the light of the pending arbitration proceedings between [PA's] principal[, EYLLP,] and x x x Strickland.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> (Emphasis in the original; citations omitted.)<br></blockquote>Moreover, that PA is not a signatory to the Partnership Agreement containing the arbitration clause is of no moment. The arbitration clause is applicable to PA nd effectively stays the proceedings against it.<br><br>In <i>BF Corporation v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> we ruled thus:<br><blockquote>Petitioner's contention that there was no arbitration clause because the contract incorporating said provision is part of a "hodge-podge" document, is therefore untenable. A contract need not be contained in a single writing. It may be collected from several different writings which do not conflict with each other and which, when connected, show the parties, subject matter, terms and consideration, as in contracts entered into by correspondence. A contract may be encompassed in several instruments even though every instrument is not signed by the parties, since it is sufficient if the unsigned instruments are clearly identified or referred to and made part of the signed instrument or instruments. Similarly, a written agreement of which there are two copies, one signed by each of the parties, is binding on both to the same extent as though there had been only one copy of the agreement and both had signed it.<br><br>The flaw in petitioner's contentions therefore lies in its having segmented the various components of the whole contract between the parties into several parts. This notwithstanding, petitioner ironically admits the execution of the Articles of Agreement. Notably, too, the lower court found that the said Articles of Agreement "also provides that the 'Contract Documents' therein listed 'shall be deemed an integral part of this Agreement,' and one of the said documents is the 'Conditions of Contract' which contains the Arbitration Clause.'" It is this Articles of Agreement that was duly signed by Rufo B. Colayco, president of private respondent SPI, and Bayani F. Fernando, president of petitioner corporation. The same agreement was duly subscribed before notary public Nilberto R. Briones. In other words, the subscription of the principal agreement effectively covered the other documents incorporated by reference therein.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> (Citations omitted.)<br></blockquote><i>Second</i>. The confusion arises because Strickland insists on foregoing suit on his Partnership Agreement with EYLLP precisely because such has an arbitration clause and a choice of law provision. It is quite apparent that Strickland wishes to sue all the defendants before our courts based on a combination of causes of action for violation of obligations arising out of tort,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> quasi-contract,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> and contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> However, Strickland's allegations in both the complaint and amended complaint are undoubtedly hinged, and unavoidably linked, to his former contractual relationship with EYLLP to which the present controversy among all the parties can be traced:<br><blockquote>(<s>28</s>)(<u>23</u>) It is likely that one of the reasons that P&amp;A refused to compensate him was because of the influence of [EYLLP]. It is believed that [EYLLP] sought to punish Mr. Strickland by trying to prevent him from receiving compensation despite [EYLLP's] deliberate and reckless abandonment of its contractual responsibilities. NHMFC appears to have refused to compensate [Strickland] because it was not contractually bound by the Agreement to compensate him, although NHMFC believed it could oblige [Strickland] to complete the work because of [his] designation as Project Manager.<br><br>(<s>29</s>)(<u>24</u>) [Strickland] is entitled to be compensated for his work.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> x x x<br></blockquote>The designation in Strickland's amended complaint of "Additional Cause of Action Against [respondent EYLLP]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> further demonstrates that the totality of his causes of action are actually anchored on the disintegration of his working relationship with EYLLP whom he faults for his failure to receive compensation from the other defendants.<br><br>In a hodge podge of allegations, Strickland, without being a party to the FASA between NHMFC and PA/EYLLP, insists on the continuation of his suit contending that his designation as "Lead Due Diligence Partner," forming part of the Engagement Team, entitles him to equitable compensation. Thus, Strickland maintains that the proceedings in Civil Case No. 05-692 should not have been suspended, and should then proceed independently of the arbitration between Strickland and EYLLP.<br><br>We do not agree. We do not find the designation of Strickland in the Engagement Team of the FASA as a stipulation <i>pour atrui</i>. Article 1311, paragraph 2 of the Civil Code reads:<br><blockquote>Art. 1311. x x x<br><br>If a contract should contain some stipulation in favor of a third person, he may demand its fulfillment provided he communicated his acceptance to the obligor before its revocation. A mere incidental benefit or interest of a person is not sufficient. The contracting parties must have clearly and deliberately conferred a favor upon a third person.<br></blockquote>Considering the clear applicability of the Partnership Agreement and the terms of the arbitration clause, and absent a clear right-duty correlative<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> which supports Strickland's causes of action, the CA certainly did not err in suspending the proceedings in CA-G.R. SP No. 120897.<br><br><i>Third</i>. We are not unaware of previous holdings where we disallowed suspension of trial pending arbitration, even simultaneous arbitration proceedings and trial, where the issue before the court could not then be speedily and efficiently resolved in its entirety. We emphasized that the object of arbitration (that is, to expedite the determination of a dispute) would only be served if the trial court hears and adjudicates the case in a single and complete proceeding.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>The following circumstances underscore the high probability of an expeditious resolution of the conflict with the referral to arbitration of the dispute between EYLLP and Strickland and the succeeding suspension of the proceedings before the RTC in Civil Case No. 05-692:<br><br>1. As previously stated, these cases comprise of a foreign element, involving foreign parties and international transactions. While the parties have not questioned the jurisdiction of our courts, the RTC may still refuse to assume jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>2. As previously discussed, the causes of action cited by Strickland in his complaint (and amended complaint) all undoubtedly relate to his Partnership Agreement with EYLLP which is subject to arbitration. This very same Partnership Agreement is even reiterated in the November 15, 2002 Assignment Letter assigning Strickland to Manila.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>3. Strickland himself admits that as Partner of EYLLP, he was assigned to various parts of Asia. He has also not denied that he was seconded to EYAPFS because of certain tax consequences of his different assignments.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> In fact, in his additional cause of action against EYLLP, Strickland alleged, among others, that EYLLP did not pay his correct taxes making him liable for these.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> Evidently, the real dispute between Strickland and EYLLP falls within its Partnership Agreement involving its own choice of law provision.<br><br>In <i>Crescent Petroleum, Ltd. v. M/V "Lok Maheshwari</i>,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> the Court used balancing of basic interest to weigh the varying foreign elements of the case listed in the US case of Lauritzen v. Larsen.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> With Philippine law falling only under one factor as the law of the forum where petitioner Crescent filed suit, the Court declared it inconceivable that the Philippine court had any interest in the case that would outweigh the interests of the involved foreign jurisdictions (Canada or India).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> Ultimately, the Court held that:<br><blockquote><i>Finally</i>. The submission of petitioner is not in keeping with the reasonable expectation of the parties to the contract. Indeed, when the parties entered into a contract for supplies in Canada, they could not have intended the laws of a remote country like the Philippines to determine the creation of a lien by the mere accident of the Vessel's being in Philippine territory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br></blockquote>In all, while we do not preclude Strickland from pursuing all remedies available to him, we point out that the factual circumstances obtaining here, given that Strickland was then partner of the global company EYLLP, the Philippines is not automatically the law of the place of performance of the contract nor is it the only factor to be considered in the ultimate choice-ofÂ­ law final analysis.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petitions in G.R.
