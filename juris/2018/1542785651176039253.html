It failed to acknowledge the prolonged duration of consistent and uninterrupted payment of real property taxes; the absence of any adverse claim, save the Republic's opposition; and the confirmation and tillage since 1942. Its haphazard reliance on the notion that real property tax declarations are not conclusive evidence of ownership demonstrates its failure to go about its duty of resolving the case with care and precision.

Who May Apply. — The following persons may file in the proper Court of First Instance an application for registration of title to land, whether personally or through their duly authorized representatives:</p> <blockquote> <p> (1) Those who by themselves or through their predecessors-in-interest have been in open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and occupation of alienable and disposable lands of the public domain under a bona fide claim of ownership since June 12, 1945, or earlier.</p> <p> (2) Those who have acquired ownership of private lands by prescription under the provision of existing laws.</p> <p> (3) Those who have acquired ownership of private lands or abandoned river beds by right of accession or accretion under the existing laws.</p> <p> (4) Those who have acquired ownership of land in any other manner provided for by law.</p> </blockquote> <p> Where the land is owned in common, all the co-owners shall file the application jointly. </p> <p> Where the land has been sold under <em>pacto de retro</em>, the vendor<em> a retro</em> may file an application for the original registration of the land, provided, however, that should the period for redemption expire during the pendency of the registration proceedings and ownership to the property consolidated in the vendee <em>a retro</em>, the latter shall be substituted for the applicant and may continue the proceedings. </p> <p> A trustee on behalf of his principal may apply for original registration of any land held in trust by him, unless prohibited by the instrument creating the trust. </p> </blockquote> <p> This Court has distinguished applications for registration pursuant to Section 14, paragraphs (1) and (2). In <i>Canlas v. Republic</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> In land registration cases, the applicants' legal basis is important in determining the required number of years or the reference point for possession or prescription. This court has delineated the differences in the modes of acquiring imperfect titles under Section 14 of Presidential Decree No. 1529. <i>Heirs of Mario Malabanan v. Republic</i> extensively discussed the distinction between Section 14 (1) and Section 14 (2) of Presidential Decree No. 1529. Thus, this court laid down rules to guide the public:</p> <blockquote> <p> (1) In connection with Section 14(1) of the Property Registration Decree, Section 48(b) of the Public Land Act recognizes and confirms that "those who by themselves or through their predecessors in interest have been in open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession and occupation of alienable and disposable lands of the public domain, under a bona fide claim of acquisition of ownership, since June 12, 1945" have acquired ownership of, and registrable title to, such lands based on the length and quality of their possession.</p> <blockquote> <p> (a) Since Section 48(b) merely requires possession since 12 June 1945 and does not require that the lands should have been alienable and disposable during the entire period of possession, the possessor is entitled to secure judicial confirmation of his title thereto as soon as it is declared alienable and disposable, subject to the timeframe imposed by Section 47 of the Public Land Act.</p> <p> (b) The right to register granted under Section 48(b) of the Public Land Act is further confirmed by Section 14(1) of the Property Registration Decree.</p> </blockquote> <p> (2) In complying with Section 14(2) of the Property Registration Decree, consider that under the Civil Code, prescription is recognized as a mode of acquiring ownership of patrimonial property. However, public domain lands become only patrimonial property not only with a declaration that these are alienable or disposable. There must also be an express government manifestation that the property is already patrimonial or no longer retained for public service or the development of national wealth, under Article 422 of the Civil Code. And only when the property has become patrimonial can the prescriptive period for the acquisition of property of the public dominion begin to run.</p> <blockquote> <p> (a) Patrimonial property is private property of the government. The person [who] acquires ownership of patrimonial property by prescription under the Civil Code is entitled to secure registration thereof under Section 14(2) of the Property Registration Decree. </p> <p> (b) There are two kinds of prescription by which patrimonial property may be acquired, one ordinary and [the] other extraordinary. Under ordinary acquisitive prescription, a person acquires ownership of a patrimonial property through possession for at least ten (10) years, in good faith and with just title. Under extraordinary acquisitive prescription, a person's uninterrupted adverse possession of patrimonial property for at least thirty (30) years, regardless of good faith or just title, ripens into ownership. </p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> In <i>Republic v. Gielczyk</i>, this court summarized and affirmed the differences between Section 14 (1) and Section 14 (2) of Presidential Decree No. 1529 as discussed in <i>Heirs of Malabanan</i>: </p> <blockquote> <p> In <i>Heirs of Mario Malabanan v. Republic</i>, the Court further clarified the difference between Section 14(1) and Section 14(2) of P.D. No. 1529. The former refers to registration of title on the basis of possession, while the latter entitles the applicant to the registration of his property on the basis of prescription. Registration under the first mode is extended under the aegis of the P.O. No. 1529 and the Public Land Act (PLA) while under the second mode is made available both by P.D. No. 1529 and the Civil Code. Moreover, under Section 48(b) of the PLA, as amended by Republic Act No. 1472, the 30-year period is in relation to possession without regard to the Civil Code, while under Section 14(2) of P.D. No. 1529, the 30-year period involves extraordinary prescription under the Civil Code, particularly Article 1113 in relation to Article 1137.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p align="center"> <b>II</b> </p><p> Contrary to the Court of Appeals' conclusion, petitioner is entitled to registration under Section 14(1).</p><p> Citing <i>Republic v. Hanover Worldwide Trading Corp</i>.,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> <i>Canlas</i> broadly considered the requisites for availing registration under Section 14(1): </p><blockquote> <p> An applicant for land registration or judicial confirmation of incomplete or imperfect title under Section 14 (1) of Presidential Decree No. 1529 must prove the following requisites: "(1) that the subject land forms part of the disposable and alienable lands of the public domain, and (2) that [the applicant has] been in open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and occupation of the same under a bona fide claim of ownership since June 12, 1945, or earlier." Concomitantly, the burden to prove these requisites rests on the applicant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Thus, two (2) things must be shown to enable registration under Section 14(1). First is the object of the application, i.e., land that is "part of the disposable and alienable lands of the public domain." Second is possession. This possession, in turn, must be: first, "open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious"; second, under a bona fide claim of acquisition of ownership; and third, has taken place since June 12, 1945, or earlier.</p><p> In jurisprudence, there is also a more nuanced reckoning of requisites for registration under Section 14(1). This more nuanced reckoning untangles the necessary characteristics of possession, as the preceding paragraph demonstrated. In this Court's September 3, 2013 Resolution in <i>Heirs of Malabanan v. Republic</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> [T]he applicant must satisfy the following requirements in order for his application to come under Section 14 (1) of the Property Registration Decree, to wit:</p> <ol><li> The applicant, by himself or through his predecessor-in-interest, has been in possession and occupation of the property subject of the application;<br><br></li><li> The possession and occupation must be open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious;<br><br></li><li> The possession and occupation must be under a bona fide claim of acquisition of ownership;<br><br></li><li> The possession and occupation must have taken place since June 12, 1945, or earlier; and<br><br></li><li> The property subject of the application must be an agricultural land of the public domain.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></li></ol> </blockquote> <p> Proceeding independently of how jurisprudence reckons requisites for registration under Section 14(1), the Court of Appeals identified three (3) requisites: </p><blockquote> <p> Under Section 14 (1), applicants for registration of title must sufficiently establish first, that the subject land forms part of the disposable and alienable lands of the public domain; second, that the applicant and his predecessors-in-interest have been in open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and occupation of the same; and third, that it is under a <i>bona fide</i> claim of ownership since 12 June 1945, or earlier.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p align="center"><b> III</b> </p><p> The Court of Appeals conceded that the first of its identified requisites is availing here.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Indeed, the February 9, 2004 CENRO-Laoag City Report stated "that the entire area of the land applied for registration was within the alienable and disposable zone as classified under Land Classification Map No. 1008, Project No. 13, released and certified on 25 May 1933 by the Bureau of Forestry (now the Forestry Management Service)."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> </p><p> The Court of Appeals also conceded that the second of its identified requisites is availing: </p><blockquote> <p> Kawayan Hills had likewise met the second requirement as to <i><u>ownership</u> and possession</i>. The [Municipal Circuit Trial Court] found that it had presented sufficient testimonial and documentary evidence to show that<em> from its first known predecessor-in-interest, Andres Dafun, up to [itself], they were in open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and occupation</em> of the land in question.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> Andres was asserted to have been in possession of Lot No. 2512 since 1931, when he started declaring it for real property tax purposes. The Court of Appeals' acknowledgment of his "open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and occupation,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> which it considered to be the second requisite, is a concession of the duration of possession that is even prior to June 12, 1945. </p><p> Despite its acknowledgments and its own categorical statement that "Kawayan Hills ... met the ... requirement as to <em>ownership</em>,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> the Court of Appeals proceeded to state that the third of its identified requisites has not been satisfied. It faulted the evidence presented by petitioner as failing to establish a <i>bona fide claim of ownership</i> that dates to June 12, 1945, or earlier. It decried petitioner's reliance on tax declarations, even if they dated to as far back as 1931, as these supposedly did not prove ownership: </p><blockquote> <p> Well[-]settled is the rule that tax declarations are not conclusive evidence of ownership or of the right to possess land when not supported by any other evidence. The fact that the disputed property may have been declared for taxation purposes in the name of the applicant for registration or of their predecessors-in-interest does not necessarily prove ownership. They are merely indicia of a claim of ownership.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p align="center"> <b>IV</b> </p><p> The Court of Appeals' grossly dismissive consideration of tax declarations dating back to 1931 is a serious error.</p><p> While recognizing that tax declarations do not absolutely attest to ownership, this Court has also recognized that "[t]he voluntary declaration of a piece of property for taxation purposes ... strengthens one's bona fide claim of acquisition of ownership."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> It has stated that payment of real property taxes "is good indicia of possession in the concept of an owner, and when coupled with continuous possession, it constitutes strong evidence of title."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> For after all: </p><blockquote> <p> No person in the right mind would pay taxes on real property over which he or she does not claim any title. Its declaration not only manifests a sincere desire to obtain title to a property; it may be considered as an announcement of an adverse claim against State ownership. It would be unjust for the State to take properties which have been continuously and exclusively held since time immemorial without showing any basis for the taking, especially when it has accepted tax payments without question.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> There have been instances where this Court has favorably considered the presentation of tax declarations which are "not of recent vintage"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> as indicating possession under a bona fide claim of ownership.</p><p> In <em>Republic v. Court of Appeals,</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> this Court found no merit in the Republic's opposition asserting that "aside from mere tax declarations all of which are of recent vintage, private respondent has not established actual possession of the property in question in the manner required by law (Section 14, P.D. 1529) and settled jurisprudence."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> In claiming that the applicant failed to establish actual possession, the Republic was noted as emphasizing that "no evidence was adduced that private respondent cultivated[,] much less, fenced the subject property if only to prove actual possession."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup></p><p> Ruling against the Republic, this Court favorably considered the presentation of tax declarations, tax payment receipts, and a deed of sale as "strong evidence of possession in the concept of owner."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> It also noted that contrary to the Republic's assertion, there were indications that the applicant occupied, possessed, and cultivated the land: </p><blockquote> <p> We are not persuaded. On this point, the respondent Court correctly found that:</p> <blockquote> <p> "Proof that petitioner-appellee and his predecessors-in-interest have acquired and have been in open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession of the subject property for a period of 30 years under a <i>bona fide</i> claim of ownership are the tax declarations of petitioner­ appellee's predecessors-in-interest, the deed of sale, tax payment receipts and petitioner-appellee's tax declarations. The evidence on record reveals that: (1) the predecessors­ in-interest of petitioner-appellee have been declaring the property in question in their names in the years 1923, 1927, 1934 and 1960; and, (2) in 1966, petitioner-appellee purchased the same from the Heirs of Gil Alhambra and since then paid the taxes due thereon and declared the property in his name in 1985.<br> . . . . </p> <p> . . . Considering the dates of the tax declarations and the realty tax payments, they can hardly be said to be of recent vintage indicating petitioner-appellee's pretended possession of the property. On the contrary, they are strong evidence of possession in the concept of owner by petitioner-appellee and his predecessors-in-interest. Moreover, the realty tax payment receipts show that petitioner-appellee has been very religious in paying the taxes due on the property. This is indicative of his honest belief that he is the owner of the subject property. We are, therefore, of the opinion that petitioner-appellee has proved that he and his predecessors-in-interest have been in open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession of the subject property in the concept of owner for a period of 30 years since 12 June 1945 and earlier. By operation of law, the property in question has become private property.</p> <p> "Contrary to the representations of the Republic, petitioner-appellee had introduced some improvements on the subject property from the time he purchased it. His witnesses testified that petitioner-appellee developed the subject property into a ricefield and planted it with rice, but only for about five years because the return on investment was not enough to sustain the continued operation of the rice1and. Though not in the category of permanent structures, the preparation of the land into a ricefield and planting it with rice are considered 'improvements' thereon."</p> </blockquote> <p> Although tax declarations or realty tax payments of property are not conclusive evidence of ownership, nevertheless, they are good indicia of possession in the concept of owner for no one in his right mind would be paying taxes for a property that is not in his actual or at least constructive possession. They constitute at least proof that the holder has a claim of title over the property. The voluntary declaration of a piece of property for taxation purposes manifests not only one's sincere and honest desire to obtain title to the property and announces his adverse claim against the State and all other interested parties, but also the intention to contribute needed revenues to the Government.

The burden to prove the public character of Lot 4287 becomes more pronounced when the State continuously accepts payment of real property taxes.

However, it is good indicia of possession in the concept of an owner, and when coupled with continuous possession, it constitutes strong evidence of title.</p> <p> No person in the right mind would pay taxes on real property over which he or she does not claim any title. Its declaration not only manifests a sincere desire to obtain title to a property; it may be considered as an announcement of an adverse claim against State ownership.

In addition to Andres' declaration of Lot No. 2512 for the payment of real property taxes for almost a decade and a half ahead of the June 12, 1945 threshold, and his and his successors-in-interest's unfailing diligence in paying real property taxes, there are more details that attest to possession in the concept of owner.</p><p> Since the start of Andres' documented possession in 1931, no one has come forward to contest his and his successors-in-interest's possession as owners. It was only on September 4, 2001, about a month after petitioner's filing of its application, that the Republic came forward to contest the confirmation and registration of title in his name.

It amounts to its evasion of its positive duty<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> to weigh the competing claims and to meticulously consider the evidence to arrive at a judicious resolution.</p><p> In so doing, the Court of Appeals validated what amounted to a mere <i>pro forma</i> opposition by the Republic, one that was triggered, not by an independent determination of a fatal error in an application, but by the mere occasion of the filing of an application. In <i>Spouses Noval</i>, this Court decried favorable actions on such <i>pro forma</i> oppositions as amounting to undue taking of property, thus, violative of the right to due process: </p><blockquote> <p> When an applicant in the registration of property proves his or her open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession of a land for the period required by law, he or she has acquired an imperfect title that may be confirmed by the State. The State may not, in the absence of controverting evidence and in a <i>pro forma</i> opposition, indiscriminately take a property without violating due process.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> For decades, Andres and his descendants toiled on Lot No. 2512. No one bothered to assail their possession or to claim it as owners. That is, until their transferee had the prudence to submit to legal processes by finally having title over Lot No. 2512 confirmed and registered. Rather than upholding legal objectives, the Republic's perfunctory response disincentivizes submission to judicial mechanisms. It unwittingly sends the message that holders of property, albeit through imperfect titles, are better off not bothering to abide by legal requirements. It is grave error to rule for the Republic in such cases merely on account of unquestioning belief in trite adages. The adjudication of judicial matters demands more than swift invocations. The Court of Appeals was much too accepting of the Republic's position. It was remiss in its duty to be a discriminating adjudicator; it was remiss in its duty to uphold due process and to do justice. </p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition for Certiorari is <b>GRANTED</b>.
