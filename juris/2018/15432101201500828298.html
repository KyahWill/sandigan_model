Graphics' violation was not remediable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> At any rate, there was no compliance within such 90-day period because the insurance policies were not

Whether the CA erred in affirming the RTC Orders on the ground that the factual determination of conflicting claims in an application for a provisional writ is not the function of appellate courts. </p> <p> 2. Whether the CA erred in granting the injunctive relief despite absence of: (a) a right<i> in esse</i> of Mac Graphics that warranted protection; (b) proof of material and substantial violation of Mac Graphics' right; and (c) grave and irreparable damage that Mac Graphics would sustain if no such injunctive writ was issued. </p> <p> 3. Whether the CA erred in granting the injunctive relief despite it being clear that it has become impossible to compel PMI to do the acts subject of the mandatory injunctive writ because the leased properties were sold by PMI to Super Shopping Market, Inc. prior to the rendition of the RTC Order granting the WPMI.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> On the other hand, the SMIC Petition raises the following issues: </p><blockquote> <p> 1. Whether the CA, by making general conclusions in the challenged Decision without addressing the issues and arguments raised by SMIC, has so far departed from the accepted and usual course of judicial proceedings as to call for an exercise of the power of supervision. </p> <p> 2. Whether the CA decided a question of substance in a way not in accord with law or with the applicable decisions of the Court in upholding the RTC's grave abuse of discretion when it issued a mandatory injunction against SMIC despite the following: </p> <p> a) SMIC's shareholdings in Makro do not justify treating these corporations as one and against whom injunctive relief may be issued jointly. </p> <p> b) SMIC does not operate SM Hypermart. </p> <p> c) Mac Graphics has not established any clear and positive right to any injunctive relief against SMIC.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p align="center"> <b>The Court's Ruling</b> </p><p> Once more the Court is tasked to determine the propriety of the issuance of a WPMI. The crux of these consolidated Petitions is the propriety of the WPMI issued by the RTC and upheld by the CA. </p><p> As defined by Section 1, Rule 58 of the Rules of Court, a preliminary injunction is an order granted at any stage of an action or proceeding prior to judgment or final order, requiring a party or a court, agency or a person to refrain from a particular act or acts or require the performance of a particular act or acts, in which case it shall be known as a preliminary mandatory injunction. </p><p> As to the grounds for its issuance, a preliminary injunction may be granted when it is established that: </p><p> (a) the applicant is entitled to the relief demanded, and the whole or part of such relief consists in restraining the commission or continuance of the act or acts complained of, or in requiring the performance of an act or acts, either for a limited period or perpetually; </p><p> (b) the commission, continuance or non-performance of the act or acts complained of during the litigation would probably work injustice to the applicant; or </p><p> (c) a party, court, agency or a person is doing, threatening, or is attempting to do, or is procuring or suffering to be done, some act or acts probably in violation of the rights of the applicant respecting the subject of the action or proceeding, and tending to render the judgment ineffectual.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> </p><p> The Court enumerated the requisites to justify the issuance of a WPMI in <i>Heirs of Melencio Yu v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> and explained the ramifications of its issuance, to wit: </p><blockquote> <p> x x x To justify the issuance of a writ of preliminary mandatory injunction, it must be shown that: (1) the complainant has a clear legal right; (2) such right has been violated and the invasion by the other party is material and substantial; and (3) there is an urgent and permanent necessity for the writ to prevent serious damage.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> An injunction will not issue to protect a right not <i>in esse</i>, or a right which is merely contingent and may never arise since, to be protected by injunction, the alleged right must be clearly founded on or granted by law or is enforceable as a matter of law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71] </sup>As this Court opined in [<i>Sps.</i>] <i>Dela Rosa v. Heirs of Juan Valdez</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup></p> <blockquote> <p> A preliminary mandatory injunction is more cautiously regarded than a mere prohibitive injunction since, more than its function of preserving the <em>status quo</em> between the parties, it also commands the performance of an act. Accordingly, the issuance of a writ of preliminary mandatory injunction is justified only in a clear case, free from doubt or dispute. When the complainant's right is doubtful or disputed, he does not have a clear legal right and, therefore, the issuance of a writ of preliminary mandatory injunction is improper. While it is not required that the right claimed by applicant, as basis for seeking injunctive relief, be conclusively established, it is still necessary to show, at least tentatively, that the right exists and is not vitiated by any substantial challenge or contradiction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> </p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> The Court in <i>Power Sites and Signs, Inc. v. United Neon (a Division of Ever Corporation)</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> stated that before a court grants injunctive relief, the complainant must demonstrate that: he is entitled to the relief sought, the actual or threatened violation of complainant's rights, the probability of irreparable injury, and the inadequacy of pecuniary compensation as relief.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> The Court explained: </p><blockquote> <p> A preliminary injunction may be granted only where the plaintiff appears to be clearly entitled to the relief sought<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> and has substantial interest in the right sought to be defended.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> While the existence of the right need not be conclusively established, it must be clear.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> The standard is even higher in the case of a preliminary mandatory injunction, which should only be granted—</p> <blockquote> <p> x x x in cases of extreme urgency; where the right is very clear; where considerations of relative inconvenience bear strongly in complainant's favor; where there is willful and unlawful invasion of plaintiffs right against his protest and remonstrance, the injury being a continuing one; and where the effect of the mandatory injunction is rather to reestablish and maintain a preexisting continuing relation between the parties, recently and arbitrarily interrupted by the defendant, than to establish a new relation x x x.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> </p> <p> x x x x </p> </blockquote> <p> It is settled that a writ of preliminary injunction should be issued only to prevent grave and irreparable injury, that is, injury that is actual, substantial, and demonstrable. Here, there is no "irreparable injury" as understood in law. Rather, the damages alleged by the petitioner, namely, "immense loss in profit and possible damage claims from clients" and the cost of the billboard which is "a considerable amount of money"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> is easily quantifiable, and certainly does not fall within the concept of irreparable damage or injury as described in <i>Social Security Commission v. Bayona</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup></p> <blockquote> <p> Damages are irreparable within the meaning of the rule relative to the issuance of injunction where <b>there is no standard by which their amount can be measured with reasonable accuracy</b>. "An irreparable injury which a court of equity will enjoin includes that degree of wrong of a repeated and continuing kind which <b>produce hurt, inconvenience, or damage that can be estimated only by conjecture, and not by any accurate standard of measurement</b>." An irreparable injury to authorize an injunction consists of a serious charge of, or is destructive to, the property it affects, either physically or in the character in which it has been held and enjoined, or when the property has some peculiar quality or use, so that <b>its pecuniary value will not fairly recompense the owner of the loss thereof</b>. (Emphasis supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> Here, any damage petitioner may suffer is easily subject to mathematical computation and, if proven, is fully compensable by damages.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> Thu, a preliminary injunction is not warranted.

style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Mac Graphics responded to the termination letter to the effect that while the lease contract provides that Makro is duty bound to assist Mac Graphics in securing barangay permit, business permit and building permit/sign permit, it was Makro's sole responsibility to obtain the same since the billboard towers are already existing at the stores of Makro.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> After those permits are obtained, there would be no more need to secure any permit from MMDA nor the local government unit concerned since the billboard structures are standing on private land, which is owned by Makro, the lessor, and not on a public property where MMDA clearance is required.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> Mac Graphics also stated that if there would be any permit that would be required after the said permits, it would only come from the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) and Makro failed to assist Mac Graphics in securing the DPWH permit which was not one of those stipulated in the lease contract.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> As to the issue of the comprehensive insurance, Mac Graphics interposed that "the country was plagued with a devastating typhoon <i>Milenyo</i>, that caused the destruction of several billboards in the metropolis hence would explain why no insurance company at such time would want to secure such type of property."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> </p><p> Mac Graphics took the position that "such inability to comply to such requirements of the contract [w]as not without justifiable reasons, hence cannot be considered as valid grounds for the pre-termination" of the lease contract, and a period of 90 days after written notice is provided therein to remedy such alleged breach.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> Thus, Mac Graphics undertook "to secure the necessary permit from DPWH as well as ensure that the necessary comprehensive insurance for [the] leased premises has been obtained" within 90 days from Mac Graphics' receipt of Makro's October 6, 2008 letter.<sup style="COLOR:

commencement of the lease, and Makro merely enforced its option under the lease contract to rescind and terminate the lease by reason thereof.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup> Thus, Makro notified Mac Graphics of the termination of the lease contract and returned to the latter the checks representing the lease payments for the year 2009.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0,

since Mac Graphics did not have them prior to the commencement of the lease.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup> Makro further stated that at any rate, Mac Graphics did not even comply within the 90-day period, and the insurance policies (Annexes "K" to "N" to the Complaint), while issued in October 2008, were not comprehensive and did not cover the stipulated third party liability while the third party policies (Annexes "0" to "R" to the Complaint) were all issued in April 2009 or way beyond the 90-day period.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup></p><p> Makro concluded that Mac Graphics has no cause of action against it and the Complaint should be dismissed in its entirety.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup> As additional defense, it invoked

supposed compliance with the licenses/permits and insurance stipulations, SMIC points out that Mac Graphics secured after the commencement of the lease on January 15, 2007, a purported "DPWH Clearance" dated June 10, 2008 (Exh. "M-1") and a purported insurance policy dated October 23, 2008 to cover the period October 23, 2008 to October 23, 2009 (Exh. "M-6-PI"), which was only for the Makro-Cubao leased property and did not cover the Makati-based property.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup> </p><p> Given the respective positions of the parties as enunciated above, both the CA Decision and RTC Orders, while both did not make a categorical finding that Mac Graphics has demonstrated <i>prima facie</i> its right to continue enforcing the lease contract despite its pre-termination by PMI, which is clear and unmistakable or <i>in esse</i>, they effectively made such a finding with the following pronouncements:</p><p> From the CA Decision: </p><blockquote> <p> Here, based on the evidence presented by x x x Mac Graphics, the trial court found that all the requisites for the issuance of a WPMI were present. The trial court found that Makro pre-terminated its twenty (20) year Lease Contract with x x x Mac Graphics without giving the latter a chance to rectify or remedy any alleged violations of such contract. The Lease Contract existed for only about two (2) years. x x x <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> From the RTC Order dated April 22, 2013: </p><blockquote> <p> A careful evaluation of the evidence presented by the plaintiff [Mac Graphics] initially shows with respect to the period of its existence, a breach in the Contract of Lease executed by MAKRO and MACGRAPHICS. The contract's term of lease was for twenty (20) years which was cut short by the unilateral and immediate termination by MAKRO. x x x </p> <p> x x x x </p> <p> MACGRAPHICS had shown that the contract of lease was pre-terminated by MAKRO without giving it a chance to rectify or remedy any violations that MAKRO alleged to have been committed by MACGRAPHICS. The contract is shown to have been in existence for a little less than two (2) years of the 20 year term, when MACGRAPHICS pre-terminated it. x x x <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> In fine, both the RTC and the CA initially determined that the pre­ termination by PMI without according Mac Graphics the 90-day "remedy period" to correct the alleged violations by the latter is not justified and, in a way, invalid.</p><p> To the Court, a finding of the existence of a clear and unmistakable right in favor of Mac Graphics necessarily presupposes that PMI's pre­termination of the lease contract is not valid. Conversely, a finding that PMI's pre-termination is valid and justified necessarily renders naught whatever rights emanating from the lease contract that Mac Graphics may have.</p><p> Indeed, the resolution of whether Mac Graphics has any right arising from the lease contract after its pre-termination by PMI hinges on the validity of such pre-termination. The issue on the existence of right in favor of Mac Graphics is the mirror image, so to speak, of the issue on the validity of PMI's pre-termination of the lease contract, and <em>vice versa</em>. </p><p> The parties are relentless in their contrary positions on these issues. Mac Graphics admits its non-compliance with the licenses/permits and insurance stipulations in the lease contract, but justifies such breach by invoking the presence of circumstances that rendered it legally and physically impossible to comply therewith and PMI's disregard of the 90-day "remedy period." On PMI's part, the outright pre-termination of the lease contract is justified because Mac Graphics failed to obtain the stipulated licenses/permits and insurance on the commencement date of the lease contract, which is January 15, 2007. Also, the insurance obtained was not compliant and obtained beyond the 90-day "remedy period."</p><p> Clearly, PMI has presented a substantial challenge against or contradiction of Mac Graphic's position. A genuine doubt, which is more legal than factual, exists on the validity of PMI's act of pre-termination and the tenability of Mac Graphics' excuse from its non-compliance with the stipulations of the lease contract.</p><p> Being more of a legal than factual determination, the lower courts should have been more circumspect before making an "initial" resolution thereof. While the pre-termination of the lease contract and the non­ observance of the 90-day "remedy period" are established and undisputed facts, which the lower courts took in consideration in issuing the WPMI, the non-compliance of the licenses/permits and insurance stipulations by Mac Graphics is likewise undisputed, Mac Graphics having duly acknowledged the same in the latter's Complaint and response letter to the termination notice. Yet, the lower courts did not seem to have factored such non­ compliance in their determination of whether or not Mac Graphics had a clear and unmistakable right in its favor that would entitle it to a WPMI.</p><p> The following pronouncement of the Court in <i>Sps. Dela Rosa v. Heirs of Juan Valdez</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup> cited in <em>Heirs of Melencio Yu v. Court of Appeals</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup> is relevant: </p><blockquote> <p> x x x Accordingly, the issuance of a writ of preliminary mandatory injunction is justified only in a <u>clear case, free from doubt or dispute</u>. When <u>the complainant's right is <strong>doubtful or disputed</strong>, he does not have a clear legal right and, therefore, the issuance of a writ of preliminary mandatory injunction is improper</u>. While it is not required that the right claimed by applicant, as basis for seeking injunctive relief, be conclusively established, it is still necessary to show, at least tentatively, that <u>the right exists and is <b>not vitiated by any substantial challenge or contradiction</b></u>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> Inasmuch as the right being claimed by Mac Graphics is substantially challenged or contradicted by PMI, a doubt exists whether Mac Graphics is entitled to the final relief sought by it in its Complaint, which is "[to direct and require] Makro and SMI to x x x honor and faithfully comply with the subsisting Contract [of Lease] until its final termination on 14 January 2027 [and] restore [its] lawful possession, use and enjoyment of the leased premises under the Contract [of Lease] x x x."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup> </p><p> Given the foregoing, the Court is of the opinion, and so holds, that Mac Graphics has failed to establish <i>prima facie</i> a right<i> in esse</i> or a clear and unmistakable right, rendering the issuance of the WPMI improper. Given the legal complexity of Mac Graphic's cause of action <i>vis-a-vis</i> PMI's defenses, it is unclear at this point whether Mac Graphics can enforce the pre­terminated lease contract as a matter of law. There are simply too many legal and factual sub-issues that need to be threshed out before the pre­termination may be declared valid or invalid.</p><p> Also, a finding in favor of the existence of a clear and unmistakable right in favor of Mac Graphics, which the lower courts effectively made, is tantamount to a prejudgment of the legality of PMI's pre-termination of the lease contract. PMI's pre-termination has in effect been declared invalid. The existence of Mac Graphics' right consequently negates the validity of the pre-termination by PMI. How can PMI now convince the RTC that the 90-day "remedy period" is not applicable — the breach by Mac Graphics being non-remediable — given the RTC finding that "MACGRAPHICS had shown that the contract of lease was pre-terminated by MAKRO without giving it a chance to rectify or remedy any violations that MAKRO alleged to have been committed by MACGRAPHICS?"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup> This is precisely the absurd situation that would result if there is a prejudgment of the main case as contemplated in<i> Searth Commodities Corp. v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[121]</sup> where there would be a reversal of the rule on the burden of proof since the proposition which Mac Graphics is inceptively bound to prove is already assumed. </p><p> Going to the grave and irreparable requirement for the issuance of a WPMI, both the CA and RTC found that the injuries which Mac Graphics might have sustained or would sustain as a result of the act of PMI are irreparable and cannot be remedied by a simple computation of damages. The RTC noted: </p><blockquote> <p> x x x Some clients of the plaintiff have also terminated their contract with MACGRAPHICS. Apart from the profits that MACGRAPHICS could have realized from their existing and future contracts, it had soiled the goodwill or reputation that plaintiff had built in the realm of advertisements. x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> The CA echoed the words of the RTC, to wit: </p><blockquote> <p> x x x As a result, private respondent's other clients also terminated their contract with the former. Apart from losing profits, private respondent's goodwill or reputation was soiled. x x x <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> During the hearing on its application for a WPMI, Mac Graphics presented two witnesses, namely: Mastroianni Alcala (Alcala), the Executive Assistant of Mac Graphics, and Lea Bon Ceraos (Ceraos), the purchasing and production officer of Mac Graphics.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[124]</sup> On the damages that Mac Graphics allegedly suffered, Alcala's testimony is summarized in the RTC Order dated April 22, 2013, as follows: </p><blockquote> <p> x x x MAC GRAPHICS incurred tremendous losses in earnings under its advertising contracts with its clients, including lost business opportunities. The most severe is that the company continuously to suffer gross and irreparable damage to its established business reputation which it has been protecting since 1984.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[125]</sup> Said loss was evidenced by a report dated 15 August 2009 which [Alcala] prepared and noted by Cecilia Edora. </p> <p> Relative to this case, [Alcala] prepared the Revenue Opportunity for the Remaining Contract Period dated August 15, 2009. Such document represents the revenue opportunities that MAC GRAPHICS was supposed to get from the sites upon marketing to their clients based on the market rate on the ongoing rates of other billboard sites in the same region. It represents actually the market rate, the rental rate that MAC GRAPHICS would charge to its clients for each site. Aside from the prevailing rates in the same area as basis, they also considered the existing contracts with clients. At present, they have existing contracts with Asiawide and Above World Multimedia Services. He described the MAKRO sites in Cubao and Makati as very marketable due to high traffic count and because of the visibility range that upon marketing the sites the value is based on the number of traffic coming along the area.</p> <p> MAC GRAPHICS['] yearly revenue has reduced greatly as they have around seven (7) billboards in Metro Manila site and two (2) of them were lost, relative to this case. A great percentage of their revenue was lost considering that they invested in improving the two MAKRO structures but they failed to use them for considerable number of years in accordance with their contract. The problem likewise affected their marketing efforts as some of their clients seemed to begin questioning their credibility.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[126]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> Ceraos, according to the aforesaid RTC Order, testified as follows: </p><blockquote> <p> MAC GRAPHICS spent more or less five (5) million pesos covering the labor and materials used in the MAKRO structures. With respect to labor, MAC GRAPHICS had contracts with labor contractor and the designer.

HGL Development Corporation</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[133]</sup> (<i>Semirara</i>) wherein the Court upheld the issuance of a WPMI in favor of the respondent therein. In <i>Semirara</i>, as holder of a pasture lease agreement, the respondent therein had a clear and unmistakable right to the possession of the property for a period of 25 years. The petitioner therein even sought permission from the respondent therein to use the subject property therein in 1999. The Court ruled that the damage to the business standing of the respondent therein was irreparable because no fair and reasonable redress could be had by the respondent therein insofar as the damage to its good will and business reputation is concerned because its failure to operate its cattle-grazing business would be perceived as inability on its part to comply with the demands of its customers and sow doubt in its capacity to continue doing business.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[134]</sup> </p><p> Unlike in <i>Principalia</i> and<i> Semirara</i>, where the businesses of the respondents therein were threatened with suspension of operation or even closure, the impact of the pre-termination of the lease contract under consideration to Mac Graphics is basically the reduction of its revenues. As testified by Alcala, Mac Graphics has around seven billboards in Metro Manila and two of them (those involved in this case) have been lost, resulting in the great reduction of its yearly revenue.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[135]</sup> Thus, Mac Graphics' injury, if any, is mainly loss of revenues and as such, the same can be measured with reasonable accuracy, easily quantifiable or susceptible of simple mathematical computation. The pecuniary value of such loss will fairly recompense Mac Graphics for which Mac Graphics has put its initial value at P1 million in its Complaint. Also, the presentation of the Revenue Opportunity for the Remaining Contract Period dated August 15, 2009, which represents the alleged revenue opportunities that Mac Graphics was supposed to get from the sites in dispute upon marketing to its clients based on the ongoing market rates of other billboard sites in the same region, bolsters the finding that the damage, if any, that Mac Graphics stood to suffer is reparable. </p><p> Consequently, the CA committed grave error for upholding the grant of the WPMI by the RTC in favor of Mac Graphics given the patent absence of a clear and unmistakable right of Mac Graphics and its injury, if any, that is easily quantifiable and reparable. The CA Decision is based on a misapprehension of the facts and the legal ramifications of the pre-termination by PMI based on the alleged non-compliance by Mac Graphics of the licenses/permits and insurance stipulations of the lease contract <i>vis-a­vis</i> the defenses interposed by Mac Graphics. </p><p> In light of the foregoing, the Court finds that the resolution of the third issue in the PMI Petition and the issues raised in the SMIC Petition that do not deal with the requisites for the issuance of a WPMI is, as it would be, superfluous.</p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petitions are hereby <b>GRANTED</b>.
