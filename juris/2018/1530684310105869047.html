The bloat could not be explained by private respondent Romeo's Service Record showing the total amount of government salary that he earned from January 1, 1986 to December 31, 2001 to be just <strong>P2,516,818.90</strong> - which is P10,236,771.60<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> less than his stated networth by the end of 2001. </p><p> And juxtaposed with the supposed value of the five real properties, <em>i.e</em>., P40,766,300.00, the latter is way out of proportion to private respondent Romeo's 15-year accumulated income of P2,516,818.90. Petitioner Republic also took note of the fact that private respondent Romeo made eight foreign travels between 1999 and 2004; while his wife, private respondent Fe, made 28 travels abroad during the same period. </p><p> Petitioner Republic concluded that the discrepancy of P10,236,771.60,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> plus the aggregate P40,766,300.00 value of the five real properties, all constituted ill-gotten wealth.</p><p> Thus, the Republic prayed – </p><blockquote> <p> 1. Before hearing, a writ be issued commanding respondents to show cause why their assets, more particularly enumerated in paragraph 5 hereof amounting to at least FORTY MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY-SIX THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED PESOS (P40,766,300.00), and such other additional properties amounting, or the value of which is equivalent to, TEN MILLION TWO HUNDRED THIRTY-SIX THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY-ONE AND 60/100 PESOS (P10,236,771.60) or a total of at least FIFTY-ONE MILLION THREE THOUSAND SEVENTY-ONE AND 60/100 PESOS (P51,003,071.60), which are in excess of respondent Romeo G. Panganiban's lawful and legitimate income, should not be forfeited in favor of the government; and </p> <p>2. After trial, the above-described real properties enumerated in paragraph 5 hereof amounting to at least FORTY MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY-SIX THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED PESOS (P40,766,300.00), and such other additional properties amounting, or the value of which is equivalent to, TEN MILLION TWO HUNDRED THIRTY-SIX THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY-ONE AND 60/100 PESOS (P10,236,771.60), be declared forfeited in favor of the petitioner.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> In his <em>Answer</em>, private respondent Romeo denied the allegations, and averred that his wife and his sisters had the financial capacity to purchase the real estate properties registered in their names; and that private respondent Fe contributed substantially to the family income as a business owner. He disavowed any personal participation in the purchase of the Ayala Alabang and Los Angeles properties. But he admitted that the Los Angeles property was actually purchased by his daughter Geraldine and his wife.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> </p><p> Private respondents Fe, Elsa, and Purita filed a <em>Joint Answer</em> echoing the same denial and special and affirmative defenses raised by private respondent Romeo. </p><p> Geraldine, however, did not file any <em>Answer</em>; thus, she was declared in default by the Sandiganbayan. </p><p> Upon the conclusion of the presentation of petitioner Republic's evidence-in-chief, it filed its Formal Offer of Exhibits.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> </p><blockquote> <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" border="1"> <tbody><tr> <td width="11%"><div align="center"><strong>EXHIBIT</strong></div></td> <td width="55%"><div align="center"><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></div></td> <td width="34%"><div align="center"><strong>PURPOSE</strong></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="center">A</div></td> <td><table width="95%" cellpadding="0" border="0" align="center"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify">Original copy of Romeo G.

The said property is in the name of Elsa P. de Luna widow under TCT No. 1577 (Exh. "8") and was acquired through a Deed of Absolute Sale from spouses Jose and Concepcion Singson as early as September 29, 1999 (Exh. "4"). The only evidence adduced by the plaintiff to support its claim that the said property belonged to respondent Romeo Panganiban was that his wife Fe Panganiban has listed the property in her travel documents as her address, and that there was a [S]ky [C]able account with the same address of the said property in the name of respondent's] wife Fe Panganiban. We can not sustain the assertion of the plaintiff. Those facts can not defeat the ownership of the property evidenced by a Torrens Title, and a Deed of Absolute Sale from the former owner. The usage of the said premises [by Romeo and Fe] is not unnatural considering that the public respondent and his wife Fe Panganiban are residing in Callos, Sta. Cruz, Laguna, and respondent Elsa Panganiban de Luna is the sister of Romeo Panganiban. Being siblings it is natural and proper for the brother and sister to make things convenient for each other.</p> <p> Petitioner would also asseverate that the property located in Los Angeles California - that is a <b>three-bedroom house and lot at 2840 Heritage Drive, Pasadena, Los Angeles, California, U.S.A.</b> with a value of Twelve Million Five Hundred Forty Thousand Three Hundred Pesos (P12,540,300.00) x x x is respondent Romeo Panganiban's property in excess of his lawful income. As proof of its claim, petitioner presented Exhibit "AA" which is a mere photocopy of Property Profile in the name of Fe and Geraldine Panganiban, and Exh. "BB" which is a photocopy of Sales Comparables indicating the name of Fe and Geraldine Panganiban with the allegation that there was an admission by the public respondent of supposed purchase in his counter-affidavit. Since we denied admission of Exhibits "AA" and "BB", and the alleged counter-affidavit was not even marked by the petitioner as its exhibit, We can not rule and resolve that this property was acquired by the [private] respondent while he was a public [officer] and even before or after he was a public officer. Petition for forfeiture of property must be supported and sustained by evidence admissible under the Rules of Court just like any other case. <b>The Courts ruling denying the admission of Exhs. "AA" and "BB" was not even questioned by the petitioner.</b></p> <p> With respect to the Residential House and Lot covered by and described under TCT No. 307495 in the name of spouses Romeo and Fe Panganiban consisting of 256 sq. meters located at Grand Villas, Batong Malake, Los Baños, Laguna x x x, We resolve there is a need for respondent Romeo Panganiban to explain the circumstances surrounding the same. If as appearing in Exhibit "1" of the defense that the same has been sold to respondent Purita Sarmiento even as early as December 1994, We can not understand why up to the present the same has not been transferred in the name of the vendee. The consideration of the Deed of Absolute Sale between Crescent Holdings Corp. and spouses Romeo and Fe Panganiban amounted to One Million Two Hundred Eighty Thousand (P1,280,000.00) pesos which could be considered a considerable amount at that time, it is, we feel, unnatural and not in accordance with human behavior why up to the time the petition for forfeiture was filed, there has been no move on the part of the respondent Purita Sarmiento, the supposed transferee of the property from Romeo and Fe Panganiban, to effect the eventual transfer in her name of the property.</p> <p> Let us now consider the three-storey commercial bldg. and the lots on which it is located. Per proof of the petitioner, the three-storey building is sitting on two lots with areas of 64 and 84 sq. meters with a valuation of P2.15 million (Exhs. "X" and "Y" with their sub-markings). And while the two (2) lots purchased from Walfrido T. Hicban had only a consideration of P200,000.00, they were acquired in June 1994 (Exh. "M") at a time when the gross salary of respondent Romeo Panganiban was only P147,768 (Exh. "D"). the petitioner has driven its point that unless sufficiently explained by the respondents, the circumstances would warrant forfeiture of the property.</p> <p> We find the <b>residential lot consisting of 200 sq. meters covered by TCT No. T-110804 in the names of spouses Romeo Panganiban and Fe Labunas</b> upon which the petitioner placed the value at P146,000 can be very well acquired by the salaries and income of respondent Romeo Panganiban. In petitioner's Exh. "DD", the market value was only P16,000.00 in the year 1989, and in Exh. "EE" it was only P40,000.00 in the year 1994, while in Exh. "FF" in the year 1997 the market value was only P110,000.00. Lastly, in Exh. "GG" Tax Declaration for the year 2000, the market value was pegged at P146,000.00.</p> <p> For the many foreign travels made by the respondents we rule and hold that the respondents should be made to explain how they were able to finance the same.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> (Emphases supplied.)</p> </blockquote> <p> Petitioner Republic moved for the partial reconsideration of the Resolution on the following arguments: (<em>i</em>) relative to the <strong>Ayala Alabang property</strong>, the Sandiganbayan failed to appreciate the testimony of an investigator of the Philippine National Police (PNP) Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG) that private respondent Elsa admitted that the subject property really belonged to private respondent Romeo; (<em>ii</em>) as to the <b>Los Angeles property</b>, the Sandiganbayan overlooked the fact that if private respondent Fe co-owned the Los Angeles property, then it would similarly make private respondent Romeo a co-owner thereof being the spouse of Fe; and (<em>iii</em>) the finding that the value of <b>Callos-Sta.

It should be sustained where the plaintiffs evidence is <em>prima facie </em>insufficient for recovery.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> (Citations omitted.)</p> </blockquote> <p> <b><i>Ayala Alabang Property</i></b></p><p> Petitioner Republic argues that public respondent Sandiganbayan put much stock on private respondent Elsa's <i>Certificate of Title and Deed of Sale</i>, which had not been formally offered in evidence as private respondent Romeo, <em>et al.</em>, had not even commenced presenting their evidence yet. Hence, public respondent Sandiganbayan should not have considered the two documents in resolving the demurrer to evidence pursuant to Section 34, Rule 132 of the Rules of Court, as amended, which states that "<em>the court shall consider no evidence which has not been formally offered</em>." It also asserts that in <em>Tan v. Bantegui</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> this Court held that "<em>the incontrovertible nature of a certificate of title applies only when the issue involved is the validity of the original and not of the transfer</em>." In this case, public respondent Sandiganbayan considered a transfer certificate of title as an absolute and indefeasible evidence of ownership. </p><p> Petitioner Republic also insists that from <em>Yuchengco v. Sandiganbayan</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> even if a respondent is not the registered owner of a property if it could be shown by preponderance of evidence that the property is ill-gotten and that he/she is the beneficial owner, thus, the subject property could still be forfeited in favor of the State.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> It insists that private respondents Romeo and Fe are the actual and beneficial owners of the Ayala Alabang property. </p><p> Lastly, petitioner Republic avers that public respondent Sandiganbayan merely speculated when it ruled that "<em>being siblings, it is natural and proper for the brother and sister to make things convenient for each other</em>";<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> that speculation should not be allowed to supplant hard evidence; and that private respondents Romeo, <em>et al.</em>, should present evidence to show that it was really private respondent Elsa who purchased the Ayala Alabang property, and she lent it to her brother. </p><p> Private respondents Romeo, <em>et al.</em>, counters that, "the petitioner's evidence as to the usage by private respondents Romeo and Fe Panganiban of the same property cannot defeat the ownership documents of [private respondent] Ms. Elsa P. de Luna,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> which documents, <em>i.e</em>., Revised Tax Declaration Form and Deed of Absolute Sale, were attached to the Petition for Forfeiture as Annexes "J" and "K", respectively, and made integral parts thereof. They also countered that the testimonial evidence given by its witness Januario Mendoza – to the effect that when he went to a residence in Moonwalk Village in Paranaque City to serve a letter of invitation to private respondent Elsa, the latter admitted to him that the residential property in Ayala Alabang is actually owned by private respondents Romeo and Fe – is of doubtful veracity because witness Mendoza narrated that when he was ushered inside the house at Moonwalk Village, private respondent Elsa walked towards him, which is improbable because private respondent Elsa has been wheelchair-bound since before the petition for forfeiture was filed. </p><p> In dismissing the forfeiture complaint as to the Ayala Alabang property, public respondent Sandiganbayan held that the evidence adduced by petitioner Republic – travel documents of private respondent Fe and the Sky Cable account documents both listing such property as the latter's given address – failed to defeat the presumed ownership of private respondent Elsa whose name appears on the TCT and the Deed of Absolute Sale pertaining to the subject property.</p><p> We agree with public respondent Sandiganbayan that the facts of the case fail to substantiate the assertion that the real owners of the Ayala Alabang property are private respondents Romeo and Fe, especially when contrasted with the Deed of Absolute Sale, Revised Tax Declaration Form and the Transfer Certificate of Title all stating therein that the owner is one Elsa P. De Luna.</p><p> While it is true that public respondent Sandiganbayan incorrectly made mention of Exhibits "4" (Deed of Absolute Sale) and "8" (Transfer Certificate of Title) of the private respondents, however, a certified true copy of the same Deed, including the Revised Tax Declaration Form covering the subject property were earlier attached to the Petition for Forfeiture and made integral parts thereof; and a copy of the title was attached as Annex "3" of the Joint Answer of private respondents Fe, Elsa and Purita.</p><p> Again, Section 1, Rule 33 of the Rules of Court, as amended, provides that: </p><blockquote> <p> Section 1. <em>Demurrer to evidence</em>. — After the plaintiff has completed the presentation of his evidence, the defendant may move for dismissal <strong>on the ground that upon the <u>facts</u> and the law the plaintiff has shown no right to relief</strong>. If his motion is denied, he shall have the right to present evidence. If the motion is granted but on appeal the order of dismissal is reversed he shall be deemed to have waived the right to present evidence. (Emphasis supplied.)</p> </blockquote> <p> From above, what should be resolved in a demurrer to evidence is whether or not the plaintiff is entitled to the relief based on the facts and the law. The evidence to be considered pertains to the merits of the case, which does not include technical aspects thereof,<em> i.e</em>., capacity to sue. But, the plaintiff’s evidence is not the sole basis in resolving a demurrer to evidence. The "<u>facts</u>," contemplated by the rule should include all the means sanctioned by the Rules of Court in ascertaining matters in judicial proceedings, <em>i.e</em>., judicial admissions, matters of judicial notice, stipulations made during the pre-trial and trial, admissions, and presumptions, the only exclusion being the defendant's evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> </p><p> Section 4, Rule 129 of the Rules of Court, as amended, provides: </p><blockquote> <p> Section 4.<em> Judicial admissions</em>. — An admission, verbal or written, made by a party in the course of the proceedings in the same case, does not require proof. The admission may be contradicted only by showing that it was made through palpable mistake or that no such admission was made.</p> </blockquote> <p> In <i>Republic v. Sandigabayan</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> this Court settled that judicial admissions may be made: (a) in the pleadings filed by the parties; (b) in the course of the trial either by verbal or written manifestations or stipulations; or (c) in other stages of judicial proceedings, as in the pre-trial of the case.</p> <p> Hence, in the instant case, facts pleaded in the petition and answer/joint answer are deemed admissions of petitioner Republic and private respondents Romeo, <em>et al</em>., respectively, who are not permitted to contradict them or subsequently take a position contrary to or inconsistent with such admissions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> </p><p> Though the title to the property was initially filed in court through the Joint Answer, however, petitioner Republic failed to refute the same, and even marked it during pre-trial. Hence, petitioner Republic already admitted its genuineness and due execution. Such judicial admission was correctly considered by public respondent Sandiganbayan in resolving the demurrer to evidence. When the due execution and genuineness of an instrument are deemed admitted because of the adverse party's failure to make a specific verified denial thereof, the instrument need not be presented formally in evidence for it may be considered an admitted fact.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></p><p> As to the cable television subscription and travel documents wherein private respondent Fe used the Ayala Alabang property as her given address, what they simply proved is that private respondent Fe resides in the said property, nothing more. They are not sufficient to prove that private respondents Romeo and Fe are the actual and beneficial owners of the property, much less that they unlawfully acquired it.</p><p> <b><i>Los Angeles Property</i></b> </p><p>Petitioner Republic argues that private respondent Romeo already admitted in his <em>Answer</em> that the Los Angeles property was jointly acquired by his wife and daughter, private respondent Fe and Geraldine, respectively.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> It insists that the existence of the said property and the fact that his wife is a co-owner does not require proof pursuant to Section 4, Rule 129 of the Rules of Court, as amended and <i>Republic v. Sandiganbayan</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> </p><p> Petitioner Republic reasons that whether the property relation of private respondents Romeo and Fe is governed by the system of absolute community of property or conjugal partnership of gains, private respondent Romeo stands as a co-owner of his wife's interest in the Los Angeles property.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></p><p> Petitioner Republic concludes that it was premature of public respondent Sandiganbayan to conclude that private respondent Romeo had no participation in the purchase of the said property, which is his defense that he needed to prove during trial.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> </p><p>Private respondents Romeo,<i> et al.</i>, on the other hand, simply insists that any admission on the ownership of the Los Angeles property that may have been made (in the answer/joint answer) is not sufficient basis to find that the said property belonged to private respondent Romeo, much less illegally acquired by him. </p><p>Public respondent Sandiganbayan ordered the dismissal of the petition for forfeiture as to the Los Angeles property on the ground that the two documentary evidence, Annexes "AA" and "BB," though formally offered by petitioner Republic, were mere photocopies; therefore, inadmissible in evidence. And that the latter failed to formally offer the. counter-affidavit<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> of private respondent Romeo. </p><p> In this instance, this Court disagrees with public respondent Sandiganbayan.</p><p> As similarly discussed above, the admission of private respondent Romeo in his Answer that the Los Angeles property was bought by his wife, private respondent Fe, and his daughter, Geraldine, is a judicial admission that necessarily formed part of the facts of the case, which did not require proof to be sufficiently considered in the resolution of the demurrer to evidence. </p><p> Moreover, the denial by private respondent Romeo of his ownership of the subject property is pregnant with an admission, <em>i.e.</em>, that he has an interest in his wife's share in the property by virtue of their marital union. This is a negative pregnant, which is a form of negative expression which carries with it an affirmation or at least an implication of some kind favorable to the adverse party.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> </p><p> In his Answer, private respondent Romeo alleged that, "<em>respondent reiterates that he had no participation whatsoever in the purchase of that residential house and lot located at No. 2840 Heritage Drive, Pasadena, Los Angeles, as the same was actually purchased by his daughter, Geraldine, who is U.S. based, together with her mother, Fe</em>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> On the other hand, private respondent Fe claimed in her Joint Answer that, she "<em>vehemently denies that the residential house and lot located at No. 2840 Heritage Drive, Pasadena, Los Angeles, belongs to respondent Romeo Panganiban as the same was actually purchased by her daughter, Geraldine, who is U.S. based, and that her name as co-owner of the property was indicated to enable Geraldine to secure approval for a loan to finance [the] purchase of the property</em>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> </p><p> Although private respondents Romeo and Fe aver that the former had nothing to do in the transaction, the fact that they are spouses makes the Los Angeles property part of their property regime, be it an absolute community or conjugal property of gains. Article 91 of the Family Code states that <em>unless otherwise provided in this Chapter or in the marriage settlements, the community property shall consist of all the property owned by the spouses at the time of the celebration of the marriage or acquired thereafter</em>. </p><p> On the other hand, Articles 106, 116, and 117 of the Family Code provide what constitutes the conjugal property of the spouses. </p><blockquote> <p> Art. 106. Under the regime of conjugal partnership of gains, the husband and wife place in a common fund the proceeds, products, fruits and income from their separate properties and those acquired by either or both spouses through their efforts or by chance, and, upon dissolution of the marriage or of the partnership, the net gains or benefits obtained by either or both spouses shall be divided equally between them, unless otherwise agreed in the marriage settlements.</p> <p> Art. 116. All property acquired during the marriage, whether the acquisition appears to have been made, contracted or registered in the name of one or both spouses, is presumed to be conjugal unless the contrary is proved.</p> <p> Art. 117. The following are conjugal partnership properties:</p> <blockquote> <p> (1) Those acquired by onerous title during the marriage at the expense of the common fund, whether the acquisition be for the partnership, or for only one of the spouses;</p> <p> (2) Those obtained from the labor, industry, work or profession of either or both of the spouses; </p> <p>(3) The fruits, natural, industrial, or civil, due or received during the marriage from the common property, as well as the net fruits from the exclusive property of each spouse;</p> <p> (4) The share of either spouse in the hidden treasure which the law awards to the finder or owner of the property where the treasure is found;</p> <p> (5) Those acquired through occupation such as fishing or hunting; </p> <p>(6) Livestock existing upon the dissolution of the partnership in excess of the number of each kind brought to the marriage by either spouse; and</p> <p> (7) Those which are acquired by chance, such as winnings from gambling or betting. However, losses therefrom shall be borne exclusively by the loser-spouse.</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> Just as public respondent Sandiganbayan gave weight to the admission of private respondents Romeo, <i>et al</i>., as to the registered owners on the certificate of title to the Ayala Alabang property, then it should have accorded the same credence to their admission as to the owners of the Los Angeles property, otherwise, the application of the rules on evidence is arbitrary and tantamount to grave abuse of discretion. Based on the evidence on record, the Los Angeles property is co-owned in equal shares by private respondent Fe and Geraldine, and by law, the half share therein of respondent Fe is deemed to pertain to both private respondents Romeo and Fe as spouses. </p><p> And as a consequence of Our reversal of the resolution granting the demurrer to evidence<em> vis-à-vis</em> one-half of the Los Angeles property, or that portion pertaining to the undivided share of private respondent Fe, private respondents Romeo, <em>et al.</em>, are deemed to have waived the right to present countervailing evidence that such one-half was not unlawfully acquired.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> </p><p> <b>Callos-Sta. Cruz Laguna Property</b></p><p> Petitioner Republic argues that private respondents Romeo and Fe did not deny the acquisition of the said property in their Answers; thus, they now have the burden to show that the same was not unlawfully acquired.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></p><p> Private respondents Romeo,<em> et al.</em>, counter-argue that petitioner Republic's very own evidence show the value of the subject property to be well within private respondent Romeo and Fe's financial capacity to purchase; therefore, it has not been proved to have been unlawfully acquired. </p><p>This Court finds that public respondent Sandiganbayan correctly dismissed the petition for forfeiture with respect to the Callos-Sta. Cruz property. Petitioner Republic's pieces of documentary evidence failed to sufficiently prove that the subject property was unlawfully acquired, or that private respondent Romeo could not have afforded the said property. </p><p> Further, petitioner Republic claims that the assailed resolutions <em>deserve closer examination</em>, without actually stating upon what ground public respondent Sandiganbayan abused its discretion in granting the demurrer to evidence concerning the Callos-Sta. Cruz property. Where a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, as amended, alleges grave abuse of discretion, the petitioner should establish that the respondent court or tribunal acted in a capricious, whimsical, arbitrary or despotic manner in the exercise of its jurisdiction as to be equivalent to lack of jurisdiction. This is so because "grave abuse of discretion" is well-defined and not an amorphous concept that may easily be manipulated to suit one's purpose. </p><p align="center"> <b><i>Conclusion</i></b> </p><p>This Court finds that the pieces of evidence adduced by petitioner Republic <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Ayala Alabang and Callos-Sta. Cruz properties are wholly insufficient to support the allegations of the petition for forfeiture in Civil Case No. 0192. Thus, for failure of petitioner Republic to show any right to the relief sought, this Court partly affirms the assailed resolutions. </p><p> <strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the petition is <strong>PARTLY GRANTED</strong>.
