CR HC No. 07579, which affirmed <em>in toto</em> the Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated May 18, 2015 of the Regional Trial Court of Makati City, Branch 64 (RTC): (a) in Criminal Case No. 14-518 finding accused-appellants Edgardo Dela Rosa y Empamano @ "Boy" (Edgardo), Criselda Huerto <i>y</i> Docot @ "Cecil" (Criselda), and Ronaldo Huerto y Docot (Ronaldo; collectively, accused-appellants) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating Section 5, Article II of Republic Act No. (RA) 9165,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> otherwise known as the "Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002;" and (b) in Criminal Case No. 14-519 finding accused-appellant Edgardo guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating Section 11, Article II of RA 9165. <p align="center"> <b>The Facts</b> </p><p> The prosecution alleged that on April 26, 2014, a buy-bust team composed of members of the Station Anti-Illegal Drugs (SAID) Special Operations Task Group of Makati City was formed to respond to a tip<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> regarding a male and a female peddling illegal drugs along Makati Avenue, Barangay Poblacion, Makati City. After coordinating with the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> the team, together with their asset, proceeded to the target area where Edgardo, whom the asset called "Mang Boy," sold a plastic sachet containing suspected <em>shabu</em> to Police Officer 1 Jojo Valdez (PO1 Valdez), the designated poseur-buyer. Also present during the buy-bust transaction and arrested together with Edgardo were Edgardo's wife, Criselda, and brother-in-law, Ronaldo.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> A search on the person of Edgardo yielded four (4) more plastic sachets containing suspected <em>shabu</em>. Thus, after accused-appellants were apprised of their rights, the arresting officers brought them and the seized items to the barangay hall where the items were marked,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> photographed, and inventoried<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> in the presence of Barangay Captain Benhur Cruz (Brgy. Captain Cruz).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Thereafter, the confiscated items were brought to the crime laboratory for examination<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> and tested positive<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> for Methamphetamine Hydrochloride. Consequently, all three (3) accused-appellants were charged with violation of Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 for Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs (0.10 gram),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> while Edgardo was further charged with violation of Section 11, Article II of RA 9165 for Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs (0.41 gram).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> </p><p> In defense, Edgardo and Criselda denied the charges and claimed that on April 25, 2014, they, together with Ronaldo, were inside a bingo boutique along Makati Avenue when police officers suddenly took them outside and eventually, handcuffed them. They were then taken to the SAID office where they were detained for three (3) days. Thereafter, they were asked to confess to their crimes and further, shown plastic sachets allegedly recovered from them.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15] </sup> </p><p> In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> dated May 18, 2015, the RTC found accused-appellants guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 5, Article II of RA 9165, and accordingly, sentenced each of them to life imprisonment and to pay a fine of P500,000.00, without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency. In addition, the RTC convicted Edgardo for violation of Section 11, Article II of RA 9165, and hence, sentenced him to an indeterminate penalty of twelve (12) years and one (1) day to fifteen (15) years of imprisonment and to pay a fine of P400,000.00, without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> The RTC found that the elements of the crimes charged were sufficiently established by the prosecution and that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items had been properly preserved.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> </p><p>On appeal,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> the CA affirmed the judgment of conviction in a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> dated November 29, 2016.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Apart from echoing the findings and conclusions of the RTC, the CA stressed that non-compliance with the provisions of Section 21, Article II of RA 9165 does not automatically render void and invalid the seizure and custody of the confiscated items, so long as the integrity and evidentiary value thereof have been properly preserved by the arresting officers.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> </p><p> Hence, this appeal<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> seeking the reversal of accused-appellants' conviction for the crimes charged. </p><p align="center"> <b>The Court's Ruling</b> </p><p>The appeal is meritorious. </p><p>In cases for Illegal Sale and/or Possession of Dangerous Drugs under RA 9165,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> it is essential that the identity of the dangerous drug be established with moral certainty, considering that the dangerous drug itself forms an integral part of the <em>corpus delicti</em> of the crime.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Failing to prove the integrity of the <em>corpus delicti</em> renders the evidence for the State insufficient to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt and hence, warrants an acquittal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> </p><p> To establish the identity of the dangerous drug with moral certainty, the prosecution must be able to account for each link of the chain of custody from the moment the drugs are seized up to their presentation in court as evidence of the crime.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> As part of the chain of custody procedure, the law requires that the apprehending team, immediately after seizure and confiscation, conduct a physical inventory and photograph the seized items. The law further requires that the said inventory and photography be done in the presence of the accused or the person from whom the items were seized, or his representative or counsel, as well as certain required witnesses, namely: (<em>a</em>) if <b>prior</b> to the amendment of RA 9165 by RA 10640,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> "a representative from the media <i><u>AND</u></i> the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official";<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> or (<em>b</em>) if <b>after</b> the amendment of RA 9165 by RA 10640, "[a]n elected public official and a representative of the National Prosecution Service <i><u>OR</u></i> the media."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> The law requires the presence of these witnesses primarily "to ensure the establishment of the chain of custody and remove any suspicion of switching, planting, or contamination of evidence."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> </p><p> As a general rule, compliance with the chain of custody procedure is strictly enjoined as the same has been regarded "not merely as a procedural technicality but as a matter of substantive law."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> This is because "[t]he law has been crafted by Congress as safety precautions to address potential police abuses, especially considering that the penalty imposed may be life imprisonment."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></p><p> Nonetheless, the Court has recognized that due to varying field conditions, strict compliance with the chain of custody procedure may not always be possible.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> As such, the failure of the apprehending team to strictly comply with the same would not<em> ipso facto</em> render the seizure and custody over the items as void and invalid, provided that the prosecution satisfactorily proves that: <b><u>(<i>a</i>) there is a justifiable ground for non-compliance; and (<i>b</i>) the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved</u></b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> The foregoing is based on the saving clause found in Section 21 (a),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Article II of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA 9165, which was later adopted into the text of RA 10640.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> It should, however, be emphasized that for the saving clause to apply, the prosecution must duly explain the reasons behind the procedural lapses,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> and that the justifiable ground for non-compliance <b><i>must be proven as a fact</i></b>, because the Court cannot presume what these grounds are or that they even exist.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> </p><p> Anent the required witnesses rule, non-compliance may be permitted if the prosecution proves that the apprehending officers exerted genuine and sufficient efforts to secure the presence of such witnesses, albeit they eventually failed to appear. While the earnestness of these efforts must be examined on a case-to-case basis, the overarching objective is for the Court to be convinced that the failure to comply was reasonable under the given circumstances.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Thus, mere statements of unavailability, absent actual serious attempts to contact the required witnesses, are unacceptable as justified grounds for non-compliance.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> These considerations arise from the fact that police officers are ordinarily given sufficient time – beginning from the moment they have received the information about the activities of the accused until the time of his arrest – to prepare for a buy-bust operation and consequently, make the necessary arrangements beforehand, knowing full well that they would have to strictly comply with the chain of custody rule.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> </p><p> Notably, the Court, in <i>People v. Miranda</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> issued a definitive reminder to prosecutors when dealing with drugs cases. It implored that "[since] the [procedural] requirements are clearly set forth in the law, the State retains the positive duty to account for any lapses in the chain of custody of the drugs/items seized from the accused, regardless of whether or not the defense raises the same in the proceedings <em>a quo</em>; otherwise, it risks the possibility of having a conviction overturned on grounds that go into the evidence's integrity and evidentiary value, albeit the same are raised only for the first time on appeal, or even not raised, become apparent upon further review."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> </p><p> Records show that although the inventory of the seized items was conducted in the presence of Brgy. Captain Cruz (an elected public official), no representatives from the DOJ and the media were present to witness the same. During trial, PO1 Valdez, one of the members of the buy-bust team and the designated poseur-buyer, explicitly admitted that: </p><blockquote> <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td colspan="2">ATTY.

As earlier discussed, the prosecution is put to task <i>to justify the absence of the required witnesses</i> during the conduct of inventory and photography or, at the very least, show that the arresting officers exerted <i>genuine and sufficient efforts</i> to secure their presence. Unfortunately, no such justification or demonstration was even proffered in this case. In consequence, the Court is constrained to conclude that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items have been compromised, which perforce already warrants accused-appellants' acquittal. That being said, the Court finds it unnecessary to delve into the other matters raised.</p> <p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appeal is <b>GRANTED</b>.
