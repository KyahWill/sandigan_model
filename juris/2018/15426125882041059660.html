Nonetheless, it directed the filing of comments on the Third Supplemental Petition.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Thus, a Comment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> dated November 12, 2009 was filed. </p> <p>On October 6, 2010, the Court of Appeals issued a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> expunging from the record the Second and Third Supplemental Petitions. It also deemed the case submitted for decision.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> In particular, it noted: </p> <blockquote> <p>This case is already ripe for determination had it not been for the filing of the instant Motions and the consequent filing of pleadings.

They allege that the Court of Appeals committed inordinate delay in resolving their Petition filed on July 11, 2008. They claimed that the Court of Appeals' "continued inaction on the case is clearly a neglect of its judicial duties."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> </p> <p>In their Comment/Opposition,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> respondents the Madrigals, Vicente, Malasig, Ubano, and Asido argue that the Court of Appeals did not neglect its duty to resolve the instant case. They attribute the delay in the resolution of this case to the numerous supplemental petitions filed by petitioners for which the Court of Appeals had to afford respondents an opportunity to be heard. If not for the numerous supplemental petitions, the case would have already been resolved.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> </p> <p>In its December 14, 2012 Resolution,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> the Court of Appeals denied the Motion for Mediation as it was unilaterally made. It also denied the Motion for Reconsideration of its October 6, 2010 Resolution. It again deemed the case submitted for decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></p> <p> On February 8, 2013, the Court of Appeals rendered a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> dismissing the petition as the questioned orders of the Regional Trial Court were not rendered in grave abuse of discretion. Thus, respondents the Madrigals, Vicente, Malasig, Ubano, and Asido filed a Manifestation<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> dated February 18, 2013, attaching a copy of the Court of Appeals February 8, 2013 Decision and praying that this Court dismiss this case as the issues raised have already become moot and academic.</p> <p> This Court noted their Manifestation and directed the parties to file their respective memoranda.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> </p><p> In their Memorandum, petitioners claim that the Court of Appeals "did not comply with its constitutional and statutory mandate to decide the incidents and the merits of [the case] within the prescribed period, and had violated the rights of the petitioners to a speedy disposition of their case."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> In particular, they point out that their 2008 petition was resolved by the Court of Appeals only in 2013, or more than the required 12-month period, in violation of their rights.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> </p><p> Respondents, on the other hand, contend that any delay in the resolution of the case was due to petitioners' numerous motions. They point out that due to these motions, the Court of Appeals was constrained to first resolve pending incidents before repeatedly submitting the case for decision. They likewise argue that the prayer for the issuance of a writ of mandamus has since become moot due to the promulgation of the Court of Appeals February 8, 2013 Decision.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> </p><p> Petitioners counter, however, that the February 8, 2013 Decision did not render the case moot since it had not yet become final. The Court of Appeals had yet to resolve their Motion for Reconsideration.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> </p><p> From the arguments of the parties, the issue for resolution before this Court is whether or not the Court of Appeals committed inordinate delay in resolving the petition in CA-G.R. SP No. 104291. Before this issue can be addressed, however, this Court must first pass upon the issue of whether or not the petition has already become moot in view of the Court of Appeals February 8, 2013 Decision. </p><p align="center"> <b>I</b> </p><p> The Petition is dismissed for being moot and academic.</p><p> A petition for mandamus may be filed against any tribunal, corporation, board, officer, or person who is alleged to have unlawfully neglected the performance of a duty arising from that office, trust, or station.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> In this case, petitioners pray for the issuance of a writ of mandamus to compel the Court of Appeals to resolve their Petition in CA­-G.R. SP No. 104291.</p><p> However, the Court of Appeals has already rendered its Decision on February 8, 2013. It issued a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> dated March 10, 2014 on petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration. CA-G.R. SP No. 104291 has already been fully resolved by the Court of Appeals. In <i>Baldo v. Commission on Elections</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p>A case becomes moot when there is no more actual controversy between the parties or no useful purpose can be served in passing upon the merits. Courts will not determine a moot question in a case in which no practical relief can be granted. It is unnecessary to indulge in academic discussion of a case presenting a moot question, as a judgment thereon cannot have any practical legal effect or, in the nature of things, cannot be enforced.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p>In <i>Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Employees Association v. Court of Industrial Relations</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> a petition for mandamus was filed to compel the Court of Industrial Relations to resolve an urgent petition for the issuance of preliminary mandatory injunction. While the petition for mandamus was pending before this Court, the Court of Industrial Relations issued a Resolution denying the application for the issuance of the writ of preliminary mandatory injunction. This Court was, thus, constrained to dismiss the petition for mandamus as it had already become moot and academic. </p> <p> In <i>Apao v. Tizon</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> several persons were charged with double murder. These persons subsequently filed a motion for bail before the Court of First Instance of Zamboanga del Sur. The motion for bail, however, was denied for being prematurely filed as the information had not yet been filed. Thus, they filed a petition for mandamus before this Court, seeking to compel the Assistant Provincial Fiscal to file the information so that the Court of First Instance could act on their urgent motion for bail. While the petition for mandamus was pending before this Court, the Assistant Provincial Fiscal filed the information for double murder. The Court of First Instance likewise conducted a hearing on the motion for bail. The petition for mandamus, therefore, was dismissed for being moot and academic.</p><p> In this Petition, petitioners prayed for the issuance of a writ of mandamus to compel the Court of Appeals to resolve CA-G.R. SP No. 104291.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> However, the Court of Appeals already rendered a Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 104291 on February 8, 2013. It also resolved petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration on March 10, 2014. Despite the occurrence of these subsequent events, petitioners, in their Memorandum, reiterated their prayer for this Court to compel the Court of Appeals to resolve CA-G.R. SP No. 104291.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> </p><p> Any issuance of a writ of mandamus in this case, however, becomes an exercise in futility. The Court of Appeals cannot be compelled to resolve a case it has already fully resolved. This Petition must be dismissed for being moot. </p><p align="center"> <b>II</b> </p><p> Even assuming that this Court could still pass upon the substantive issue in this case, the Petition would still be denied for lack of merit. The Court of Appeals did not delay in resolving CA-G.R. SP No. 104291.</p><p> All persons have the constitutional right to speedy disposition of cases.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> To this end, the Constitution specifies specific time periods when courts may resolve cases: </p><blockquote> <p> Section 15. (1) All cases or matters filed after the effectivity of this Constitution must be decided or resolved within twenty-four months from date of submission for the Supreme Court, and, unless reduced by the Supreme Court, twelve months for all lower collegiate courts, and three months for all other lower courts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Under this provision, the Court of Appeals is given a 12-month period to resolve any case that has already been submitted for decision. Any case still pending 12 months after submission for decision may be considered as delay. The parties may file the necessary action, such as a petition for mandamus, to protect their constitutional right to speedy disposition of cases.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup></p> <p> In this case, however, petitioners' invocation of the right to speedy disposition of cases is misplaced since the Court of Appeals has resolved the petition in a timely manner within the period provided by law.</p><p> Petitioners filed their Petition for Certiorari, Prohibition, and Mandamus before the Court of Appeals on July 11, 2008.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> On July 15, 2008, the Court of Appeals required respondents to submit their comment on this Petition.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> On July 28, 2008, however, petitioners filed a Motion for Leave to File Supplemental Petition.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> </p><p>Meanwhile, respondents filed their Comment on August 5, 2008,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> while petitioners filed their Reply on August 15, 2008.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> On September 17, 2008, the Court of Appeals directed the parties to submit their respective memoranda.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> On September 30, 2008, however, petitioners filed a Motion to Admit Second Supplemental Petition.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> Thus, on October 13, 2008, the Court of Appeals directed the submission of comments on the Second Supplemental Petition.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> Nonetheless, all the parties had already submitted their respective memoranda by October 17, 2008.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> </p><p>On December 12, 2008, petitioners again filed a Motion for Leave to File a Third Supplemental Petition.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> In its frustration, the Court of Appeals issued a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> dated October 22, 2009, stating: </p><blockquote> <p>From the records, it appears that the herein parties have already submitted their respective memoranda, thus this Court could have very well considered this case submitted for decision.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p>Owing to the requirements of due process, the Court of Appeals, however, directed respondents to file their comments on the Third Supplemental Petition, after which, the case would be deemed submitted for decision.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> Thus, respondents submitted a Comment dated November 12, 2009.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> </p> <p>After assessing the merits of the Second and Third Supplemental Petitions, the Court of Appeals expunged them both and deemed the case submitted for decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> in its October 6, 2010 Resolution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> The Court of Appeals reiterated: </p> <blockquote> <p> This case is already ripe for determination had it not been for the filing of the instant Motions and the consequent filing of pleadings.

Vigilance should not be a license for parties to incessantly badger courts into action.

Instead of resolving the main petition, courts will have to devote their time and resources in resolving these pleadings. </p> <p>Petitioners are reminded that litigation is not won by the party who files the most pleadings.
