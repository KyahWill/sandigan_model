The RTC found accused-appellant Benito Palaras y Lapu-os (<i>accused-appellant</i>) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the charges against him, and sentenced him with life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000.00 for violating Section 5, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> (<i>R.A.

The two cases were jointly tried.<br><br><b><i>Version of the Prosecution</i></b><br><br>The Office of the Solicitor General (<i>OSG</i>) summarized the prosecution's case as follows:<br><br>The Intelligence Section of the Philippine National Police of Silay City (<i>PNP-Silay City</i>) received reports that a certain Benito Palaras y Lapu-os a.k.a. "Bitoy," a resident of Sitio Matagoy, Barangay Rizal, Silay City, was actively engaged in selling <i>shabu</i> in the said area together with his brother, Joemarie Palaras, who had been previously arrested for a similar offense.<br><br>Pursuant to the said reports, P/Supt. Rosauro B. Francisco, Jr., the Chief of Police of PNP-Silay City, ordered surveillance, monitoring, and casing operation on accused-appellant. A test-buy operation was then undertaken with the use of a confidential asset, who acted as the poseur足-buyer. A sachet of <i>shabu</i> was purchased by the poseur-buyer from accused足-appellant for the sum of Two Hundred Fifty Pesos (P250.00). The item purchased from the accused-appellant in said test-buy was brought to the PNP Crime Laboratory of the Negros Occidental Provincial Police Office (<i>NOPPO</i>) on 14 December 2011. The contents of the said plastic sachet was "positive" for methamphetamine hydrochloride (<i>shabu</i>), a dangerous drug, as shown in Chemistry Repm1No. D-241-2011.<br><br>A buy-bust operation was thus set on 22 February 2012, to be conducted by the same police unit on accused-appellant Palaras. Two (2) P1 00-peso bills and a P50-peso bill were marked by underlining the last digit of the serial numbers on each of them. The same were subscribed to before Prosecutor Ma. Lisa Lorraine H. Atotubo as the money to be used in said buy-bust operation. This was entered in the blotter of the PNP-Silay City as Entry No. 024885.<br><br>The planned buy-bust operation was coordinated with the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (<i>PDEA</i>), Regional Office 6. A pre-operation report and coordination form were likewise issued. Details of the operation were planned at a short briefing in the office of the Intelligence Section of the PNP-Silay City. The members of the buy-bust operation team were PO2 Reynaldo Bernil, Jr. (<i>PO2 Bernil</i>), PO2 Ian Libo-on (<i>PO2 Libo-on</i>), and a number of civilian agents of the police unit, with PO2 Bernil as the lead police officer.<br><br>The marked bills were given by PO2 Bernil to the confidential asset, who was to act as the poseur-buyer. The poseur-buyer proceeded to Burgos Street, Barangay Rizal, Silay City, ahead of the other members of the buy足 bust team, to meet accused-appellant. The poseur-buyer was instructed to immediately call PO2 Bernil the moment he saw accused-appellant at the said place. Shortly after the poseur-buyer made the call that he had already seen accused-appellant in the area, the other members of the buy-bust team proceeded there. They positioned themselves a few meters away from where the poseur-buyer was, such that their presence would not be noticed by accused-appellant but sufficient for them to clearly see him and the poseur-buyer.<br><br>The poseur-buyer approached a person seated in a tricycle parked on the street. Since the farmer was a previous customer of accused-appellant, Palaras did not become suspicious. The poseur-buyer took out tram this pocket the marked bills and handed them to accused-appellant, who readily received the bills and placed them in his pocket. Accused-appellant, thereafter, took something from his pocket and gave it to the poseur-buyer. As they parted ways, the poseur-buyer gave the pre-arranged signal that the sale had already been consummated by placing his right hand on top of his head. The other members of the buy-bust team, specifically PO2 Bernil, SPO1 Rayjay Rebadomia (<i>SPO1 Rebadomia</i>), and PO2 Libo-on, hurriedly proceeded towards accused-appellant who, upon noticing the approaching police officers, attempted to escape but was promptly apprehended.<br><br>PO2 Bernil searched the body of accused-appellant and recovered from the left pocket of his pants the marked bills, as well as four (4) small heat-sealed transparent plastic sachets containing white crystalline substances. PO2 Bernil handed these transparent plastic sachets to PO2 Libo-on, who marked them as "BIT2," "BIT3," "BIT4," and "BIT5," respectively.<br><br>On the other hand, the poseur-buyer handed to PO2 Bernil a small heat-sealed transparent plastic sachet containing a crystalline substance which the former received from accused-appellant. PO2 Bernil, in turn, handed it to PO2 Libo-on which the latter marked as "BIT1," the buy-bust item.<br><br>Accused-appellant and the items recovered from him were then brought to the police station of the PNP-Silay City. An inventory was made of the seized items from accused-appellant which he signed. The said inventory was witnessed by, among others: Councilor Ireneo Celis, media representative Ed Gumban, Kagawad Noel Lacson, and DOJ representative Danilo Tumlos.<br><br>Thereafter, the marked plastic sachets were brought to the PNP Crime Laboratory NOPPO at Bacolod City, for laboratory examination.<br><br>Chemistry Report No. D-049-2012<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> was issued by Police Inspector Hernand Gutierrez Donado, a forensic chemist, showed that "BIT1" had a net weight of 0.2 gram, and "BIT2," "BIT3," "BIT4," and "BIT5" had a net weight of 0.01 gram each, with an aggregate weight of 0.06 gram. Said report found that all the aforementioned specimen tested "positive" for methamphetamine hydrochloride (<i>shabu</i>), a dangerous drug.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br><b><i>Version of the Defense</i></b><br><br>Accused-appellant testified that on 22 February 2012, at around 4:00 P.M., he was inside a private tricycle at Kahilwayan, Brgy. 2, Silay City. While he was conversing with his friends, two armed men in civilian clothes approached him, aimed a gun at him, and handcuffed him. He resisted and asked them why he was being arrested as he had done nothing wrong. No answer was given and he was forcibly held in front of the jeep. To his surprise, one of the police officers inserted his hand on accused足 appellant's pocket and eventually made a search. Accused-appellant resisted the body search as his pockets had holes in them; however, the police authorities persisted.<br><br>Accused-appellant further testified that during the search, a Tanduay Rum bottle cap dropped to the ground, but he had no idea where it came from. Subsequently, he was made to board a green multicab and taken to the police station. At the station, he saw a small transparent plastic sachet on the table and was astounded when police authorities told him that the transparent sachet was found inside the bottle cap, evidence that he was in possession of an illegal drug. He further testified that a photographer arrived and took the P250.00 from his pocket and placed it on the table. Photographs were taken and accused-appellant was forced to sign the certificate of inventory being informed by the authorities that another case would be filed against him if he refused to sign the document.<br><br>Jenny Casiano, accused-appellant's niece, claimed that on 22 February 2012, a neighbor called her while she was at home watching TV. She ran outside and there she saw her uncle, accused-appellant, being held forcefully by the police officers. Accused-appellant asked for her help. Jenny narrated that she was dragged by the police officers away from her uncle.<br><br>Jenny also claimed that while her uncle was being handcuffed, a bottle cap was inse1ted by PO2 Bernil into her uncle's pocket. She observed that the bottle cap contained a small transparent sachet which fell to the floor and which PO2 Bernil picked up. After the body search, the crowd applauded as the seized items were seen to have been purposely placed in accused足-appellant's pocket. Jenny did not go with her uncle when the latter was brought to the police station, but she immediately reported the incident to her father.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br><b><i>The RTC Ruling</i></b><br><br>The RTC convicted accused-appellant for violation of Section 5 and Section 11, Article II, of R.A.

However, the prosecution did not present the poseur-buyer during the trial to describe the said transaction. The records also show that it was PO2 Bernil who was tasked to monitor the movements of accused足-appellant and the poseur-buyer and was positioned the closest to the subject transaction, but he was located ten (10) meters away from the transaction, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td colspan="2"><div align="justify">(to SPO1 Rebadomia)</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q. </div></td><td><div align="justify">What happened there?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A. <u><strong></strong></u></div></td><td><div align="justify"><u><strong>Our poseur-buyer went ahead of us and it was PO2 Bernil who will monitor the actions of our poseur-buyer while I and PO2 Libo-on will wait for the signal of PO2 Bernil.</strong></u></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q. </div></td><td><div align="justify">How far were you from the subject person?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A. </div></td><td><div align="justify">I was about 20 meters from the subject person because I was waiting [sic] the signal of PO2 Bernil.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> (emphasis and underscoring supplied)</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td colspan="2"><div align="justify">x x x x</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td colspan="2"><div align="justify">(to PO2 Bernil)</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q. </div></td><td><div align="justify">Were you able to have a meeting?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A. </div></td><td><div align="justify">Yes.

Amin</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> this Court did not deem as eyewitness account the testimony of the prosecution witnesses who were ten (10) meters away from the transaction. Similarly, in <i>People v. Guzon</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> a police officer who admitted that he was seven (7) to eight (8) meters away from the actual transaction was not considered an eyewitness to the crime.<br><br>Notably, also, PO2 Bernil testified that accused-appellant was inside a tricycle when the transaction took place and it was not established that he was still able to clearly see the acts of both the poseur-buyer and accused-appellant despite the latter's position and the cover afforded by the tricycle.<br><br>It can also be gleaned from the foregoing testimonies that the members of the buy-bust team primarily relied on the pre-arranged signal in order to effect the arrest.<br><br>In <i>People v. Andaya</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> the Court ruled that "the reliance on the supposed signal to establish the consummation of the transaction between the poseur-buyer and Andaya was unwarranted because the unmitigatedly hearsay character of the signal rendered it entirely bereft of trustworthiness. The arresting members of the buy-bust team interpreted the signal from the anonymous poseur-buyer as sign of the consummation of the transaction. Their interpretation, being necessarily subjective without the testimony of the poseur-buyer, unfairly threatened the liberty of Andaya."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Consequently, the non-presentation of the poseur-buyer in this case is fatal to the prosecution's case. Without an eyewitness account to the illegal sale, the evidence of the prosecution does not satisfy the quantum of proof necessary for accused-appellant's conviction.<br><br>Since the poseur-buyer was not presented to testify on the details of the subject transaction, the act of accused-appellant as witnessed by the members of the buy-bust team cannot, therefore, be limited to illegal sale of drugs. It was capable of multiple explanations. It is a well-established rule that "if the inculpatory facts and circumstances are capable of two or more interpretations, one of which being consistent with the innocence of the accused and the other or others consistent with his guilt, then the evidence in view of the constitutional presumption of innocence has not fulfilled the test of moral certainty and is thus insufficient to support a conviction."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>On accused-appellant's conviction for illegal possession of <i>shabu</i>, this Court is also constrained to reverse the same.<br><br>A conviction for illegal possession of dangerous drugs requires the prosecution to establish the following: (1) that the accused was in possession of dangerous drugs; (2) that such possession was not authorized by law; and (3) that the accused was freely and consciously aware of being in possession of dangerous drugs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>The seizure of the items marked as "BIT2," "BIT3," "BIT4," and "BIT5" was made after a warrantless search on accused-appellant incidental to his arrest based on the buy-bust operation. However, as discussed earlier, since the sale transaction was not sufficiently established and no crime for the sale of illegal drugs could be attributed to accused-appellant, then there could have been no basis for the warrantless search. Any item it yielded could not, therefore, be used as evidence against the accused-appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>More importantly, accused-appellant's possession of the drugs was premised on his sale thereof. There is no showing that the prosecution independently established illegal possession through testimony or other evidence, aside from merely linking it to the illegal sale. Since the sale was not duly proven, then it cannot be said that the third element of the crime - that accused-appellant freely and consciously possessed the drug - was sufficiently established. Thus, proof beyond reasonable doubt of accused-appellant's possession of illegal drugs is wanting.<br><br>It is also worth noting that the buy-bust team had conducted a surveillance and monitoring operation on accused-appellant prior to the buy足 bust operation, and that a test-buy operation was in fact made months before the actual buy-bust operation, where a laboratory examination on the bought item yielded positive for <i>shabu</i>. There was thus enough time and reason for the team to secure a search warrant on accused-appellant, and it is curious why they did not.<br><br>In view of the foregoing, it is no longer necessary to discuss other issues raised by both parties.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court <b>REVERSES</b> and <b>SETS ASIDE</b> the Court of Appeals Decision, dated 29 January 2015, in CA-G.R.
