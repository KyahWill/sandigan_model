It has the effect and authority of <i>res judicata</i>, although <b>no execution may issue until it would have received the corresponding approval of the court where the litigation pends and its compliance with the terms of the agreement is thereupon decreed</b>. x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Before approving a compromise, courts are thus bound to strictly scrutinize the same to ensure that the compromise <i>and</i> its execution are compliant with the law and consistent with procedural rules.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>The Court finds that the RTC failed to exercise the degree of scrutiny required by law and jurisprudence when it ordered the immediate execution of the Compromise Agreement. Consequently, the CA erred when it dismissed the Republic's petition for <i>certiorari</i> and affirmed the July 2011 Omnibus Order and November 2011 Order issued by the RTC.<br><br>To recall, the Compromise Agreement divides the Republic's <b>entire remaining balance</b> between and among the defendants, in accordance with the terms agreed upon by the Oliquino and Agalabia groups. <b>The allocation of the remaining balance was determined <u>without</u> the participation of all other claimants who likewise stand as parties to the Interpleader.</b><br><br>The relevant terms of the Compromise Agreement read:<br><blockquote><b>The parties, particularly, [the Agalabia group], [the Oliquino group]</b>, x x x <b>entered into a COMPROMISE AGREEMENT</b> dated March 24, 2011 hereunder quoted to read as follows:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>WHEREAS, x x x <b>the above-listed parties, being the present immediate relatives of the late [Eligio Cruz]</b>, who were impleaded as defendants or have filed for intervention in [the Interpleader], <b>have agreed to settle the proceeds of the remaining portions amoul1lting to Php31,821,760.87</b>.<br><br>NOW THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the above premises, the following are hereby stipulated:<br><br>GROUP I<br><ol><li>The [h]eirs of Emilia Cruz represented by Maximino C.

Said amount to be equally shared by them.<br><br>&nbsp;2.4 BELEN CRUZ SINGH and MA. LOURDES CRUZ shall receive the amount of [ONE MILLION FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY SIX THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED SIXTY SIX AND 67/100] (Php1,466,666.67).

Borja of the opportunity to establish their entitlement, if any, to compensation beyond the amounts unilaterally set by the Oliquino and Agalabia groups. This defeats the very purpose for which the Republic's Interpleader had been filed, as it opens the portals to protracted litigation not only among the opposing claimants, but also between said claimants and the Republic.<br><br>The Court's ruling in <i>Armed Forces of the Philippines Mutual Benefit Association, Inc. v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> lends guidance:<br><blockquote>Adjective law governing judicial compromises annunciate that once approved by the court, a judicial compromise is not appealable and it thereby becomes immediately executory but <b>this rule must be understood to refer and apply only to those who are bound by the compromise and, <u>on the assumption that they are the only parties to the case</u></b>, the litigation comes to an end except only as regards to its compliance and the fulfillment by the parties of their respective obligations thereunder. x x x<br><br><b>Where there are, along with the parties to the compromise, other persons involved in the litigation who have not taken part in concluding the compromise agreement but are adversely affected or feel prejudiced thereby, should not be precluded from invoking in the same proceedings an adequate relief therefor.</b> A motion to set aside the judgment to the extent he might feel aggrieved, or might justifiably fear to be at risk by acquiescence unless timely invoked, is such a remedy. A denial of the motion to set aside the judgment on the compromise agreement opens the door for its possible elevation to a higher court. If the motion is denied, he may, considering the special finality feature of the compromise judgment, <i>albeit</i> partial, and its susceptibility to execution, take an appeal from the order of denial under Rule 45 or even, when circumstances particularly warrant, the extraordinary remedy prescribed in Rule 65, of the Rules of Court. That appeal notwithstanding, the main case still subsists allowing him to have continued <i>locus standi</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>By affirming the July 2011 Omnibus Order and November 2011 Order, the CA erroneously exposed the Republic to the very risk against which it sought protection through its Interpleader.<br><br>The risk of protracted litigation becomes even more apparent in light of the letter-communication dated February 19, 2013 sent by Rodolfo M. Ordanes (OIC Ordanes), Officer-in-Charge of the Quezon City Assessor's Office to Atty. Carlo Alcantara, Register of Deeds of Quezon City, a copy of which had been appended<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> to the Republic's Petition. Thereunder, OIC Ordanes makes the following certification which casts doubt on the Oliquino and Agalabia groups' claim of ownership:<br><blockquote>x x x <b>Prior to the death of Eligio Cruz</b> on April 19, 1983, i.e., from 1950 to [the] present, <b>all derivative lots of Lot 643 had already been sold and undergone several changes/transfer of names or ownerships (sic) and <u>nothing was left to Eligio Cruz</u></b>.
