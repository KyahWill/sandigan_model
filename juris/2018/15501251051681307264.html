She said that Fernandez was hired because their biological mother lived separately, and nobody took care of them when their father was at work.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Eventually, Fernandez cohabited with the two (2) children and their father. In the beginning, the relationship was harmonious. However, after some time, Fernandez started inflicting abuse on AAA and BBB.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>During breakfast on November 11, 2011, BBB said that Fernandez pinched her stomach, crimped her ears with pliers, and hit her back with a bamboo stick, causing her to vomit blood. Fernandez also ordered her to lie down, then kicked her in the stomach, and hit her eyes with rubber slippers. Fernandez then dragged her by the hair and spun her around like a helicopter.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>On a previous occasion, Fernandez scalded BBB with a cooking pot.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>AAA and BBB's father was often not around because he was a driver. Whenever their father saw the marks, BBB said that Fernandez would force her to lie.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>AAA also testified that Fernandez beat him and his older sister. He recounted that Fernandez clipped, pulled, and rotated his right ear with rusty pliers after he spilled rice by accident. Fernandez also forbade them to cry so he just wiped the blood off his ear with a handkerchief. She also banged his head on the floor several times, and hit him on the nape and back with a broom until the broom broke.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>After the incident, BBB said that Fernandez prohibited her from going to school for a week. On the day she went back to school, her teacher, Malabanan, saw that she had several contusions and marks on her body. Malabanan also noticed that her black eye was very prominent, prompting him to ask her about what happened.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Initially, BBB refused to answer his questions, but upon prodding, she disclosed that her stepmother hit her as well as her brother, AAA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Malabanan brought the matter to the principal, who in turn called in a barangay councilor. They then talked to a representative from the Department of Social Welfare and Development.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>The defense presented Fernandez as its sole witness.

It ruled that the testimonies of the two (2) minor victims were consistent, candid, spontaneous, and credible. The medical certificates and photographs of the injuries sustained also supported their testimonies. The Regional Trial Court rejected Fernandez's defense that AAA and BBB sustained injuries through a physical fight. It found her defense self-serving and not in accord with human experience.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>The dispositive portion of the Regional Trial Court April 18, 2013 Joint Decision read:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the prosecution having proven the guilt of accused CHRISTINE M.

It adds that the inconsistencies petitioner pointed out are trivial as they concern inconsequential matters that do not change the fact that she physically abused the children.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> It says that in any case, courts expect minor inconsistencies when a child-victim narrates the details of a traumatic experience. Respondent elaborates that inconsistencies on minor details are, in fact, badges of truth and candidness, and that the testimonies of AAA and BBB were unrehearsed.<br><br>The sole issue in this case is whether or not the Court of Appeals committed reversible error in affirming petitioner's conviction for two (2) counts of violation of Section 10(a) of Republic Act No. 7610.<br><br>The Petition is denied.<br><br>The prosecution proved beyond reasonable doubt that petitioner violated Republic Act No. 7610, or the Special Protection of Children Against Child Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act.<br><br>Under Article I, Section 3 of the law, child abuse may be committed through the following:<br><blockquote>Section 3.

The Regional Trial Court's "evaluation of the facts and evidence is utterly sufficient in substance to support [petitioner's] conviction."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Petitioner points out that AAA's and BBB's testimonies are inconsistent.<br><blockquote>AAA testified:<br><br>Q: Ano pa?<br><br>A: Kinurot po ako sa singit at pinalo ng <b><i>walis tambo</i></b> nabale pa nga po eh.<br><br>....<br><br><b><i>Q: At sabi mo, yong walis tambo binale niya, paano niya binale sa iyo?<br><br></i></b><b><i>A: Ipinalo niya po sa akin.</i></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>On the other hand, BBB testified:<br><blockquote>Q: Ang sabi mo, nandoon yung kapatid mo. Ano ang ginagawa niya habang nakikita niya na <b><i>pinaplais</i></b> ni Christine ang tenga mo, tinutusok ka ng <b><i>kawayan</i></b> sa tiyan at pinapalo ka ng kawayan sa likod habang ikaw ay kumakain?<br><br>A: Katabi ko po siya at kumakain din.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Petitioner argues that both of the witnesses' narrations contain the use of objects such as <i>plais, kawayan</i>, and <i>walis tambo</i>, which are contrary to human experience, and strengthen the suspicion that they were coached.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>This Court finds that petitioner's argument lacks merit, and agrees with the findings of the Court of Appeals September 29, 2014 Decision, which states:<br><blockquote>From our own careful examination of the records, we are convinced that there is no reason to disturb the assessment and determination of the private complainants' credibility by the trial court. The straightforward, candid[,] and intrepid revelation in coming forward to avenge the physical abuses upon them is more convincing and plausible compared to the weak and uncorroborated defense of appellant. Despite the minor inconsistencies in their testimonies, their general statements remained consistent throughout the trial as they recounted the sordid details of their tormenting experience in the hands of appellant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br></blockquote>The Court of Appeals further ruled:<br><blockquote>AAA and BBB remained consistent all throughout the trial as they recounted the sordid details of [the] tormenting experience they suffered. They likewise identified the photographs depicting the injuries they suffered in the hands of the appellant and which was corroborated by their respective Medical Certificates. Where a minor-victim's testimony is corroborated by the physical findings of cruelty, like in this case, there is sufficient basis for concluding that the minor-complainant was telling the truth. Physical evidence is of the highest order and speaks more eloquently than all witnesses put together.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br></blockquote>Trial courts at first instance determine the credibility of witnesses. Generally, their findings and conclusions on this matter are given great weight.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> These findings should not be disturbed on appeal, unless facts that were overlooked or misinterpreted would materially affect the disposition of the case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Thus, in <i>People v. De Los Santos</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><blockquote>Basic is the rule that the matter of assigning values to declarations on the witness stand is best and most competently performed by the trial judge, who had the unmatched opportunity to observe the witnesses and to assess their credibility by the various <i>indicia</i> available but not reflected on the record. Hence, the corollary principle that absent any showing that the trial court overlooked substantial facts and circumstances that would affect the final disposition of the case, appellate courts are bound to give due deference and respect to its evaluation of the credibility of an eyewitness and his testimony as well as its probative value amidst the rest of the other evidence on record.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br></blockquote>A perusal of the records shows that there is no clear reason to disturb the factual findings of the Regional Trial Court. AAA's and BBB's testimonies were clear, positive, and direct. The Regional Trial Court judge's assessment of the witnesses' credibility is given great weight and respect, especially on appeal, since he or she had the advantage of actually examining both object and testimonial evidence, including the demeanors of the witnesses.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>In <i>Sanchez v. People, et al.</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> this Court upheld the conviction of the accused for child abuse through physical violence based on the witnesses' testimonies. The Decision read:<br><blockquote>Appellant could only proffer the defense of denial. Notably, the RTC found VVV and MMM to be credible witnesses, whose testimonies deserve full credence. It bears stressing that full weight and respect are usually accorded by the appellate court to the findings of the trial court on the credibility of witnesses, since the trial judge had the opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witnesses. Equally noteworthy is the fact that the CA did not disturb the RTC's appreciation of the witnesses' credibility. Thus, we apply the cardinal rule that factual findings of the trial court, its calibration of the testimonies of the witnesses, and its conclusions anchored on such findings, are accorded respect, if not conclusive effect, especially when affirmed by the CA. The exception is when it is established that the trial court ignored, overlooked, misconstrued, or misinterpreted cogent facts and circumstances which, if considered, will change the outcome of the case. We have reviewed the records of the RTC and the CA and we find no reason to deviate from the findings of both courts and their uniform conclusion that appellant is indeed guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the offense of Other Acts of Child Abuse.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br></blockquote>Moreover, courts expect minor inconsistencies when a child-victim narrates the details of a harrowing experience, especially when the details are too painful to recall. Such inconsistencies only prove that the child­ victim was unrehearsed, especially when the discrepancies are minor details irrelevant to the elements of the crime, and thus, cannot be considered as grounds for acquittal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>Here, AAA's and BBB's testimonies sufficiently established that petitioner committed physical violence against the minors. They validated their testimonies with properly identified photos depicting the injuries they had suffered from petitioner, further corroborated by their medical certificates. Thus, there is sufficient basis to conclude that they were telling the truth.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>The courts must stay true to its mandate of protecting the welfare of children. In <i>Araneta v. People</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> this Court emphasized:<br><blockquote>Republic Act No. 7610 is a measure geared towards the implementation of a national comprehensive program for the survival of the most vulnerable members of the population, the Filipino children, in keeping with the Constitutional mandate under Article XV, Section 3, paragraph 2, that "The State shall defend the right of the children to assistance, including proper care and nutrition, and special protection from all forms of neglect, abuse, cruelty, exploitation, and other conditions prejudicial to their development." This piece of legislation supplies the inadequacies of existing laws treating crimes committed against children, namely, the Revised Penal Code and Presidential Decree No. 603 or the Child and Youth Welfare Code. As a statute that provides for a mechanism for strong deterrence against the commission of child abuse and exploitation, the law has stiffer penalties for their commission, and a means by which child traffickers could easily be prosecuted and penalized. Also, the definition of child abuse is expanded to encompass not only those specific acts of child abuse under existing laws but includes also "other acts of neglect, abuse, cruelty or exploitation and other conditions prejudicial to the child's development[."]<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br></blockquote>However, the Court of Appeals noted that the Regional Trial Court imposed the penalty for only one (1) count; thus, it modified the ruling, increasing it to two (2) counts of violation of Section 10(a) of Republic Act No. 7610.<br><br>Under current jurisprudence, an annual 6% interest rate should be imposed on all damages awarded from the date of judgment until fully paid.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court of Appeals September 29, 2014 Decision and March 11, 2015 Resolution in CA-G.R.
