CV No. 107678, which affirmed the Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> dated February 22, 2016 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Caloocan City, Branch 126 (RTC-Br. 126) in Civil Case No. C-22988, dismissing the complaint filed by petitioner Ma. Victoria M. Galang (Galang) for annulment of deed of real estate mortgage and foreclosure proceedings on the ground of forum shopping.<br><br><center><b>The Facts</b></center><br><br>This case stemmed from a complaint for annulment of deed of real estate mortgage and foreclosure proceedings<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> filed by Galang against respondent Peakhold Finance Corporation (Peakhold) before the RTC of Caloocan City, Branch 123 (RTC-Br. 123), docketed as Civil Case No. C-22988 <b>(Annulment Case)</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Essentially, the complaint alleged that: <i>(a)</i> Galang is the registered owner of a 150-square meter (sq. m.) lot located at Deparo, Caloocan City, and covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 327548 (subject lot); <i>(b)</i> the subject lot was mortgaged to Peakhold without her knowledge and consent; <i>(c)</i> Peakhold foreclosed the subject lot, and eventually, acquired the same via an auction sale; and <i>(d)</i> as such, the mortgage must be annulled as her signature in the mortgage document was forged/falsified.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>While the <b>Annulment Case</b> was pending, Peakhold filed an <i>Ex-Parte </i>Petition for Issuance of Writ of Possession <i>(Ex-Parte </i>Petition)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> over the subject lot, before the RTC of Caloocan City, Branch 122 (RTC-Br. 122), docketed as LRC Case No. C-6032, to which Galang filed her opposition<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> on June 11, 2012. In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> dated November 27, 2012, the RTC-Br. 122 granted Peakhold's <i>Ex-Parte </i>Petition, noted Galang's opposition,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> and ordered the issuance of a writ of possession in favor of Peakhold.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Initially, Galang filed a motion for extension of time to file a petition for review<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> before the CA, docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 128171.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Further, Galang filed a Petition for Relief from Judgment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> before the RTC-Br. 122 <b>(Petition for Relief Case)</b> on February 11, 2013, contending that the <i>Ex-Parte </i>Petition is not summary in nature and should have been threshed out in an adversarial proceeding, as it essentially deals with the validity of the subject deed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> After filing the <b>Petition for Relief Case,</b> Galang manifested that he is withdrawing the filing of the intended petition for review before the CA, which was granted on April 24, 2013.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Thus, on May 7, 2013, Peakhold, through a Motion to Dismiss,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> sought the dismissal of the <b>Petition for Relief Case</b> on the ground of forum shopping. In a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> dated September 2, 2013, the RTC-Br. 122 granted the said motion, holding that Galang deliberately failed to mention in her Petition for Relief from Judgment that she likewise filed a petition for review before the CA, which had not been effectively withdrawn at the time the Petition for Relief Case was filed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> With the subsequent denial<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> of the motion for reconsideration,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Galang elevated the matter to the CA via a petition for <i>certiorari </i>and <i>mandamus,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> docketed as CA-G.R.

In response, Peakhold moved to dismiss<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> the <b>Annulment Case</b> on the ground of, <i>inter alia, </i>forum shopping, since the Amended Complaint failed to disclose that Galang has a pending <b><i>Certiorari </i>Case</b> before the CA, as well as a complaint for qualified theft (Criminal Complaint)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> against the President of Peakhold and a certain Jocelyn "Gigi" Cortina-Donasco (Donasco) before the Office of the City Prosecutor of Caloocan City (OCP Caloocan).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br><center><b>The RTC-Br. 126 Ruling</b></center><br><br>Initially, the RTC-Br. 126 issued an Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> dated October 12, 2015, denying Peakhold's motion to dismiss. It found that the causes of actions and reliefs prayed for in the <b>Annulment</b> and <b><i>Certiorari </i>Cases</b> are different from those in the <b>Criminal Complaint</b>. It further held that, assuming that the Order dismissing the <b>Petition for Relief Case</b> is reversed, there is still no violation of the rule against forum shopping, since the prayers/reliefs in the Annulment Case are different from those in the <b>Petition for Relief Case.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>On reconsideration,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> however, the RTC-Br. 126 issued an Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> dated February 22, 2016, finding Galang guilty of forum shopping, considering that the P<b>etition for Relief Case,</b> together with the <b>Annulment</b> and <b><i>Certiorari</i> Cases,</b> all have a common cause of action/relief – that is the reconveyance of the subject lot to Galang.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Aggrieved, Galang moved for reconsideration,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> but the same was denied in an Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> dated June 20, 2016; hence, the appeal<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> before the CA, docketed as CA-G.R. CV No. 107678.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br><center><b>The CA Ruling</b></center><br><br>In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> dated April 21, 2017, the CA affirmed the RTC-Br. 126 ruling. It held that Galang is guilty of forum shopping as she failed to indicate the pendency of the <b><i>Certiorari</i> Case</b> before the CA, as well as the <b>Criminal Complaint</b> before the OCP Caloocan in her Amended Complaint in the <b>Annulment Case.</b> More significantly, it noticed that there is identity of parties, rights asserted/causes of action, and reliefs prayed for among the aforesaid cases.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Dissatisfied, Galang sought reconsideration<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> thereof, which was denied in a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> dated August 29, 2017; hence, the instant petition.<br><br>In the interim, the CA issued a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> dated September 23, 2015, dismissing the <b><i>Certiorari</i> Case</b> for lack of merit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> While it found Galang not to have committed forum shopping – since the supposed filing of the petition for review, <i>i.e., </i>CA-G.R. SP No. 128171, was simply filed out of oversight – it nevertheless sustained the RTC-Br. 122's dismissal of the <b>Petition for Relief Case,</b> given that petitioner failed to establish the existence of extrinsic fraud, as in fact, she was able to file her comment and had her day in court. In any event, it could not rule upon the existence of forum shopping, as the petition for review, being the basis of the forum shopping allegation, had already been expunged by the CA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Galang also moved for its reconsideration,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> but the same was denied in a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> dated August 23, 2016.<br><br><center><b>The Issue Before the Court</b></center><br><br>The core issue for the Court's resolution is whether or not the CA erred in finding that Galang committed forum shopping when she failed to declare the pending <b><i>Certiorari</i> Case</b> and <b>Criminal Complaint</b> in her Amended Complaint in the <b>Annulment Case.</b><br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b></center><br><br>The petition is meritorious.<br><br>Forum shopping is the act of a litigant who repetitively availed of several judicial remedies in different courts, simultaneously or successively, all substantially founded on the same transactions and the same essential facts and circumstances, and all raising substantially the same issues, either pending in or already resolved by some other court, to increase the chances of obtaining a favorable decision if not in one court, then in another.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> It can be committed in three (3) ways: (1) by filing multiple cases based on the same cause of action and with the same prayer, the previous case not having been resolved yet (where the ground for dismissal is <i>litis pendentia); </i>(2) by filing multiple cases based on the same cause of action and with the same prayer, the previous case having been finally resolved (where the ground for dismissal is <i>res judicata); </i>and (3) by filing multiple cases based on the same cause of action but with different prayers (splitting of causes of action, where the ground for dismissal is also either <i>litis pendentia </i>or <i>res judicata</i>).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>Thus, to determine whether a party violated the rule against forum shopping, it is essential to ask whether a final judgment in one case will amount to <i>res judicata </i>in another or whether the following elements of <i>litis pendentia </i>are present: <i>(a) </i>identity of parties, or at least such parties as representing the same interests in both actions; <i>(b)</i> identity of rights asserted and reliefs prayed for, the relief being founded on the same facts; and <i>(c)</i> the identity of the two (2) preceding particulars, such that any judgment rendered in the other action will, regardless of which party is successful, amount to <i>res judicata </i>in the action under consideration.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>In this instance, Galang filed a total of four (4) cases, namely:<br><br><i>(a)</i> the <b>Annulment Case</b> seeking to annul the allegedly fraudulent mortgage document involving the subject lot;<br><br><i>(b)</i> the <b>Petition for Relief Case</b> seeking to set aside the <i>ex-parte </i>writ of possession issued in Peakhold's favor;<br><br><i>(c)</i> the <b><i>Certiorari </i>Case</b> imputing grave abuse of discretion on the part of RTC-Br. 122 in dismissing the <b>Petition for Relief Case</b> on the ground of forum shopping; and<br><br><i>(d)</i> the <b>Criminal Complaint</b> seeking to indict the President of Peakhold and Donasco for the crime of Qualified Theft.<br><br>A judicious perusal of the records reveals that there is no identity of causes of actions and reliefs prayed for among the said cases. As already adverted to, the <b>Annulment Case</b> seeks to nullify the mortgage document executed in Peakhold's favor, as well as the subsequent foreclosure proceedings, given that the alleged real estate mortgage covering the subject lot was void for having been executed without Galang's knowledge and consent. In the <b>Petition for Relief Case,</b> Galang sought to set aside the <i>ex­ parte </i>writ of possession, contending that the same should have been threshed out in an adversarial proceeding, since it involves a fictitious deed of real estate mortgage, where the mortgagor therein is supposedly an impostor of Galang; while the <b><i>Certiorari </i>Case</b> sought to revive the <b>Petition for Relief Case</b> which was dismissed on the ground of forum shopping. Finally, the <b>Criminal Complaint</b> involves the determination of whether or not there is probable cause to indict the President of Peakhold and Donasco for Qualified Theft.<br><br>Similarly, the issues raised and determined in these cases likewise differ. In the <b>Annulment Case,</b> the issue is whether or not the deed of real estate mortgage is void, thereby entitling Galang to the recovery of the subject lot. In the <b>Petition for Relief Case,</b> the issue is whether or not extrinsic fraud was actually employed by Peakhold during the <i>Ex-Parte </i>Petition proceedings. In the <b><i>Certiorari </i>Case,</b> the issue is whether or not the RTC-Br. 122 acted with grave abuse of discretion when it affirmed the dismissal of Galang's <b>Petition for Relief.</b> Lastly, in the <b>Criminal Complaint,</b> the issue is whether or not there is probable cause to believe that the President of Peakhold and Donasco committed the crime of Qualified Theft and should stand trial therefor.<br><br>Given the above, the Court finds that Galang correctly declared in the Amended Complaint in the <b>Annulment Case</b> that she did not commence any action or proceeding which involves the same causes of actions, reliefs, and issues in any court, tribunal, or agency at the time she filed the said Amended Complaint, or anytime thereafter. In this light, there is no <i>litis pendentia,</i> as the cases essentially involve different causes of actions, reliefs, and issues. Thus, any judgment rendered in one will not necessarily amount to <i>res judicata</i> in the action under consideration. This holds true even if the complaint in the <b>Annulment Case</b> was subsequently amended by Galang. Moreover, the cases also differ in their form and nature, for while a ruling in the <b>Annulment Case</b> may result in the recovery of ownership and possession of the subject lot, a favorable ruling in the other cases will not have the same effect, considering that: <i>(a)</i> the granting of the <b><i>Certiorari</i> Case</b> will lead to the granting of the <b>Petition for Relief Case;</b> <i>(b)</i> a favorable result in the <b>Petition for Relief Case</b> would end up in the conduct of adversarial proceedings before a writ of possession concerning the subject lot may be issued; and <i>(c)</i> the resolution of the <b>Criminal Complaint</b> is only determinative of whether or not the President of Peakhold and/or Donasco should be indicted of the crime of Qualified Theft and stand trial therefor.<br><br>Accordingly, the CA erred in upholding the dismissal of the <b>Annulment Case</b> on the ground of forum shopping. Thus, a revival of the <b>Annulment Case</b> and its remand to RTC-Br. 126 is in order.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petition is <b>GRANTED.</b> The Decision dated April 21, 2017 and the Resolution dated August 29, 2017 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
