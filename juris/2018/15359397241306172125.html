In particular, Banco Filipino alleged that Bangko Sentral and the Monetary Board committed grave abuse of discretion in imposing an additional condition in Resolution No. 1668 requiring it to withdraw its cases and waive all future cases since it was unconstitutional and contrary to public policy. It prayed that a writ of mandamus be issued to compel Bangko Sentral and the Monetary Board to approve and implement its business plan and release its Financial Assistance and Regulatory Reliefs package.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> </p><p> The trial court issued a Notice of Hearing on the prayer for a temporary restraining order on the same day, setting the hearing on October 27, 2010.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></p><p> On October 27, 2010, Bangko Sentral and the Monetary Board filed their Motion to Dismiss Ad Cautelam,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> assailing the Regional Trial Court's jurisdiction over the subject matter and over the persons of Bangko Sentral and the Monetary Board.

SP No. 116627, hence, they can be the subject of separate: petitions; and 3) Since a writ of preliminary injunction was earlier issued, Section 2 (d), Rule VI of the 2009 IRCA requires that the instant petition remain with the undersigned <em>ponente</em> for decision on the merits with dispatch.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> On July 28, 2011, the Court of Appeals rendered its Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> in CA-G.R.

The law explicitly stated that a receiver shall "represent the [insolvent] bank personally or through counsel as he [or she] may retain in all actions or proceedings for or against the institution." Section 29 of the old law states: </p><blockquote> <p> Section 29. Proceedings upon insolvency. — Whenever, upon examination by the head of the appropriate supervising or examining department or his examiners or agents into the condition of any bank or non-bank financial intermediary performing quasi-banking functions, it shall be disclosed that the condition of the same is one of insolvency, or that its continuance in business would involve probable loss to its depositors or creditors, it shall be the duty of the department head concerned forthwith, in writing, to inform the Monetary Board of the facts.

Upon acquiring jurisdiction, the court shall, upon motion by the receiver after due notice, adjudicate disputed claims against the institution, assist the enforcement of individual liabilities of the stockholders, directors and officers, and decide, on other issues as may be material to implement the liquidation plan adopted.

Section 30 of Republic Act No. 7653 directs the receiver of a closed bank to "immediately gather and <em>take charge</em> of all the assets and liabilities of the institution" and "administer the same for the benefit of its creditors."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup> </p><p> The law likewise grants the receiver "the general powers of a receiver under the Revised Rules of Court."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup> Under Rule 59, Section 6 of the Rules of Court, "a receiver shall have the power to bring and defend, in such capacity, actions in his [or her] own name."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup> Thus, Republic Act No. 7653 provides that the receiver shall also "in the name of the institution, and with the assistance of counsel as [it] may retain, institute such actions as may be necessary to collect and recover accounts and assets of, or defend any action against, the institution."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup> Considering that the receiver has the power to take charge of <i>all</i> the assets of the closed bank and to institute for or defend <i>any</i> action against it, only the receiver, in its fiduciary capacity, may sue and be sued on behalf of the closed bank.</p><p> In <i>Balayan Bay Rural Bank v. National Livelihood Development Corporation</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup> this Court explained that a receiver of a closed bank is tasked with the duty to hold the assets and liabilities in trust for the benefit of the bank's creditors.</p><p> As fiduciary of the insolvent bank, Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation conserves and manages the assets of the bank to prevent the assets' dissipation. This includes the power to bring and defend any action that threatens to dissipate the closed bank's assets. <i>Balayan Bay Rural Bank </i>explained that Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation does so, not as the real party-in-interest, but as a representative party, thus: </p><blockquote> <p> As the fiduciary of the properties of a closed bank, the PDIC may prosecute or defend the case by or against the said bank as a representative party while the bank will remain as the real party in interest pursuant to Section 3, Rule 3 of the Revised Rules of Court which provides:</p> <blockquote> <p> SEC. 3. Representatives as parties. — Where the action is allowed to be prosecuted or defended by a representative or someone acting in a fiduciary capacity, the beneficiary shall be included in the title of the case and shall be deemed to be the real party in interest. A representative may be a trustee of an express trust, a guardian, an executor or administrator, or a party authorized by law or these Rules. An agent acting in his own name and for the benefit of an undisclosed principal may sue or be sued without joining the principal except when the contract involves things belonging to the principal.</p> </blockquote> <p> The inclusion of the PDIC as a representative party in the case is therefore grounded on its statutory role as the fiduciary of the closed bank which, under Section 30 of R.A. 7653 (New Central Bank Act), is authorized to conserve the latter's property for the benefit of its creditors.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup> (Citation omitted)</p> </blockquote> <p> For this reason, Republic Act No. 3591,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup> or the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation Charter, as amended,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup> grants Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation the following powers as a receiver: </p><blockquote> <p> (c) In addition to the powers of a receiver pursuant to existing laws, the Corporation is empowered to:</p> <p> (1) bring suits to enforce liabilities to or recoveries of the closed bank;</p> <p> . . . .</p> <p> (6) hire or retain private counsels as may be necessary; </p> <p> . . . .</p> <p> (9) exercise such other powers as are inherent and necessary for the effective discharge of the duties of the Corporation as a receiver.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> <i>Balayan Bay Rural Bank </i>summarized, thus: </p><blockquote> <p> [T]he legal personality of the petitioner bank is not<em> ipso facto</em> dissolved by insolvency; it is not divested of its capacity to sue and be sued after it was ordered by the Monetary Board to cease operation. The law mandated, however, that the action should be brought through its statutory liquidator/receiver which in this case is the PDIC. The authority of the PDIC to represent the insolvent bank in legal actions emanates from the fiduciary relation created by statute which reposed upon the receiver the task of preserving and conserving the properties of the insolvent for the benefit of its creditors.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Petitioner contends that it was not a closed bank at the time of the filing of this Petition on April 10, 2012 since the Court of Appeals January 27, 2012 Decision, docketed as CA-G.R.

This is a fact, however, that petitioner failed to address when it filed its Petition, signifying that petitioner had no intention of complying with the law when it filed its Petition or anytime after.</p><p> It was speculative on petitioner's part to presume that it could file this Petition without joining its receiver on the ground that Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation might not allow the suit. At the very least, petitioner should have shown that it attempted to seek Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation's authorization to file suit. It was possible that Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation could have granted its permission to be joined in the suit. If it had refused to allow petitioner to file its suit, petitioner still had a remedy available to it. Under Rule 3, Section 10 of the Rules of Court,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup> petitioner could have made Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation an unwilling co-petitioner and be joined as a respondent to this case.</p><p> Petitioner's suit concerned its Business Plan, a matter that could have affected the status of its insolvency. Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation's participation would have been necessary, as it had the duty to conserve petitioner's assets and to examine any possible liability that petitioner might undertake under the Business Plan.</p><p> Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation also safeguards the interests of the depositors in all legal proceedings. Most bank depositors are ordinary people who have entrusted their money to banks in the hopes of growing their savings. When banks become insolvent, depositors are secure in the knowledge that they can still recoup some part of their savings through Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[121]</sup> Thus, Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation's participation in all suits involving the insolvent bank is necessary and imbued with the public interest.</p><p> In any case, petitioner's verification and certification of non-forum shopping was signed by its Executive Vice Presidents Maxy S.

As an administrative agency, it is vested with quasi-judicial powers, which it exercises through the Monetary Board. In <i>United Coconut Planters Bank v. E. Ganzon, Inc</i>.:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[129]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> A quasi-judicial agency or body is an organ of government other than a court and other than a legislature, which affects the rights of private parties through either adjudication or rule-making. The very definition of an administrative agency includes its being vested with quasi-judicial powers. The ever increasing variety of powers and functions given to administrative agencies recognizes the need for the active intervention of administrative agencies in matters calling for technical knowledge and speed in countless controversies which cannot possibly be handled by regular courts. A "quasi-judicial function" is a term which applies to the action, discretion, etc., of public administrative officers or bodies, who are required to investigate facts, or ascertain the existence of facts, hold hearings, and draw conclusions from them, as a basis for their official action and to exercise discretion of a judicial nature.</p> <p> Undoubtedly, the BSP Monetary Board is a quasi-judicial agency exercising quasi-judicial powers or functions. As aptly observed by the Court of Appeals, the BSP Monetary Board is an independent central monetary authority and a body corporate with fiscal and administrative autonomy, mandated to provide policy directions in the areas of money, banking and credit. It has power to issue subpoena, to sue for contempt those refusing to obey the subpoena without justifiable reason, to administer oaths and compel presentation of books, records and others, needed in its examination, to impose fines and other sanctions and to issue cease and desist order. Section 37 of Republic Act No. 7653, in particular, explicitly provides that the BSP Monetary Board shall exercise its discretion in determining whether administrative sanctions should be imposed on banks and quasi-banks, which necessarily implies that the BSP Monetary Board must conduct some form of investigation or hearing regarding the same. <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[130]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Bangko Sentral's Monetary Board is a quasi-judicial agency. Its decisions, resolutions, and orders are the decisions, resolutions, and orders of a quasi-judicial agency. Any action filed against the Monetary Board is an action against a quasi-judicial agency.</p><p> This does not mean, however, that Bangko Sentral only exercises quasi-judicial functions. As an administrative agency, it likewise exercises "powers and/or functions which may be characterized as administrative, investigatory, regulatory, quasi-legislative, or quasi-judicial, or a mix of these five, as may be conferred by the Constitution or by statute."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[131]</sup></p><p> In this case, the issue between the parties was whether the trial court had jurisdiction over petitions for certiorari against Bangko Sentral and the Monetary Board. Rule 65, Section 4 of the Rules of Court provides: </p><blockquote> <p> Section 4. Where and when petition to be filed. — The petition shall be filed not later than sixty (60) days from notice of the judgment, order or resolution. In case a motion for reconsideration or new trial is timely filed, whether such motion is required or not, the sixty (60) day period shall be counted from notice of the denial of said motion.</p> <p> The petition shall be filed in the Supreme Court or, if it relates to the acts or omissions of a lower court or of a corporation, board, officer or person, in the Regional Trial Court exercising jurisdiction over the territorial area as defined by the Supreme Court. It may also be filed in the Court of Appeals whether or not the same is in aid of its appellate jurisdiction, or in the Sandiganbayan if it is in aid of its appellate jurisdiction. <i>If it involves the acts or omissions of a quasi-judicial agency, unless otherwise provided by law or these Rules, the petition shall be filed in and cognizable only by the Court of Appeals</i>. (Emphasis supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> The Rules of Court categorically provide that petitions for certiorari involving acts or omissions of a quasi-judicial agency "shall be filed in and cognizable only by the Court of Appeals."</p><p> As previously discussed, respondent Bangko Sentral exercises a myriad of functions, including those that may not be necessarily exercised by a quasi-judicial agency. It is settled, however, that it exercises its quasi­ judicial functions through respondent Monetary Board. Any petition for certiorari against an act or omission of Bangko Sentral, when it acts through the Monetary Board, must be filed with the Court of Appeals. Thus, this Court in <i>Vivas v. Monetary Board and Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[132]</sup> held that the proper remedy to question a resolution of the Monetary Board is through a petition for certiorari filed with the Court of Appeals.</p><p> The Court of Appeals, therefore, did not err in dismissing the case before the Regional Trial Court since the trial court did not have jurisdiction over the Petition for Certiorari filed by petitioner against respondents. </p><p> This Court cannot subscribe to petitioner's contention that a Court of Appeals decision already provided for an exception to Rule 65. A Court of Appeals decision, no matter how persuasive or well written, does not function as <em>stare decisis.</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[133]</sup> Neither can a Court of Appeals decision amend the Rules of Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[134]</sup> As it stands, Rule 65 and jurisprudence hold that petitions for certiorari against the Monetary Board must be filed with the Court of Appeals. </p><p align="center"> <b>III</b> </p><p> While this Petition is considered dismissed, this Court takes the opportunity to address other lingering procedural issues raised by the parties in their pleadings.</p><p> Petitioner assails respondents' failure to file a motion for reconsideration of the trial court's denial of its motion to dismiss before filing a petition for certiorari with the Court of Appeals.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[135]</sup></p><p> Rule 65, Section 1 of the Rules of Court requires that there be "no appeal, or any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law" available before a petition for certiorari can be filed.

However, in <i>Estate of Salvador Serra Serra v. Primitivo Hernaez</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[139]</sup> a case decided after the Rules of Court were revised in 1997: </p><blockquote> <p> The settled rule is that a motion for reconsideration is a sine qua non condition for the filing of a petition for certiorari.

In the instant case, the plain and adequate remedy expressly provided by [Sec. 9, Rule X, New Rules of the National Labor Relations Commission] was a motion for reconsideration of the assailed decision, based on palpable or patent errors, to be made under oath and filed within ten (10) calendar days from receipt of the questioned decision.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[144]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> <i>Pure Foods Corporation</i>, on the other hand, stated: </p><blockquote> <p> In the present case, the plain and adequate remedy expressly provided by law was a motion for reconsideration of the assailed decision and the resolution thereof, which was not only expected to be but would actually have provided adequate and more speedy remedy than the present petition for certiorari. This remedy was actually sought to be availed of by petitioner when it filed a motion for reconsideration albeit beyond the 10-day reglementary period. For all intents and purposes, petitioner cannot now be heard to say that there was no plain, speedy and adequate remedy available to it and that it must, therefore, be allowed to seek relief by certiorari.
