To warrant dismissal from the service, the misconduct must be grave, serious, important, weighty, momentous, and not trifling. The misconduct must imply wrongful intention and not a mere error of judgment and must also have a direct relation to and be connected with the performance of the public officer's official duties amounting either to maladministration or willful, intentional neglect, or failure to discharge the duties of the office. In order to differentiate <b>gross misconduct</b> from simple misconduct, <b>the elements of corruption, clear intent to violate the law, or flagrant disregard of established rule, must be manifest</b> in the former.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, dishonesty has been defined as the concealment or <b>distortion of truth,</b> which shows lack of integrity or a disposition to defraud, cheat, deceive, or betray, or intent to violate the truth.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Civil Service Commission Resolution No. 06-0538<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> classifies dishonesty in three (3) gradations, namely: serious, less serious or simple. In this case, petitioner was charged with serious dishonesty, which necessarily entails the presence of any of the following circumstances: <i>(a)</i> the dishonest act caused serious damage and grave prejudice to the Government; <i>(b)</i> the respondent gravely abused his authority in order to commit the dishonest act; <i>(c)</i> <b>where the respondent is an accountable officer, the dishonest act directly involves property, accountable forms or money for which he is directly accountable and the respondent shows an intent to commit material gain, graft and corruption;</b> <i>(d)</i> the dishonest act exhibits moral depravity on the part of respondent; <i>(e)</i> the respondent employed fraud and/or falsification of official documents in the commission of the dishonest act related to his/her employment; <i>(f)</i> the dishonest act was committed several times or in various occasions; <i>(g)</i> the dishonest act involves a Civil Service examination irregularity or fake Civil Service eligibility such as, but not limited to impersonation, cheating and use of crib sheets; and <i>(h)</i> other analogous circumstances.<br><br>Dishonesty, like bad faith, is not simply bad judgment or negligence, but a question of intention. In ascertaining the intention of a person charged with dishonesty, consideration must be taken not only of the facts and circumstances giving rise to the act committed by the respondent, but also of his state of mind at the time the offense was committed, the time he might have had at his disposal for the purpose of meditating on the consequences of his act, and the degree of reasoning he could have had at that moment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Both grave misconduct and serious dishonesty, of which petitioner was charged, are classified as <i>grave offenses</i> for which the penalty of dismissal is meted even for first time offenders.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>After a judicious study of the case, the Court finds that the evidence on record sufficiently demonstrate petitioner's culpability for the charges and fully satisfy the standard of substantial evidence, which is defined as such amount of relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion, even if other minds equally reasonable might conceivably opine differently.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br><ol><li><u>With respect to petitioner's excess cellular phone charges aggregating to P25,594.76</u>.</li></ol><br>Office Order No. CLS-001-2005 dated August 25, 2005 issued by petitioner himself set a P10,000.00 cap in the maximum monthly allocation of PCGG Commissioners in the official use of PCGG-issued cellular phones<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> and disallowed the previous practice of justifying any and all amounts in excess thereof, which shall henceforth be paid by the end-user.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> On January 30, 2008, petitioner issued Office Order No. CLS-092-2008 clarifying that the monthly allocation fixed above shall not apply in cases where the official concerned is abroad, on official business, and the charges on text messages and voice calls are made by virtue thereof.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>However, a reading of the complaint in OMB-C-A-09-0611-J shows that petitioner is being charged for excess monthly cellular phone charges for the periods December 27, 2005 to March 26, 2006, April 27 to May 26, 2006, July 27 to September 26, 2006, December 27, 2006 to May 26, 2007, and July 27 to August 26, 2007 for Account No. 38659931/Phone No. 9178589299 and the periods December 11, 2005 to March 10, 2006, April 11 to May 10, 2006, June 11 to August 10, 2006, December 11, 2006 to May 10, 2007, and July 11 to August 10, 2007 for Account No. 26780102/Phone No. 9175775266.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> The charges cover a total of twelve (12) billing periods and clearly, were incurred prior to the issuance of Office Order No. CLS-092-2008 dated January 30, 2008, which, hence, would not apply.<br><br>As aptly pointed out by the CA, petitioner cannot disregard with impunity Office Order No. CLS-001-2005 limiting the use of the PCGG-issued cellular phones, which he himself issued in line with the austerity measures implemented by the government to lessen operating expenses.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Notably, in seven (7) of the 12 billing cycles concerned, the excess usage amounted to between 15.96%<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> and 62.77%<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> over the P10,000.00 cap given for cellular phone usage, rendering such excesses to be expenses that are irregular, or even excessive and extravagant<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[42]</sup></font> under the auspices of COA Circular No. 85-55-A.<br><br>While misconduct generally means wrongful, improper or unlawful conduct motivated by a premeditated, obstinate or intentional purpose, a public officer shall be liable for grave misconduct only when the elements of corruption, clear intent to violate the law or <b>flagrant disregard of established rule are manifest,</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> as in this case. Flagrant disregard of rules has been jurisprudentially demonstrated, among others, in the instances when there had been open defiance of a customary rule; in the repeated voluntary disregard of established rules in the procurement of supplies; in the practice of illegally collecting fees more than what is prescribed for delayed registration of marriages; when several violations or disregard of regulations governing the collection of government funds were committed; and when the employee arrogated unto herself responsibilities that were clearly beyond her given duties. <b>The common denominator in these cases was the employee's propensity to ignore the rules as clearly manifested by his or her actions.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Here, petitioner's flagrant disregard of the rule imposing a P10,000.00 cap on cellular phone usage is readily apparent from his <u>repeated</u> incurrence of irregular, excessive, and/or extravagant cellular phone charges over and above said cap for 7 of the 12 billing periods when excess usages were noted. Likewise, the intent to procure some benefit for himself is manifest from the undisputed fact that said charges have remained unpaid to date<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> despite the clear provisions of Office Order No. CLS-001-2005 that any and all amounts in excess of the said cap shall be paid by the end-user.<br><br>Consequently, the Court finds the CA to have correctly upheld petitioner's administrative liability for Grave Misconduct. However, it was not shown that the incurrence of excess charges involved any act of dishonesty to sustain liability for the charge of Serious Dishonesty.<br><ol start="2"><li><u>With respect to petitioner's failure to remit to the CARP fund through the BOT the P10,350,000.00 remittances from the sequestered corporations that he used as cash advances, which he likewise failed to liquidate</u>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></li></ol><br>Under Section 63<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> of RA 6657, as amended, <b>all</b> amounts derived from the sale of ill-gotten wealth recovered through the PCGG shall accrue to the CARP fund<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> and shall be <b>considered automatically appropriated</b> for such purpose pursuant to Sections 20<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> and 21<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> of EO 229.<br><br>By its very nature, <b>ill-gotten wealth</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> <b>assumes a public character as they supposedly originated from the government itself, and must, perforce, be returned to the public treasury,</b> subject only to the satisfaction of positive claims of certain persons as may be adjudged by competent courts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> <b>Accordingly, the proceeds from the sales thereof should likewise be remitted to the public treasury.</b><br><br>However, despite the express provisions of Section 63 of RA 6657, as amended, petitioner converted the P10,350,000.00 remittances from the sequestered corporations (P9,850,000.00 and P500,000.00 of which were placed in the names of petitioner and IRC Chairman and President Ernesto R. Jalandoni, respectively)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> and the proceeds of the sale of A. Soriano Corporation shares, which formed part of the ill-gotten wealth of former President Ferdinand E. Marcos,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> as his cash advances, and admittedly failed to verify the exact amount of resources made available to him to successfully carry out his tasks.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>While it is acknowledged that the PCGG performs the herculean task of recovering ill-gotten wealth, petitioner failed to show any law, rule, regulation or authority that permits him to utilize receipts from the sale of the aforesaid shares – being classified as ill-gotten wealth – to be channelled for any other purpose than that provided under Section 63 of RA 6657, as amended. His reliance on the Special Provision of the General Appropriations Act for the Fiscal Year 2007<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> is misplaced because the subject cash advances were disbursed to him in the Fiscal Year 2006.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Neither was there any showing that the PCGG had no other funds<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> which may be utilized to serve the purposes for which such cash advances were applied. As aptly pointed out by the CA, receipts from the sale of ill-gotten wealth are not meant to be used for the operation of the PCGG, which is funded from a separate source, <i>i.e.,</i> through the general appropriation allocated by Congress. Thus, it is immaterial whether petitioner utilized the amount for the operational expenses of the PCGG for the achievement of its mandate.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>Moreover, even assuming that petitioner may utilize a portion of the proceeds from the sale of ill-gotten wealth as cash advances, he failed to liquidate the same pursuant to COA Circular No. 97-002, which requires the liquidation of all cash advances at the end of each year and the refund of any unexpended balance to the Cashier/Collecting Officer who will issue the necessary official receipt.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> Notably, in order to excuse himself from complying with the liquidation procedure under COA Circular No. 97-002, petitioner claimed that he used the receipts from the sale of ill-gotten wealth in replacement of his unreleased CIF,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> thereby implying that he could account therefor with a mere certification that the same was utilized for a public purpose in the performance of duty.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> The claim must be rejected for the reason that since the CIF is covered by an appropriation<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> specifically identifying and authorizing it as such, it is governed by a different set of liquidation procedures<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> which was, however, also not shown to have been followed in this case.<br><br>To add, the Court cannot subscribe to petitioner's claim that no bad faith can be attributed to him since he signed the vouchers and the checks by virtue of his position as head of the PCGG, but <i>left the encashment of the checks and their use to his fellow Commissioners Ricardo Abcede and Nicasio Conti, who were supposedly responsible for applying those cash advances to the use of the PCGG.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup>&nbsp; On the contrary, it fortified petitioner's liability for Grave Misconduct and Serious Dishonesty because it sufficiently demonstrated <u>his propensity to disregard the law and established rules, and his predilection to distort the truth</u>. In addition, transfer of cash advance from one accountable officer to another is not allowed, and hence, constitutes a violation of another provision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> of COA Circular No. 97-002.<br><br>In a last ditch effort to escape administrative liability for the complained acts, petitioner invoked<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> his acquittal in the allied criminal cases for Violation of Section 3 (e) of RA 3019<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> and Malversation of Public Funds under Article 217<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> of the Revised Penal Code.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> However, the Court holds that such acquittal on the basis of insufficiency of evidence which engendered reasonable doubt, cannot work in petitioner's favor. An administrative case is, as a rule, independent from criminal proceedings. As such, the dismissal of a criminal case on the ground of insufficiency of evidence or the acquittal of an accused who is also a respondent in an administrative case does not necessarily preclude the administrative proceeding nor carry with it relief from administrative liability. This is because the quantum of proof required in administrative proceedings is merely substantial evidence, unlike in criminal cases which require proof beyond reasonable doubt or that degree of proof which produces conviction in an unprejudiced mind.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br>In this case, petitioner's administrative liability for Grave Misconduct and Serious Dishonesty does not rest on whether or not he has appropriated, took or misappropriated or consented or, through abandonment or negligence, permitted another person to take public funds for which he is accountable (which an accused in malversation of public funds must be shown to have committed), but rather on whether or not he flagrantly disregarded the law and established rules, or committed any distortion of the truth with respect to his handling and accounting of the public funds which came into his hands, as affirmatively shown in this case. Here, there was competent showing of a pattern of petitioner's <u>open and repeated defiance</u> of: <i>(a)</i> the law requiring the turn-over of receipts from the sale of ill-gotten wealth to the Agrarian Reform Fund when he channelled receipts from the sale of ill-gotten wealth to other purposes without any authority; and <i>(b)</i> the proper liquidation procedures, rendering him liable for Grave Misconduct. On the other hand, his <u>inconsistent</u> categorizations of the subject cash advances sufficiently evince his intent to distort the truth in order to evade the proper liquidation procedure therefor, warranting his liability for Serious Dishonesty.<br><br><ol start="3"><li><u>With respect to petitioner's failure to liquidate despite demand the amount of P1,555,862.03 out of the total cash advances that he used in his travels and litigation of foreign cases</u>.</li></ol><br>Petitioner claims that the amount of P1,555,862.03 forms part of his CIF which he utilized to successfully accomplish his mission and to carry out his tasks as then PCGG Chairman,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> and that his acquittal in the related criminal case<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> negates any gross misconduct and serious dishonesty on his part. Corollarily, as discussed in the immediately preceding section, such contentions must be dismissed as mere evasive tactics to skirt compliance with the proper liquidation procedures under COA Circular No. 97-002. As aptly observed by the CA:<br><br><blockquote>Instead of presenting documentary evidence, such as receipts and vouchers, to satisfactorily show that the amount was spent for the purposes for which it was released, [petitioner] proceeded to glorify the achievements of the PCGG under his watch and discussed the historical origin of its mandate. His lengthy exposition, to be sure, is not responsive to the charge and is deemed an extraneous matter that would not sway this Court in exonerating him from administrative liability.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup></blockquote><br><br>Petitioner's liability for grave misconduct and serious dishonesty must, perforce, be sustained.<br><br>Finally, the totality of petitioner's acts tarnished the image and integrity of his public office, which is tantamount to Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> Conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service is a <i>grave offense </i>which carries the penalty of suspension of six (6) months and one (1) day to one (1) year for the first offense, and dismissal on the second offense.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> However, in view of petitioner's culpability for all the three (3) charges, Section 50,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> Rule 10 of the RRACCS dictates that the penalty to be imposed should be that corresponding to the most serious charge.<br><br>Petitioner's administrative liability for Grave Misconduct and Serious Dishonesty would have warranted his dismissal from the service even for the first offense,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> if not for his separation from the office.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> Accordingly, the Court finds the Ombudsman and the CA to have correctly imposed the corresponding administrative disabilities of forfeiture of petitioner's retirement benefits, except accrued leave credits, if any, with prejudice to re-employment in any branch or instrumentality of the government.<br><br>As a final note, this Court has repeatedly emphasized the time-honored rule that a "[p]ublic office is a public trust [and] [p]ublic officers and employees must at all times be accountable to the people, serve them with utmost responsibility, integrity, loyalty and efficiency, act with patriotism and justice and lead modest lives."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> This high constitutional standard of conduct is not intended to be mere rhetoric and taken lightly as those in the public service are enjoined to fully comply with this standard or run the risk of facing administrative sanctions ranging from reprimand to the extreme penalty of dismissal from the service. Thus, public officers, as recipients of public trust, are under obligation to perform the duties of their offices honestly, faithfully, and to the best of their ability.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> Unfortunately, petitioner miserably failed in this respect. As appositely pointed out by the CA:<br><br><blockquote>We emphasize that despite the exalted position that [petitioner] had occupied in the executive arm of the government, he is not immune from administrative suit. As Chairman of the PCGG, he had no blanket authority to do as he pleased with the money and property of the government. He is covered by the same code of conduct and the rules and regulations pertaining to the handling and accounting of public funds. In fact, as an accountable public officer endowed with trust and confidence, [petitioner] is expected to comport himself with utmost responsibility and to observe the highest standard of ethical conduct.
