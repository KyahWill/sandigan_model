Considering that the property in this case has been recovered, no civil liability is imposed. </p> <p>The preventive imprisonment undergone by [petitioner] shall be credited in her favor.</p> <p> Issue a commitment order for the commitment of [petitioner] to the Correctional Institute for Women for the service of her sentence. </p> <p>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p>Per the RTC Branch Clerk of Court's Certification<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> dated November 7, 2017, no appeal was filed in the said case. </p><p>Per her Prison Record,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> petitioner already has two (2) years, three (3) months, and twenty-seven (27) days time served with earned good conduct time allowance as of May 8, 2018. </p><p>Meanwhile, R.A. No. 10951 was promulgated on August 29, 2017, which provides under Section 81, paragraph 4 thereof, that any person guilty of theft shall be punished by <em>arresto mayor</em> in its medium period to <em>prision correccional</em> in its minimum period<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> if the value of the property stolen is over P5,000.00 but does not exceed P20,000.00. </p><p>Applying, thus, the Indeterminate Sentence Law and invoking our ruling in <em>Hernan</em>, allowing for the re-opening of an already terminated case for purposes of modifying/reducing the penalty to be served, petitioner comes before this Court averring that she is entitled to have her sentence modified in accordance with R.A. No. 10951 and thereafter, to be immediately released from confinement in view of the aforesaid circumstances. </p><p align="center"><b>The Issue</b> </p><p> Is petitioner entitled to the relief prayed for? </p><p align="center"><b>Ruling of the Court</b> </p><p> While the petitioner correctly invoked R.A. No. 10951 for the modification of her sentence, in the recent case of <i>In Re: Correction/Adjustment of Penalty pursuant to R.A. No. 10951 in Relation to Hernan v. Sandiganbayan – Rolando Elbanbuena y Marfil</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> however, this Court ruled that the determination of whether the petitioner is entitled to immediate release would necessarily involve ascertaining, among others, the actual length of time actually served and whether good conduct time allowance should actually be allowed, and thus should be better undertaken by the trial court, which is relatively more equipped to make findings of both fact and law.
