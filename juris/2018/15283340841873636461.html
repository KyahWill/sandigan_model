Preliminarily, it found that while a motion to dismiss is a prohibited pleading under the Rule on Summary Procedure, Offshore Construction's motion was grounded on the lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>The Metropolitan Trial Court found that Intramuros committed forum shopping and that it had no jurisdiction over the case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>First, it pointed out that there were two (2) pending cases at the time Intramuros filed its complaint: Civil Case No. 08-119138 for specific performance filed by Offshore Construction against Intramuros, and SP CA No. 10-123257 for interpleader against Offshore Construction and Intramuros filed by 4H Intramuros, Inc. (4H Intramuros),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> which claimed to be a group of respondent's tenants.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>The Metropolitan Trial Court found that the specific performance case was anchored on Offshore Construction's rights under the Compromise Agreement. In that case, Offshore Construction claimed that it complied with its undertakings, but Intramuros failed to perform its obligations when it refused to offset Offshore Construction's expenses with the alleged unpaid rentals. The interpleader case, on the other hand, dealt with Offshore Construction's threats to evict the tenants of Puerta de Isabel II. 4H Intramuros prayed that the Regional Trial Court determine which between Offshore Construction and Intramuros was the rightful lessor of Puerta de Isabel II.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>The Metropolitan Trial Court found that the cause of action in Intramuros' complaint was similar with those in the specific performance and interpleader cases. Any judgment in any of those cases would affect the resolution or outcome in the ejectment case, since they would involve Offshore Construction's right to have its expenses offset from the rentals it owed Intramuros, and the determination of the rightful lessor of Puerta de Isabel II. The Metropolitan Trial Court pointed to the arrears in rentals that Intramuros prayed for as part of its complaint. Further, Intramuros failed to disclose the specific performance and interpleader cases in its certification against forum shopping.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Second, the Metropolitan Trial Court held that it had no jurisdiction over the complaint. While there were lease contracts between the parties, the existence of the other contracts between them made Intramuros and Offshore Construction's relationship as one of concession. Under this concession agreement, Offshore Construction undertook to develop several areas of the Intramuros District, for which it incurred expenses. The trial court found that the issues could not be mere possession and rentals only.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Intramuros appealed the October 19, 2010 Order with the Regional Trial Court. On April 14, 2011, the Regional Trial Court affirmed the Municipal Trial Court October 19, 2010 Order <i>in toto.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>On May 25, 2011, Intramuros, through the Office of the Solicitor General, filed a Motion for Extension of Time to File Petition for Review on Certiorari (Motion for Extension) before this Court. It prayed for an additional 30 days, or until June 16, 2011, within which to file its petition for review on solely on questions of law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>On June 16, 2011, Intramuros filed its Petition for Review on Certiorari,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> assailing the April 14, 2011 Decision of the Regional Trial Court.<br><br>In its Petition for Review, Intramuros argues that the Regional Trial Court erred in upholding the Metropolitan Trial Court findings that it had no jurisdiction over Intramuros' ejectment complaint<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> and that it committed forum shopping.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>First, Intramuros argues that Offshore Construction's Very Urgent Motion should not have been entertained by the Metropolitan Trial Court as it was a motion to dismiss, which was prohibited under the Rule on Summary Procedure.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> It claims that the Metropolitan Trial Court could have determined the issue of jurisdiction based on the allegations in its complaint. It points out that "jurisdiction over the subject matter is determined by the allegations [in] the complaint" and that the trial court's jurisdiction is not lost "just because the defendant makes a contrary allegation" in its defense.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> In ejectment cases, courts do not lose jurisdiction by a defendant's mere allegation that it has ownership over the&nbsp; litigated property. It holds that the Metropolitan Trial Court did not lose jurisdiction when Offshore Construction alleged that its relationship with Intramuros is one of concession, that the cause of action accrued in 2003, and that there was <i>litis pendentia </i>and forum shopping. It contends that the sole issue in an ejectment suit is the summary restoration of possession of a piece of land or building to the party that was deprived of it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Thus, the Metropolitan Trial Court gravely erred in granting Offshore Construction's motion to dismiss despite having jurisdiction over the subject matter of Intramuros' complaint.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>Second, Intramuros avers that it did not commit forum shopping as to warrant the dismissal of its complaint. It claims that while there were pending specific performance and interpleader cases related to the ejectment case, Intramuros was not guilty of forum shopping since it instituted neither action and did not seek a favorable ruling as a result of an earlier adverse opinion in these cases.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Intramuros points out that it was Offshore Construction and 4H Intramuros which filed the specific performance and interpleader cases, respectively.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> In both cases, Intramuros was the defendant and did not seek possession of Puerta de Isabel II as a relief in its answers to the complaints.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Moreover, the issues raised in these earlier cases were different from the issue of possession in the ejectment case. The issue in the specific performance case was whether or not Intramuros should offset the rentals in arrears from Offshore Construction's expenses in continuing the WOW Philippines Project.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Meanwhile, the issue in the interpleader case was to determine which between Intramuros and Offshore Construction was the rightful lessor of Puerta de Isabel II.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Finally, Intramuros maintains that there is no concession agreement between the parties, only lease contracts that have already expired and are not renewed. It argues that there is no basis for alleging the existence of a concession agreement. It points out that in the Contracts of Lease and Memorandum of Agreement entered into by Intramuros and Offshore Construction, the expiry of the leases would be on August 31, 2003. Afterwards, Intramuros tolerated Offshore Construction's continued occupation of its properties in hopes that it would pay its arrears in due course.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>On July 20, 2011, this Court issued its Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> granting the Motion for Extension and requiring Offshore Construction to comment on the Petition for Review.<br><br>On October 10, 2011, Offshore Construction filed its Comment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> to the Petition for Review. In its Comment, Offshore Construction argues that the Petition for Review should be dismissed because it violates the principle of hierarchy of courts and raises questions of fact.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> It points out that Intramuros did not move for the reconsideration of the Regional Trial Court April 14, 2011 Decision. Instead of directly filing with this Court, Intramuros should have filed a Petition for Review with the Court of Appeals, in accordance with Rule 42 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> It claims that Intramuros raises questions of fact in its Petition for Review, namely, the expiration of the Contracts of Lease and the business concession in favor of Offshore Construction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>In its November 21, 2011 Resolution, this Court noted the Comment and required Intramuros to file its Reply.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>On March 12, 2012, Intramuros filed its Reply<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> to the Comment. It argues that direct resort to this Court is proper because the issues it raises in its Petition for Review do not require review of evidence to resolve, and the facts of the case are undisputed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> It claims that the nature of Intramuros and Offshore Construction's relationship is never an tssue because all the documents referenced and relied upon by the parties were lease agreements.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>On August 23, 2012, this Court gave due course to the Petition for Review and ordered both parties to submit their memoranda.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>On January 7, 2013, Intramuros filed its Memorandum,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> while Offshore Construction filed its Memorandum<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup>&nbsp; on August 16, 2013.<br><br>In its Memorandum, Offshore Construction claims that it occupies Puerta de Isabel II by virtue of a legal concession based not only on the parties' contracts but also on the contemporaneous and subsequent acts of Intramuros and Offshore Construction. It argues that under the Contracts of Lease, Offshore Construction was required to invest around P20,000,000.00 worth of investments in the leased properties and that it lost its initial investments, which were demolished due to adverse criticism by then- Intramuros Administrator Anna Maria L. Harper. Under the Compromise Agreement, Offshore Construction was again required to make new developments, again worth millions of pesos. Offshore Construction claims that these conditions make their relationship not one of mere lessor and lessee.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>Further, it attests that Intramuros committed illegal and inhuman acts, and injustice against it and its sublessees, allegedly because the Contracts of Lease had expired.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> Moreover, it points out that Intramuros only filed the ejectment complaint in 2010, even though the Contracts of Lease expired on August 31, 2003. It argues that Intramuros was guilty of estoppel <i>in pais, </i>since it continued to accept rental payments as late as July 10, 2009.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> Assuming that the lease contracts had expired, these contracts were impliedly renewed by the mutual and voluntary acts of the parties, in accordance with Article 1670 of the Civil Code.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> Offshore Construction claims that there is now novation of the Contracts of Lease, and the courts may fix a period for them,<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[64]</sup></font> pursuant to Article 1687 of the Civil Code.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> It reiterates its prayer that the Petition for Review be dismissed, due to questions of fact more properly cognizable by the Court of Appeals.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>The issues to be resolved by this Court are:<br><br>First, whether or not direct resort to this Court is proper;<br><br>Second, whether or not the Metropolitan Trial Court had jurisdiction over the ejectment complaint filed by Intramuros Administration;<br><br>Third, whether or not Intramuros Administration committed forum shopping when it filed its ejectment complaint despite the pending cases for specific performance and interpleader; and<br><br>Finally, whether or not Intramuros Administration is entitled to possess the leased premises and to collect unpaid rentals.<br><br><center><b>I</b></center><br><br>At the outset, petitioner should have filed a petition for review under Rule 42 of the Rules of Court to assail the Regional Trial Court's ruling upholding the Metropolitan Trial Court October 19, 2010 Order instead of filing a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 with this Court.<br><br>Under Rule 42, Section 1 of the Rules of Court, the remedy from an adverse decision rendered by a Regional Trial Court exercising its appellate jurisdiction is to file a verified petition for review with the Court of Appeals:<br><br><blockquote>Section 1. <i>How appeal taken; time for filing.</i> — A party desiring to appeal from a decision of the Regional Trial Court rendered in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction may file a verified petition for review with the Court of Appeals, paying at the same time to the clerk of said court the corresponding docket and other lawful fees, depositing the amount of P500.00 for costs, and furnishing the Regional Trial Court and the adverse party with a copy of the petition. The petition shall be filed and served within fifteen (15) days from notice of the decision sought to be reviewed or of the denial of petitioner's motion for new trial or reconsideration filed in due time after judgment.

Trial courts do not only determine the facts from the evaluation of the evidence presented before them. They are likewise competent to determine issues of law which may include the validity of an ordinance, statute, or even an executive issuance in relation to the Constitution. To effectively perform these functions, they are territorially organized into regions and then into branches. Their writs generally reach within those territorial boundaries. Necessarily, they mostly perform the all-important task of inferring the facts from the evidence as these are physically presented before them. In many instances, the facts occur within their territorial jurisdiction, which properly present the 'actual case' that makes ripe a determination of the constitutionality of such action. The consequences, of course, would be national in scope. There are, however, some cases where resort to courts at their level would not be practical considering their decisions could still be appealed before the higher courts, such as the Court of Appeals.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> (Citation omitted)</blockquote><br><br>Nonetheless, the doctrine of hierarchy of courts is not inviolable, and this Court has provided several exceptions to the doctrine.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> One of these exceptions is the exigency of the situation being litigated.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> Here, the controversy between the parties has been dragging on since 2010, which should not be the case when the initial dispute—an ejectment case—is, by nature and design, a summary procedure and should have been resolved with expediency.<br><br>Moreover, this Court's rules of procedure permit the direct resort to this Court from a decision of the Regional Trial Court upon questions of law, such as those which petitioner raises in this case.

In compliance with the Memorandum of Agreement, Offshore incurred expenses amounting to Seven Million Eight Hundred Twenty[-]Five Thousand Pesos (P7,825,000.00) by way of Expenses for Rentals of Lights &amp; Sound System, Electrical Bill and Performers Fees. This amount is excluding the expenses incurred during the period Offshore supplied the Light &amp; Sound System, as well as Performers, aforementioned started in October 2004. A copy of the Statement of Account is hereto appended as ANNEX "H" to "H-4";<br><br>17. Based on Offshore's records, upon re-computation of Actual Area used during all these period[s] from July 2001 to March 30, 2008, copy of Statement of Accounts has been sent to Intramuros Administration for reconciliation, Offshore's total obligation by way of back and current rentals up to March 30, 2008 is only in the amount of Six Million Four Hundred Three Thousand Three Hundred Sixty[-]Four Pesos (P6,403,364.00);<br><br>18.

Unfortunately, despite this glaring fact that [Intramuros] owes Offshore, Defendant [Anna Maria L.] Harper (who has already showed sour and adverse treatment of Offshore in the past), being the new Administrator of Intramuros Administration, sent a Letter dated 09 April 2008 demanding from Offshore to pay [Intramuros] alleged rentals in arrears in the amount of P12,478[,]461.74, within seven (7) days from receipt. A copy of the Letter is hereto attached and marked as Annex "I" to "I-1";<br><br>20. It can be deduced from the attachment to the aforementioned letter that [Intramuros] did not honor the obligations imposed in the Memorandum of Agreement because the monthly expenses incurred by Offshore for the payment of the Lights and Sound System, Electricity and Performers Fees for the continuance of the Department of Tourism WOW Project at Baluarte Plano, Luneta de Sta. Isabel which were duly furnished [Intramuros] in the amount of Seven Million Eight Hundred Twenty[-]Five Thousand Pesos (P7,825,000.00) as expressly agreed by [Department of Tourism], [Intramuros] and Offshore in the Memorandum of Agreement were NOT deducted from the rentals due[.] <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup></blockquote><br><br>Petitioner's counterclaim in its Amended Answer was set up to defend itself against such a claim:<br><br><blockquote>26. [Offshore Construction] has not established its right, or the reality is, [Offshore Constructioin] has been delinquent in the payment of its financial obligations which are specifically provided in its contract with defendant [Intramuros], such as rental fees.<br><br>27. [Offshore Construction] has to pay rent for being still in possession of Puerta Isabel II and Asean Garden. Moreover, plaintiff has enjoyed the fruits of subleasing these premises for years and yet it has continuously failed to remit all rental fees and surcharges despite repeated demands from defendants. It bears stressing that as of December 31, 2009, [Offshore Construction's] arrears has already ballooned to thirteen million four hundred and forty[-]eight thousand eight hundred and sixty[-]seven pesos and forty[-]five centavos (P13,448,867.45).<br><br>28. Glaringly, [Offshore Construction] has been remiss in performing its obligations stated in the Lease Contracts (Annexes A to A-15; B to B-14 and C to C-14 of the Complaint), Compromise Agreement (Annexes E to E-17 of the Complaint) and Memorandum of Agreement (Annexes F to F-16 of the Complaint). [Intramuros and Anna Maria L. Harper] are therefore constrained to demand payment from [Offshore Construction] for the latter's failure or refusal to honor its just and valid obligations. Necessarily, [Intramuros and Anna Maria L. Harper] will not hesitate to seek legal remedies if [Offshore Construction] continues to be delinquent.<br><br>29. Essentially, [Offshore Construction] is protesting the computation of its arrears (P12,478,461.74) in the demand letter sent by Administrator [Anna Maria L.] Harper on April 9, 2008. [Offshore Construction] also asserts that it only owes defendant [Intramuros] six million four hundred three thousand and three hundred sixty[-]four pesos (P6,403,364.00).<br><br>30. [Offshore Construction] is misguided. The [Memorandum of Agreement] dated July 27, 2004 was executed because [Offshore Construction], at that time, had been indebted to defendant [Intramuros] in the form of rental and utility consumption arrears for the occupancy of Puerta Isabel Chambers, Asean Gardens and Baluarte de San Andres in the amount of six million seven hundred sixty[-]two thousand one hundred fifty[-]three and seventy centavos (P6,762,153.70)....<br>....<br><br>32. Even after July 27, 2004, and up to this time, [Offshore Construction] remained in possession of, used and/or subleased the subject premises. As such, [Offshore Construction] still has to pay rental fees, aside from the aforesaid arrears. The rental fees continued to pile up and triggered the imposition of surcharges as [Offshore Construction] again failed to remit payments thereon. This explains the demandable amount of P13,448,867.45 (Annex I to I1 of Complaint). [Offshore Construction] is therefore mistaken in believing that it only owes defendant [Intramuros] the arrears subject of the [Memorandum of Agreement] of July 27, 2004 and nothing more.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup></blockquote><br><br>Clearly, petitioner's counterclaim is compulsory, arising as it did out of, and being necessarily connected with, the parties' respective obligations under the July 27, 2004 Memorandum of Agreement. Petitioner cannot be faulted for raising the issue of unpaid rentals in the specific performance case or for raising the same issue in the present ejectment case, since it appears that respondent's alleged failure to pay the rent led to the non-renewal of the Contracts of Lease.

When a demand to vacate has been made, as what petitioner had done, respondent's possession became illegal and it should have left the leased premises. In <i>Cañiza v. Court of Appeals:</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[125]</sup><br><br><blockquote>The Estradas' first proffered defense derives from a literal construction of Section 1, Rule 70 of the Rules of Court which inter alia authorizes the institution of an unlawful detainer suit when "the possession of any land or building is unlawfully withheld after the expiration or termination of the right to hold possession, by virtue of any contract, express or implied." They contend that since they did not acquire possession of the property in question "by virtue of any contract, express or implied" — they having been, to repeat, "allowed to live temporarily ... (therein) for free, out of ... (Cañiza's) kindness" — in no sense could there be an "expiration or termination of ... (their) right to hold possession, by virtue of any contract, express or implied." Nor would an action for forcible entry lie against them, since there is no claim that they had "deprived (Cañiza) of the possession of ... (her property) by force, intimidation, threat, strategy, or stealth."<br><br>The argument is arrant sophistry. Cañiza's act of allowing the Estradas to occupy her house, rent-free, did not create a permanent and indefeasible right of possession in the latter's favor. Common sense, and the most rudimentary sense of fairness clearly require that act of liberality be implicitly, but no less certainly, accompanied by the necessary burden on the Estradas of returning the house to Cañiza upon her demand. More than once has this Court adjudged that a person who occupies the land of another at the latter's tolerance or permission without any contract between them is necessarily bound by an implied promise that he will vacate upon demand, failing which a summary action for ejectment is the proper remedy against him. <i>The situation is not much different from that of a tenant whose lease expires but who continues in occupancy by tolerance of the owner, in which case there is deemed to be an unlawful deprivation or withholding of possession as of the date of the demand to vacate. In other words, one whose stay is merely tolerated becomes a deforciant illegally occupying the land or property the moment he is required to leave. </i>Thus, in <i>Asset Privatization Trust vs. Court of Appeals, </i>where a company, having lawfully obtained possession of a plant upon its undertaking to buy the same, refused to return it after failing to fulfill its promise of payment despite demands, this Court held that "(a)fter demand and its repudiation, ...

The Metropolitan Trial Court found that a concession agreement existed due to the agreements entered into by the parties:<br><br><blockquote>This Court agrees with the defendant. The various contracts of lease between the parties notwithstanding, the existence of the other agreements involved herein cannot escape the scrutiny of this Court. Although couched in such words as "contracts of lease", the relationship between the parties has evolved into another kind – that of a concession agreement whereby defendant [Offshore Construction] undertook to develop several areas of the Intramuros District, defendant [Offshore Construction] actually commenced the development of the subject premises and incurred expenses for the said development, effectively making the relationship more than an ordinary lessor-lessee but one governed by concession whereby both parties undertook other obligations in addition to their basic obligations under the contracts of lease. <i>Consensus facit legem </i>(The parties make their own law by their agreement).
