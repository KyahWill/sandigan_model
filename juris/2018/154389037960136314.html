SP. Nos. 127757 and 127801. The CA Decision reversed and set aside the Joint Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated May 30, 2012 (OMB Resolution) of the Office of the Ombudsman (OMB), which found herein respondent P/Supt. Ermilando O. Villafuerte (respondent Villafuerte) administratively liable with several others for Serious Dishonesty and Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service.<br><br>This case arose from the infamous "chopper scam" that involved the procurement of second-hand light police operational helicopters (LPOHs) for use of the Philippine National Police (PNP). During the procurement process, respondent Villafuerte was the Legal Officer of the National Headquarters Bids and Awards Committee (NHQ-BAC), Secretariat Division (BAC Secretariat).<br><br><center><i>The Facts</i></center><br><br>The events precipitating the instant controversy were summarized in the CA Decision, as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Sometime in 2009, the Philippine National Police programed <i>(sic) </i>to purchase three (3) fully equipped helicopters with an approved budget of Php105,000,000.00. After two (2) scheduled public bidding <i>(sic) </i>failed, another bidding was conducted with two proponents participated <i>(sic) </i>namely: MAPTRA and BEELINE. The third bidding was again declared a failure since the proponents failed to meet the requirements. Later on, the requirement was modified from three (3) fully equipped helicopters to One (1) fully equipped and two (2) standard helicopters.<br><br>On 15 June 2009, the negotiation committee convened and again, MAPTRA and BEELINE participated. BEELINE submitted price quotation of Php104,987,000.00 for the requirement but manifested that the helicopters do not have xenon light, down link transmission and aircondition with only 2-3 sitting <i>(sic) </i>capacity as the inclusion of said accessories cost Php12,000,000.00. On the other hand, MAPTRA quoted Php104,985,000.00 for the requirement but all helicopters are 4-sitter <i>(sic).</i><br><br>The Bids and Awards Committee of the PNP resolved to award the contract to MAPTRA. The head of BAC Secretariat PSSUPT Detran instructed petitioner Villafuerte to prepare the necessary documents pertaining to the award of the contract to the winning bidder MAPTRA. Hence, petitioner Villafuerte prepared the Supply Contract and the Notice to Proceed was signed by then PNP Chief Jesus Versoza.<br><br>After securing a performance bond from the AFP General Insurance Corporation in favor of the PNP, two light operational helicopters were delivered on 24 September 2009 at the PNP Air Unit Hangar, Domestic Airport in Pasay City. After inspection, the PNP released 50% of the contract price to MAPTRA.<br><br>On 10 February 2010, a fully equipped Robinson R44 Helicopter was delivered to PNP. A certification of inspection was issued on 22 February 2010. Thus, the PNP released to MAPTRA the remaining 50% balance.<br><br>Later on, an investigation was conducted regarding the procurement of the said helicopters and the investigating body allegedly found that the helicopters that were subject of the procurement were not brand new contrary to the requirement of the PNP procurement. x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></blockquote><br><br>As a result of the investigation, a Complaint dated November 25, 2011<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> (Complaint) was filed by the OMB-Field Investigation Office, charging several public and private respondents,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> including respondent Villafuerte, with various criminal and administrative offenses, which included <i>inter alia: </i>(i) violation of paragraphs (e) and (g), Section 3,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Republic Act No. (RA) 3019,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> in relation to RA 9184,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> and (ii) Dishonesty, Gross Neglect of Duty, and Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service under paragraphs 1, 2 and 20, Section 52(A), Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>.<br><br>In his Counter-Affidavit dated January 12, 2012, respondent Villafuerte claimed that his only participation in the procurement process was the drafting of several documents under the instruction of P/SSupt.

In particular, considering that potential bidders are required to submit certain documentary requirements to be evaluated by the BAC under the IRR-A, the OMB concluded that respondent Villafuerte and his other co-respondents, given their respective positions, conspired to award the LPOH contract to an unqualified bidder.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>The OMB Resolution held thus:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE,</b> it is hereby resolved as follows:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x x<br><br><b>OMB-C-A-11-0758-L {ADMINISTRATIVE CASE)</b><br><br>1) Respondents P/Dir.

Thus, in administrative cases, the only inquiry in determining liability is simply whether the respondent, through his individual actions, committed the charges against him that render him administratively liable.<br><br>In any case, it bears stressing that while the OMB's factual findings in their entirety tend to demonstrate a sequence of irregularities in the procurement of the LPOHs, <b>this does not <i>ipso facto</i> translate into a conspiracy between each and every person involved in the procurement process.</b> For conspiracy to be appreciated, it must be clearly shown that there was a conscious design to commit an offense; <b><u>conspiracy is not the product of negligence but of intentionality on the part of cohorts</u>.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> <b><u>Conspiracy is never presumed</u>.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>To establish respondent Villafuerte's participation in the alleged conspiracy, the OMB Resolution concluded as follows:<br><br><blockquote>With respect to respondents Villafuerte and Loreto, they were legal officers designated as members of the BAC Secretariat. As such, they had the opportunity to examine the documents submitted by MAPTRA. They knew, therefore, that the latter failed to meet the technical and financial requirements required by IRR-A. However, they still proceeded to prepare the necessary papers to recommend the award of the contract to the unqualified supplier. Moreover, at the time respondent Villafuerte prepared the Supply Contract, he saw the incorporation papers of MAPTRA Corporation which indicated that it was issued Certificate of Incorporation on June 10, 2009. He was present during the June 15, 2009 negotiations when MAPTRA Sole Proprietorship submitted its proposal. Hence, when he drafted the Supply Contract he already knew that MAPTRA misrepresented itself as a sole proprietorship during the negotiations on June 15, 2009. This is not merely tolerating an irregularity but clearly participating in the commission thereof.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></blockquote><br><br>Aside from the sweeping statements of the OMB, there is a dearth of evidence on record to arrive at a conclusion that respondent Villafuerte was complicit in a conspiracy to defraud the Government. As consistently stressed by respondent Villafuerte, the following documents were drafted <b>upon the instruction of his superior officer,</b> P/SSupt. Lurimer B. Detran: (i) Negotiation Committee Resolution No. 2009-04, (ii) BAC Resolution No. 2009-36, (iii) Supply Contract between the PNP and MAPTRA; and (iv) Notice to Proceed addressed to Mr. Larry B. De Vera of MAPTRA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> <b><u>None of the aforesaid documents suggest that respondent Villafuerte had a material role in the awarding of the contract to MAPTRA</u>.</b><br><br>In fact, <b>the nature of the functions of the BAC Secretariat under the Amended IRR-A of RA 9184 confirms that respondent Villafuerte does <u>not</u> possess recommendatory authority of any kind:</b><br><br><blockquote><b>Section 14.

George Quinto Piano.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> In other words, petitioner cannot judge respondent Villafuerte's actions based on the end result of the documents drafted.<br><br>Based on the foregoing, <b>petitioner miserably failed to establish a nexus between the ministerial act of drafting the said documents and a scheme to defraud the Government.</b> Petitioner cannot satisfy the threshold of substantial evidence using only conjectures and suppositions; the mere fact that an irregular procurement process was uncovered does not mean that all persons involved, regardless of rank or functions, were acting together in conspiracy. Moreover, as already discussed above, neither does proof of criminal conspiracy automatically impute administrative liability on all those concerned.<br><br>On this score, the Court finds merit m and accordingly adopts the following disquisition in the CA Decision:<br><br><blockquote>In the present case, no records will show that petitioners took part in the alleged conspiracy. <b>They were not signatories of any document pertaining to the procurement of the three (3) helicopters. The petitioners were neither part of the team who inspected the procured helicopters nor were they signatories in the disbursement vouchers for the payment of the said helicopters. Hence, there is no direct evidence that will link them to the alleged conspiracy.</b><br><br>Petitioner Loreto was not present in the 15 June 2009 negotiation which eventually led to the awarding of the Supply Contract to MAPTRA. Perforce, there is no clear or substantial evidence proffered against him to become administratively liable. <b><u>Anent petitioner Villafuerte though he was present in the 15 June 2009 negotiation, however, there are no records to show that he has the power to recommend or decide on the negotiation that was conducted. He was merely instructed to prepare the Supply Contract, nothing more</u>.</b><br><br>x x x x<br><br>It cannot be disputed that only the members of the Bids and Awards Committee are the only persons authorized and empowered to decide on matters pertaining to the bidding and procurement. <b>The BAC Secretariat is clearly given the mandate to only safe keep the documents and facilitate the procurement process. <u>They only rely on the decision of the members of the BAC itself and to prepare whatever document they are instructed to do so</u>. Hence, it cannot be determined as to what extent of culpability that petitioners committed in the alleged conspiracy.</b><br><br>x x x x<br><br>Here, there was no substantial evidence presented against the petitioners. Petitioner Loreto was not present in the 15 June 2009 negotiation that led to the awarding of the Supply Contract to MAPTRA and both petitioners were merely members of the BAC Secretariat who were only support group <i>(sic), </i>as custodian of documents and to facilitate the procurement process. <b><u>Their alleged silence cannot be equated to acquiesce <i> (sic) </i> or participation in the alleged anomaly or irregularity. Petitioners cannot, therefore, be held civilly or administratively liable for such acts</u> unless there is a clear showing of bad faith, malice or gross negligence.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br><br>Parenthetically, petitioner makes much of the fact that respondent Villafuerte was under the Office of Legal Affairs of the PNP before being detailed to the BAC Secretariat.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> From this fact, petitioner concludes that respondent Villafuerte's legal background "should have cautioned him that it was improper to award the contract to MAPTRA" and therefore he could no longer escape culpability from his act of drafting the necessary documents recommending the award to MAPTRA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> This reasoning is specious.<br><br>Even as petitioner does not contest the CA's finding that respondent Villafuerte's duties as Member of the BAC Secretariat are ministerial in nature, it insists on holding respondent Villafuerte liable. <b>What petitioner is thus doing is effectively imposing additional duties upon respondent Villafuerte by the mere fact that he previously worked under the Office of Legal Affairs; that respondent Villafuerte's purported failure to o above and beyond his regular functions under the BAC Secretariat makes him equally responsible for the damage resulting to the government. <u>This is untenable and simply unfair</u>.</b> While eagerness in public service is indeed ideal, there is simply no basis in fact to find respondent Villafuerte liable for not examining each and every document and on the basis of which make an independent assessment of the qualifications of bidders — when, as a member only of the BAC Secretariat, he is merely charged with the custody thereof. <u><b>To be certain, an opportunity to examine documents does not, by any means, impose a mandatory duty to examine the same</b></u><b>.</b><br><br>Neither can dishonesty or conduct prejudicial to the service be attributed to respondent Villafuerte by the mere fact that he drafted Negotiation Committee Resolution No. 2009-04 recommending the award of the contract to MAPTRA as a <u>sole proprietorship</u>, notwithstanding the fact that it was apparently issued a Certificate of Incorporation on June 10, 2009, or five (5) days prior to the June 15, 2009 negotiations leading to the issuance of Negotiation Committee Resolution No. 2009-04. Petitioner specifically posits that respondent Villafuerte, who was present in the June 15, 2009 negotiations, effectively consented to the irregularities attending the procurement process due to his knowledge that MAPTRA represented itself as a sole proprietorship despite being incorporated a few days earlier.<br><br>The Court disagrees; without more, such bare circumstance does not qualify as substantial evidence that respondent Villafuerte was guilty of any impropriety and therefore administratively liable. No deliberate intention to mislead the Government in pursuance of a larger conspiracy can be derived from the mere fact that there was a purported error in designating MAPTRA either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation. In the first place, as summarized in the OMB Resolution itself, the Negotiation Committee, which is in charge of evaluating the eligibility of MAPTRA, had already made a finding thereon:<br><br><blockquote>30. In the evaluation of the eligibility of MAPTRA Sole Proprietorship, the Minutes of the Negotiation states, inter alia, that the eligibility and technical documents submitted by said entity are all in order and conforming with the requirements of the Committee, thus:<br><br><blockquote>[T]he Negotiation Committee called on the second proponent which is MAPTRA. The Chairman instructed MAPTRA's representative to hand over their Eligibility, Technical and Financial documents to the Secretariat and TWG. <u><b>After a thorough checking by the BAC Legal and TWG on the Eligibility and Technical documents, it was found to be all in order and conforming with the requirements by the Committee</b></u><b>,</b> hence the opening of its financial proposal. x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote></blockquote><br><br>Thus, as a mere Member of the BAC Secretariat, respondent Villafuerte had no compelling reason to evaluate MAPTRA's eligibility all over again while drafting the pertinent documents, especially as such is not even a part of his duties. Further in this regard, the Court finds respondent Villafuerte's explanation to have sufficiently clarified the matter:<br><br><blockquote>7.18. It should herein be emphasized, that among the papers and documents PSSUPT Detran gave to herein Respondent are the incorporation papers of MAPTRA <b>which was not presented during the negotiation conference conducted on 15 June 2009.</b> Apparently, MAPTRA was in the process of incorporation during the period of negotiation. It is relevant to state, however, that it appears from the documents that MAPTRA maintained the same business facilities, address, and continued to engage in the same line and kind of business as the sole proprietorship.<br><br>7.19. <b>Since it was more than two (2) weeks from 15 June 2009, the date of the negotiation conference, that the Respondent was informed that after deliberating the matter the NHQ-BAC awarded the supply contract to MAPTRA and the pertinent documents were given to him, the Respondent presumed that the NHQ-BAC through the Technical Working Group (TWG) already conducted verification of the documents submitted by MAPTRA.</b> The Minutes of the 15 June 2009 negotiation conference shows that members of the BAC TWG were present, namely: <i>Police Chief Inspector Cherry M Fajardo, Police Chief Inspector Maria Josefina Recometa, SPO3 Ma. Linda A. Padojinog, and NUP Ruben S. Gongona.</i><br><br>7.20. Further, considering that the NHQ-BAC must have already taken all the MAPTRA documents into consideration, including the legal, financial and technical aspects thereof, when they deliberated on the award made to MAPTRA, as well as the fact that the Respondent is not aware of any prohibition thereon, he proceeded in drafting the required documents as he was commanded to do. Thus, when Respondent drafted the Supply Contract, he indicated therein that MAPTRA is a corporation as can be gleaned from the documents subsequently given to him by his superior officer.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><br>Further on this matter, Justice Leonen, in his dissenting opinion, opines that respondent Villafuerte should be held liable considering that he is a member of the bar.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> He argues that respondent Villafuerte's claim of performing ministerial duties is untenable as having administrative or ministerial functions does not strip a lawyer of his ethical duties as embodied in the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Specifically, Justice Leonen argues that in the drafting of the subject documents, respondent Villafuerte was engaged in the practice of law as it entailed application of his legal knowledge, training, and experience.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Thus, Justice Leonen opines that respondent Villafuerte's duties could not have been ministerial as his legal training should have prompted him as to the impropriety of the contract and that his purported failure to advise his superiors of irregularities rendered him liable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>The Court cannot accept the foregoing ratiocination of Justice Leonen. While it may be true that a lawyer cannot, at his convenience, shed himself of his ethical duties as a member of the legal profession, holding him accountable for alleged violations of the CPR must be done in strict observance of established procedure. Here, while there is an apparent intersection between respondent Villafuerte's duties as Member of the BAC Secretariat and his duties as a member of the bar, the Court cannot hold him liable for violations of the latter as he was never properly charged for the same nor was he given the opportunity to respond to any such charges. The two offices that respondent Villafuerte occupy have separate and distinct duties and functions and are governed by entirely different rules. Thus, to insist on penalizing him for acts done in violation of one office despite being charged for violation of the other — no matter how patent the infraction — would infringe upon the most basic requirement of due process.<br><br>More importantly, there is nothing explicit in the statutory duties of the BAC Secretariat that would require respondent Villafuerte to further examine the findings of the Negotiation Committee, which is the body charged with evaluating the qualifications of MAPTRA. That respondent Villafuerte had incidentally applied his legal knowledge and training does not discount the fact that he drafted the contested documents purely under the instructions of his superiors — not as a result of any exercise of discretion on his part. Such circumstance undeniably points to the conclusion that his duties are only ministerial in nature.<br><br>Again, it is untenably and simply unfair to effectively impose additional duties upon respondent Villafuerte by the mere fact that he is a lawyer so that his purported failure to go above and beyond his regular functions under the BAC Secretariat makes him part of a conspiracy to defraud the government. To reiterate, there is simply no basis to find respondent Villafuerte liable for not examining each and every document and on the basis of which make an independent assessment of the qualifications of bidders — when, as a member only of the BAC Secretariat, he is merely charged with the custody thereof.<br><br>All told, the Court is not prepared to punish respondent Villafuerte for merely discharging the ministerial functions of his office as Member of the BAC Secretariat, especially when such acts were made pursuant to the instructions of his superiors. Without more, and there being absolutely no substantial evidence existing from the records to hold respondent Villafuerte liable for either Serious Dishonesty or Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service, the judgment here can be no other than total exoneration.<br><br><i>A final note.</i><br><br>The Office of the Ombudsman is, by special designation of the Constitution, the "protector of the people."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> As such, the Constitution has bequeathed upon it a unique arsenal of powers to investigate any and all acts or omissions of public officers that appear to be illegal, unjust, improper, or inefficient.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> As well, it is empowered to impose penalties in the exercise of its administrative disciplinary authority.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> In this regard, while the nature of its functions is largely prosecutorial, the Office of the Ombudsman is not, by any means, exempted from upholding the fundamental rights of all citizens as safeguarded by the Constitution. This was stressed by the Court in <i>Morales, Jr. v. Carpio-Morales</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup>:<br><br><blockquote>x x x [T]he Ombudsman's duty is not only to prosecute but, more importantly, to <b>ensure that justice is served.</b> This means determining, at the earliest possible time, whether the process should continue or should be terminated. The duty includes using all the resources necessary to prosecute an offending public officer where it is warranted, as well as to refrain from placing any undue burden on the parties in the case, or government resources where the same is not.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup></blockquote><br><br>Following the pronouncements in <i>Morales, Jr.,</i> the Ombudsman is thus reminded to exercise the utmost circumspection in its own pursuit of justice. It must be stressed that it is not prosecuting ordinary citizens, but public servants who play instrumental roles in our system of government, regardless of rank. In this regard, to stubbornly pursue baseless cases against public officers not only places an unnecessary burden upon their person, but also ultimately hampers the effective dispensation of government functions due to the unique positions that they occupy. The responsibility of the Ombudsman is made even greater given that a decision imposing the penalty of dismissal is immediately executory and is not stayed by a pending appeal:<br><br><blockquote>Section 7. Finality and execution of decision. — Where the respondent is absolved of the charge, and in case of conviction where the penalty imposed is public censure or reprimand, suspension of not more than one month, or a fine equivalent to one month salary, the decision shall be final, executory and unappealable. In all other cases, the decision may be appealed to the Court of Appeals on a verified petition for review under the requirements and conditions set forth in Rule 43 of the Rules of Court, within fifteen (15) days from receipt of the written Notice of the Decision or Order denying the Motion for Reconsideration.<br><br><b>An appeal shall not stop the decision from being executory. In case the penalty is suspension or removal and the respondent wins such appeal, he shall be considered as having been under preventive suspension and shall be paid the salary and such other emoluments that he did not receive by reason of the suspension or removal.</b><br><br>A decision of the Office of the Ombudsman in administrative cases shall be executed as a matter of course. The Office of the Ombudsman shall ensure that the decision shall be strictly enforced and properly implemented. The refusal or failure by any officer without just cause to comply with an order of the Office of the Ombudsman to remove, suspend, demote, fine, or censure shall be a ground for disciplinary action against said officer.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><br><b><u>In the same vein, it should be emphasized, following the cited provision, that the CA has a concomitant responsibility to ensure that, in case of exoneration, such a decision must perforce be immediately executory, notwithstanding an appeal that may be lodged by the Ombudsman with the Court. The Court finds such rule necessary to fulfill the interests of justice and fairness, given that not only the livelihoods of our public servants are at stake, but likewise the efficient operations of government as a whole</u>.</b><br><br>All told, inasmuch as the Office of the Ombudsman enjoys independence, it cannot and should not lose sight of our laws, which it is bound to uphold and obey.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> The Ombudsman is as much the protector of the innocent as it is the sentinel of the integrity of the public service; the zeal of prosecution must, at all times, be tempered with evidence. In this case, the cavalier attitude of the Ombudsman in distilling the facts and meting out the most severe penalty of dismissal cannot go unnoticed; the dismissal of an officer based on nothing but conjecture and a talismanic invocation of conspiracy is, aside from being manifestly unjust, a gross disservice to its mandate. To be sure, the cleansing of our ranks cannot be done at the expense of a fair and just proceeding.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> premises considered, the instant Petition is <b>DENIED.</b> The Decision dated January 28, 2015 and Resolution dated August 3, 2015 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

Further, MAPTRA Sole Proprietorship's single largest contract and the only similar contract with that of the PNP was only for P15,295,000.00.<br><br>34. Likewise, the Independent Auditor's Report with Balance Sheets submitted by MAPTRA reveals that its "Current Assets" in 2007 and and 2008 were P14,180,600.00 and P11,594,832.00, respectively, and that its "Current Liabilities" in said years were P13,803,844.00 and P12,043,260.00, respectively.<br><br>35. MAPTRA Sole Proprietorship or MAPTRA-Corporation had not submitted a commitment from a licensed bank to extend to it a credit line if awarded the contract. Neither did it submit a cash deposit certificate in an amount which is at least equal to ten percent (10%) of the P105,000,000.00 ABC, or P10,500,000.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br></blockquote><br>By this alone, it is inconceivable that respondent, who prepared the Negotiation Committee Resolution No. 2009-04 and under whose custody the supplier's financial documents were, had no hand in the anomaly.<br><br>The NHQ-BAC Resolution No. 2009-36 "affirmed the recommendation of the Negotiation Committee to recommend to the [Philippine National Police] Chief the award of the supply contract to MAPTRA Sole Proprietorship."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> The Supply Contract is where the parties obligated themselves to deliver to the Philippine National Police one <i>brand new</i> fully-equipped and two standard brand new Light Police Operational Helicopters for MAPTRA, and to pay MAPTRA the amount of P104,985,000.00 for the Philippine National Police.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>The Ombudsman found that the misrepresentations on the financial and technical capabilities of MAPTRA were exhibited in the documents they submitted to the Bids and Awards Committee.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[8]</sup></font> To exculpate himself from the administrative charge, respondent argues that his duties as a legal officer of the Bids and Awards Committee Secretariat render him as performing ministerial duties. He insists that the Bids and Awards Committee Secretariat's functions are purely administrative in nature.<br><br>The duties of a lawyer, as embodied in the Code of Professional Responsibility, are not ministerial. I cannot agree with the <i>ponencia's</i> view that respondent's act of drafting the procurement documents was administrative and ministerial.<br><br>Respondent's invocation of the Bids and Awards Committee Secretariat's administrative functions is a poor excuse and a mockery of the profession he brandishes. As a member of the legal profession, respondent performs duties impressed with public interest. Having administrative and ministerial functions does not strip a lawyer of his ethical duties embodied in the Code of Professional Responsibility.<br><br>The first canon in the Code of Professional Responsibility instructs lawyers to "uphold the Constitution, obey the laws of the land and promote respect for law and for legal processes."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> A lawyer must conduct himself with honesty and integrity in all his dealings.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Further, he must maintain "a high standard of legal proficiency, morality, honesty, integrity and fair dealing, and must perform their four-fold duty to society, the legal profession, the courts and their clients, in accordance with the values and norms embodied in the Code of Professional Responsibility."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> The legal profession demands exacting standards from its members.<br><br>Respondent alleged that he was under the Office of the Legal Affairs of the Philippine National Police before he was assigned as the Legal Officer of the Bids and Awards Committee Secretariat as an additional duty.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> According to him, taking custody of procurement documents and assisting in the management of the procurement process were among the Bids and Awards Committee Secretariat's official functions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>In <i>Roxas v. Republic Estate Corporation,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> this Court defined a ministerial duty:<br><br><blockquote>A purely ministerial act or duty is one which an officer or tribunal performs in the context of a given set of facts, in a prescribed manner and <i>without regard to the exercise of [one's] own judgment</i> upon the propriety or impropriety of the act done.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><br>A duty is ministerial when it does not require the exercise of discretion or judgment. Respondent is a high-ranking police officer and a lawyer. At its barest minimum, he is no stranger to the law. In preparing the Bids and Awards Committee resolutions and the supply contract in furtherance of the procurement, respondent made representations concerning MAPTRA's qualifications for which he must have reviewed the financial documents. This constituted practice of law and exercise of his judgment, entailing application of his legal knowledge, training, and experience.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> His duty was not ministerial as his legal training prompted him of the impropriety of the task at hand.<br><br>Respondent contends that he relied in good faith in the documents which his superior presented to him and was "not aware of any prohibition thereon."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> In preparing the Supply Contract, he claims that he indicated that "MAPTRA is a corporation, as can be gleaned from the documents."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Respondent is inconsistent. He cannot claim good faith in relying on the documents, unaware of an irregularity on its face, when he had foreknowledge of MAPTRA's ineligibility. In respondent's Comment before this Court, he claimed:<br><br><blockquote>It should herein be emphasized, that among the papers and documents PSSUPT Detran gave to herein Respondent are the incorporation papers of MAPTRA which was not presented during the negotiation conference conducted on 15 June 2009. Apparently, MAPTRA was in the process of incorporation during the period of negotiation. It is relevant to state, however, that it appears from the documents that MAPTRA maintained the same business facilities, address, and continued to engage in the same line and kind of business as the sole proprietorship.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></blockquote><br><br>Respondent's narration of facts in his Comment appears to be quoted from his Petition for Review before the Court of Appeals. Curiously, he omitted a damning statement:<br><br><blockquote>It should herein be emphasized that, among the papers and documents PSSUPT Detran gave to herein Respondent are the incorporation papers of MAPTRA which was not presented during the negotiation conference conducted on 15 June 2009. <b><i>In fact, [respondent] recalls that on 15 June 2009, MAPTRA claimed that it is a sole proprietorship owned by Mr. Larry B. De Vera.</i></b> Apparently, MAPTRA was in the process of incorporation during the period of negotiation, <b><i>of which fact, [respondent] is not certain if the NHQ-BAC was apprised at the time.</i></b> It is relevant to state, however, that it appears from the documents that MAPTRA maintained the same business facilities, address, and continued to engage in the same line and kind of business as the sole proprietorship.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br><br>MAPTRA's Certification of Incorporation presented to respondent indicated that it was issued on June 10, 2009.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> This is contrary to what he personally heard from a MAPTRA representative. Not only was respondent in attendance in the negotiation conference on June 15, 2009, but more importantly, respondent <b><i>knew </i></b>of MAPTRA's ineligibility and the apparent falsehood in the statement in the document he prepared. At minimum, there was an irregularity staring right at him. It seems that respondent <b><i>willfully </i></b>disregarded the facts before him and looked the other way. His foreknowledge of MAPTRA's ineligibility as a supplier warranted an inquiry into the transaction for which he was preparing the documents. He must have, at the very least, informed his superior of the patent irregularity.<br><br>As a defense, respondent harps on the Bids and Awards Committee Secretariat's administrative functions as defined by law. However, respondent's specific function does not appear on record. Nonetheless, it would be the height of ignorance to claim that he was not obligated as the Bids and Awards Committee Secretariat's <i>legal officer </i>to inform his superior of the <i>manifest legal infirmities </i>in the contract. Clearly, respondent was remiss in his basic duty, which, to my mind, does not have to be specifically delineated for him.<br><br>In effect, what respondent claims and the majority is prepared to accept is that he drafted the procurement documents without verifying the representations and statements declared there despite personal knowledge of their falsehood. As it was his superior's instruction, he prepared the documents unmindful of the supplier's financial documents under his custody and for his perusal. In conclusion, the majority is acquitting respondent high-ranking police officer-lawyer because his official function was to merely keep the supplier's documents safe and to unthinkingly prepare the procurement documents as instructed. I cannot condone this.<br><br>Respondent cannot claim failure to exercise judgment under the circumstances or worse, ignorance of the law he had sworn to obey. He failed to conduct himself as a lawyer according to the best of his knowledge and discretion, contrary to the solemn oath he had sworn to be admitted into the legal profession.<br><br>Moreover, respondent is a high-ranking public official.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> "Public office is a public trust."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> It involves a delegation of sovereign functions to an individual for the benefit of the public.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> No less than the Constitution demands a public officer's "utmost responsibility, integrity, loyalty, and efficiency"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> in the performance of one's duties. This, respondent failed to do.<br><br>Respondent cannot hide behind his superior's alleged instruction to disavow liability. As a public official, he performed the sovereign function of being the legal officer of the Philippine National Police Bids and Awards Committee Secretariat. He served the interest of the public, and not his superior's. Inept legal work of a public official exposes the public to unnecessary risks and as in this case, blatant corruption.<br><br>Lawyers cannot disabuse themselves of their inescapable duties as embodied in the Code of Professional Responsibility. They must perform their duties, at all times and in whatever capacity, in accordance with the dictates of the legal profession. To exculpate respondent from the administrative charge against him in the guise of having administrative and ministerial functions is to lessen the confidence reposed by the public in the fidelity, honesty, and integrity of the legal profession.<br><br>In <i>LRTA v. Salvaña,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> this Court discussed the administrative charge of serious dishonesty:<br><br><blockquote>Dishonesty has been defined "as the 'disposition to lie, cheat, deceive, or defraud; untrustworthiness, lack of integrity' . . . ." Since the utmost integrity is expected of public servants, its absence is not only frowned upon but punished severely.<br><br>Section 52, Rule IV of the URACCS provides:<br><br><blockquote>Section 52. <i>Classification of Offenses. </i>— Administrative offenses with corresponding penalties are classified into grave, less grave or light, depending on their gravity or depravity and effects on the government service.<br><br>A. The following are grave offenses with their corresponding penalties:<br><br>1. Dishonesty — 1st Offense — Dismissal<br><br>. . . .<br></blockquote><br>In <i>Remolona v. Civil Service Commission, </i>this court explained the rationale for the severity of the penalty:<br><br><blockquote>It cannot be denied that dishonesty is considered a grave offense punishable by dismissal for the first offense under Section 23, Rule XIV of the Rules Implementing Book V of Executive Order No. 292. And the rule is that dishonesty, in order to warrant dismissal, need not be committed in the course of the performance of duty by the person charged. <b>The rationale for the rule is that if a government officer or employee is dishonest or is guilty of oppression or grave misconduct, even if said defects of character are not connected with his office, they affect his right to continue in office. The Government cannot tolerate in its service a dishonest official, even if he performs his duties correctly and well, because by reason of his government position, he is given more and ample opportunity to commit acts of dishonesty against his fellow men, even against offices and entities of the government other than the office where he is employed; and by reason of his office, he enjoys and possesses a certain influence and power which renders the victims of his grave misconduct, oppression and dishonesty less disposed and prepared to resist and to counteract his evil acts and actuations.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> (Emphasis in the original, citations omitted)</blockquote></blockquote><br><br>The Rules on the Administrative Offense of Dishonesty defines dishonesty as "the concealment or distortion of truth, which shows lack of integrity or a disposition to defraud, cheat, deceive or betray and an intent to violate the truth."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Dishonesty is serious when it "causes serious damage and grave prejudice to the government."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Undoubtedly, the millions of public funds involved in this illegal dealing brought grave prejudice to the government.<br><br>A conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service is "any misconduct 'which need not be related or connected to the public officers' official functions but tends to tarnish the image and integrity of his/her public office.'"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> There is no need to belabor this point.<br><br>The "old boys club" is often used as metaphor for the existence of powerful but corrupt leadership in an agency. It describes an atmosphere where all public officers look the other way rather than evolve the courage to stand up and call attention to anomalies in their office. The "old boys club" syndrome survives on the reality that the impoverished masses who stand to benefit from the weeding out of corruption are not proximate. The "old boys club" thrives on both fear from the powerful and the institutionalization of powerlessness on the part of the other public offices in that office.<br><br>I disagree that a police superintendent could not have mustered the courage to do his constitutional and statutory duty to serve the people with "utmost responsibility, integrity, loyalty, and efficiency." Respondent saw that there was something amiss. He saw the anomaly, yet he chose to do nothing. In effect, he conspired.<br><br>To allow respondent to go free without liability is contrary to the value of his office and his rank. It is to allow the "old boys club" to continue.<br><br>Thus, I dissent.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo,</i> p. 299.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <i>Ponencia,</i> p. 9.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> <i>Rollo,</i> pp. 74-215.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Id. at 125.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Id. at 126-127.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Id. at 127.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Id.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Id. at 126-129.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> CODE OF PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY, Canon 1.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> <i>Villanueva v.
