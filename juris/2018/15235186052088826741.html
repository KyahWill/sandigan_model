CV No. 96662, which reversed and set aside the November 12, 2010 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Parañaque City, Branch 260, in Civil Case No. 07-0070.<br><br><b><i>Factual Antecedents</i></b><br><br>On Februruy 27, 2007, Maria Concepcion N. Singson a.k.a. Concepcion N. Singson (petitioner) filed a Petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> for declaration of nullity of marriage based on Article 36 of the Family Code of the Philippines<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> (Family Code). This was docketed as Civil Case No. 07-0070.<br><br>It was alleged therein that on July 6, 1974, petitioner and Benjamin L. Singson (respondent) were married before the Rev. Fr. Alfonso L. Casteig at St. Francis Church, Mandaluyong, Rizal; that said marriage produced four children, all of whom are now of legal age; that when they started living together, petitioner noticed that respondent was "dishonest, unreasonably extravagant at the expense of the family's welfare, extremely vain physically and spiritually,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> and a compulsive gambler; that respondent was immature, and was unable to perform his paternal duties; that respondent was also irresponsible, an easy-going man, and guilty of infidelity; that respondent's abnormal behavior made him completely unable to render any help, support, or assistance to her; and that because she could expect no help or assistance at all from respondent she was compelled to work doubly hard to support her family as the sole breadwinner.<br><br>Petitioner also averred that at the time she filed this Petition, respondent was confined at Metro Psych Facility,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> a rehabilitation institution in Pasig City; and that respondent's attending psychiatrist, Dr. Benita Sta. Ana-Ponio (Dr. Sta. Ana-Ponio), made the following diagnosis on respondent:<br><blockquote>Based on history, mental status examination and observation, he is diagnosed to be suffering from Pathological Gambling as manifested by:<br><br>a. preoccupation with gambling, thinking of ways to get money with which to gamble as seen in his stealing and pawning jewelries and appliances[;]<br><br>b. needs to gamble with increasing amounts of money in order to achieve the desired effect[;]<br><br>c. lies to family members or others to conceal the extent of [his] involvement with gambling[;]<br><br>d. committed illegal acts such as forging the signature of his wife, issuing bouncing checks in order to finance his gambling[;]<br><br>e. has jeopardized his relationship with his wife, lost the respect of his children, lost a good career in banking because of gambling[;]<br><br>f. [relies] on his parents, his wife, and siblings to provide money to relieve a desperate financial situation caused by gambling[;]<br><br>While he apparently had Typhoid fever that resulted [in] behavioral changes as a young boy, it would be difficult to say that the psychotic episodes he manifested in 2003 and 2006 [are] ethologically related to the general medical condition that occurred in his childhood.<br><br>Furthermore, [respondent] manifests an enduring pattern of behavior that deviates markedly from the expectations of our culture as manifested in the following areas:<br><br>a. his ways of perceiving and interpreting [his own] self, other people, and events[;]<br><br>b. his emotional response[;]<br><br>c. his poor impulse control[;]<br><br>Such pattern is inflexible and pervasive and has led to significant impairment in social, occupational and interpersonal relationship. In [respondent's] case, this has persisted for several years, and can be traced back [to] his adolescence since he started gambling while in high school. He is therefore diagnosed to be suffering from Personality Disorder.<br><br>All these[,] put together, [hinder respondent] from performing his marital obligations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioner moreover asserted that respondent came from a "distraught" family and had a "dysfunctional" childhood;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> that respondent had all the love, care, and protection of his parents as the youngest child for some time; but that these parental love, care and protection were, however, transferred to his youngest brother who was born when respondent was almost five years old; and that these factors caused respondent emotional devastation from which he never recovered.<br><br>Petitioner added that unknown to her, respondent even as a high school student, was already betting on jai alai. She also claimed that she tried to adjust to respondent's personality disorders, but that she did not attain her goal.<br><br>Finally, petitioner claimed that she and respondent did not enter into any ante-nuptial agreement to govern their property relations as husband and wife and that they had no conjugal assets or debts.<br><br>On June 19, 2007, respondent filed his Answer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Traversing petitioner's allegations, respondent claimed that "psychological incapacity" must be characterized by gravity, juridical antecedence, and incurability, which are not present in the instant case because petitioner's allegations are not supported by facts.<br><br>Respondent further averred that it was not true that he failed to render any help, support or assistance to petitioner and their family; that the family home where petitioner and their children are living was in fact his own capital property; that his shortcomings as mentioned by petitioner do not pertain to the most grave or serious cases of personality disorders that would satisfy the standards required to obtain a decree of nullity of marriage; that petitioner's complaint is nothing more than a complaint of a woman with an unsatisfactory marriage who wants to get out of it; that contrary to petitioner's claim that he is a good-for-nothing fellow, he has a college degree in business administration, and is a bank employee, and, that it was money problem, and not his alleged personality disorder, that is the wall that divided him and petitioner.<br><br>Respondent also claimed that petitioner failed to lay the basis for the conclusions of the psychiatrist to the effect that he is suffering from pathological gambling and personality disorder; that petitioner's allegation that he came from a distraught family and that he suffered emotional devastation is vague, and bereft of particular details, and even slanderous; and that assuming that he had not acted the way petitioner expected him to conduct himself, his actions and behavior are not psychological illnesses or personality disorders, but simply physical illnesses of the body, akin to hypertension and allied sicknesses, and that these physical illnesses are not at all incurable psychiatric disorders that were present at the time of his marriage with petitioner.<br><br>Respondent furthermore claimed that he and petitioner had conjugal assets and debts; that the land where their family home is built came from his earnings, hence the family home is their conjugal property; that he and petitioner also have a house and lot in Tagaytay City, as well as bank accounts that are in petitioner's name only; and he and petitioner also have investments in shares of stocks, cars, household appliances, furniture, and jewelry; and that these are conjugal assets because they came from petitioner's salaries and his (respondent's) own inheritance money.<br><br>Respondent moreover alleged that before the filing of the present Petition, petitioner had caused him to be admitted into the Metro Psych Facility for treatment; that on account of his confinement and treatment in this psychiatric facility, he has incurred medical expenses and professional medical fees; and that since it is petitioner who manages all their finances and conjugal assets it stands to reason that he should be awarded "spousal support."<br><br>On July 25, 2007, the RTC issued its Pre-Trial Order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Trial thereafter ensued.

Ana-Ponio convincingly showed that respondent is psychologically incapacitated to perform the essential marital obligations; that respondent's inability to perform his marital obligations as set out in Articles 68 to 71 of the Family Code, was essentially due to a psychological abnormality arising from a pathological and utterly irresistible urge to gamble.<br><br>The RTC cited "[Dr. Sta. Ana-Ponio's] findings [which] reveal that respondent is suffering from <b>Personality Disorder known as Pathological Gambling</b>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> It ruled that it has been shown that this personality disorder was present at the time of celebration of marriage but became manifest only later; that because of this personality disorder respondent had already jeopardized his relationship with his family; and that respondent's psychological disorder hinders the performance of his obligations as a husband and as a father.<br><br>Lastly, the RTC found that the only property owned in common by the spouses was donated in favor of the parties' children as evidenced by TCT No. 179751 - a fact not at all controverted, in view of respondent's waiver of his right to present evidence.<br><br>Respondent moved for reconsideration of this verdict.<br><br>But in its Order dated January 6, 2011,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> the RTC denied respondent's motion for reconsideration. It reiterated that the expert witness had adequately established that respondent is suffering from "Pathological Gambling Personality Disorder" which is grave, permanent, and has juridical antecedence.<br><br>On February 4, 2011, respondent filed a Notice of Appeal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> which was given due course by the RTC in its Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> dated February 28, 2011.<br><br><b><i>Ruling of the Court of Appeals</i></b><br><br>In its Decision of August 29, 2013, the CA overturned the RTC, and disposed as follows:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the appeal is GRANTED. The Decision dated 12 November 2010 issued by the Regional Trial Court, Branch 260, Parañaque City in Civil Case No. 07-0070, declaring the marriage between Maria Concepcion N. Singson and Benjamin L. Singson null and void <span style="font-style: italic;">ab initio</span>, is REVERSED AND SET ASIDE. Instead, the Petition for Declaration of Nullity of Marriage is DISMISSED.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br></blockquote>The CA held that the totality of evidence presented by petitioner failed to establish respondent's alleged psychological incapacity to perform the essential marital obligations, which in this case, was not at all proven to be grave or serious, much less incurable, and furthermore was not existing at the time of the marriage. What is more, the CA declared that any doubt should be resolved in favor of the existence and continuation of the marriage, and against its dissolution and nullity, in obedience to the mandate of the Constitution and statutory laws; and that in this case, petitioner failed to discharge the burden of proving that respondent is suffering from a serious or grave psychological disorder that completely disables or incapacitates him from understanding and discharging the essential obligations of the marital union.<br><br>According to the CA, psychological incapacity is the downright or utter incapacity or inability to take cognizance of and to assume the basic marital obligations. The CA did not go along with the RTC, which placed heavy reliance on Dr. Sta. Ana-Ponio's finding that respondent was psychologically incapacitated to perform the essential marital obligations due to a personality disorder known as pathological gambling. The CA held that, contrary to petitioner's claim that respondent's pathological gambling was grave or serious, the evidence in fact showed that the latter was truly capable of carrying out the ordinary duties of a married man because he had a job, had provided money tor the family from the sale of his own property, and he likewise provided the land on which the family home was built, and he also lives in the family home with petitioner and their children.<br><br>On top of these, the CA ruled that it is settled that mere difficulty, refusal or neglect in the performance of marital obligations, or ill will on the part of a spouse, is different from incapacity rooted in some debilitating psychological condition or illness; that the evidence at bar showed that respondent's alleged pathological gambling arose after the marriage; that in fact petitioner admitted that she was not aware of any gambling by respondent before they got married; that petitioner moreover acknowledged that respondent was a kind and a caring person when he was courting her; that petitioner likewise admitted that respondent also brought petitioner to the hospital during all four instances when she gave birth to their four children.<br><br>In other words, the CA found that respondent's purported pathological gambling was not proven to be incurable or permanent since respondent has been undergoing treatment since 2003 and has been responding to the treatment.<br><br>Petitioner moved for reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> of the CA's Decision. But her motion was denied by the CA in its Resolution of January 6, 2014.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br><center><b>Issue</b><br></center><br>Hence, the instant recourse with petitioner raising the following question - <br><blockquote>[WHETHER] THE [CA] ERRED IN REVERSING THE DECISION OF THE [RTC].<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br></blockquote><b><i>Petitioner's Arguments</i></b><br><br>In praying for the reversal of the assailed CA Decision and Resolution, and in asking for the reinstatement of the RTC Decision, petitioner argues in her Petition,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Reply,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; and Memorandmr<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> that respondent's psychological incapacity had been duly proved in court, including its juridical antecedence, incurability, and gravity.<br><br>First, petitioner maintains that respondent failed to perform the marital duties of mutual love, respect and support; that Dr. Sta. Ana-Ponio's expert findings are corroborated by the testimonies of petitioner end her son Jose both of whom demonstrated that respondents psychological incapacity is grave or serious rendering him incapable to perform the essential marital obligations; that for his part, respondent had adduced no proof that he (respondent) is capable of carrying out the ordinary duties required in a marriage for the reason that everything that the family had saved and built had been squandered by respondent; and that respondent's confinement at the rehabilitation facility is itself proof of the gravity or seriousness of his psychological incapacity.<br><br>Second, petitioner contends that respondent's psychological incapacity preceded the marriage, as shown in Dr. Sta. Ana-Ponio's Clinical Summary, which pointed out that such psychological incapacity, which included pathological gambling, can be traced back when respondent was already betting on <span style="font-style: italic;">jai alai</span> even in high school, and this was not known to his family; that the Clinical Summary was based on information provided not only by petitioner) but by respondent's sister, and by respondent himself; that such juridical antecedence was neither questioned nor overthrown by countervailing evidence; and that the root cause could be traced back to respondent's flawed relationship with his parent which developed into a psychological disorder that existed before the marriage.<br><br>Third, petitioner insists that this Court can take judicial notice of the fact that personality disorders are generally incurable and permanent, and must continuously be treated medically; that in this case&nbsp; the Clinical Summary had pointed out that respondent's understanding of his gambling problem is only at the surface level; and that in point of tact Dr. St.a. Ana-Ponio had affirmed that personality disorders are incurable.<br><br><b><i>Respondent's Arguments</i></b><br><br>In his Comment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> and Memorandum,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> respondent counters that the assailed CA Decision should be affirmed. He argues that. the grounds cited by petitioner are the self-same grounds raised&nbsp; by petitioner before the RTC and the CA; that petitioner's evidence indeed failed to prove convincingly that he (respondent) is psychologically incapacitated to comply with the essential marital obligations, hence there is no basis to declare the parties' marriage void <span style="font-style: italic;">ab initio</span>.<br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b><br></center><br>The Petition will not succeed.<br><br>It is axiomatic that the validity of marriage and the unity of the family are enshrined in our Constitution and statutory laws, hence any doubts attending the same are to be resolved in favor of the continuance and validity of the marriage and that the burden of proving the nullity of the same rests at all times upon the petitioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> "The policy of the Constitution is to protect and strengthen the family as the basic social institution, and marriage as the foundation of the family. Because of this, the Constitution decrees marriage as legally inviolable and protects it from dissolution at the whim of the parties."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Article 1 of the Family Code describes marriage as "a special contract of permanent union between a man and a woman entered into in accordance with law for the establishment of conjugal and family life" and as "the foundation of the family and an inviolable social institution."<br><br>In the instant case, petitioner impugns the inviolability of this social institution by suing out pursuant to Article 36 of the Family Code, which provides that:<br><blockquote>Art. 36. A marriage contracted by any party who, at the time of the celebration, was psychologically incapacitated to comply with the essential marital obligations of marriage, shall likewise be void even if such incapacity becomes manifest only after its solemnization. (As amended by Executive Order 227)<br></blockquote>Petitioner's case will thus be examined in light of the well-entrenched case law rulings interpreting and construing the quoted Article, to wit:<br><blockquote>'Psychological incapacity,' as a ground to nullify a marriage under Article 36 of the Family Code, should refer to no less than a mental - not merely physical - incapacity that causes a party to be truly incognitive of the basic marital covenants that concomitantly must be assumed and discharged by the parties to the marriage which, as so expressed in Article 68 of the Family Code, among others, include their mutual obligations to live together, observe love respect and fidelity and render help and support. There is hardly any doubt that the intendment of the law has been to confine the meaning of 'psychological incapacity' to the most serious cases of personality disorders clearly demonstrative of an utter insensitivity or inability to give meaning and significance to the marriage. In <i>Santos v. CA</i> (<i>Santos</i>), the Court first declared that psychological incapacity must be characterized by: (a) gravity (<i>i.e.</i>, it must be grave and serious such that the party would be incapable of carrying out the ordinary duties required in a marriage); (b) juridical antecedence (<i>i.e.</i>, it must be rooted in the history of the party antedating the marriage, although the overt manifestations may emerge only after the marriage); and (c) incurability (<i>i.e.</i>, it must be incurable, or even if it were otherwise, the cure would be beyond the means of the party involved). The Court laid down more definitive guidelines in the interpretation and application of Article 36 of the Family Code in <i>Republic of the Phils. v. CA</i>, x x x [also known as the Molina guidelines]. These guidelines incorporate the basic requirements that the Court established in Santos.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br></blockquote>In setting aside the RTC's ruling, the CA in this case held that petitioner failed to prove that respondent was psychologically incapacitated to comply with the essential marital obligations because she failed to establish that such incapacity was grave and serious, and that it existed at the time of the marriage, and that it is incurable. We agree.<br><br>At the outset, this Court is constrained to peruse the records because of the conflicting findings between the trial court and the appellate court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> We thus did peruse and review the records, and we are satisfied that the CA correctly found that respondent has the capability and ability to perform his duties as a husband and father as against the RTC's rather general statement that respondent's psychological or personality disorder hinders the performance of his basic obligations as a husband and a father.<br><br>We agree with the CA that the evidence on record does not establish that respondent's psychological incapacity was grave and serious as defined by jurisprudential parameters since "[respondent] had a job; provided money for the family from the sale of his property; provided the land where the family home was built on; and lived in the family home with petitioner-appellee and their children."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Upon the other hand, petitioner herself testified that respondent had a job as the latter "was working at a certain point."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> This is consistent with the information in Dr. Sta. Ana-Ponio's Clinical Summary and testimony, which were both included in petitioner's formal offer of evidence, respecting the parties' relationship history that petitioner and respondent met at the bank where petitioner was applying for a job and where respondent was employed as a credit investigator prior to their courtship and their marriage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>It is significant to note moreover that petitioner also submitted as part of her evidence a notarized summary dated February 18, 2010 which enumerated expenses paid for by the proceeds of respondent's share in the sale of his parents' home in Magallanes, Makati City which amounted to around P2.9 million. Although petitioner was insinuating that this amount was insufficient to cover the family expenses from 1999 to 2008, we note that she admitted under oath that the items for their family budget, such as their children's education, the payments for association dues, and for electric bills came from this money.<br><br>And no less significant is petitioner's admission that respondent provided the land upon which the family home was built, thus -<br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td colspan="2"><div

More than that, Dr. Sta.

And, although Dr. Sta. Ana-Ponio claimed to have interviewed respondent's sister in connection therewith, the latter did testify in court.

Nor is there basis for upholding petitioner's contention that respondent's family was "distraught" and that respondent's conduct was "dysfunctional"; again, there is no evidence to attest to this. These are very serious charges which must be substantiated by clear evidence which, unfortunately, petitioner did not at all adduce. Indeed, Dr. Sta. Ana-Ponio did not make a specific finding that this was the origin of respondent's alleged inability to appreciate marital obligations.<br><br>Needless to say, petitioner cannot lean upon her son Jose's testimony that his father's psychological incapacity existed before or at the time of marriage.
