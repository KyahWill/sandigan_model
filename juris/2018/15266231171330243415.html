With treachery, taking advantage of superior strength, with the aid of armed men, or employing means to weaken the defense, or of means or persons to insure or afford impunity;</p> <p> x x x x </p> <p>5. With evident premeditation[.] </p> <p>x x x x </p> </blockquote> <p> To successfully prosecute the crime of Murder, the following elements must be established: (<i>1</i>) that a person was killed; (<i>2</i>) that the accused killed him or her; (<i>3</i>) that the killing was attended by any of the qualifying circumstances mentioned in Article 248 of the RPC; and (<i>4</i>) that the killing is not parricide or infanticide.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> </p><p> In this case, and as correctly found by the courts <i>a quo</i>, the prosecution was able to establish a confluence of the foregoing elements, considering the following: (<em>1</em>) the victim Casipit was killed; (<em>2</em>) accused-appellant was positively identified as the one who killed him; (<em>3</em>) Casipit's killing was attended by treachery, a qualifying circumstance; and (<em>4</em>) the killing is neither parricide nor infanticide. </p><p> Accused-appellant's defense is focused on the possible uncertainty over his identification by Dalimoos, the eyewitness, as the victim's assailant. He insists that Dalimoos was mistaken in identifying him and may even have been coached to lie in his testimony. The Court is not convinced.</p><p> It should be emphasized that the testimony of a single witness, if positive and credible, as in the case of Dalimoos, is sufficient to support a conviction even in a charge of murder.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> On the witness stand, Dalimoos testified thus: </p><blockquote> <p> Assistant City Prosecutor Conos - Do you know a person by the name [of] Ferdinand Casipit? </p> <p>Dalimoos - Yes, ma'am, he is my childhood friend. </p> <p>Q - In the afternoon of December 31, 2010, where were you then? </p> <p>A - I was at the parking lot of Mc.

Dalimoos's testimony did not waver; neither did it suffer from any grave or material inconsistency as would strip away his credibility as an eyewitness to the crime.</p><p> Time and again, the Court has held that when the issues involve matters of credibility of witnesses, the findings of the trial court, its calibration of the testimonies, and its assessment of the probative weight thereof, as well as its conclusions anchored on said findings, are accorded high respect, if not conclusive effect. This is so because the trial court has the unique opportunity to observe the demeanor of witnesses and is in the best position to discern whether or not they are telling the truth. Hence, it is a settled rule that appellate courts will not overturn the factual findings of the trial court unless there is a showing that the latter overlooked facts or circumstances of weight and substance that would affect the result of the case. The foregoing rule finds an even more stringent application where the findings of the RTC are sustained by the CA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> As such, the Court finds no reason to depart from the assessment of the RTC, as affirmed by the CA, with respect to the probative value of Dalimoos's testimony in this case.</p><p> As regards the appreciation of the qualifying circumstance of treachery, the Court likewise concurs with the courts <i>a quo </i>in finding its presence in the commission of the crime.</p><p> Treachery is the direct employment of means, methods, or forms in the execution of the crime against persons which tends directly and specially to insure its execution, without risk to the offender arising from the defense which the offended party might make. The essence of treachery is that the attack is deliberate and without warning, done in a swift and unexpected way, affording the hapless, unarmed, and unsuspecting victim no chance to resist or escape. In order for treachery to be properly appreciated, two elements must be present: (<i>1</i>) at the time of the attack, the victim was not in a position to defend himself; and (<i>2</i>) the accused consciously and deliberately adopted the particular means, methods, or forms of attack employed by him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></p><p> The evidence in this case clearly show that the attack against Casipit was sudden, deliberate, and unexpected. He was completely unaware of any threat to his life as he was merely walking with accused-appellant on the date and time in question. Moreover, deliberate intent to kill Casipit can be inferred from the location and number of stab wounds he sustained, and even though he was able to run after the first stab wound, accused-appellant was able to subdue and stab him further, rendering him defenseless and incapable of retaliation. Hence, treachery was correctly appreciated as a qualifying circumstance in this case.</p><p> However, the Court is of a different view with respect to the purported presence of evident premeditation.</p><p> For evident premeditation to be considered as a qualifying or an aggravating circumstance, the prosecution must prove: (<em>a</em>) the time when the offender determined to commit the crime; (<em>b</em>) an act manifestly indicating that the culprit has clung to his determination; and (<em>c</em>) a sufficient lapse of time between the determination and execution, to allow him to reflect upon the consequences of his act and to allow his conscience to overcome the resolution of his will.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> </p><p> In this case, there is dearth of evidence to prove that accused-appellant had previously planned the killing of Casipit. Nothing has been offered to establish <i>when</i> and <i>how</i> he planned and prepared for the same, nor was there a showing that sufficient time had lapsed between his determination and execution. The Court stresses the importance of the requirement in evident premeditation with respect to the sufficiency of time between the resolution to carry out the criminal intent and the criminal act, affording such opportunity to coolly and serenely think and deliberate on the meaning and the consequences of what accused-appellant had planned to do, where the interval should be long enough for the conscience and better judgment to overcome the evil desire and scheme.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> In the stabbing of Casipit, this requirement is clearly wanting.</p><p> With respect to the defenses of denial and alibi proffered by accused-appellant, the Court - as with the courts <em>a quo</em> - rejects the same. Denial is an intrinsically weak defense that further crumbles when it comes face-to-face with the positive identification and straightforward narration of the prosecution witness, Dalimoos. Between an affirmative assertion which has a ring of truth to it and a general denial, the former generally prevails.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> On the other hand, for the defense of alibi to prosper, appellant must prove through clear and convincing evidence that not only was he in another place at the time of the commission of the crime but also that it was physically impossible for him to be at the scene of the crime.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> </p><p> Accused-appellant himself testified that on the date and time material to this case, he was outside a fastfood restaurant standing beside a parked car within the vicinity of the stabbing incident.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> As such, he failed to prove that it was physically impossible for him to be at the scene of the crime when the incident occurred. Therefore, his denial and alibi do not deserve credence.</p><p> In view of the foregoing disquisitions, the Court affirms the conclusion of the courts<em> a quo</em> that accused-appellant is indeed guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Murder, for which he is accordingly meted the penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua</em>. Furthermore, and conformably with prevailing jurisprudence,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> the amount of exemplary damages is increased from P30,000.00 to P75,000.00. All other monetary awards are affirmed. </p><p> <strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the appeal is <strong>DISMISSED</strong>. The Decision dated February 9, 2016 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 06481 finding accused-appellant Crisanto Cirbeto<i> y </i>Giray guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Murder, defined and penalized under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, is hereby <strong>AFFIRMED</strong> with <strong>MODIFICATION</strong> as to the amount of exemplary damages, which is increased to P75,000.00 in accordance with prevailing jurisprudence.
