Essentially, it ruled that the City of Manila's filing of the expropriation case to acquire the subject land constituted a supervening event that warranted the aforesaid suspension.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> </p><p> The Court disagrees. </p><p> There is no dispute that<em> at the time the assailed Orders were issued</em> the City of Manila had filed an expropriation case to acquire the subject land, and in fact, obtained a ruling in its favor. These occurrences notwithstanding, records fail to show that the City of Manila had either: (<strong>1</strong>) priorly posted the required judicial deposit in favor of petitioners in order to secure possession of the subject land, in accordance with Section 19<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> of the Local Government Code of 1991;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> or (<strong>2</strong>) paid the original landowners, <em>i.e.,</em> Carlos Tuason's living heirs (the petitioners herein),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> the adjudged final just compensation for the subject land so as to consider the expropriation process completed and consequently, effectuate the transfer of ownership to it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Thus, at the time the assailed Orders were issued, petitioners remained the owners of the subject land, and therefore were entitled to all the rights appurtenant thereto. </p><p> The Court, however, is at a quandary as to how the City of Manila's interest in the expropriation case bears any direct relation to respondents' interest in the ejectment cases, given that the latter were not, in any manner, shown to benefit from the expropriation of the subject property. A perusal of Ordinance No. 8274<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> which authorized the City Mayor of Manila to cause the acquisition of the subject land (in line with the on-site development<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> project of the city<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>) reveals that respondents have not been specifically named as beneficiaries, the expropriation having been made for the benefit of "the qualified members/beneficiaries of the San Andres and Silayan Alley Neighborhood Association, Inc.,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> of which they have not been shown to be members. Thus, even if the expropriation process be completed, it is <em>non sequitur</em> for respondents to claim<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> that they are automatically entitled to be beneficiaries thereof, for certain requirements must still be met and complied with.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Stated differently, absent any competent proof showing that respondents have been identified and registered as socialized housing program beneficiaries<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> for the particular locality/project, they cannot claim any right over the subject land on the basis of the said ordinance, on which the expropriation case is anchored. Consequently, the Court finds that respondents failed to establish the existence of any supervening event or overriding consideration of equity in their favor, or any other compelling reason, to justify the court a quo's issuance of the assailed Orders suspending the execution of its Consolidated Decision against them pending appeal. </p><p> A final point. The Court is not unaware of the fact that subsequent to the issuance of the assailed Orders, the City of Manila has already been issued a writ of possession in the expropriation case, which therefore authorizes it to take actual possession of the subject land. However, the Court discerns that the City of Manila is not a party to this case, given that it sprung from the ejectment cases which <i>essentially involve a dispute on the mere material possession of the subject land <u>only between the petitioners and respondents herein</u></i>. As earlier mentioned, respondents have no direct interest and hence, should not benefit from any ruling favoring the City of Manila in the expropriation case. Thus, under this limited context, the Court finds it proper to completely reverse the assailed Orders, and allow full execution of the Consolidated Decision insofar as the parties herein are concerned. Suffice it to say that nothing precludes the City of Manila from enforcing the writ of possession it obtained in the expropriation case to acquire physical possession of the subject property, which circumstance the Court, however, cannot presume at this point nor, in fact, properly consider without going beyond the parameters of this case. </p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.
