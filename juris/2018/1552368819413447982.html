In an Information<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> dated July 15, 2013, he was charged with illegal possession of marijuana, committed as follows:<br><blockquote>That on or about [the] 14<sup>th</sup> day of July 2013 in the City of Laoag and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously had in his possession, custody and control: two (2) sticks of dried Marijuana Leaves, a dangerous drug, with an aggregate weight of 0.3824 grams, without any license or authority to possess, in violation of the aforesaid law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br></blockquote>With the assistance of a counsel <i>de parte</i> and in the presence of a public prosecutor, Eanna pleaded "NOT GUILTY" in his arraignment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> He was allowed to post bail for his temporary liberty, but a hold departure order was issued to prevent him from leaving the Philippines and his passport was surrendered to the court for its custody in the course of the proceedings.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br><center><b><i>Version of the Prosecution</i></b><br></center><br>Aside from the sworn statements of other intended witnesses,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> the testimonies in open court of Security Screening Officer Dexter Suguitan (<i>SSO Suguitan</i>), Police Officer 3 Joel Javier (<i>PO3 Javier</i>), and PO1 Erald Terson (<i>PO1 Terson</i>) reveal as follows:<br><br>While on his break time around 7:00 p.m. on July 14, 2013, SSO Suguitan of the Department of Transportation - Office of Transportation Security (<i>OTS</i>), assigned at the initial security screening checkpoint of the Laoag City International Airport, was told by CAAP<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Security and Intelligence Flor Tamayo (<i>CSI Tamayo</i>) that the parking space in front of the departure area smelled like marijuana ("<i>agat sa marijuana</i>"). He suspected that Eanna was the one who smoked the illegal drug, recounting that at aroud 6:35 p.m. he saw a certain male Caucasian at the parking area lighting something unrecognizable as he was covering it with his palm. CSI Tamayo observed that whenever he would suck what he seemed to be smoking, no visible vapor would come out from his mouth.<br><br>However, SSO Suguitan dismissed CSI Tamayo's story as he thought that it would be impossible for a passenger to smoke marijuana at the airport. After a while, he returned to his post at the initial check-in area. Meanwhile, CSI Tamayo reported what he saw to PO2 Pancho Caole, Jr. (<i>PO2 Caole, Jr.</i>) and SSO Fidel Bal-ot (<i>SSO Bal-ot</i>) , who were manning the final screening area.<br><br>Later on, SSO Bal-ot directed SSO Suguitan to proceed to the final security checkpoint.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> The latter was instructed to conduct a pat down search on Eanna, who agreed. He was frisked while he raised his hands by stretching sideward to the level of his shoulders with palms open. When something was felt inside the pocket of his upper garment, he was asked to take it out. He then brought out a pack of Marlboro red from his left pocket, as well as a matchbox and another pack of Marlboro red from his right pocket. The pack of Marlboro red on his left hand contained cigarettes but the one on his right hand contained two (2) rolled sticks of what appeared to be dried marijuana leaves. SSO Suguitan knew it was marijuana because that was what CSI Tamayo earlier told him. He took the pack of Marlboro red containing the two rolled sticks of dried marijuana leaves and showed it to PO1 Peter Warner Manadao, Jr. (<i>PO1 Manadao, Jr.</i>) and other police personnel on duty. SSO Suguitan put them on the nearby screening table in front of Eanna and PO1 Manadao, Jr. The two rolled sticks of dried marijuana leaves were the only items placed thereon.<br><br>PO1 Udel Tubon<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> then called the attention of PO3 Javier, who was the investigator on duty of the Philippine National Police (<i>PNP</i>) - Aviation Security Group (<i>ASG</i>). PO1 Manadao, Jr., PO2 Caole, Jr., SSO Suguitan, and SSO Bal-ot were at the final checkpoint when he arrived. They told him that marijuana was found in Eanna's pocket. SSO Suguitan turned over to PO3 Javier the pack of Marlboro red containing the two rolled sticks of dried marijuana leaves. PO3 Javier then placed them on a tray, together with Eanna's other belongings. As the area started to become crowded, the seized items were brought by PO3 Javier to the PNP-ASG office. He was accompanied by SSO Suguitan and Eanna.<br><br>Together with PO3 Javier at the PNP-ASG office were Police Superintendent Diosdado Apias (<i>P/Supt. Apias</i>), PO1 Manadao, Jr., PO2 Caole, Jr., SSO Suguitan, SSO Bal-ot, and a certain SPO3 Domingo. While waiting for the arrival of the barangay officials, which took 15-20 minutes, the two rolled sticks of dried marijuana leaves were placed on the investigation table where everybody could look but not touch. Eanna was seated in front of the table, while the others guarded him. PO3 Javier then prepared the inventory. The two rolled sticks of dried marijuana leaves and other seized items were listed. The check-in baggage of Eanna was also inspected, but it only contained clothes and other personal belongings. The confiscation/inventory receipts were signed by PO3 Javier and SSO Suguitan, as well as two (2) officials of Barangay Araniw, Laoag City (Barangay Chairman Edilberto Bumanglag and Barangay Kagawad Benjamin Teodoro) and an ABS-CBN cameraman (Juanito Badua), who acted as witnesses. In their presence, as well as of Eanna, PO3 Javier marked the two rolled sticks of dried marijuana leaves as "<i>EO-1</i>" and "<i>EO-2</i>" and, thereafter, placed them inside a Ziploc re-sealable plastic bag. The guard of the PNP-ASG office, PO1 Terson, took pictures during the inventory and marking, while P/Supt. Apias prepared the requests for the medico-legal examination of Eanna and the laboratory examination of the two rolled sticks of dried marijuana leaves. The marking, physical inventory, and photographing were likewise witnessed by PO1 Manadao, Jr. and PO2 Caole, Jr., who executed a Joint Affidavit of Arrest with PO3 Javier.<br><br>Subsequently, Eanna was brought to the Governor Roque R. Ablan, Sr. Memorial Hospital for his medico-legal examination. PO3 Javier proceeded to the Ilocos Norte Provincial Crime Laboratory Office to submit the request for laboratory examination and the two rolled sticks of dried marijuana leaves. The request and the specimens were received by PO3 Padayao, the evidence custodian. Based on the qualitative examination conducted by Forensic Chemist Police Inspector Amiely Ann Luis Navarro (<i>P/Insp. Navarro</i>), which was reduced into writing, the specimens were found to be positive for the presence of marijuana.<br><br><center><b><i>Version of the Defense</i></b><br></center><br>At around 6:30 p.m. on July 14, 2013, Eanna was with his wife at the Laoag City International Airport for their Cebu Pacific flight bound for Manila. Since the x-ray machine operator at the initial security screening was not yet around, he left his wife in the line and smoked his pre-rolled tobacco and Marlboro cigarette outside, about 30 meters away. Ten minutes passed, he went back to the initial security checkpoint carrying his check-in and cabin luggage, camera bag, and some shopping bags. The airport police conducted a body search and examined his belongings. Afterwards, he proceeded to the final security check where he was inspected by a male "immigration officer" wearing a brown shirt. As a result, a red Marlboro cigarette pack, containing two pieces of rolled paper of flavored tobacco, was found in his possession.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> It was shown to him while he was in front of his wife. The cigarette pack was then put on the desk, on top of one of his luggage. A camera bag (containing a Sony camera, connecting cables, headphones, an MP3 player, cigarette paper, and a pack of Marlboro) was also searched. The officer got some tiny grains after sticking his fingers into the bag. He showed them to Eanna and asked what they were. The latter replied that they were flavored tobacco, which he has been smoking for the past 30 years. Despite the claim, the officer directed an airport police to bring Eanna to the police station that was about 150 meters away.<br><br>Together with his wife, Eanna was escorted by about five to six airport police. At the PNP-ASG office, his camera bag and other luggage arrived approximately 20 minutes later. They were placed on top of the table and stayed there for 30-45 minutes before the police started to search the contents and catalog the items. Prior to the inventory of the seized items, Eanna and his wife repacked their luggage as the latter still proceeded with her scheduled flight. Thereafter, with the permission of PO3 Javier, Eanna went outside the office to smoke as he waited for his Batac-based Filipino relatives who arrived approximately after two hours. While smoking outside, he could not see what was happening, if any, to his luggage and camera bag.<br><br>The camera crew of ABS-CBN arrived at almost 11:00 p.m. An asset from the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (<i>PDEA</i>) called Badua and told him to come to the PNP-ASG office. He went with an off-duty security guard of ABS-CBN Laoag City. There, he was allowed to cover the incident, which became the basis of a television news report.<br><br>The sticks of the alleged marijuana were shown to Eanna thrice - once at the airport and twice at the police station. On the second instance, he was shown two thin rolled sticks that were placed on top of the table in front of him. On the third time, however, he saw a thin and a fat rolled sticks made of paper that were different from what he was using.<br><br><center><b><i>RTC Ruling</i></b><br></center><br>After trial, Eanna was convicted of the crime charged. The <i>fallo</i> of the November 22, 2013 Decision states:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, accused Eanna O'Cochlain is hereby pronounced GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the charge of illegal possession of marijuana weighing 0.3824 gram and is therefore sentenced to suffer the indeterminate penalty of imprisonment of TWELVE (12) YEARS and ONE (1) DAY to FOURTEEN (14) YEARS and to pay a fine of THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND PESOS (P300,000.00).<br><br>The two sticks of marijuana subject hereof are confiscated, the same to be disposed in the manner that the law prescribes.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br></blockquote>The search conducted on Eanna and his subsequent arrest were upheld. According to the RTC, the search upon his person was not unreasonable but was actually an exception to the proscription against warrantless searches and seizures. It was justified as it proceeded from a duty or right that was enforced in accordance with the aviation rules and regulations to maintain peace, order and security at the airports. In fact, Eanna's plane ticket carried a proviso allowing airport authorities to check on his person and baggage pursuant to the requirement of Section 9 of R.A. No. 6235.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Moreover, another exception to the rule is consented warrantless search and seizure. In this case, Eanna agreed to the body pat down search that was requested by SSO Suguitan.<br><br>For the RTC, SSO Suguitan was a credible witness. It was observed that he was spontaneous in his testimony and that he appeared candid and truthful in his statements. There was nothing in his testimony or in the manner he testified that could arouse serious suspicion of lying. Some of his inconsistent statements, which the defense considered as irreconcilable, were insignificant and trivial as they do not impinge on any of the elements of the offense charged. Instead, the statements bolster SSO Suguitan's credibility as they were indicia of his unrehearsed testimony.<br><br>The RTC opined that Eanna's denial was not based on clear and convincing evidence; rather, it was bare and self-serving. His testimony was even fraught with incoherence and serious inconsistencies which he obviously committed as he desperately tried to show that what was taken from his possession was mere tobacco. Considering his flip-flopping testimony, his denial was not given credence and did not prevail over the credible testimony of SSO Suguitan and the unquestioned findings of the forensic chemist.<br><br>Finally, as to the chain of custody of the illegal drug seized, the RTC was satisfied that the prosecution was able to preserve the integrity and evidentiary value of the subject marijuana. It ruled:<br><blockquote>In this case, the Court does not doubt a bit that the two sticks of marijuana presented in evidence are the same sticks of marijuana confiscated from the accused. There was not only compliance by the airport authorities of the requirements of Section 21 of the law and its implementing rules and regulations, there is a complete account of the complete chain of custody of the two sticks of marijuana that negates any doubt that their integrity and evidentiary value have been preserved. As it has been established by the prosecution, upon being informed of the arrest of the accused, after SSO Suguitan had confiscated the two [sticks] of marijuana from the accused, PO3 Joel Javier, the duty police investigator at the airport at [the] time who was at the ramp outside the departure terminal was called and when he arrived at the place where the accused was accosted and was informed of the arrest of the accused, he took custody of the two sticks of marijuana which were then on the screening desk or table and invited the accused to the office of the PNP-CAAP Aviation Security Group located within the premises of the airport not far tram the departure terminal. There, PO3 Javier marked the two sticks of marijuana with E0-1 and. E0-2. Upon the arrival of two Barangay officials, Barangay Chairman Edilberto Bumanglag and Kagawad Benjamin Teodoro of Barangay Araniw, Laoag City which has territorial jurisdiction over the airport, and a member of the media in the person of Juanito Badua, a cameraman of ABS-CBN, Laoag, PO3 Javier also conducted the required inventory not only of the two sticks of marijuana but the other belongings of the accused contained in his luggage. In the course of the inventory, PO1 Erald Terson, also a member of the PNP­ Aviation Security Group, took pictures of the seized items as he was directed to do by their superior. Sometime later, as the accused was brought for medical examination, PO3 Javier was the one who brought the two sticks of marijuana together with the prepared letter request to the Ilocos Norte Provincial Crime Laboratory Office for examination. And to complete the chain, the prosecution established that at the said crime lab, the two sticks were received by PO3 Padayao who thereupon turned them over to the forensic chemist, Police Inspector Amiely Ann Navarro. As the Court takes judicial notice from the record of the case, the two sticks were finally submitted to court on July 19, 2013, received by the Branch Clerk of Court, Atty. Bernadette Espejo[,] who issued the corresponding Acknowledgment Receipt therefor.<br><br>Significantly relative to the chain of custody and as would have equally done by the other concerned witnesses such as forensic chemist Police Inspector Navarro who issued her written chemistry reports of the qualitative examinations she conducted on the specimens, and PO3 Padayao, both of the crime lab, SSO Suguitan[,] who discovered the two sticks of marijuana[,] identified the same in open court, pointing in the process the respective markings E0-1 and E0-2 that he witnessed to have been placed by the investigating police officer, PO3 Javier[,] which, after the inventory, the latter placed in a plastic bag (Ziploc). PO3 Javier himself also identified the two sticks of marijuana.<br><br>At this point, the Court is not oblivious of the fact that in his testimony SSO Suguitan initially claimed that he turned over the two sticks of marijuana to PO1 Manadao, Jr. But actually[,] as it can be clearly appreciated from the testimony of SSO Suguitan, the turn over that he said was merely the placing of the two sticks of marijuana on top of the table at the final screening area, in front of PO1 Manadao and the accused. In fact, as SSO Suguitan conoborated PO3 Javier, the two sticks of marijuana which were still on the screening desk were thereafter placed on a tray and PO3 Javier was the one who then actually took custody thereof as the accused was invited to the office of the PNP-CAAP Aviation Security Group. PO3 Javier himself, when he was asked by the defense if it was PO1 Manadao who turned over the specimens to him, categorically said, "No, sir, Mr. Dexter Suguitan."<br><br>Also, the Court cannot be amiss to point out that the two sticks of marijuana could not have been switched with another or contaminated while it was in the custody of PO3 Javier. While admitting that there were many things that they prepared while they were already in their office, he testified in effect that no such [thing] happened. The people there at the office were not examining the specimens, they were just looking and not holding it.<br><br>The Court at this point cannot but express its observation that PO3 Javier, just like SSO Suguitan, was equally credible. He was straightforward, consistent and candid in his testimony that it cannot in any way be considered suspect.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br></blockquote>Eanna moved to reconsider the RTC judgment, but it was denied; hence, a notice of appeal was filed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br><center><b><i>CA Ruling</i></b><br></center><br>Finding no cause to overturn the findings of fact and conclusions of law, the CA affirmed the assailed RTC Decision.<br><br>The CA affirmatively answered the issue of whether there was probable cause to justify the warrantless search of Eanna and the seizure of his belongings. It appreciated the prosecution's version that CSI Tamayo saw him smoking while out.side the departure area of the airport terminal. Although no smoke coming from his mouth was seen, CSJ Tamayo still smelled the scent of marijuana. Similar to the RTC ruling, the warrantless search and seizure was also valid because the search was conducted pursuant to a routine airport security procedure and Eanna voluntarily gave his consent thereto.</div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br></div><div align="JUSTIFY">It was likewise held that all the elements of the crime of illegal possession of dangerous drug were satisfactorily established. <i>First</i>, Eanna was caught in possession and custody of two sticks of marijuana on July 14, 2013 at the Laoag City International Airport during the routine search conducted by the airport authorities. <i>Second</i>, he failed to prove that he was authorized by law to possess the same. And <i>third</i>, he freely and consciously possessed the illegal drug.<br><br>The CA downplayed the alleged varying testimonies of the prosecution witnesses. As the RTC opined, the inconsistences raised by the defense were minor and trivial and could not affect the RTC's finding as to the credibility of the airport police officers.<br><br>Finally, anent the chain of custody rule, the CA regarded as specious Eanna's claim that the procedures set forth in Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165 were not followed. The testimony of SSO Suguitan was quoted and the ratiocination of the RTC was adopted to support the finding that the airport officials complied with the rule.<br><br>Eanna filed a motion for reconsideration, but it was denied on July 21, 2016.<br><br>Now before us, the Office of the Solicitor General manifested that it would no longer file a supplemental brief as it had exhaustively discussed the legal issues and arguments in its appeal brief before the CA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> On his part, Eanna filed a Supplemental Brief<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> to bolster his claim that there were gaps in the chain of custody of the alleged illegal drug seized. He argues that:<br><ol><li>PO3 Javier was not at the scene where Eanna was found in possession of the alleged illegal drug; thus, he had no personal knowledge of its possession by Eanna and its seizure by SSO Suguitan.<br><br></li><li>It was not made clear by the prosecution that the two sticks of rolled paper allegedly containing marijuana were marked immediately upon confiscation.<br><br></li><li>The drug evidence was rendered susceptible to alteration, tampering and swapping because the Ziploc where it was placed was not sealed by an adhesive tape or any means other than the natural, built-in re­sealable feature of the plastic bag.<br><br></li><li>The presence of the marking "JEP" on the two rolled sticks of alleged marijuana could not be explained and the marking made thereon compromised their integrity and physical appearance.<br><br></li><li>The presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty is unavailing because the police authorities deviated from the mandated procedure and offered no valid ground to show that their actuations were justified.<br></li></ol><div align="center"><b><i>Our Ruling</i></b><br></div><br>The judgment of conviction is affirmed.<br><br><b><i>Airport screening search is a constitutionally reasonable administrative search.</i></b><br><br>The search and seizure of an illegal drug during a routine airport inspection made pursuant to the aviation security procedures has been sustained by this Court in a number of cases.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> In the leading case of <i>People v. Johnson</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> we held:<br><blockquote>Persons may lose the protection of the search and seizure clause by exposure of their persons or property to the public in a manner reflecting a lack of subjective expectation of privacy, which expectation society is prepared to recognize as reasonable. Such recognition is implicit in airport security procedures. With increased concern over airplane hijacking and terrorism has come increased security at the nation's airports. Passengers attempting to board an aircraft routinely pass through metal detectors; their carry-on baggage as well as checked luggage are routinely subjected to x-ray scans. Should these procedures suggest the presence of suspicious objects, physical searches are conducted to determine what the objects are. There is little question that such searches are reasonable, given their minimal intrusiveness, the gravity of the safety interests involved, and the reduced privacy expectations associated with airline travel. Indeed, travelers are often notified through airport public address systems, signs, and notices in their airline tickets that they are subject to search and, if any prohibited materials or substances are found, such would be subject to seizure. These announcements place passengers on notice that ordinary constitutional protections against warrantless searches and seizures do not apply to routine airport procedures.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br></blockquote>Thus, while the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against <b>unreasonable</b> searches and seizures is guaranteed by Section 2, Article III of the 1987 Constitution,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> a routine security check being conducted in air<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> and sea<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> ports has been a recognized exception. This is in addition to a string of jurisprudence ruling that search and seizure may be made without a warrant and the evidence obtained therefrom may be admissible in the following instances: (1) search incidental to a lawful arrest; (2) search of a moving motor vehicle; (3) customs search; (4) seizure of evidence in "plain view"; (5) consented warrantless search; (6) "stop and frisk" search; and (7) exigent and emergency circumstance.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Notably, Section 2, Article III of the Constitution was patterned after the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Having been derived almost verbatim therefrom, the Court may turn to the pronouncements of the US Federal Supreme Court and State Appellate Courts, which are considered doctrinal in this jurisdiction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Like in our country, the circumstances under which a warrantless search, unsupported by probable cause, may be considered reasonable under the Fourth Amendment are very limited and that exceptions thereto are few specifically established and well delineated.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> In a similar way, the government bears the burden of proving that a warrantless search was conducted pursuant to an established exception to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>US courts have permitted exceptions to the Fourth Amendment when "special needs, beyond the normal need for law enforcement, make the warrant and probable cause requirement impracticable" such as work-related searches of government employees' desks and offices, warrantless searches conducted by school officials of a student's property, government investigators conducting searches pursuant to a regulatory scheme when the searches meet "reasonable legislative or administrative standards," and a State's operation of a probation system.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> The Fourth Amendment permits the warrantless search of "closely regulated" businesses; "special needs" cases such as schools, employment, and probation; and "checkpoint" searches such as airport screenings under the administrative search doctrine.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Searches and seizures are ordinarily unreasonable in the absence of individualized suspicion of wrongdoing.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> However, because administrative searches primarily ensure public safety instead of detecting criminal wrongdoing, they do not require individual suspicion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Where the risk to public safety is substantial and real, blanket suspicionless searches calibrated to the risk may rank as "reasonable."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> In particular, airport searches have received judicial sanction essentially because of the magnitude and pervasiveness of the danger to the public safety and the overriding concern has been the threat of death or serious bodily injury to members of the public posed by the introduction of inherently lethal weapons or bombs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Although the US Supreme Court has not specifically <i>held</i> that airport screening searches are constitutionally reasonable administrative searches, it has suggested that they qualify as such.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Airport security searches can be deemed lawful administrative searches because (1) these searches constitute relatively limited intrusions geared toward finding particular items (weapons, explosives, and incendiary devices) that pose grave danger to airplanes and air travelers; (2) the scrutiny of carry-on luggage is no more intrusive (in both its scope and intensity) than is necessary to achieve the legitimate aims of the screening process (that is, to ensure air travel safety); (3) airline passengers have advance notice that their carry-on luggage will be subjected to these security measures, thus giving passengers the opportunity to place their personal effects in checked luggage; (4) all passengers are subject to the same screening procedures; and (5) passengers are aware that they can avoid the screening process altogether by electing not to board the plane.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Moreover, abuse is unlikely because of its public nature.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>As a permissible administrative search, the scope of airport routine check is not limitless.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Airport screening procedures are conducted for two primary reasons: first, to prevent passengers from carrying weapons or explosives onto the aircraft; and second, to deter passengers from even attempting to do so.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> The oft-cited case of <i>United States v.

Skipwith</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> which ruled:<br><blockquote>Necessity alone, however, whether produced by danger or otherwise, does not in itself make all non-probable-cause searches reasonable. Reasonableness requires that the courts must weigh more than the necessity of the search in terms of possible harm to the public. The equation must also take into account the likelihood that the search procedure will be effective in averting the potential harm. On the opposite balance we must evaluate the degree and nature of intrusion into the privacy of the person and effects of the citizen which the search entails.<br><br>In undertaking our calculation of the weight to be accorded to these three factors in the case at bar - public necessity, efficacy of the search, and degree of intrusion - we need not reiterate what was said in <i>Moreno</i> about the dangers posed by air piracy; suffice it to say that there is a judicially-recognized necessity to insure that the potential harms of air piracy are foiled. The search procedures have every indicia of being the most efficacious that could be used. The group being screened is limited to persons with the immediate intention of boarding aircraft. Metal detectors, visual inspection, and rare but potential physical searches appear to this court to provide as much efficiency to the process as it could have.<br><br>On the other side of the judicial scales, the intrusion which the airport search imposes on the public is not insubstantial. It is inconvenient and annoying, in some cases it may be embarrassing, and at times it can be incriminating. There are several factors, however, which make this search less offensive to the searched person than similar searches in other contexts. One such factor is the almost complete absence of any stigma attached to being subjected to search at a known, designated airport search point. As one commentator has put it in the border search context, "individuals searched because of their membership in a morally neutral class have less cause to feel insulted . . . ." In addition, the offensiveness of the screening process is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the person to be searched must voluntarily come to and enter the search area. He has every opportunity to avoid the procedure by not entering the boarding area. Finally, the circumstances under which the airport search is conducted make it much less likely that abuses will occur. Unlike searches conducted on dark and lonely streets at night where often the officer and the subject are the only witnesses, these searches are made under supervision and not far from the scrutiny of the traveling public.<br><br>Moreover, the airlines, which have their representatives present, have a definite and substantial interest in assuring that their passengers are not unnecessarily harassed. The officers conducting the search under these circumstances are much more likely to be solicitous of the Fourth Amendment rights of the traveling public than in more isolated, unsupervised surroundings.<br><br>Our conclusion, after this tripartite weighing of the relevant factors, is that the standards for initiating a search of a person at the boarding gate should be no more stringent than those applied in border crossing situations. In the critical pre-boarding area where this search started, reasonableness does not require that officers search only those passengers who meet a profile or who manifest signs of nervousness or who otherwise appear suspicious. Such a requirement would have to assume that hijackers are readily identifiable or that they invariably possess certain traits. The number of lives placed at hazard by this criminal paranoia forbid taking such deadly chances. As Judge Friendly has stated:<br><blockquote>Determination of what is reasonable requires a weighing of the harm against the need. When the object of the search is simply the detection of past crime, probable cause to arrest is generally the appropriate test . . . . When the risk is the jeopardy to hundreds of human lives and millions of dollars of property inherent in the pirating or blowing up of a large airplane, the danger <i>alone</i> meets the test of reasonableness, so long as the search is conducted in good faith for the purpose of preventing hijacking or like damage and with reasonable scope and the passenger has been given advance notice of his liability to such a search so that he can avoid it by choosing not to travel by air.

Aukai</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> US case law had erroneously suggested that the reasonableness of airport screening searches is dependent upon the passenger's consent, either ongoing consent or irrevocable implied consent. It opined:<br><br>The constitutionality of an airport screening search, however, does not depend on consent, <i>see <u>Biswell</u></i><u>, 406 U.S. at 315</u>, and requiring that a potential passenger be allowed to revoke consent to an ongoing airport security search makes little sense in a post-9/11 world. Such a rule would afford terrorists multiple opportunities to attempt to penetrate airport security by "electing not to fly" on the cusp of detection until a vulnerable portal is found. This rule would also allow terrorists a low-cost method of detecting systematic vulnerabilities in airport security, knowledge that could be extremely valuable in planning future attacks. Likewise, given that consent is not required, it makes little sense to predicate the reasonableness of an administrative airport screening search on an irrevocable implied consent theory. Rather, where an airport screening search is otherwise reasonable and conducted pursuant to statutory authority, <u>49 U.S.C. § 44901</u>, all that is required is the passenger's election to attempt entry into the secured area of an airport. <i><u>See Biswell</u></i><u>, 406 U.S. at 315; 49 C.F.R. § 1540.107</u>.

Here, the reason for the non-observance with the rule is justified. Immediate marking, physical inventory, and photograph of the confiscated drug cannot be done at the final checkpoint area because it started to become crowded by the constant comings and goings of departing passengers. The seized items were fittingly brought by PO3 Javier to the PNP-ASG office where it was made sure that the barangay officials and a media man were in attendance to witness the regularity of the entire proceedings.<br><br>The peculiar situation in airports calls for a different treatment in the application of Section 21 (1) of R.A. No. 9165 and its IRR. To require all the time the immediate marking, physical inventory, and photograph of the seized illegal drug will definitely have a domino effect on the entire airport operation no matter how brief the whole procedure was conducted. Stuck passengers will cause flight delays, resulting not just economic losses but security threats as well. Besides, to expect the immediate marking, physical inventory, and photograph of the dangerous drug at the place of arrest is to deny the reality that the persons<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup> required by law to witness the procedure are unavailable at the moment of arrest. Unlike in a buy-bust operation which is supposed to be pre-planned and already coordinated in order to ensure the instant presence of necessary witnesses, arrests and seizures in airports due to illegal drugs are almost always spontaneous and unanticipated.<br><br>In our view, the period of waiting for the arrival of the witnesses did not affect the integrity and evidentiary value of the subject illegal drug, on the following grounds:<br><br><i>First</i>, the airport police ensured that only authorized personnel were inside the PNP-ASG office during the investigation. PO3 Javier claimed that he was with SPO3 Domingo, PO1 Manadao, Jr., PO2 Caole, Jr., SSO Suguitan, SSO Bal-ot, and P/Supt.

PO3 Javier testified that the two rolled sticks of dried marijuana leaves were placed on the investigation table where everybody could look but not hold.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup> Eanna could also see any attempt to switch or alter the evidence as he was seated just in front of the table while the others guarded him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup> Interestingly, instead of being concerned at the time of the risk of substitution, he even requested to smoke so he was allowed to go out of the PNP-ASG office.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup> Although the apprehending officers could have exercised a better judgment, they are under no obligation to explain why the accused was permitted to leave the office in order to smoke. Such fact should not be taken against them as the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are not automatically rendered infirmed. Certainly, we consider the totality of eircumstanees present in this case. Eanna's right to be presumed innocent until proven otherwise includes the constitutional right to enjoy his liberty, albeit in a restricted sense due to his arrest. He retains his (limited) freedom of movement during the course of the investigation. Likewise, it must be added that the natural tendeney of an innocent person aceused of committing a crime is not to rest easy by ensuring that the evidence being used against him is not altered, tampered or swapped. In this case, Eanna's resolve to smoke outside notwithstanding a pending concern either shows that he was adamant in his claim that what was confiscated from him were merely flavored tobaeco or that he was already resigned to the fact that he was busted possessing marijuana. The Court cannot speeulate or engage in guesswork.<br><br>And <i>third</i>, the plausibility of tampering with the evidence is nil as the airport police were preoccupied in accomplishing the necessary documentation relative to the arrest and seizure.

It is precisely for [this] reason that the two sticks of marijuana [appear] to have been submitted to the crime lab only at 12:50 a.m. of the following day, July 15, 2013."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup><br><br>It has been raised that the drug evidence should have been placed in a sealed container. Eanna asserts that the evidence was rendered susceptible to alteration, tampering and swapping because the Ziploc was not sealed by an adhesive tape or any means other than the natural, built-in re-sealable feature of the plastic bag. Contrary to his allegation, however, the specimens that were submitted to the RTC were actually placed in a big transparent re­sealable Hefty One Zip plastic bag sealed with a masking tape with markings.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[121]</sup> Even if there is truth to his representation, the specimens contained in the Ziploc re-sealable plastic bag that were marked, tested, and presented in court were positively identified by SSO Suguitan and PO3 Javier, who both testified under oath, as the same two rolled sticks of dried marijuana leaves that were seized from Eanna. Raising a mere possibility is not enough. Eanna should have shown with particularity how the drug evidence was altered, tampered or swapped. The nature of illegal drugs as fungible things is not new to him. He is not a stranger to prohibited drugs, claiming to be familiar with marijuana since he is employed or attached to a drug addiction center and has been in 22 different countries and spent hours in customs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup> As the RTC opined, he could have submitted for laboratory examination the tiny grains of dried leaves and seeds that were found in his camera bag in order to prove that the alleged sticks of marijuana seized from him were in fact flavored tobacco that he used to smoke all the time.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup><br><br>The same reasoning as above can be said even if we are to admit that PO3 Padayao placed his own marking on the specimens he received from PO3 Javier and before he turned them over to the forensic chemist. A marking made on the corpus delicti itself is not automatically considered a form of contamination which irreversibly alters its physical state and compromises its integrity and evidentiary value.<br><br>Where a defendant identifies a defect in the chain of custody, the prosecution must introduce sufficient proof so that the judge could find that the item is in substantially the same condition as when it was seized, and may admit the item if there is a reasonable probability that it has not been changed in important respects.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[124]</sup> However, there is a presumption of integrity of physical evidence absent a showing of bad faith, ill will, or tampering with the evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[125]</sup> Merely raising the possibility of tampering or misidentification is insufficient to render evidence inadmissible.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[126]</sup> Absent some showing by the defendant that the evidence has been tampered with, it will not be presumed that those who had custody of it would do so.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[127]</sup> Where there is no evidence indicating that tampering with the exhibits occurred, the courts presume that the public officers have discharged their duties properly.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[128]</sup><br><br>In this jurisdiction, it has been consistently held that considering that the integrity of the evidence is presumed to be preserved unless there is a showing of bad faith, ill will, or proof that the evidence has been tampered with, the defendant bears the burden to show that the evidence was tampered or meddled with to overcome a presumption of regularity in the handling of exhibits by the public officers and a presumption that the public officers properly discharge their duties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[129]</sup> <i>People v.

Thus:<br><blockquote>The dissent agreed with accused-appellant's assertion that the police operatives failed to comply with the proper procedure in the custody of the seized drugs. It premised that <b>non-compliance with the procedure in Section 21 (a), Article II of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of Republic Act No. 9165 creates an irregularity and overcomes the presumption of regularity accorded police authorities in the performance of their official duties</b>. This assumption is without merit.<br><br><b>First, it must be made clear that in several cases decided by the Court, failure by the buy-bust team to comply with said section did not prevent the presumption of regularity in the performance of duty from applying.</b><br><br><b>Second, even prior to the enactment of R.A. 9165, the requirements contained in Section 21 (a) were already there per Dangerous Drugs Board Regulation No. 3, Series of 1979.

This Court ratiocinated in <i>People v.

For evidence to be inadmissible, there should be a law or rule which forbids its reception. If there is no such law or rule, the evidence must be admitted subject only to the evidentiary weight that will [be] accorded [to] it by the courts. x x x<br><br>We do not find any provision or statement in said law or in any rule that will bring about the non-admissibility of the confiscated and/or seized drugs due to non-compliance with Section 21 of Republic Act No. 9165. The issue therefore, if there is non-compliance with said section, is not of admissibility, but of weight - evidentiary merit or probative value - to be given the evidence. The weight to be given by the courts on said evidence depends on the circumstances obtaining in each case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[142]</sup> (Italics in the original.)<br></blockquote>We restated in <i>People v. Moner</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[143]</sup> that if the evidence of illegal drugs was not handled precisely in the manner prescribed by the chain of custody rule, the consequence relates not to inadmissibility that would automatically destroy the prosecution's case but rather to the weight of evidence presented for each particular case. The saving clause under Section 21 (1) of R.A. No. 9165 recognizes that the credibility of the prosecution's witnesses and the admissibility of other evidence are well within the power of trial court judges to decide. The Court went on to state that under the doctrine of separation of powers, it is important to distinguish if a matter is a proper subject of the rules of evidence, which are promulgated by the Court pursuant to paragraph (5), Section 5, Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution, or if it is a subject of substantive law, which is passed by an act of Congress. Taking into account the distinction in criminal law that a substantive law declares what acts are crimes and prescribes the punishment for committing them while a procedural law provides or regulates the steps by which one who commits a crime is to be punished, it was concluded that the chain of custody rule is a matter of evidence and a rule of procedure; therefore, it is the Cmni which has the last say regarding the appreciation of evidence.<br><br>Certainly, the chain of custody rule is a matter of evidence and a rule of procedure, it being ultimately anchored on the weight and admissibility of evidence which the courts have the exclusive prerogative to decide. Any missing link, gap, doubt, challenge, break, problem, defect or deficiency in the chain of custody goes to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[144]</sup> Once admitted, the court evaluates it and, based thereon, may accept or disregard the evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[145]</sup> In <i>People v. Sipin</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[146]</sup> this Court, through the <i>ponente</i>, recently conveyed:<br><blockquote>At this point, it is not amiss for the <i>ponente</i> to express his position regarding the issue of which between the Congress and the Judiciary has jurisdiction to determine sufficiency of compliance with the rule on chain of custody, which essentially boils down to the application of procedural rules on admissibility of evidence. In this regard, the <i>ponente</i> agrees with the view of Hon. Associate Justice Teresita J. Leonardo-De Castro in <i>People v. Teng Moner y Adam</i> that "if the evidence of illegal drugs was not handled precisely in the manner prescribed by the chain of custody rule, the consequence relates not to inadmissibility that would automatically destroy the prosecution's case but rather to the weight of evidence presented for each particular case." As aptly pointed out by Justice Leonardo-De Castro, the Court's power to promulgate judicial rules, including rules of evidence, is no longer shared by the Court with Congress.<br><br>The <i>ponente</i> subscribes to the view of Justice Leonardo-De Castro that the chain of custody rule is a matter of evidence and a rule of procedure, and that the Court has the last say regarding the appreciation of evidence. Evidentiary matters are indeed well within the powers of courts to appreciate and rule upon, and so, when the courts find appropriate, substantial compliance with the chain of custody rule as long as the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items have been preserved may wanant the conviction of the accused.<br><br>The <i>ponente</i> further submits that <b>the requirements of marking the seized items, conduct of inventory and taking photograph in the presence of a representative from the media or the DOJ and a local elective official, are police investigation procedures which call for administrative sanctions in case of non-compliance. Violation of such procedure may even merit penalty under R.A. No. 9165</b>, to wit:<br><blockquote><b>Section 29.</b> <i>Criminal Liability for Planting of Evidence</i>. - Any person who is found guilty of "planting" any dangerous drug and/or controlled precursor and essential chemical, regardless of quantity and purity, shall suffer the penalty of death.<br><br><b>Section 32.</b> <i>Liability to a Person Violating Any Regulation Issued by the Board</i>. - The penalty of imprisonment ranging from six (6) months and one (1) day to four (4) years and a fine ranging from Ten thousand pesos (P10,000.00) to Fifty thousand pesos (P50,000.00) shall be imposed upon any person found violating any regulation duly issued by the Board pursuant to this Act, in addition to the administrative sanctions imposed by the Board.<br></blockquote>However, non-observance of such police administrative procedures should not affect the validity of the seizure of the evidence, because the issue of chain of custody is ultimately anchored on the admissibility of evidence, which is exclusively within the prerogative of the courts to decide in accordance with the rules on evidence. (Emphasis and italics in the original)<br></blockquote>Strict compliance with the requirements of Section 21 (1) of R.A.

While both State intrusions are valid even without a warrant, the underlying reasons for the absence of a warrant are different. A reasonable search arises from a reduced expectation of privacy, for which reason Section 2, Article III of the Constitution finds no application. Examples include searches done at airports, seaports, bus terminals, malls, and similar public places. In contrast, a warrantless search is presumably an "unreasonable search," but for reasons of practicality, a search warrant can be dispensed with. Examples include search incidental to a lawful arrest, search of evidence in plain view, consented search, and extensive search of a private moving vehicle.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br></blockquote>Nonetheless, for an inspection of passengers and their belongings under routine security procedures to be a valid reasonable search, certain conditions must be met.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> In <i>Saluday</i>:<br><blockquote>In both situations, the inspection of passengers and their effects prior to entry at the bus terminal and the search of the bus while in transit must also satisfy the following conditions to qualify as a valid reasonable search. First, as to the manner of the search, it must be the least intrusive and must uphold the dignity of the person or persons being searched, minimizing, if not altogether eradicating, any cause for public embarrassment, humiliation or ridicule. Second, neither can the search result from any discriminatory motive such as insidious profiling, stereotyping and other similar motives. In all instances, the fundamental rights of vulnerable identities, persons with disabilities, children and other similar groups should be protected. Third, as to the purpose of the search, it must be confined to ensuring public safety. Fourth, as to the evidence seized from the reasonable search, courts must be convinced that precautionary measures were in place to ensure that no evidence was planted against the accused.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br></blockquote>If the conditions are not met, then an initially reasonable search will be unreasonable.<br><br>The purpose of the search must be confined to ensuring public safety. This Court has recognized that increasing concerns over terrorism and other imminent threats to life warrant additional safety measures in public places, including the implementation of security procedures, inspections, and searches.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>However, if there is no imminent threat to life, there must be probable cause that a crime is being, or has been committed to make the search reasonable. In <i>Dela Cruz v. People</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><blockquote>The presentation of petitioner's bag for x-ray scanning was voluntary. Petitioner had the choice of whether to present the bag or not. He had the option not to travel if he did not want his bag scanned or inspected. X-ray machine scanning and actual inspection <i>upon showing of probable cause that a crime is being or has been committed are part of reasonable security regulations to safeguard the passengers passing through ports or terminals</i>. Probable cause is:<br><blockquote>reasonable ground of suspicion supported by circumstances sufficiently strong in themselves to induce a cautious man to believe that the person accused is guilty of the offense charged. It refers to the existence of such facts and circumstances that can lead a reasonably discreet and prudent man to believe that an offense has been committed, and that the items, articles or objects sought in connection with said offense or subject to seizure and destruction by law are in the place to be searched.<br></blockquote>It is not too burdensome to be considered as an affront to an ordinary person's right to travel if weighed against the safety of all passengers and the security in the port facility.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted)<br></blockquote>This Court has, in several instances, upheld the validity of searches under routine security procedures, resulting in convictions for possession of illegal items because there had been probable cause.<br><br>In <i>People v.

A search of the bag revealed firearms and explosives.<br><br>Here, it is undisputed that there was no imminent threat to life that warranted the search of the accused. He passed through routine airport security procedures at the Laoag City International Airport. At the final security check, he went through a pat-down search conducted by Security Screening Officer Dexter Suguitan (Suguitan), upon which two (2) cigarette packs were found in his possession. One (1) pack contained hand-rolled cigarette sticks. The accused explained that this was hand-rolled tobacco, but Suguitan stated that he knew the sticks had dried marijuana leaves.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Unlike in <i>Sales</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> the accused here did not act suspiciously during the routine inspection to believe that he was committing, or had committed an offense. No metal detectors or x-ray machines were triggered, and the pat­ down of the accused did not yield any suspicious materials apart from hand­ rolled cigarettes.<br><br>Notably, Suguitan claimed that he knew the sticks were marijuana because Security and Intelligence Flor Tamayo, of the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines, had earlier told him that he saw a Caucasian man smoking at the parking space in front of the airport departure area. The area smelled like marijuana, even though no smoke came out of the man's mouth.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Suguitan himself did not know of any suspicious activities of the accused that would have warranted his conclusion that the accused's hand­ rolled cigarettes contained marijuana.<br><br>To emphasize, probable cause that a crime is or has been committed requires "reasonable ground of suspicion supported by circumstances sufficiently strong in themselves to induce a cautious man to believe that the person accused is guilty of the offense charged."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> The mere possession of hand-rolled cigarettes is not by itself suspicious. Likewise, hearsay tips or secondhand knowledge of allegedly suspicious behavior cannot be a ground to believe that a person is committing or has committed a crime. For a valid finding of probable cause, law enforcers and their agents must have, based on observation, personally known the facts of the commission of a crime.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br><center><b>II</b><br></center><br>For the majority, the integrity of the evidence is presumed to be preserved unless there is bad faith, ill will, or proof of tampering, to which the defendant has the burden of showing.

Neither the express text of the provision nor its implementing rules and regulations carve out an exception for airport searches. This Court has consistently evaluated the integrity of dangerous drugs seized during such searches, as well as the preservation of the chain of custody, against the mandatory requirements of Section 21.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Despite the majority's citation of United States jurisprudence on the establishment of chain of custody on a rational basis,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> this Court has consistently held that the illegal drug's identity must be proved with moral certainty, "established with the same degree of certitude as that needed to sustain a guilty verdict."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> The four (4) links in the chain of custody of the confiscated item must be established:<br><blockquote>Thus, the following links should be established in the chain of custody of the confiscated item: first, the seizure and marking, if practicable, of the illegal drug recovered from the accused by the apprehending officer; second, the turnover of the illegal drug seized by the apprehending officer to the investigating officer; third, the turnover by the investigating officer of the illegal drug to the forensic chemist for laboratory examination; and fourth, the turnover and submission of the marked illegal drug seized from the forensic chemist to the court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> (Citation omitted)<br></blockquote>The presumption of regularity of performance of official duty only arises when it can be shown that the apprehending officer followed the requirements in Section 21 of Republic Act No. 9165, or met the conditions for the saving clause in the Implementing Rules and Regulations of Republic Act No. 9165.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> As to the latter:<br><blockquote>All the above requirements must be complied with for a successful prosecution for the crime of illegal sale and possession of drugs under Sections 5 and 11 of RA 9165. Any deviation in the mandatory procedure must be satisfactorily justified by the apprehending officers. Under Section 21 of the IRR, the Court may allow deviation from the procedure only where the following requisites concur: (a) the existence of justifiable grounds to allow departure from the rule on strict compliance; and (b) the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending team. If these two elements are present, the seizure and custody over the confiscated items shall not be rendered void and invalid.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> (Citation omitted)<br></blockquote>Here, several deviations from the procedures in Section 21 of Republic Act No. 9165 cast in doubt the links in the chain of custody of the seized items. First, Suguitan made no immediate marking, physical inventory, and photograph of the seized items.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Instead, the seized items were merely placed on a screening table at the final checkpoint area.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Second, there was no immediate turnover of the seized items from Suguitan to Police Officer 3 Joel Javier, the investigator on duty for the Philippine National Police-Airport Security Group.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Moreover, it was Javier, instead of Suguitan, who marked the seized items with "EO-1" and "EO-2," and inventoried them in the presence of two (2) barangay officials and a member of the media.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Justifying these deviations, the majority pointed out that the apprehending officers could not have observed the rule due to the crowded final checkpoint area. This made it necessary for the seized items to be brought to the Philippine National Police-Airport Security Group office. The delay in the inventory, marking, and even turnover of the seized items to the forensic laboratory were all justified as the apprehending officers' preoccupation with accomplishing the necessary documentation for the arrest and seizure.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>However, the integrity of the items' initial seizure and marking, and their turnover have already been put in doubt. No explanation was made as to why Suguitan did not immediately turn over the seized items to Javier, despite allegedly being present when Javier arrived. Why the seized items were merely placed on a table at the final checkpoint area, a public space that the majority noted was crowded with departing passengers, instead of being immediately marked by Suguitan under Section 21 of Republic Act No. 9165, was also inadequately explained.<br><br>The accused leaving to smoke,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> while the seized items remained in the Philippine National Police-Airport Security Group office, does not mitigate the noncompliance of the apprehending officers with the requirements of Section 21 of Republic Act No. 9165. It should have been the apprehending officers who were made to explain why the accused was permitted to leave the office, even if the inventory and turnover of the seized items had not been completed.<br><br>Considering the doubts raised not only on why the officers here failed to strictly comply with Section 21 of Republic Act No. 9165, but also on the integrity of the chain of custody over the seized items, the presumption of regularity must be negated.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> In <i>Mallillin v. People</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><blockquote>Given the foregoing deviations of police officer Esternon from the standard and normal procedure in the implementation of the warrant and in taking post-seizure custody of the evidence, the blind reliance by the trial court and the Court of Appeals on the presumption of regularity in the conduct of police duty is manifestly misplaced. <i>The presumption of regularity is merely just that - a mere presumption disputable by contrary proof and which when challenged by the evidence cannot be regarded as binding truth. Suffice it to say that this presumption cannot preponderate over the presumption of innocence that prevails if not overthrown by proof beyond reasonable doubt. In the present case the lack of conclusive identification of the illegal drugs allegedly seized from petitioner, coupled with the irregularity in the manner by which the same were placed under police custody before offered in court, strongly militates a finding of guilt.</i><br><br>In our constitutional system, basic and elementary is the presupposition that the burden of proving the guilt of an accused lies on the prosecution which must rely on the strength of its own evidence and not on the weakness of the defense. The rule is invariable whatever may be the reputation of the accused, for the law presumes his innocence unless and until the contrary is shown. <i>In dubio pro reo</i>. When moral certainty as to culpability hangs in the balance, acquittal on reasonable doubt inevitably becomes a matter of right.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)<br></blockquote>The doubts on the existence of probable cause for the search and seizure of the confiscated drugs, and the noncompliance with the mandatory requirements in Section 21 of Republic Act No. 9165 should be resolved in favor of the accused.<br><br><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, I vote to <b>ACQUIT</b> respondent Eanna O'Cochlain of possession of illegal drugs under Article II, Section 11 of Republic Act No. 9165.
