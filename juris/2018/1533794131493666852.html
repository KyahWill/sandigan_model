Furthermore, petitioner reiterates that respondent is liable for deficiency income tax for taxable year 2003 because respondent erroneously carried over the amount of P16,194,108.00 as prior year's excess credits, to which it is not entitled, to the succeeding taxable year 2003.</p><p align="center"> <b><u>The Issues</u></b> </p><p>Petitioner raises the following issues: </p><ol><li> Whether respondent is entitled to a tax credit certificate in the amount of P2,083,878.07, representing respondent's excess creditable taxes for taxable year 2002; and <br><br></li><li>Whether respondent is liable for deficiency income tax for taxable year 2003.</li></ol> <p align="center"> <b><u>The Court's Ruling</u></b> </p><p> The petition is partly meritorious. </p><p> The requisites for claiming a refund of excess creditable withholding taxes are: (l) the claim for refund was filed within the two-year prescriptive period; (2) the fact of withholding is established by a copy of a statement duly issued by the payor (withholding agent) to the payee, showing the amount of tax withheld therefrom; and (3) the income upon which the taxes were withheld was included in the income tax return of the recipient as part of the gross income.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> </p><p> Respondent complied with all the requisites, albeit the CTA First Division found some discrepancies with the claimed refund and the amount to which respondent is entitled for refund.</p><p> First, respondent filed the claim for refund within the two-year prescriptive period. As found by the CTA First Division and CTA <i>En Banc</i>, respondent filed its claim for refund with the BIR on 4 March 2005 and the Petition for Review before the CTA on 15 April 2005, which both fell within the two-year prescriptive period counting from the date respondent filed its ITR on 15 April 2003.</p><p> Second, as proof of taxes withheld, respondent submitted the Certificate Authorizing Registration, Withholding Tax Remittance Returns, and Certificates of Creditable Tax Withheld at Source, upon which the Independent CPA based his report.</p><p> Third, respondent submitted its amended 2002 ITR to show that the income upon which the taxes were withheld was included in its ITR. However, upon comparison with the Certificates of Creditable Tax Withheld at Source and Withholding Tax Remittance Returns, the CTA First Division and the CTA <i>En Banc</i> found certain discrepancies and held that out of the total claimed CWT of P15,877,961.02, respondent was only able to provide valid proofs of withholding for the amount of P15,752,461.03.</p><p> Thus, the CTA First Division correctly held that respondent is entitled to a refundable excess tax credits of P2,083,878.07 after deducting the substantiated prior year's excess credits (P288,076.04) and the substantiated CWT (P15,752,461.03) from the total tax due (P13,956,659.00).</p><p> However, as pointed out by petitioner, respondent erroneously carried over the amount of P16,194,108.00 as prior year's excess credits, to which it is not entitled, to the succeeding taxable year 2003 as shown in respondent's Annual ITR for the year 2003.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> The fact that respondent carried over the amount of P16,194,108.00 as prior year's excess credits to the succeeding taxable year 2003 was even mentioned in the Decision dated 10 November 2008 of the CTA First Division.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> It should be stressed that the amount of P16,194,108.00 is the remaining portion of the claimed prior year's excess credits in the amount of P30,150,767.00 after deducting the P13,956,659.00 tax due in respondent's amended ITR for taxable year 2002. <b>But the CTA First Division categorically ruled that respondent (petitioner therein) failed to substantiate its prior year's excess credits of P30,150,767.00 except for the amount of P288,076.04, which can be applied against respondent's income tax liability for taxable year 2002. </b>The CTA First Division stated: </p><blockquote> <p> Petitioner [Cebu Holdings, Inc.] alleges that no amount of the creditable taxes withheld in taxable year 2002 was utilized since its prior year's excess credits of P30,150,7[6]7.00 were more than enough to offset its income tax liability for taxable year 2002 in the amount of P13,956,659.00.</p> <p> <b>However, petitioner failed to substantiate its prior year's excess credits of P30,150,7[6]7.00, save for the amount of P288,076.04</b>, computed as follows:</p> <p> x x x x</p> <p> <b>In sum, out of the reported prior year's excess credits of P30,150,7[6]7.00, only the amount of P288,076.04 shall be applied against the income tax liability for taxable year 2002 in the amount of P13,956,659.00. </b>The remaining income tax liability of P13,668,582.96 shall be offset against the substantiated creditable taxes withheld in taxable year 2002 in the amount of P15,752,461.03, leaving a refundable excess tax credits of only P2,083,878.07 x x x.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> Such categorical pronouncement of the CTA First Division affects respondent's claim for excess creditable income taxes which can be carried over to succeeding taxable years. Thus, when the CTA First Division denied respondent's Motion for Partial Reconsideration of the Decision dated 10 November 2008, respondent filed an "Urgent Motion to Withdraw Petition for Review." In its motion, respondent stated that "it shall no longer pursue its claim for tax credit certificate and, instead carry forward the said excess creditable income taxes to the succeeding taxable quarters of the succeeding taxable years until the same will have been fully utilized."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Clearly, respondent filed the motion in order to avoid the adverse effect of the ruling of the CTA First Division that respondent (petitioner therein) failed to substantiate almost all of its claimed prior year's excess credits, especially since respondent already carried over and applied the amount of P16,194,108.00 as prior year's excess creditable tax against the income tax due for the succeeding taxable year 2003. The CTA First Division denied for lack of merit respondent's Urgent Motion to Withdraw Petition for Review.</p><p> It should be emphasized that respondent no longer appealed the 10 November 2008 Decision and the 12 March 2009 Resolution of the CTA First Division to the CTA <i>En Banc</i>. Neither did respondent appeal the CTA <i>En Banc</i> Decision dated 29 July 2009, which affirmed the 10 November 2008 Decision and the 12 March 2009 Resolution of the CTA First Division.</p><p> In the Decision dated 10 November 2008 of the CTA First Division, the substantiated prior year's excess credits have already been fully applied against respondent's income tax liability for taxable year 2002. Thus, respondent no longer has any remaining prior year's excess creditable tax which can be carried over and applied against its income tax due for the succeeding taxable year 2003.</p><p> Clearly, respondent erred when it carried over the amount of P16,194,108.00 as prior year's excess credits to the succeeding taxable year 2003, resulting in a tax overpayment of P7,653,926.00 as shown in its 2003 Amended ITR: </p><blockquote> <table cellpadding="0" border="0" width="70%"> <tbody><tr> <td colspan="2" valign="top">Aggregate Income Tax Due</td> <td width="33%">&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td width="6%" valign="top">Less:</td> <td width="61%" valign="top"> Tax Credits/Payments<br> <b>Prior Year's Excess Credits<br> </b></td> <td><div align="right">P 25,567,685<br> <b>16,194,108</b></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top">Creditable Tax Withheld for the First Three Quarters </td> <td><div align="right">6,472,176</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top">Creditable Tax Withheld Per BIR Form No. 2307 for the Fourth Quarter </td> <td><div align="right">10,555,327</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top">Total Tax Credits/Payments</td> <td><div align="right">33,221,611</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top"><b>Total Tax Payable/(Overpayment)</b> </td> <td><div align="right"><b>(P 7,653,926)</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote> <p>Considering that respondent's prior year's excess credits have already been fully applied against its 2002 income tax liability, the P16,194,108.00 unsubstantiated tax credits in taxable year 2002 could no longer be carried over and applied against its income tax liability for taxable year 2003. Thus, the amount of P16,194,108.00 as prior year's excess credits should be deleted, making respondent liable for income tax in the amount of P8,540,182.00 for taxable year 2003 as computed below:</p> <blockquote> <table cellpadding="0" border="0" width="70%"> <tbody><tr> <td colspan="2" valign="top">Aggregate Income Tax Due</td> <td width="33%"><div align="right">P 25,567,685</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td width="6%" valign="top">Less:</td> <td width="61%" valign="top"> Tax Credits/Payments<br> <b>Prior Year's Excess Credits<br> </b></td> <td><div align="right"><br> <b>0</b></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top">Creditable Tax Withheld for the First Three Quarters </td> <td><div align="right">6,472,176</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top">Creditable Tax Withheld Per BIR Form No. 2307 for the Fourth Quarter </td> <td><div align="right">10,555,327</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top">Total Tax Credits/Payments</td> <td><div align="right"><strong>17,027,503</strong></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top"><b>Total Tax Payable/(Overpayment)</b> </td> <td><div align="right"><b>(P 8,540,182)</b> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote> <p>Respondent argues that the alleged deficiency income tax for taxable year 2003 has no bearing on the case which merely involves a claim for a tax credit certificate for taxable year 2002.</p> <p> We cannot subscribe to respondent's reasoning. The ruling of the CTA First Division and the CTA <i>En Banc</i> clearly affects respondent's income tax liability for taxable year 2003 precisely because respondent carried over the amount of P16,194,108.00 as prior year's excess credits, to which it is not entitled. Respondent is once again trying to evade the adverse effect of the ruling of the CTA First Division that respondent (petitioner therein) failed to substantiate almost all of its claimed prior year's excess credits, especially since respondent already carried over and applied the amount of P16,194,108.00 as prior year's excess creditable tax against the income tax due for the succeeding taxable year 2003. To reiterate, the CTA First Division already ruled that respondent (petitioner therein) failed to substantiate its prior year's excess credits of P30,150,767.00 except for the amount of P288,076.04, which can be applied against respondent's income tax liability for taxable year 2002. Thus, since respondent's prior year's excess credits have already been fully applied against its 2002 income tax liability, the P16,194,108.00 unsubstantiated tax credits in taxable year 2002 could no longer be carried over and applied against its income tax liability for taxable year 2003.</p> <p> Nevertheless, it is incumbent upon petitioner to issue a final assessment notice and demand letter for the payment of respondent's deficiency tax liability for taxable year 2003. Section 228 of the National Internal Revenue Code provides that: </p><blockquote> <p> Section 228. <i>Protesting Assessment</i>. – When the Commissioner or his duly authorized representative finds that proper taxes should be assessed, he shall first notify the taxpayers of his findings: <i>Provided, however</i>, That a pre-assessment notice shall not be required in the following cases:</p> <p> (a) When the finding for any deficiency tax is the result of mathematical error in the computation of the tax as appearing on the face of the return; or </p> <p>(b) When a discrepancy has been determined between the tax withheld and the amount actually remitted by the withholding agent; or</p> <p> (c) <b>When a taxpayer who opted to claim a refund or tax credit of excess creditable withholding tax for a taxable period was determined to have carried over and automatically applied the same amount claimed against the estimated tax liabilities for the taxable quarter or quarters of the succeeding taxable year</b>; or </p> <p>(d) When the excise tax due on excisable articles has not been paid; or</p> <p> (e) When an article locally purchased or imported by an exempt person, such as, but not limited to, vehicles, capital equipment, machineries and spare parts, has been sold, traded or transferred to non exempt persons. </p> <p>The taxpayers shall be informed in writing of the law and the facts on which the assessment is made; otherwise, the assessment shall be void.</p> <p> Within a period to be prescribed by implementing rules and regulations, the taxpayer shall be required to respond to said notice. If the taxpayer fails to respond, the Commissioner or his duly authorized representative shall issue an assessment based on his findings. </p> <p>Such assessment may be protested administratively by filing a request for reconsideration or reinvestigation within thirty (30) days from receipt of the assessment in such form and manner as may be prescribed by implementing rules and regulations. Within sixty (60) days from filing of the protest, all relevant supporting documents shall have been submitted; otherwise, the assessment shall become final.</p> <p> If the protest is denied in whole or in part, or is not acted upon within one hundred eighty (180) days from submission of documents, the taxpayer adversely affected by the decision or inaction may appeal to the Court of Tax Appeals within thirty (30) days from receipt of the said decision, or from the lapse of the one hundred eighty (180)-day period; otherwise, the decision shall become final, executory and demandable.
