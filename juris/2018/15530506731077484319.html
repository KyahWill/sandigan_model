Ortiz,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> where this Court held as follows:<br><blockquote>Obviously a prevailing party in a civil action is entitled to a writ of execution of the final judgment obtained by him within five years from its entry (Section 443, Code of Civil Procedure). <u><b>But it has been repeatedly held, and it is now well-settled in this jurisdiction, that when after </b></u><u><b>judgment has been rendered and the latter has become final, facts and </b></u><u><b>circumstances transpire which render its execution impossible o</b></u><b>r </b><u><b>unjust, the interested party may ask the court to modify or alter the </b></u><u><b>judgment to harmonize the same with justice and the facts</b></u><b> </b>(Molina vs. De la Riva, 8 Phil. 569; Behn, Meyer &amp; Co. vs. McMicking, 11 Phil. 276; Warner, Barnes &amp; Co. vs. Jaucian, 13 Phil. 4; Espiritu vs. Crossfield and Guash, 14 Phil. 588; Flor Mata vs. Lichauco and Salinas, 36 Phil. 809). In the instant case the respondent Cleofas alleged that subsequent to the judgment obtained by Sto. Domingo, they entered into an agreement which showed that he was no longer indebted in the amount claimed of P995, but in a lesser amount. Sto. Domingo had no right to an execution for the amount claimed by him. (De la Costa vs. Cleofas, 67 Phil. 686-693).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>The fourth exception to the doctrine on immutability of judgement is present in this case. After the June 27, 2006 Decision granting the adoption of Karen has become final and executory, new facts and circumstances occurred which made its execution inequitable and impossible.<br><br>To be specific, on July 12, 2006, the OCR of Quezon City refused to enforce the June 27, 2006 Decision because Karen's birth was also registered in the OCR of Caloocan City. Unfortunately, although petitioners filed a Petition to Cancel the registration of Karen's birth in the OCR of Caloocan City, the RTC of Caloocan City ordered for correction of entries instead.<br><br>Hence, due to the belated discovery of the duplicitous registration of Karen's birth, and the subsequent refusal of the RTC of Caloocan City to cancel the registration in the OCR of Caloocan City, the petitioners have no way to enforce the June 27, 2006 Decision.<br><br>It must be noted that the exception to the doctrine of immutability of judgment has been previously applied in several cases in order to serve substantial justice.<br><br>Notably, that the Office of the Solicitor General recognized, in its Comment to the instant petition, that the issue on the propriety of the adoption of Karen is already final and unalterable. Thus, the only unsettled matter is the proper OCR to enforce the June 27, 2006 Decision.<br><br>The RTC of Marikina City is of the position that it cannot rule on the said issue because it was never presented before it, and the June 27, 2006 Decision being final and immutable cannot be corrected anymore.<br><br>This Court disagrees.<br><br>In the earlier case of <i>Candelario, et al. v. Canizares, et al.</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> this Court enunciated that in cases when an event changed or affected the rights of the parties, the court is allowed to (1) suspend the execution of a final judgement, (2) admit evidence of new facts and circumstances, and (3) grant the relief warranted based on such new facts and circumstances, to wit:<br><blockquote>After a judgment has become final, if there is evidence of an event or circumstance which would affect or change the rights of the parties thereto, <u><b>the court should be allowed to admit evidence of such new facts and circumstances, and thereafter suspend execution thereof and grant </b></u><u><b>relief as the new facts and circumstances warrant</b></u><b>. </b>We, therefore, find that the ruling of the court declaring that the order for the payment of P40,000.00 is final and may not be reversed, is erroneous as above explained.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> (emphasis and underscoring supplied.)<br></blockquote>Considering the foregoing, as well as, the new circumstances and facts which made the execution of the June 27, 2006 Decision impossible, an exception to the rule on immutability of judgement is applicable.<br><br>In <i>Barnes v. Judge Padilla,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> this Court further discussed the exceptions to the rule on finality of judgements, and had the occasion to state:<br><blockquote>However, this Court has relaxed this rule in order to serve substantial justice considering (a) matters of life, liberty, honor or property, (b) the existence of special or compelling circumstances, (c) the merits of the case, (d) a cause not entirely attributable to the fault or negligence of the party favored by the suspension of the rules, (e) a lack of any showing that the review sought is merely frivolous and dilatory, and (f) the other party will not be unjustly prejudiced thereby.<br><br><u><b>Invariably, rules of procedure should be viewed as mere tools </b></u><u><b>designed to facilitate the attainment of justice. Their strict and rigid application, which would result in technicalities that tend to frustrate </b></u><u><b>rather than promote substantial justice, must always be </b></u><u><b>eschewed. Even the Rules of Court reflects this principle. The power to </b></u><u><b>suspend or even disregard rules can be so pervasive and compelling as </b></u><u><b>to alter even that which this Court itself had already declared to be </b></u><u><b>final</b></u><b>.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> (emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Thus, this Court finds the filing of a new and separate action to determine the proper OCR to execute the June 27, 2006 Decision as unnecessarily burdensome to the petitioners. Such strict and rigid application of the rules of procedure will result in technicalities that will frustrate rather than facilitate substantial justice.<br><br>However, it is correct that the RTC of Marikina City may not outright change the dispositive portion of the June 27, 2006 Decision to insert the phrase "City Civil Registrar of Caloocan City" in lieu of the "City Civil Registrar of Quezon City".<br><br>Instead, the RTC of Marikina City is allowed to admit evidence in order to enable it to properly scrutinize the issue, and grant the proper relief to harmonize the June 27, 2006 Decision with justice and the facts.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE, </b>in consideration of the foregoing disquisitions, the petition is <b>GRANTED.</b> The assailed Order dated May 23, 2013 and Order dated July 1, 2013 issued by the RTC of Marikina City in JDRC Case No. 05-1119-MK are <b>ANNULLED </b>and <b>SET ASIDE. </b>The case is thus <b>REMANDED </b>to Branch 273 of the RTC of Marikina City, which is hereby directed to:<br><br>(1) <b>RECEIVE </b>evidence relevant to the duplicitous registration of Karen's birth;<br><br>(2) <b>DETERMINE </b>the proper OCR to enforce the June 27, 2006 Decision; and<br><br>(3) <b>CORRECT </b>the decision, if needed, only as to the proper OCR to enforce it.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Carpio, (Chairperson), Perlas-Bernabe, Caguioa,</i> and <i>J.
