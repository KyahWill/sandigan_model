The victim, Gerry Alcantara, was his co-worker who was employed by his uncle as a butcher. Both he and the victim worked at the market from 1:00 a.m. to 5:00 a.m.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>On the same day, at about 3:00 a.m., Ross saw appellant arrive at the market, apparently drunk because he walked in a swaying manner. Appellant worked as a butcher across the stalls of Ross' uncle. Because appellant was drunk, Ross told him to just lie down on a bench near their stall.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Moments later, appellant stood up and approached the victim from behind. At the time, the victim was busy weighing sliced pork meat for distribution to the stalls at the market. Appellant then used his left hand to hold the victim in place by the neck, and without saying a word, he suddenly stabbed the victim at the back. The victim turned around but he was stabbed for the second time. Appellant would have succeeded in stabbing the victim again, but it was prevented by Ryan who pushed a cart in appellant's direction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Appellant immediately fled the scene, still carrying with him the butcher's knife that was stained with the victim's blood. He ran towards the direction of Platerias Street comer Palma Street, but he was eventually subdued by civilians and <i>barangay tanods</i> at the market.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Unfortunately, the victim died at the hospital the following day.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Dr. Romeo T. Salen (Dr. Salen) performed the autopsy on the victim's body.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Based on the Medico-Legal Report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> dated January 29, 2008, the cause of death was the stab wound sustained by the victim at the back.<br><br><b><i>Version of the Defense</i></b><br><br>Appellant raised the justifying circumstance of self-defense in order to exculpate himself from criminal liability, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>At around 3:00 o'clock in the [morning] of January 24, 2008, [he] was inside his stall [at the] Quinta Market waiting for the delivery of his pork meat when [the victim] suddenly approached him, uttered "<i>[E]to ba</i>" and boxed him. He stood up and fought back upon getting hurt, not knowing what [the victim] was referring to when he uttered those words. [The victim] continued boxing him so he embraced him and [they] both fell on the ground. Since [the victim] was on top of him, he was not able to resist. Thus, he picked up the knife on the ground which fell from [the victim's] waist and stabbed him, without intending to kill him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> x x x<br></blockquote><b><i>Ruling of the Regional Trial Court</i></b><br><br>In its Decision dated January 10, 2014, the RTC found appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>The RTC rejected appellant's contention that he had simply acted in selfÂ­-defense which resulted in the victim's killing. It explained that:<br><blockquote>x x x The testimony of the accused raising self-defense is difficult to believe because it is replete with contradictions and inconsistencies. The accused claims that the victim boxed him several times but nowhere in his medical certificate [was it shown] that he suffered [any] boxing injur[ies]. In fact, the medical certificate attested that there was no sign of external injuries at the time of the examination. Moreover, he claims that the victim pressed his left arm on his neck but again(,) there is no sign of injuries on his neck that appeared in his medical certificate. x x x x <b>More importantly, the accused claims that he only stabbed the victim only [sic] once which is inconsistent with the autopsy performed on the body of the victim by Dr. Romeo T. Salen which indicated that the victim suffered two (2) stab wounds.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> x x x (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Moreover, the RTC held that the victim's killing was attended by the qualifying circumstance of treachery.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> "By attacking the victim at a time when his attention was drawn to his work of weighing the meat on the scale, [appellant] gave the victim no chance to prepare his defense of the attack."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> The RTC thus concluded that the mode of attack chosen by appellant made it impossible for the victim to defend himself or retaliate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>The RTC, however, ruled that the attendant circumstances of evident premeditation, taking advantage of superior strength, and nighttime alleged in the Information were not proven beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Accordingly, the RTC sentenced appellant to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>. It likewise ordered appellant to pay the heirs of the victim: P50,000.00 as civil indemnity, P47,641.50 as actual damages, and P1,916,250.00 for the loss of the victim's earning capacity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Appellant thereafter appealed the RTC Decision before the CA.<br><br><b><i>Ruling of the Court of Appeals</i></b><br><br>In its Decision dated September 10, 2015, the CA affirmed the assailed RTC Decision with modifications, in that the appellate court: (<i>a</i>) directed appellant to pay the heirs of the victim P75,000.00 as moral damages and P30,000.00 as exemplary damages; (<i>b</i>) increased the award of civil indemnity to P75,000.00; (<i>c</i>) decreased the amount of loss of earning capacity to P1,383,286.95; and (<i>d</i>) imposed interest at the rate of 6% per annum on all damages awarded from the date of finality of the Decision until fully paid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>The CA agreed with the RTC's finding that appellant had failed to clearly and convincingly prove the elements of self-defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> It also pointed out that appellant himself testified that Ross (the prosecution's eye witness) held no grudges against him and that he had no hostile encounter with the latter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>In addition, the CA held that the victim's killing was indeed qualified by treachery.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> It noted that, while the victim was busy weighing pork meat on a scale, appellant approached him from behind, strangled his neck and, while in such position, stabbed him at the right side.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> "A sudden attack against an unarmed victim, such as in this case, clearly constitutes treachery."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Aggrieved, appellant filed the present appeal.<br><br><center><b>The Issues</b><br></center><br>Appellant raises the following issues for the Court's resolution:<br><br><i>First</i>, whether appellant was able to sufficiently prove the justifying circumstance of self-defense;<br><br>And <i>second</i>, whether the victim's stabbing was attended by treachery.<br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b><br></center><br>The appeal is unmeritorious.<br><br>In criminal cases, the burden lies upon the prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> However, when the accused invokes selfÂ­ defense, the burden of proof is <i>shifted</i> from the prosecution to the defense,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> and it becomes incumbent upon the accused to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, the existence of the following requisites of self-defense: <b><i>first</i></b>, unlawful aggression on the part of the victim; <b><i>second</i></b>, reasonable necessity of the means employed to prevent or repel such aggression; and <b><i>third</i></b>, lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the person defending himself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>In such cases, the accused must rely on the strength of his evidence and not on the weakness of the prosecution's evidence. After all, by invoking self-defense, the accused, in effect, <i>admits having killed or injured the victim</i>, and he can no longer be acquitted of the crime charged <i>if</i> he fails to prove the essential requisites of self-defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>The most important requisite of self-defense is <b>unlawful aggression</b> which is the condition <i>sine qua non</i> for upholding self-defense as a justifying circumstance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> In simpler terms, the accused must prove by clear and convincing evidence that the victim committed unlawful aggression against him;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> otherwise, "self-defense, whether complete or incomplete, <i>cannot</i> be appreciated, for the two other essential elements [thereof] would have <i>no factual and legal bases</i> without any unlawful aggression to prevent or repel."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Thus, we explained in <i>People v.

Accordingly, the accused must establish the concurrence of three elements of unlawful aggression, namely: (<i>a</i>) there must be a physical or material attack or assault; (<i>b</i>) the attack or assault must be actual, or, at least, imminent; and (<i>c</i>) the attack or assault must be unlawful.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>After a thorough review of the records, we find that appellant failed to discharge the burden of proving that the unlawful aggression had originated from the victim.<br><br><b><i>First</i></b>, it is undisputed that appellant tried to flee the <i>situs criminis</i> immediately after the stabbing incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> It was only through the concerted efforts of the civilians and <i>barangay tanods</i> at the market that appellant's escape attempt was thwarted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> "Flight is a veritable badge of guilt and negates the plea of selfÂ­-defense."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>We find no merit in appellant's contention that he "ran after the stabbing incident because he intended to voluntarily surrender himself at the <i>barangay</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> He could have easily surrendered to Milagros Reyes, one of the <i>barangay tanods</i> chasing after him, but he kept on running away until he was eventually subdued by Edgardo Reyes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br><b><i>Second</i></b>, the location, nature and seriousness of the wounds sustained by the victim are inconsistent with a plea of self-defense;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> rather, these factors indicate a determined effort to kill.<br><br>On this point, Dr. Salen testified that the stabbing wound sustained by the victim <i>at the back portion of his body</i> can be characterized as <i>fatal</i>, as it penetrated the intestines, mesentery and right lobe of the victim's liver, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td colspan="2"><div align="justify">[ACP LEA LLAVORE:]</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify"></div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q: </div></td><td><div align="justify">Mr. [W]itness, could you please describe the wounds and the injuries which are in the Anatomical Sketch?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A:</div></td><td><div align="justify"> The first stab wound was on the back portion and the second stab wound was on the left thigh, it was [a] thru and thru stab wound, there is an entry and there is an exit wound, ma'am.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td colspan="2"><div align="justify">x x x x</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q:</div></td><td><div align="justify"> Mr. [W]itness, which of these two wounds were [sic] fatal?
