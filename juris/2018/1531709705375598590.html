The land, regarded as Lot No. 1591, Cad. 729, Talisay Cadastre, had an area of 9,629 square meters.

She claimed that she and Cecilio (the Spouses Javier) purchased the property from Spouses Antonio Lumbres and Leonisa Manaig (the Spouses Lumbres) on October 10, 1985. A Deed of Absolute Sale was executed to facilitate the transaction. They had the property fenced and planted with coconut, antipolo, and duhat.

The half portion owned by Cito was later transferred to his daughter, Luisa Paison (Luisa). Both portions owned by Luisa and Juan were then transferred to the Spouses Lumbres, until half was finally sold to the Spouses Javier and the other half to their son, Iden.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Banawa added that since every person in their barangay knew that Laureana and Iden owned and possessed the property, nobody interrupted or disturbed their possession or made an adverse claim against them.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Thus, their possession was "open, continuous, exclusive, and in the concept of an owner[.]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> </p> <p>Hernandez, who was a Special Land Investigator I of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources-Community Environment and Natural Resources Office (DENR-CENRO), testified that he was the one who conducted an ocular inspection on the land.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> He found that the land "ha[d] not been forfeited in favor of the government for non-payment of taxes [or] ... confiscated as bond in connection with any civil or criminal case."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Moreover, the land was outside a reservation or forest zone.

Upon tracing back the tax declarations on the property, Canarias also found that the previous owners who declared the land for taxation purposes were the same as the previous owners according to Laureana's and Iden's testimonies. The previous tax declarations of the property now covered by Tax Declaration No. 014-01335 were under the names of Luisa and the Spouses Lumbres while Tax Declaration No. 014-00397 were previously under the names of Juan and the Spouses Lumbres.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> </p> <p>On May 5, 2011, the trial court rendered a Decision granting Laureana and Iden's application for registration of title.

The Court of Appeals held that the annotation could be regarded as substantial compliance with the requirement that the property should be alienable and disposable, especially since it coincided with Hernandez's report and Maglinao's testimony.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> </p> <p>Finally, the Court of Appeals found that Laureana and Iden were able to prove their predecessors-in-interest's possession of property since 1937 and their possession since 1985 as evidenced by the tax declarations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></p> <p> The dispositive portion of the Court of Appeals Decision read:</p> <blockquote> <p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of the foregoing premises, the instant appeal is hereby ordered <b>DISMISSED</b>, and the appealed Decision rendered on 5 May 2011 and Order dated 9 December 2011 by the Fourth Judicial Region of the Municipal Circuit Trial Court in Talisay-Laurel, Batangas in Land Reg.

Petitioner argues that the application for land registration should have been dismissed by the trial court considering that it was not accompanied by "a copy of the original classification approved by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) Secretary and certified as true copy by its legal custodian."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> It avers that a CENRO Certification is not sufficient to prove the land's classification as alienable and disposable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Moreover, the rule on substantial compliance is applied <i>pro hac vice</i> in the cases of <i>Republic v. Vega</i> and <i>Republic v. Serrano</i>, upon which the Court of Appeals heavily relied.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> </p><p>Petitioner contends that respondents' acts of fencing and planting transpired only after they purchased the property in 1985. Banawa also failed to mention in her testimony that respondents' predecessors-in-interest occupied, developed, maintained, or cultivated the property, which could have shown that the former owners possessed the property by virtue of a <em>bona fide </em>ownership claim. Lastly, the tax declarations presented by respondents only date back to 1948 as the earliest year of possession.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> </p><p>On April 21, 2015, respondents filed their Comment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> They counter that they were able to prove substantial compliance when they presented Maglinao's Certification and Hernandez's report. The Survey Plan also stated that the land was in an alienable and disposable zone. They also point out that the Land Registration Authority did not question the classification of the property, despite notice of the application.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> </p><p> Respondents maintain that their and their predecessors-in-interest's possession had been "open, continuous, exclusive and notorious ... under a bona fide claim of ownership since June 12, 1945 or earlier,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> as supported by Banawa's testimony. Although they admit that the earliest tax declaration was dated 1948, they seek the application of this Court's ruling in <i>Sps. Llanes v. Republic</i>, where this Court held that "tax declarations and receipts . . . coupled with actual possession ... constitute evidence of great weight and can be the basis of a claim of ownership through prescription."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> </p><p> On April 18, 2016, petitioner filed its Reply.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> It asserts that land registration applicants should strictly comply with the requirements in proving that the land is alienable and disposable. It maintains that for failing to submit the required document, respondents' application should have been denied.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Petitioner also insists that Banawa's testimony and the tax declarations are not sufficient to prove that respondents' and their predecessors-in-interest's possession and occupation of the property were "open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious ... under a <i>bona fide</i> claim of ownership, since June 12, 1945 or earlier."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> </p><p>This Court resolves the sole issue of whether or not the trial court and the Court of Appeals erred in granting Laureana Malijan-Javier and Iden Malijan-Javier's application for registration of property. </p><p> Land registration is governed by Section 14 of Presidential Decree No. 1529 or the Property Registration Decree, which states: </p><blockquote> <p> Section 14. Who may apply. — The following persons may file in the proper Court of First Instance an application for registration of title to land, whether personally or through their duly authorized representatives:</p> <blockquote> <p> <i>(1) Those who by themselves or through their predecessors­ in-interest have been in open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and occupation of alienable and disposable lands of the public domain under a bona fide claim of ownership since June 12, 1945, or earlier.</i> </p> <p>(2) Those who have acquired ownership of private lands by prescription under the provisions of existing laws.</p> <p> (3) Those who have acquired ownership of private lands or abandoned river beds by right of accession or accretion under the existing laws.</p> <p> (4) Those who have acquired ownership of land m any other manner provided for by law.</p> </blockquote> <p> Where the land is owned in common, all the co-owners shall file the application jointly.</p> <p> Where the land has been sold under <em>pacto de retro</em>, the vendor <em>a retro</em> may file an application for the original registration of the land, provided, however, that should the period for redemption expire during the pendency of the registration proceedings and ownership to the property consolidated in the vendee <em>a retro</em>, the latter shall be substituted for the applicant and may continue the proceedings.</p> <p> A trustee on behalf of his principal may apply for original registration of any land held in trust by him, unless prohibited by the instrument creating the trust.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p>Applicants whose circumstances fall under Section 14(1) need to establish only the following: </p><blockquote> <p> <em>[F]irst</em>, that the subject land forms part of the disposable and alienable lands of the public domain;<em> second</em>, that the applicant and his predecessors-in-interest have been in open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and occupation of the [land]; and<em> third</em>, that it is under a <em>bona fide</em> claim ownership since June 12, 1945, or earlier.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p>To satisfy the first requirement of Section 14(1), petitioner argues that both a CENRO or Provincial Environment and Natural Resources Office (PENRO) certification and a certified true copy of a DENR Secretary­approved certificate should be obtained to prove that the land is alienable and disposable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> </p> <p>Petitioner's contention has merit.</p> <p> It is well-settled that a CENRO or PENRO certification is not enough to establish that a land is alienable and disposable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> It should be "accompanied by an official publication of the DENR Secretary's issuance declaring the land alienable and disposable."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> In <i>Republic v. TA.N Properties</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> </p> <blockquote> <p> [I]t is not enough for the PENRO or CENRO to certify that a land is alienable and disposable. The applicant for land registration must prove that the DENR Secretary had approved the land classification and released the land of the public domain as alienable and disposable, and that the land subject of the application for registration falls within the approved area per verification through survey by the PENRO or CENRO. In addition, <em>the applicant for land registration must present a copy of the original classification approved by the DENR Secretary and certified as a true copy by the legal custodian of the official records.</em> These facts must be established to prove that the land is alienable and disposable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> In <i>Republic v. Lualhati</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> [I]t has been repeatedly ruled that certifications issued by the CENRO, or specialists of the DENR, as well as Survey Plans prepared by the DENR containing annotations that the subject lots are alienable, <i>do not constitute incontrovertible evidence to overcome the presumption that the property sought to be registered belongs to the inalienable public domain</i>. Rather, this Court stressed the importance of proving alienability by presenting a copy of the original classification of the land approved by the DENR Secretary and certified as true copy by the legal custodian of the official records.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted) </p> </blockquote> <p> The certification issued by the DENR Secretary is necessary since he or she is the official authorized to approve land classification, including the release of land from public domain.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> As thoroughly explained in <i>Republic v. Spouses Go</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> [A]n applicant has the burden of proving that the public land has been classified as alienable and disposable. To do this, the applicant must show a positive act from the government declassifying the land from the public domain and converting it into an alienable and disposable land. "[T]he exclusive prerogative to classify public lands under existing laws is vested in the Executive Department." In <i>Victoria v. Republic:</i></p> <blockquote> <p> To prove that the land subject of the application for registration is alienable, an applicant must establish the existence of a positive act of the government such as a presidential proclamation or an executive order; an administrative action; investigation reports of Bureau of Lands investigators; and a legislative act or statute. The applicant may secure a certification from the government that the lands applied for are alienable and disposable, but<em> the certification must show that the DENR Secretary had approved the land classification and released the</em> land of the pub[l]ic domain as alienable and disposable[.]</p> </blockquote> <p> Section X(1) of the DENR Administrative Order No. 1998-24 and Section IX(1) of DENR Administrative Order No. 2000-11 affirm that the DENR Secretary is the approving authority for "[l]and classification and release of lands of the public domain as alienable and disposable." Section 4.6 of DENR Administrative Order No. 2007-20 defines land classification as follows:</p> <blockquote> <p> Land classification is the process of demarcating, segregating, delimiting and establishing the best category, kind, and uses of public lands. Article XII, Section 3 of the 1987 Constitution of the Philippines provides that lands of the public domain are to be classified into agricultural, forest or timber, mineral lands, and national parks.</p> </blockquote> <p> These provisions, read with <i>Victoria v. Republic</i>, establish the rule that before an inalienable land of the public domain becomes private land, the DENR Secretary must first approve the land classification into an agricultural land and release it as alienable and disposable. The DENR Secretary's official acts "may be evidenced by an official publication thereof or by a copy attested by the officer having legal custody of the record, or by his deputy."</p> <p> The CENRO or the Provincial Environment and Natural Resources Officer will then conduct a survey to verify that the land for original registration falls within the DENR Secretary-approved alienable and disposable zone.</p> <p> The CENRO certification is issued only to verify the DENR Secretary issuance through a survey[.]<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> (Emphasis in the original, citations omitted)</p> </blockquote> <p> In this case, although respondents were able to present a CENRO certification, a DENR-CENRO report with the testimony of the DENR officer who made the report, and the survey plan showing that the property is already considered alienable and disposable, these pieces of evidence are still not sufficient to prove that the land sought to be registered is alienable and disposable. Absent the DENR Secretary's issuance declaring the land alienable and disposable, the land remains part of the public domain.</p><p> Thus, even if respondents have shown, through their testimonial evidence, that they and their predecessors-in-interest have been in open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession and occupation of the property since June 12, 1945, they still cannot register the land for failing to establish that the land is alienable and disposable.</p><p> All things considered, this Court finds that the Court of Appeals committed a reversible error in affirming the May 5, 2011 Decision and December 9, 2011 Order of the Municipal Circuit Trial Court of Talisay­ Laurel, Batangas, which granted the land registration application of respondents.</p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.
