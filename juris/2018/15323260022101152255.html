According to the petitioners, the evidence of the prosecution actually proved the falsification of Board Resolution 2000-001, a private document, instead of the Secretary's Certificate dated February 29, 2000. As the falsification of a private document requires proof of intention to cause damage, the petitioners argue that there is no evidence to establish this element. Furthermore, they point out that the prosecution failed to prove the existence of Board Resolution 2000-001 because they merely relied on the Secretary's Certificate in establishing its genuineness and due execution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Upon review of the Information, it is apparent that the subject matter of the falsification is the Secretary's Certificate dated February 29, 2000-a notarized document certifying that Pentel's Board of Directors passed Board Resolution 2000-001 in the meeting held on February 25, 2000. Specifically, the Information accused the petitioners of conspiring with one another in falsifying the Secretary's Certificate dated February 29, 2000 and Board Resolution 2000-001, because Quintin, one of Pentel's directors, already died on September 16, 1996-long before the documents were executed with his supposed approval. It was further alleged that the petitioners falsified these documents through the following aces: (a) counterfeiting the signature of Quintin; (b) causing it to appear that Quintin participated in the preparation of these documents; and (c) by making an untruthful statement in a narration of facts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Thus, the prosecution offered the Secretary's Certificate dated February 29, 2000 for two purposes: <i>first</i>, to prove its existence and the fact that the petitioners falsified this public document by making an untruthful statement in a narration of facts; and <i>second</i>, to prove the existence of Board Resolution 2000-001, and that the petitioners made it appear that Quintin participated in its preparation by forging his signature.<br><br>While a board resolution is indeed not a public document within the contemplation of Section 19(b), Rule 132 of the Revised Rules on Evidence, the Secretary's Certificate dated February 29, 2000 squarely falls under this category. And, since the said Secretary's Certificate specifically contained not only the supposed resolution passed by Pentel's Board of Directors, but also the signatures of all the board members who approved such resolution, then it can be concluded that all of the petitioners participated in the execution of the falsified Secretary's Certificate. Verily, the petitioners were correctly charged and convicted with the falsification of a public document, punishable under Article 172(1) of the RPC:<br><blockquote>Art. 171. <i>Falsification by public officer, employee or notary or ecclesiastic minister</i>. - The penalty of <span style="font-style: italic;">prision mayor</span> and a fine not to exceed P5,000 pesos shall be imposed upon any public officer, employee, or notary who, taking advantage of his official position, shall falsify a document by committing any of the following acts:<br><br>x x x x<br><br><b>4. Making untruthful statements in a narration of facts;</b><br><br>x x x x<br><br>Art. 172. <i>Falsification by private individual and use of falsified documents</i>. - The penalty of <i>prision correccional</i> in its medium and maximum periods and a fine of not more than P5,000 pesos shall be imposed upon:<br><br>1. <b>Any private individual who shall commit any of the falsifications enumerated in the next preceding article in any public or official document or letter of exchange or any other kind of commercial document;</b> x x x<br><br>x x x x (Emphasis Ours)<br></blockquote>To be clear, Quintin was indisputably dead by the time Board Resolution 2000-001 was passed with his participation on February 25, 2000. <b>For this reason, Pentel's Corporate Secretary, in conspiracy with the other petitioners, falsified a public document by certifying under oath that Quintin was present during this board meeting and making it appear that he signed the resolution contained in the Secretary's Certificate, when in truth and in fact, he could not, as he was already dead at the time of its execution.</b> This is the main act of falsification committed by the petitioners, especially Shirley, who was the Corporate Secretary at that time. The fact that Quintin's signature appeared on the Secretary's Certificate corroborates this charge.<br><br>The foregoing notwithstanding, it is more important to consider the allegation of the petitioners that the crime already prescribed.<br><br><b>The prescription of the offense may be raised even for the first time on appeal.</b><br><br>For the first time on appeal to the Court, the petitioners argue that despite the finding of their guilt, the crime with which they were charged already prescribed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Section 3(g), Rule 117 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure allows an accused to move for the quashal of the complaint or information on the ground that the criminal action or liability is extinguished. Generally, the accused should make the objection before entering his plea,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> otherwise, the accused is deemed to have waived this defense. However, Section 9, Rule 117 of the same Rules carves out an exception for grounds involving the extinguishment of the criminal action or liability, which includes the prescription of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>Even prior to the promulgation of the present Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Court in <i>People v. Castro</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> ruled that the accused may raise the prescription of the crime at any stage of the proceeding:<br><blockquote>A case in point is <i>People v. Moran</i>, 44 Phil., 387. In that case, the accused was charged with a violation of the election law. He was found guilty and convicted and the judgment was affirmed, with slight modification, by the Supreme Court. Pending reconsideration of the decision, the accused moved to dismiss the case setting up the plea of prescription. After the Attorney General was given an oppm1unity to answer the motion, and the parties had submitted memoranda in support of their respective contentions, the court ruled that the crime had already prescribed holding that this defense can not (<i>sic</i>) de deemed waived even if the case had been decided by the lower com1and was pending appeal in the Supreme Court. The philosophy behind this ruling was aptly stated as follows: "Although the general rule is that the defense of prescription is not available unless expressly set up in the lower court, as in that case it is presumed to have been waived and cannot be taken advantage of thereafter, yet this rule is not always of absolute application in criminal cases, such as that in which prescription of the crime is expressly provided by law, for the State not having then the right to prosecute, or continue prosecuting, nor to punish, or continue punishing, the offense, or to continue holding the defendant subject to its action through the imposition of the penalty, the court must so declare." And elaborating on this proposition, the Court went on to state as follows:<br><blockquote>As prescription of the crime is the loss by the State of the right to prosecute and punish the same, it is absolutely indisputable that from the moment the State has lost or waived such right, the defendant may, at any stage of the proceeding, demand and ask that the same be finally dismissed and he be acquitted from the complaint, and such petition is proper and effective even if the court taking cognizance of the case has already rendered judgment and said judgment is merely in suspense, pending the resolution of a motion for a reconsideration and new trial, and this is the more so since in such a case there is not yet any final and irrevocable judgment.<br></blockquote>The ruling above adverted to squarely applies to the present case. Here, the rule provides that the plea of prescription should be set up before arraignment, or before the accused pleads to the charge, as otherwise the defense would be deemed waived; but, as was well said in the Moran case, this rule is not of absolute application, especially when it conflicts with a substantive provision of the law, such as that which refers to prescription of crimes. Since, under the Constitution, the Supreme Court has only the power to promulgate rules concerning pleadings, practice and procedure, and the admission to the practice of law, and cannot cover substantive rights (section 13, article VIII, of the Constitution), the rule we are considering cannot be interpreted or given such scope or extent that would come into conflict or defeat an express provision of our substantive law. One of such provisions is article 89 of the [RPC] which provides that the prescription of crime has the effect of totally extinguishing the criminal liability. And so we hold that the ruling laid down in the Moran case still holds good even if it were laid down before the adoption of the present Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br></blockquote>This doctrine was affirmed in the more recent case of <i>Syhunliong v. Rivera</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> where the defense of prescription was raised only in the comment to the petition filed before the Court. Despite this belated objection, the Court upheld the right of the accused to invoke the prescription of the crime at any stage of the proceeding.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Under these judicial pronouncements, the petitioners are not deemed to have waived this defense, even if they failed to move for the quashal of the information prior to their arraignment.<br><br><b>The crime of falsification of a public document charged against the petitioners already prescribed.</b><br><br>The petitioners were charged with the crime of falsification of a public document, punishable under Article 172 of the RPC. They were accused of making it appear that Quintin, who died on September 16, 1996, participated in a board meeting with Pentel's Board of Directors occurring three (3) years after his death, or on February 25, 2000. This was accomplished by falsifying the signature of Quintin on Board Resolution 2000-001. <b>The crime was fully consummated through the execution of the Secretary's Certificate dated February 29, 2000, which certified under oath that such meeting happened with the participation of Quintin, and that Board Resolution 2000-001 was passed with his approval.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> This Secretary's Certificate allowed Jimmy to dispose of the subject property on behalf of Pentel, which is quoted in full below:<br><blockquote>I, SHIRLEY LIM, of legal age, Filipino and with business address at Taft Office Center Bldg., 1986 Taft Avenue, Pasay City, after having been duly sworn to in accordance with law depose and state:<br><ol><li>That am the Corporate Secretary of PENTEL MERCHANDISING CO., INC., a corporation duly organized and existing under and by virtue of the laws of the Republic of the Philippines, with SEC Registration No. 54070 and with principal office at same as above;<br><br></li><li><b>That at a special meeting of the Board of Directors of the corporation held on February 25, 2000 at its principal office, the following resolutions were unanimously approved by the directors present</b>, to wit:<br></li></ol><div style="text-align: center;"><b>RESOLUTION 2000-001</b><br></div><br>"<b>RESOLVED, that the corporation PENTEL MERCHANDISING CO., INC., by virtue of a special meeting held today (February 25, 2000) unanimously approved Resolution 2000-001, stating among others to wit:</b><br><ol><li><b>That, the corporation decided to dispose its real property (a residential townhouse) located at P.

Being more than a statute of repose, it is an act of grace whereby the state, after the lapse of a certain period of time, surrenders its sovereign power to prosecute the criminal act. While the law on prescription of civil suits is interposed by the legislature as an impartial arbiter between two contending parties, the law on prescription of crimes is an act of amnesty and liberality on the part of the state in favor of the offender [People v. Moran, supra, at p. 405]. Hence, in the interpretation of the law on prescription of crimes, that which is most favorable to the accused is to be adopted [People v. Moran, supra; People v. Parel, 44 Phil. 437 (1923); People v. Yu Hai, 99 Phil. 725 (1956)]. <b>The application of the rule on constructive notice in the construction of Art. 91 of the (RPC] would most certainly be favorable to the accused since the prescriptive period of the crime shall have to be reckoned with earlier, i.e., from the time the notarized deed of sale was recorded in the Registry of Deeds.</b> In the instant case, the notarized deed of sale was registered on May 26, 1961. The criminal informations for falsification of a public document having been filed only on October 18, 1984, or more than ten (10) years from May 26, 1961, the crime for which the accused was charged has prescribed. The [CA], therefore, committed no reversible error in affirming the trial court's order quashing the two informations on the ground of prescription.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> (Emphasis Ours)<br></blockquote>Significantly, Section 51 of Presidential Decree No. 1529, otherwise known as the Property Registration Decree, provides that the act of registration with the Register of Deeds is considered the <b>operative act</b> to convey or affect the land "insofar as third persons are concerned." Thus, if the transaction is not registered with the Register of Deeds, only the parties are bound by the contract and innocent third persons are not affected. Section 52 of the same law further states:<br><blockquote>Sec. 52. <i>Constructive notice upon registration</i>. Every conveyance, mortgage, lease, lien, attachment, order, judgment, instrument or entry affecting registered land shall, <b>if registered, filed or entered in the office of the Register of Deeds for the province or city where the land to which it relates lies, be constructive notice to all persons from the time of such registering, filing or entering</b>. (Emphasis Ours)<br></blockquote>For voluntary transactions such as sale, registration is commenced upon the owner's presentation of the duplicate certificate to the Register of Deeds, together with the voluntary instrument.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> The Register of Deeds then registers the instrument in the primary entry book, and makes a corresponding memorandum on the owner's duplicate and original certificate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> <b>If the property belongs to a corporation, such as the subject property, the voluntary instrument should be accompanied by a secretary's certificate showing the board of directors' resolution for the approval of the sale of the corporation's property.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>It should be emphasized at this point that the corporation's real property may only be sold through the agents expressly authorized by the board of directors to act on behalf of the corporation. Since a corporation is a juridical entity, the physical act of executing the deed of sale may be done only through the corporation's officers or agents, duly authorized for this purpose by its board of directors.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> This authority should be reduced in writing as evidence that such authority exists, and more importantly, because this involves the creation or conveyance of real rights over immovable property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>Thus, considering all these corporate requirements, the board resolution for the sale of the corporation's real property, must reflect two important items, <i>i.e.</i> (a) the board of directors' collective approval of the sale; and (b) the board of directors' grant of authority to a natural person, who would act as the corporation's agent for such sale.<br><br>The evidence of such board resolution to the public is the <b>secretary's certificate</b>. In this document, the corporate secretary certifies under oath, that on a particular date, the board of directors met and resolved to approve the sale of the corporation's real property, and to authorize a specific natural person to act on behalf of the corporation for this transaction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>The secretary's certificate thus serves as the corporation's official document showing the corporate actions approved by its board of directors, as well as the extent and scope of authority necessarily conferred to its agents for the execution and implementation of such actions. <i>Vis-a-vis</i> natural persons, this secretary's certificate is equivalent to the special power of attorney (SPA) that an individual executes to designate an agent, who would act on their behalf for a particular transaction, such as a sale.<br><br>In the present case, the corporate action of Pentel's Board of Directors was the approval of the sale of its land, particularly described in the corresponding board resolution. For this sale, Pentel 's Board of Directors, including Quintin, designated Jimmy as Pentel's agent in all transactions involving the disposition and conveyance of the subject property. All this information was contained in Board Resolution 2000-001, signed by all the petitioners, which in turn was embodied in the notarized Secretary's Certificate dated February 29, 2000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> However, as earlier emphasized, Quintin could not have participated, much less approved Board Resolution 2000-001 during the board meeting on February 25, 2000, because he was already dead at that time. The petitioners, therefore, falsified a public document by untruthfu1Jy stating that Quintin was among the members of Pentel's Board of Directors that approved the sale of the subject property.<br><br>Pursuant to and by virtue of the authority stated in the falsified Secretary's Certificate, Jimmy subsequently entered into the Deed of Absolute Sale with the Spouses Lee on March 21, 2000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>Thereafter, on March 29, 2000, the conveyance to the Spouses Lee was registered with the Register of Deeds of Pasay City, through the submission of the Secretary's Certificate dated February 29, 2000 and the Deed of Absolute Sale dated March 21, 2000. The annotation on Pentel's title (TCT No. 129824) reveals that the registration resulted in its cancellation and the issuance of a new one in favor of the Spouses Lee.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> <b>This was further corroborated by the Records Officer from the Register of Deeds of Pasay City, who testified that Pentel's title was cancelled when the Secretary's Certificate dated February 29, 2000, alongside the Deed of Absolute Sale dated March 21, 2000, were presented for registration.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>While the voluntary instrument in this case refers to the Deed of Absolute Sale executed between Pentel (as represented by Jimmy) and the Spouses Lee, the constructive notice rule nonetheless still covers the falsified Secretary's Certificate that was registered together with the voluntary instrument. The rule on constructive notice charges the entire world with knowledge of the document's <b>contents</b>, including "<b>all interests, legal and equitable, included therein</b>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> and of "<b>facts that the public record contains</b>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> These facts and contents necessarily include the authority granted to Jimmy, especially since the real property subject of this case was registered in the name of Pentel, which, as a juridical entity, may act only through its Board of Directors or duly authorized officers or agents.<br><br>It should be further borne in mind that when the sale of a piece of land, or any interest therein, is made through an agent (such as Jimmy in this case), the grant of authority must be in writing, otherwise, the sale itself is void.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> The grant of power to the agent must also be expressly stated in clear and unmistakable language;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> otherwise, only acts of administration are deemed conferred.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> As previously mentioned, a corporation grants authority to its representative through its board of directors, which issues a board resolution relative to the appointment of an agent. The corporate secretary then certifies this board resolution under oath, pursuant to Article 1358(1) of the Civil Code.<br><br>Accordingly, whether the party to the sale of a real property is a natural or a juridical person, as long as it is entered into by someone other than its registered owner, the written authority of the party's representative is an explicit requirement to the validity of the sale itself. While the Register of Deeds is not required to inquire into the intrinsic validity of the transaction and should, as a matter of course, record the instrument presented for registration, this ministerial duty is subject to the condition that <i>all</i> the requisites for registration are present.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> In the absence of a prescribed requirement, the Register of Deeds acts in excess of their authority should they proceed to register the instrument.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br><b>Clearly, the registration of the falsified Secretary's Certificate dated February 29, 2000, which proves the authority granted in favor of Jimmy, is indispensable for the validity of the sale of Pentel's property and for this sale to take effect as against third persons.</b> Without this document being presented for registration, the Register of Deeds of Pasay City cannot effectively transfer the title of Pentel to the Spouses Lee, absent any basis that the Deed of Absolute Sale dated March 21, 2000 was executed under the authority of Pentel 's Board of Directors.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br>Likewise, as one of the documents submitted to the Register of Deeds of Pasay City for registration, <b>the falsified Secretary's Certificate forms part of the public record</b>. As such, Lucy and all other third persons were charged with knowledge of-not only the sale or the conveyance of the subject property-but also of the fact that Jimmy acted on behalf of Pentel by virtue of the Secretary's Certificate dated February 29, 2000, which certified Board Resolution 2000-001. Charging Lucy with constructive knowledge of only the sale of Pentel 's real property, without similarly putting her and the entire world on notice of the Secretary's Certificate dated February 29, 2000, disregards the relevant statutory provisions on the requirements for the sale of real property or the transfer of real rights.<br><br>As the Court held in <i>Cayton, et al. v. Zeonnix Trading Corp., et al.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> the nature and scope of the constructive notice rule is as follows:<br><blockquote>When a conveyance has been properly recorded, such record is constructive notice of its <b>contents and all interests, legal and equitable, included therein</b>. Under the rule of notice, it is presumed that the purchaser has examined <b>every instrument of record</b> affecting the title. Such presumption is irrefutable. <b>He is charged with notice of every fact shown by the record and is presumed to know every fact which an examination of the record would have disclosed.</b> This presumption may not be overcome by proof of innocence or good faith. Otherwise, the very purpose and object of the law requiring a record would be destroyed. Such presumption may not be defeated by proof of want of knowledge of what the record contains, any more than one may be permitted to show that he was ignorant of the provisions of the law. The rule that all persons must take notice of the facts that the public record contains is a rule of law. The rule must be absolute. Any variation would lead to endless confusion and useless litigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> (Emphasis Ours)<br></blockquote>As an essential part of the public record, and as an indispensable element to the sale of Pentel's subject property, the constructive notice rule may be appropriately applied to the falsified Secretary's Certificate dated February 29, 2000.<br><br>Squarely applicable to the present case is the Court's ruling in <i>People v. Hon. Villalon</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> in which the public document subject of the case was a notarized SPA authorizing the accused to mortgage a parcel of land for purposes of securing a bank loan. Both the mortgage contract and the SPA were registered with the Registry of Deeds. It was later on discovered that the SPA was falsified, which resulted in the filing of an information charging the accused with <i>estafa</i> through the falsification of a public document. The accused later on filed a motion to dismiss raising the issue of prescription of the crime. The Court applied the constructive notice rule, and clarified that the prescriptive period commenced to run "from the time the offended party had constructive notice of the alleged forgery after the document was <b>registered</b> with the Register of Deeds."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br><br>Remarkably, while the transaction in <i>Villalon</i> referred only to the mortgage, the Court nonetheless considered the accompanying registration of the falsified SPA as constructive notice of the crime. <b>In other words, the registration of the mortgage deed, together with the falsified SPA, commenced the running of the prescriptive period for the crime.</b><br><br><b>Since the registration of all the documentary requirements for transfer of title, including the falsified Secretary's Certificate dated February 29, 2000, was made on March 29, 2000, this is the proper reckoning point from which the prescription of the crime of falsification of a public document began to run.</b> From this date of registration, there was constructive notice of the falsification to the entire world, including the complainant Lucy. She and all other persons were charged with the knowledge of the falsified Secretary's Certificate dated February 29, 2000, beginning on March 29, 2000.<br><br>Having established that the prescriptive period started on March 29, 2000-not from Lucy's actual discovery of the transfer of title, it is now pertinent to discuss whether the prescriptive period has lapsed.<br><br>Article 91 of the RPC provides:<br><blockquote>Art. 91. <i>Computation prescription of offenses</i>. - The period of prescription shall commence to run from the day on which the crime is discovered by the offended party, the authorities, or their agents, and shall be <b>interrupted by the filing of the complaint or information</b>, and shall commence to run again when such proceedings terminate without the accused being convicted or acquitted, or are unjustifiably stopped for any reason not imputable to him.<br><br>The term of prescription shall not run when the offender is absent from the Philippine Archipelago. (Emphasis Ours)<br></blockquote>It is well-settled that the filing of the complaint in the fiscal's office interrupts the prescriptive period.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> Unfortunately, the records of this case do not show the date when Lucy's Affidavit of Complaint was filed. This Court notes, however, that the Affidavit of Complaint was executed on September 21, 2010, or more than ten (10) years from the time that prescription commenced to run on March 29, 2000. Considering that Lucy's complaint could not have been tiled earlier than its date of execution, <b>prescription already set in by March 29, 2010, or approximately five (5) months before the execution of the complaint on September 21, 2010</b>.<br><br>As a result, by the time the criminal Information charging the petitioners with falsification of a public document was filed on May 15, 2012, their criminal liability was already extinguished. On this ground alone, the case against the petitioners should have been dismissed. The State already lost its right to prosecute and punish the petitioners for the crime subject of Criminal Case No. 467715-CR then filed with the MeTC.<br><br>In light of the fact that the petitioners' criminal liability is extinguished, there is no reason to discuss the other arguments raised in the petition. The Court, nonetheless, emphasizes that the merits of the parties' arguments as to the petitioners' guilt were not simply brushed aside. The Court, however, is bound to observe the basic substantive law providing for the prescription of offenses.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.
