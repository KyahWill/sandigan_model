Thus, on February 24, 2004, PAL elevated the case to the Court of Tax Appeals in Division.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></p><p> In her Answer, the Commissioner contended that PAL's claim was subject to administrative routinary investigation or examination by the Bureau of Internal Revenue. She also alleged that PAL's claim was not properly documented, and that it must show that it complied with the prescriptive period for filing refunds under Sections 204(C) and 229 of the National Internal Revenue Code. It likewise asserted that claims for refund are of the same nature as a tax exemption, and thus, are strictly construed against the claimant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> </p><p> PAL presented evidence to support its claim. The Commissioner then submitted the case for decision based on the pleadings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> </p><p> In its November 9, 2010 Decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> the Court of Tax Appeals Special First Division partially granted PAL's Petition and ordered the Commissioner to refund PAL P1,237,646.43, representing the final income tax withheld and remitted by JPMorgan.

Thus, both parties filed separate appeals before the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc, which consolidated the cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></p><p> In its August 14, 2012 Decision, the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc denied the petitions and affirmed the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals Special First Division.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> The Court of Tax Appeals En Banc sustained that PAL needed to prove the remittance of the withheld taxes because although remittance is the responsibility of the banks as withholding agents, remittance was put in issue in this case. Thus, the Court of Tax Appeals Special First Division correctly made a ruling on it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> </p><p> It found that PAL was able to establish the remittance of the taxes withheld by JPMorgan because the monthly remittance returns were identified by PAL's witness and were formally offered in the Court of Tax Appeals Special First Division without objections to their admissibility. It ruled that the monthly remittance returns may be considered even if they were only presented in the Court of Tax Appeals Special First Division as it is a court of record and is required to conduct a formal trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> </p><p> It sustained that PAL failed to prove the remittance by Chinabank, PBCom, and Standard Chartered because it did not show that the amounts remitted by these Agent Banks pertained to the taxes withheld from PAL's interest income.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> </p><p> Thus: </p><blockquote> <p> <strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, all the foregoing considered, the Commissioner's Petition for Review in CTA EB No. 749 and PAL's Petition for Review in CTA EB No. 757 are hereby<strong> DENIED </strong>for lack of merit.

Nos. 206079-80, PAL questions the denial of its refund claim for the taxes withheld by Chinabank, PBCom, and Standard Chartered. PAL argues that it adequately established the withholding and remittance of final taxes through the Certificates of Final Taxes Withheld issued to it by these Agent Banks.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> It contends that these Certificates are <em>prima facie</em> evidence of actual remittance, and if they are uncontroverted, as in this case, they are sufficient proof of remittance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> It holds that the rule pertaining to Creditable Taxes Withheld in <em>CIR v. Asian Transmission Corporation</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> and other Court of Tax Appeals En Banc cases<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> should apply to Final Taxes Withheld, as these are of the same nature.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> </p><p> PAL also insists that it is unequivocally exempt from final withholding taxes,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> and consequently, for as long as it duly establishes that taxes were withheld from its income, it must be refunded.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> It maintains that proof of actual remittance is not necessary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> </p><p> PAL further claims that it need not establish the remittance of income taxes to the Bureau of Internal Revenue because this function is vested with the Agent Banks as the payors and withholding agents of the Commissioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup></p><p> In G.R. No. 206309, the Commissioner questions the grant of refund to PAL for the final income taxes withheld by JPMorgan. She argues that PAL is not entitled to the refund as it failed to present its documentary evidence before the Bureau of Internal Revenue when it filed its administrative claim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></p><p> In its June 10, 2013 Resolution, the two (2) cases were consolidated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> </p><p> The parties thereafter filed their respective Comments,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Replies,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> and Memoranda.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> </p><p> PAL argues that it is entitled to its claim for tax refund or tax credit and insists that it has adequately established that the final taxes on interest income withheld by the banks were remitted to the Bureau of Internal Revenue.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> It contends that the Certificates of Final Taxes Withheld issued by the Agent Banks are <em>prima facie</em> evidence of actual remittance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> As <em>prima facie</em> evidence, they are sufficient proof of the fact that PAL is establishing, if they are unexplained or uncontradicted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> </p><p> As such, PAL avers that the Commissioner had the burden to prove that the Agent Banks failed to remit the withheld taxes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> Nonetheless, the Commissioner simply submitted the case for decision based on the pleadings. It did not contradict or dispute the Certificates of Final Taxes Withheld.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> </p><p> PAL further posits that the failure of the Agent Banks to remit the withheld taxes should not prejudice PAL, because they are the withholding agents accountable for proving remittance. PAL has no control or responsibility over the remittance of the taxes withheld.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> </p><p> Moreover, PAL holds that there is no need for proof of actual remittance to be entitled to claim for refund,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> and that this Court's rulings on creditable taxes withheld should also apply to final taxes withheld at source, as they are of the same nature.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> Since PAL has shown that it is unequivocally exempt from paying final withholding taxes, its taxes were erroneously paid and must be refunded.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup></p><p> PAL further asserts that the Court of Tax Appeals is a court of record, required to conduct a trial <em>de novo</em>. Thus, it should not be barred from considering new evidence not submitted in the administrative claim for refund.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> </p><p> Assuming PAL is limited by the documents it submitted in the administrative level, the Commissioner had the burden to prove that PAL did not submit complete supporting documents. However, it neither showed what documents PAL presented nor established that PAL submitted incomplete supporting documents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup></p><p> PAL further submits that assuming it failed to present the remittance returns on final income tax withheld, the Commissioner could have retrieved these files from the records, as these are monthly returns filed with the Bureau of Internal Revenue.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> As the Chief of the Bureau of Internal Revenue, the Commissioner has access to all tax returns including those of final income tax withheld at source, and thus, is in bad faith in not checking the records to determine whether or not the withheld taxes were remitted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> PAL maintains that the Commissioner's denial of the withholding of the taxes is not a specific denial, and thus, should be deemed as an admission of this fact.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup></p><p> Finally, PAL holds that the denial of its refund because of its failure to submit monthly remittance returns is contrary to substantial justice, equity, and fair play.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup></p><p> On the other hand, the Commissioner argues in her Memorandum<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> that PAL needed to prove, but did not prove, that the withheld taxes were remitted to the Bureau of Internal Revenue.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup></p><p> She points out that PAL only showed the withheld amounts remitted by branches of Chinabank, PBCom, and Standard Chartered, but there is no indication that the remitted amounts are the taxes withheld from PAL's interest income. She argues that PAL must first prove that the money remitted to the Bureau of Internal Revenue is attributable to it because tax refunds are strictly construed against the taxpayer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup></p><p> She further insists that PAL's claim must fail for insufficiency of evidence because it failed to present several of its documentary evidence before the Bureau of Internal Revenue during the administrative level.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> She argues that even if the evidence was presented in the Court of Tax Appeals, it should not be considered because trial <i>de novo</i> in the Court of Tax Appeals must be limited to the evidence shown in the administrative claim for refund.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> The Court of Tax Appeals' judicial review is allegedly limited to whether the Commissioner rightfully ruled on the claim on the basis of the evidence presented in the administrative claim, and the ruling may only be set aside where there is gross abuse of discretion, fraud, or error of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> Thus, she claims that the Court of Tax Appeals erred in considering the new evidence presented to it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> In allowing the presentation of new evidence, the Court of Tax Appeals did not conduct a judicial review. Rather, it adopted an entirely new proceeding.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup></p><p> This Court resolves the following issues: </p><p> First, whether or not evidence not presented in the administrative claim for refund in the Bureau of Internal Revenue can be presented in the Court of Tax Appeals; </p><p> Second, whether or not Philippine Airlines, Inc. was able to prove remittance of its final taxes withheld to the Bureau of Internal Revenue; and </p><p> Finally, whether or not proof of remittance is necessary for Philippine Airlines, Inc. to claim a refund under its charter, Presidential Decree No. 1590. </p><p> This Court sustains the factual findings of the Court of Tax Appeals that Philippine Airlines, Inc. failed to prove remittance of the withheld taxes. </p><p> Nonetheless, this Court grants the Petition of Philippine Airlines, Inc.</p><p align="center"> <b>I</b> </p><p> The Commissioner contends that PAL failed to present several of its documentary evidence before the Bureau of Internal Revenue during the administrative level.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> Thus, she claims that the new evidence that petitioner presented in the Court of Tax Appeals should not have been considered because trial <i>de novo</i> in the Court of Tax Appeals must be limited to the evidence shown in the administrative claim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> </p><p> This Court rules that the Court of Tax Appeals is not limited by the evidence presented in the administrative claim in the Bureau of Internal Revenue. The claimant may present new and additional evidence to the Court of Tax Appeals to support its case for tax refund. </p><p> Section 4 of the National Internal Revenue Code<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> states that the Commissioner has the power to decide on tax refunds, but his or her decision is subject to the exclusive appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Tax Appeals: </p><blockquote> <p> Section 4. <i>Power of the Commissioner to Interpret Tax Laws and to Decide Tax Cases</i>. — The power to interpret the provisions of this Code and other tax laws shall be under the exclusive and original jurisdiction of the Commissioner, subject to review by the Secretary of Finance.</p> <p> The power to decide disputed assessments, refunds of internal revenue taxes, fees or other charges, penalties imposed in relation thereto, or other matters arising under this Code or other laws or portions thereof administered by the Bureau of Internal Revenue is vested in the commissioner, subject to the exclusive appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Tax Appeals. </p> </blockquote> <p> Republic Act No. 9282,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> amending Republic Act No. 1125,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> is the governing law on the jurisdiction of the Court of Tax Appeals. Section 7 provides that the Court of Tax Appeals has exclusive appellate jurisdiction over tax refund claims in case the Commissioner fails to act on them: </p><blockquote> <p> Section 7. <i>Jurisdiction</i>. — The CTA shall exercise: </p> <p> (a) Exclusive appellate jurisdiction to review by appeal, as herein provided:</p> <blockquote> <p> (1) Decisions of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue in cases involving disputed assessments,<i> refunds of internal revenue taxes</i>, fees or other charges, penalties in relation thereto, or other matters arising under the National Internal Revenue or other laws administered by the Bureau of Internal Revenue; </p> <p> (2) Inaction by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue in cases involving disputed assessments, <i>refunds of internal revenue taxes</i>, fees or other charges, penalties in relation thereto, or other matters arising under the National Internal Revenue Code or other laws administered by the Bureau of Internal Revenue, where the National Internal Revenue Code provides a specific period of action, in which case the inaction shall be deemed a denial; </p> <p> (3) Decisions, orders or resolutions of the Regional Trial Courts in local tax cases originally decided or resolved by them in the exercise of their original or appellate jurisdiction[.] (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> This means that while the Commissioner has the right to hear a refund claim first, if he or she fails to act on it, it will be treated as a denial of the refund, and the Court of Tax Appeals is the only entity that may review this ruling. </p><p> The power of the Court of Tax Appeals to exercise its appellate jurisdiction does not preclude it from considering evidence that was not presented in the administrative claim in the Bureau of Internal Revenue. Republic Act No. 1125 states that the Court of Tax Appeals is a court of record: </p><blockquote> <p> Section 8. <i>Court of record; seal; proceedings</i>. — The Court of Tax Appeals shall be a court of record and shall have a seal which shall be judicially noticed. It shall prescribe the form of its writs and other processes. It shall have the power to promulgate rules and regulations for the conduct of the business of the Court, and as may be needful for the uniformity of decisions within its jurisdiction as conferred by law, but such proceedings shall not be governed strictly by technical rules of evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> As such, parties are expected to litigate and prove every aspect of their case anew and formally offer all their evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> No value is given to documentary evidence submitted in the Bureau of Internal Revenue unless it is formally offered in the Court of Tax Appeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> Thus, the review of the Court of Tax Appeals is not limited to whether or not the Commissioner committed gross abuse of discretion, fraud, or error of law, as contended by the Commissioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> As evidence is considered and evaluated again, the scope of the Court of Tax Appeals' review covers factual findings.</p><p> In <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Philippine National Bank</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> Finally, petitioner's allegation that the submission of the certificates of withholding taxes before the Court of Tax Appeals was late is untenable. The samples of the withholding tax certificates attached to respondent's comment bore the receiving stamp of the Bureau of Internal Revenue's Large Taxpayers Document Processing and Quality Assurance Division. As observed by the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc, "<em>[t]he Commissioner</em> is in no position to assail the authenticity of the CWT certificates due to PNB's alleged failure to submit the same before the administrative level since <i>he could have easily directed the claimant to furnish copies of these documents, if the refund applied for casts him any doubt."

Proof of actual remittance is not a condition to claim for a refund of unutilized tax credits. Under Sections 57 and 58 of the 1997 National Internal Revenue Code, as amended, it is the payor-withholding agent, and not the payee-refund claimant such as respondent, who is vested with the responsibility of withholding and remitting income taxes. </p> <p> This court's ruling in <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Asian Transmission Corporation</i>, citing the Court of Tax Appeals' explanation, is instructive: </p> <blockquote> <p> . . . proof of actual remittance by the respondent is not needed in order to prove withholding and remittance of taxes to petitioner. Section 2.58.3 (B) of Revenue Regulation No. 2-98 clearly provides that proof of remittance is the responsibility of the withholding agent and not of the taxpayer-refund claimant. It should be borne in mind by the petitioner that <i>payors of withholding taxes are by themselves constituted as withholding agents of the BIR. The taxes they withhold are held in trust for the government. In the event that the withholding agents commit fraud against the government by not remitting the taxes so withheld, such act should not prejudice herein respondent who has been duly withheld taxes by the withholding agents acting under government authority</i>. Moreover, pursuant to Sections 57 and 58 of the NIRC of 1997, as amended, the withholding of income tax and the remittance thereof to the BIR is the<i> responsibility of the payor</i> and not the payee. Therefore, respondent . . . has no control over the remittance of the taxes withheld from its income by the withholding agent or payor who is the agent of the petitioner. The Certificates of Creditable Tax Withheld at Source issued by the withholding agents of the government are <i>prima facie </i>proof of actual payment by herein respondent-payee to the government itself through said agents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[134]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> In the case at bar, PAL is the income earner and the payee of the final withholding tax, and the Agent Banks are the withholding agents who are the payors responsible for the deduction and remittance of the tax.</p><p> Given the above provisions, the failure of the Agent Banks to remit the amounts does not affect and should not prejudice PAL.

Heavily militating against respondent Commissioner is the ancient principle that no one, not even the state, shall enrich oneself at the expense of another. Indeed, simple justice requires the speedy refund of the wrongly held taxes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[163]</sup> (Citations omitted)</p> </blockquote> <p> Considering that PAL presented sufficient proof that: (i) it is exempted from paying withholding taxes; (ii) amounts were withheld and deducted from its accounts; (iii) and the Commissioner did not contest the withholding of these amounts and only raises that they were not proven to be remitted, this Court finds that PAL sufficiently proved that it is entitled to its claim for refund.</p><p> Finally, both the Commissioner and the Court of Tax Appeals should have appreciated the unreasonable difficulty that it would have put the taxpayer—in this case PAL—to claim a statutory exemption granted to it. In requiring that it prove actual remittance, the court<em> a quo </em>and the Commissioner effectively put the burden on the payee to prove that both government and the banks complied with their legal obligation. It would have been near impossible for the taxpayer to demand to see the records of the payor bank or the ledgers of the government. The legislative policy was to provide incentives to the taxpayer by unburdening it of taxes. By administrative and judicial interpretation, such policy would have been unreasonably reversed. This is not this Court's view of equity. Clearly, the taxpayer in this case is entitled to relief. </p><p> <strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, premises considered, the Petition of Philippine Airlines, Inc. in <strong>G.R.
