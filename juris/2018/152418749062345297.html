				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">We resolve this Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, assailing the August 29, 2012 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> and the March 11, 2013 Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR No. 00896. The CA affirmed with modification the January 14, 2008 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 29, Iloilo City, which found petitioner Eden Etino guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of frustrated homicide, in that the CA ordered petitioner to pay the victim P25,000.00 as moral damages and P10,000.00 as temperate damages.<br><br><center><b>The Antecedent Facts</b><br></center><br>Petitioner was charged with the crime of frustrated homicide in an Information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> dated June 19, 2003 which reads:<br><blockquote>That on or about the 5<sup>th</sup> day of November 2001, in the Municipality of Maasin, Province of Iloilo, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, armed with an unlicensed firearm of unknown caliber, with deliberate intent and decided purpose to kill, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and shoot JESSIEREL LEYBLE with said unlicensed firearm he was then provided at the time, hitting and inflicting upon the victim gunshot wounds on the different parts of ills body, thus performing all the acts of execution which would produce the crime of homicide as a consequence but which nevertheless did not produce it by reason of some cause or causes independent of the will of the accused, that is, by the timely medical attendance rendered to the said Jessierel Leyble which prevented his death.<br></blockquote>Upon arraignment, petitioner entered a plea of not guilty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Trial thereafter ensued.<br><br><b><i>The Evidence for the Prosecution</i></b><br><br>The prosecution's evidence consists mainly of the testimonies of complainant Jessierel Leyble (Leyble), Isidro Maldecir (Maldecir), and Nida Villarete Sonza (Sonza), the Administrative and Medical Officer of the West Visayas State University Medical Center (WVSUMC).<br><br>During the trial, Leyble testified that, "at about 4:30 o'clock in the afternoon of November 5, 2001, while he and his companions[,] Isidro Maldecir and Richard Magno[,] were walking on their way home to Bgy.

It ruled that petitioner was positively identified as the perpetrator of the crime charged against him, especially so, when the complainant, Leyble, was alive to tell what actually happened.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Accordingly, the RTC sentenced petitioner to suffer the penalty of imprisonment of two (2) years, four (4) months and one (1) day of <i>prision correccional</i>, as minimum, to eight (8) years and one (1) day of <i>prision mayor</i>, as maximum. Notably, it did not award any damages in favor of Leyble, as it found that the prosecution had failed to discharge its burden of presenting evidence on the civil aspect of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br><b><i>The Court of Appeals Ruling</i></b><br><br>On appellate review, the CA affirmed with modification the RTC Decision in that, it ordered petitioner to pay Leyble the amounts of P25,000.00 as moral damages and P10,000.00 as temperate damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>The CA ruled that "the trial court did not err in giving full weight and credence to the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses. Evaluation of the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses amply [showed] that Jessierel Leyble succinctly but clearly narrated how he was shot and he also categorically identified [petitioner] as his assailant."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>In addition, the CA held that the mere delay in the filing of the complaint did not necessarily undermine the credibility of witnesses; and in this case, the fear of reprisal explained why it took some time for Leyble to file the complaint and to finally reveal the identity of his assailant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>The CA also rejected petitioner's claim that Leyble filed the case against him because he testified against the latter in the Comelec gun-ban case. It explained that "[e]ven assuming that there was a grudge between Leyble and [petitioner], that [did] not automatically render the testimony of Leyble unbelievable. Moreover, considering that Leyble had positively identified [petitioner], whom he [knew] from childhood, as his assailant, motive [was] no longer essential or relevant."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Finally, the CA held that Leyble was entitled to moral damages, as it was clear from his testimony that he sustained gunshot wounds on his shoulder; and to temperate damages for the medical treatment he received but for which no documentary evidence was presented to prove the actual costs thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Petitioner moved for reconsideration, but the CA denied the motion in its Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> dated March 11, 2013. As a consequence, petitioner filed the present Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i> before the Court, assailing the CA's August 29, 2012 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> and the March 11, 2013 Resolution. <br><br><center><b>The Issues</b><br></center><br>Petitioner raises the following issues tor the Court's consideration:<br><br><i>First</i>, whether the CA erred in holding that his guilt for the charged crime of frustrated homicide was proven beyond reasonable doubt, since the physician who examined the victim was not presented in court;<br><br><i>Second</i>, whether the CA erred when it found the testimonies of petitioner and his witnesses to be incredible and unbelievable; and,<br><br><i>Third</i>, whether the CA erred when it disregarded petitioner's defenses, i.e., the lapse of unreasonable time for Leyble to file the complaint against him, the failure of Leyble to positively identify him as the assailant, and Leyble's motive in filing the case against him.<br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b><br></center><br>At the outset, we clarify that questions of fact, as a rule, <span style="font-style: italic;">cannot</span> be entertained in a Rule 45 petition, where the Court's jurisdiction is limited to reviewing and revising <i>errors of law</i> that might have been committed by the lower courts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Nevertheless, when it appears that the assailed judgment is based on a <i>misapprehension of facts</i>, and the findings of the lower courts are <i>conclusions without citation of specific evidence</i> on which they are based,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> as in this case, the Court may probe questions of fact in a Rule 45 proceeding.<br><br>Article 6 of the Revised Penal Code defines the stages of a felony as follows:<br><blockquote>ART. 6. Consummated, frustrated, and attempted felonies. - Consummated felonies, as well as those which are frustrated and attempted, are punishable.<br><br>A felony is consummated when all the elements necessary for its execution and accomplishment are present; and it is <b>frustrated</b> when the offender performs all the acts of execution which would produce the felony as a consequence but which, nevertheless, do not produce it by reason of causes independent of the will of the perpetrator.<br><br>There is an <b>attempt</b> when the offender commences the commission of felony directly by overt acts, and does not perform all the acts of execution which should produce the felony by reason of some cause or accident other than his own spontaneous desistance. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>In <i>Palaganas v. People</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> the Court outlined the distinctions between a frustrated and an attempted felony:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">1.)</div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify"> In frustrated felony, the offender has performed all the acts of execution which should produce the felony as a consequence; whereas in attempted felony, the offender merely commences the commission of a felony directly by overt acts and does not perform all the acts of execution.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">2.) </div></td><td><div align="justify">In frustrated felony, the reason for the non-accomplishment of the crime is some cause independent of the will of the perpetrator; on the other hand, in attempted felony, the reason for the non-fulfillment of the crime is a cause or accident other than the offender's own spontaneous desistance.<br></div></td></tr></tbody></table><br>In addition to these distinctions, we have ruled in several cases that when the accused intended to kill his victim, as manifested by his use of a deadly weapon in his assault, and his victim sustained fatal or mortal wound/s but did not die because of timely medical assistance, the crime committed is frustrated murder or frustrated homicide depending on whether or not any of the qualifying circumstances under Article 249 of the Revised Penal Code are present. However, if the wound/s sustained by the victim in such a case were not fatal or mortal, then the crime committed is only attempted murder or attempted homicide. <b>If there was no intent to kill on the part of the accused and the wound/s sustained by the victim were not fatal, the crime committed may be serious, less serious or slight physical injury.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Thus, in order to determine whether the crime committed is attempted or frustrated parricide, murder or homicide, or only <i>lesiones</i> (physical injuries), the crucial points to consider are: a) <i>whether the injury sustained by the victim was fatal</i>, and b) <i>whether there was intent to kill on the part of the accused</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br><b><i>No proof of the extent of injury sustained by the victim</i></b><br><br>It is settled that "where there is nothing in the evidence to show that the wound would be fatal if not medically attended to, <b>the character of the wound is doubtful,</b>"<b> and such doubt should be resolved in favor of the accused</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>In this case, we find that the prosecution failed to present evidence to prove that the victim would have died from his wound without timely medical assistance, as his Medical Certificate<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> alone, <b>absent the testimony of the physician who diagnosed and treated him, or any physician for that matter</b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> is <i>insufficient</i> proof of the nature and extent of his injury. This is especially true, given that said Medical Certificate merely stated the victim's period of confinement at the hospital, the location of the gunshot wounds, the treatments he received, and his period of healing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Without such proof, the character of the gunshot wounds that the victim sustained enters the realm of doubt, which the Court must necessarily resolve in favor of petitioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br><b><i>The intent to kill was not sufficiently established</i></b><br><br>"The assailant's intent to kill is the main element that distinguishes the crime of physical injuries from the crime of homicide. The crime can only be homicide <i>if</i> the intent to kill is proven."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> The intent to kill must be proven "in a clear and evident manner [so as] to exclude every possible doubt as to the homicidal intent of the aggressor."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>In <i>Rivera v. People</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> the Court ruled that "[i]ntent to kill is a specific intent which the prosecution must prove by direct or circumstantial evidence",<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> which may consist of:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">[a)]</div></td><td width="95%"> <div align="justify">the <em>means</em> used by the malefactors;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">[b)] </div></td><td><div align="justify">the <em>nature, location and number of wounds</em> sustained by the victim;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">[c)] </div></td><td><div align="justify">the <em>conduct of the malefactors</em> before, at the time, or immediately after the killing of the victim;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">[(d)] </div></td><td><div align="justify">the <em>circumstances</em> under which the crime was committed; and, </div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">[e)] </div></td><td><div align="justify">the <em>motives</em> of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>Moreover, the Court held in <i>Rivera</i> that intent to kill is only presumed <i>if</i> the victim dies as a result of a deliberate act of the malefactors.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Although it was sufficiently shown that petitioner fired a 12 gauge shotgun at the victim, there was simply no other evidence on record that tended to prove that petitioner had <i>animus interficendi</i> or intent to kill the victim. On the contrary, none of the prosecution's witnesses testified that petitioner had indeed aimed and fired the shotgun to <i>kill</i> the victim.<br><br>It is to be noted, likewise, that petitioner only fired a <i>single</i> shot<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> at <i>close­range</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> but did <i>not</i> hit any vital part of the victims body - the victim's wounds, based on his Medical Certificate, were located at the right deltoid (through and through) and the left shoulder<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> - and he immediately <i>fled</i> the scene right after the shooting.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> These acts certainly do not suggest that petitioner had intended to kill the victim; for if he did, he could have fired multiple shots to ensure the latter's demise.<br><br>Besides, by the victim's own narration of events, it appears that he did not sustain any fatal injury as a result of the shooting considering that he and his companions even went in pursuit of petitioner after the incident, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td colspan="2"><div align="justify">[ASST.

After all, it is settled that "[i]ntent to kill <i>cannot</i> be automatically drawn from the mere fact that the use of firearms is dangerous to life."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Rather, "[<i>a</i>]<i>nimus interficendi</i> must be established with the same degree of certainty as is required of the other elements of the crime. The inference of intent to kill should not be drawn in the absence of circumstances sufficient to prove such intent beyond reasonable doubt."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>This is not to say that petitioner is without any criminal liability. When the intent to kill is lacking, but wounds are shown to have been inflicted upon the victim, as in this case, <b>the crime is not frustrated or attempted homicide but physical injuries only</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Since the victim's period of incapacity and healing of his injuries was more than 30 days - he was confined at the hospital from November 5 to 25, 2001, or for 20 days, and his period of healing was "two (2) to four (4) weeks barring complications"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> - the crime committed is <b>serious physical injuries</b> under Article 263, par. 4 of the Revised Penal Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br><b><i>Petitioner's Defenses</i></b><br><br>We reject petitioner's contention that the prosecution failed to identify him as the victim's assailant, given that he "was not identified and never mentioned [in the police blotter] as the one who shot the victim" even though it was the victim himself who personally reported the incident to the authorities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>Based on the Police Blotter dated January 18, 2002, the victim had identified petitioner and his companions as his assailants during the November 5, 2001 shooting incident, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>9:20 AM - (Shooting Incident) Jessirel Leyble y Subade, 25 years old, single, and a resident of Brgy[.] Pispis, Maasin, Iloilo reported personally to this Office alleging that last November 5, 2001 at around 4:30 P.M. while he was on their [sic] way home at Brgy[.] Pispis, this Municipality[,] was waylaid and shot with a firearms [<i>sic</i>] <b>by the group of Eden Etino, Bautista Etino, Joeserel Masiado, Alfredo Jabadan, Wiliam Besarcs and Wenefredo Besares</b>, all resident [sic] of the same place.

As a result, the defenses of denial and alibi raised by petitioner must necessarily fail.
