However, it found Broñola, Jeremias Capellan (Jeremias), Arnel Capellan (Arnel), Temmie Nawal (Nawal), and Eduardo Capillan (Eduardo) to be regular employees and ordered L.

They assert that petitioners who claim to be maintenance personnel were actually carpenters or masons deployed by petitioner Del Remedios for his own account.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> </p><p> Respondents refer to the statements of petitioners Rolando Salen and Larry Abañes as proof that the maintenance personnel were employees of Del Remedios: </p><blockquote> <p> 4.1.17.

And, that when they signed the complaint, they were only forced by Rodolfo Del Remedios to do so. These two supposed petitioners are apologetic to Respondent and that they were withdrawing their respective complaints as indicated in their written statements. They should therefore be taken out from the list of the petitioners. The written retraction of Rolando Salen is reproduced as follows: </p> <blockquote> <p> "Ako po si Rolando A.

Natividad Poultry Farms can be considered as its regular employees.</p><p> When a decision of the Court of Appeals decided under Rule 65 is brought to this Court through a petition for review under Rule 45, the general rule is that this Court may only pass upon questions of law. <i>Meralco Industrial Engineering Services Corp. v. National Labor Relations Commission</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> emphasized as follows: </p><blockquote> <p> This Court is not a trier of facts. Well-settled is the rule that the jurisdiction of this Court in a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Court is limited to reviewing only errors of law, not of fact, unless the factual findings complained of are completely devoid of support from the evidence on record, or the assailed judgment is based on a gross misapprehension of facts. Besides, factual findings of quasi-judicial agencies like the [National Labor Relations Commission], when affirmed by the Court of Appeals, are conclusive upon the parties and binding on this Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Furthermore, judicial review under Rule 45 is confined to the question of whether or not the Court of Appeals correctly "determined the presence or absence of grave abuse of discretion in the [National Labor Relations Commission] decision before it and not on the basis of whether the [National Labor Relations Commission] decision on the merits of the case was correct."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> </p><p> Respondents deny that the petitioners, who claim to be maintenance personnel are their employees and declare that they were hired by independent contractors, who exercised control over them and paid their wages.</p><p> Respondents fail to convince.</p><p> Permissible contracting or subcontracting, and labor-only contracting is provided for under Article 106 of the Labor Code: </p><blockquote> <p> Article 106. Contractor or subcontractor. — Whenever an employer enters into a contract with another person for the performance of the former's work, the employees of the contractor and of the latter's subcontractor, if any, shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of this Code.</p> <p> In the event that the contractor or subcontractor fails to pay the wages of his employees in accordance with this Code, the employer shall be jointly and severally liable with his contractor or subcontractor to such employees to the extent of the work performed under the contract, in the same manner and extent that he is liable to employees directly employed by him.</p> <p> The Secretary of Labor and Employment may, by appropriate regulations, restrict or prohibit the contracting-out of labor to protect the rights of workers established under this Code. In so prohibiting or restricting, he may make appropriate distinctions between labor-only contracting and job contracting as well as differentiations within these types of contracting and determine who among the parties involved shall be considered the employer for purposes of this Code, to prevent any violation or circumvention of any provision of this Code.</p> <p> There is "labor-only" contracting where the person supplying workers to an employer does not have substantial capital or investment in the form of tools, equipment, machineries, work premises, among others, and the workers recruited and placed by such person are performing activities which are directly related to the principal business of such employer. In such cases, the person or intermediary shall be considered merely as an agent of the employer who shall be responsible to the workers in the same manner and extent as if the latter were directly employed by him.</p> </blockquote> <p> Labor-only contracting is prohibited as it is seen as a circumvention of labor laws; thus, the labor-only contractor is treated as a mere agent or intermediary of its principal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></p> <p> The Court of Appeals found that San Mateo and petitioner Del Remedios were not independent contractors but labor-only contractors since they did not have substantial investment in the form of tools, equipment, or work premises.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> As labor-only contractors, they were considered to be agents of respondent L. Natividad: </p><blockquote> <p> The fact, however, that neither of the contractors [San Mateo] and Rodolfo Del Remedios had substantial investment in the form of tools, equipment and even work premises, nor were the services performed by their workers, i.e. carpentry and masonry works, directly related to and usually necessary and desirable in [L. Natividad]'s main business of livestock and poultry production showed that they were merely engaged in "labor-only" contracting. As "labor-only" contractors, [San Mateo] and Rodolfo Del Remedios are considered as agents of the employer, [L. Natividad]. Liability, therefore, if any, must be shouldered by either one or shared by both. As it was, however, petitioners failed to prove any unpaid claims against [L. Natividad].<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> However, the Court of Appeals ruled that even if petitioners were L. Natividad's employees, they still cannot be considered as regular employees because there was no reasonable connection between the nature of their carpentry and masonry work and respondents' usual business in poultry and livestock production, sale, and distribution. It also found that the maintenance personnel were hired on a piece rate or <em>pakyaw</em> basis about once or thrice a year, to perform repair or maintenance works; thus, they could not be considered as regular employees.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> </p><p> The Court of Appeals is mistaken.</p><p> A <i>pakyaw</i> or task basis arrangement defines the manner of payment of wages and not the relationship between the parties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Payment through <i>pakyaw</i> or task basis is provided for in Articles 97(f) and 101 of the Labor Code: </p><blockquote> <p> Article 97. Definitions. — As used in this Title:</p> <p>. . . . </p> <p> (f) "Wage" paid to any employee shall mean the <i>remuneration or earnings</i>, however designated, capable of being expressed in terms of money, whether fixed or ascertained on a time, <i>task, piece</i>, or commission basis, or other method of calculating the same, which is payable by an employer to an employee under a written or unwritten contract of employment for work done or to be done, or for services rendered or to be rendered and includes the fair and reasonable value, as determined by the Secretary of Labor and Employment, of board, lodging, or other facilities customarily furnished by the employer to the employee. "Fair and reasonable value" shall not include any profit to the employer, or to any person affiliated with the employer.</p> <p> . . . .</p> <p> Article 101. Payment by results. — (a) The Secretary of Labor and Employment shall regulate the payment of wages by results, including pakyao, piecework, and other non-time work, in order to ensure the payment of fair and reasonable wage rates, preferably through time and motion studies or in consultation with representatives of workers' and employers' organizations. </p> </blockquote> <p> Both the National Labor Relations Commission and the Court of Appeals found respondent L. Natividad to be petitioners' real employer, in light of the labor-only contracting arrangement between respondents, San Mateo, and petitioner Del Remedios. This Court sees no reason to disturb their findings since their findings are supported by substantial evidence.</p><p> Furthermore, a resort to the four (4)-fold test of "(1) the selection and engagement of the employee; (2) the payment of wages; (3) the power of dismissal; and (4) the power to control the employee's conduct"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> also strengthens the finding that respondent L. Natividad is petitioners' employer.</p><p> Respondents hired petitioners directly or through petitioner Del Remedios, a supervisor at respondents' farm.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> They likewise paid petitioners' wages, as seen by the vouchers<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> issued to Del Remedios and San Mateo. They also had the power of dismissal inherent in their power to select and engage their employees. Most importantly though, they controlled petitioners and their work output by maintaining an attendance sheet and by giving them specific tasks and assignments.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup></p><p> With an employer-employee relationship between respondent L. Natividad and petitioners duly established, the next question for resolution is whether petitioners can be considered to be regular employees.</p><p> A regular employee is an employee who is: </p><blockquote> <p> 1) engaged to perform tasks usually necessary or desirable in the usual business or trade of the employer, unless the employment is one for a specific project or undertaking or where the work is seasonal and for the duration of a season; or 2) <i>has rendered at least 1 year of service, whether such service is continuous or broken, with respect to the activity for which he is employed</i> and his employment continues as long as such activity exists.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted)</p> </blockquote> <p> This finds basis in Article 280 of the Labor Code which provides: </p><blockquote> <p> Article 295. [280] Regular and casual employment. — The provisions of written agreement to the contrary notwithstanding and regardless of the oral agreement of the parties, an employment shall be deemed to be regular where the employee has been engaged to perform activities which are usually necessary or desirable in the usual business or trade of the employer, except where the employment has been fixed for a specific project or undertaking the completion or termination of which has been determined at the time of the engagement of the employee or where the work or service to be performed is seasonal in nature and the employment is for the duration of the season.</p> <p> An employment shall be deemed to be casual if it is not covered by the preceding paragraph: Provided, that any employee who has rendered at least one year of service, whether such service is continuous or broken, shall be considered a regular employee with respect to the activity in which he is employed and his employment shall continue while such activity exists.</p> </blockquote> <p> <i>De Leon v. National Labor Relations Commission</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> instructs that "[t]he primary standard, therefore, of determining a regular employment is the reasonable connection between the particular activity performed by the employee in relation to the usual business or trade of the employer."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> The connection is determined by considering the nature of the work performed vis-a-vis the entirety of the business or trade. Likewise, if an employee has been on the job for at least one (1) year, even if the performance of the job is intermittent, the repeated and continuous need for the employee's services is sufficient evidence of the indispensability of his or her services to the employer's business.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup></p><p> Respondents did not refute petitioners' claims that they continuously worked for respondents for a period ranging from three (3) years to 17 years.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Thus, even if the Court of Appeals is of the opinion that carpentry and masonry are not necessary or desirable to the business of livestock and poultry production,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> the nature of their employment could have been characterized as being under the second paragraph of Article 280. Thus, petitioners' service of more than one (1) year to respondents has made them regular employees for so long as the activities they were required to do subsist.</p><p> Nonetheless, a careful review of petitioners' activity as maintenance personnel and of the entirety of respondents' business convinces this Court that they performed activities which were necessary and desirable to respondents' business of poultry and livestock production.</p><p> As maintenance personnel, petitioners performed "repair works and maintenance services such as fixing livestock and poultry houses and facilities as well as doing construction activities within the premises of [L. Natividad's] farms and other sales outlets for an uninterrupted period of three (3) to seventeen (17) years."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> Respondents had several farms and offices in Quezon City and Montalban, including Patiis Farm, where petitioners were regularly deployed to perform repair and maintenance work.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup></p><p> At first glance it may appear that maintenance personnel are not necessary to a poultry and livestock business. However, in this case, respondents kept several farms, offices, and sales outlets, meaning that they had animal houses and other related structures necessary to their business that needed constant repair and maintenance. In petitioner Del Remedios' sworn affidavit: </p><blockquote> <p> 1. RODOLFO DEL REMEDIOS — Noong Marso 1990, ako ay direktang tinanggap at nagtrabaho sa malawak na farm ng L. Natividad Poultry Farms sa San Mateo Rizal na pagmamay-ari ni Gng. Juliana Natividad at pinamamahalaan ng kanyang anak nasi Merlinda Natividad. <i>Ako ang nangangasiwa sa pagkukumpuni sa mga sirang bahay ng mga manok, baboy atbp., gumawa at tumulong sa construction ng mga ito at magmentina ng mga pasilidad sa loob ng farm at maging sa mga sales outlets nito sa iba’t ibang Iugar.</i> Ako ay isa lamang empleyado ng L. Natividad Poultry Farms at kasamang sumasahod ng iba pang mga trabahador. Ang lahat ng gamit o materyales sa paggawa at pagkukumpuni ng mga bahay ng mga manok, baboy atbp. ay nanggagaling sa L. Natividad Poultry Farms.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> <i>Gapayao v. Fulo</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> likewise categorically stated that <i>pakyaw</i> workers may be considered as regular employees provided that their employers exercised control over them. Thus, while petitioners may have been paid on <i>pakyaw</i> or task basis, their mode of compensation did not preclude them from being regular employees.</p><p> Being regular employees, petitioners, who were maintenance personnel, enjoyed security of tenure<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> and the termination of their services without just cause entitles them to reinstatement and full backwages, inclusive of allowances and other benefits. </p><p> Nonetheless, the prayer for moral and exemplary damages must be denied. The termination of employment without just cause or due process does not immediately justify the award of moral and exemplary damages. <i>Philippine School of Business Administration v. National Labor Relations Commission</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> stated: </p><blockquote> <p> This Court however cannot sustain the award of moral and exemplary damages in favor of private respondents. Such an award cannot be justified solely upon the premise that the employer fired his employee without just cause or due process. Additional facts must be pleaded and proved to warrant the grant of moral damages under the Civil Code. The act of dismissal must be attended with bad faith, or fraud or was oppressive to labor or done in a manner contrary to morals, good customs or public policy and, of course, that social humiliation, wounded feelings, or grave anxiety resulted therefrom. Similarly, exemplary damages are recoverable only when the dismissal was effected in a wanton, oppressive or malevolent manner.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> (Citations omitted)</p> </blockquote> <p> Petitioners maintain that their employments were terminated by respondents in an "oppressive, malicious and unjustified manner,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> yet they failed to explain or illustrate how their dismissal was oppressive, malicious, or unjustified. It is not enough that they were dismissed without due process. Additional acts of the employers must also be pleaded and proved to show that their dismissal was tainted with bad faith or fraud, was oppressive to labor, or was done in a manner contrary to morals, good customs, or public policy. Petitioners failed to allege any acts by respondents which would justify the award of moral or exemplary damages.</p><p> As for petitioners Broñola, Gonzales, Martinez, Jeremias, Arnel, Nawal, and Eduardo, although the Court of Appeals reversed the labor tribunals' decisions and held them to be regular employees, it nonetheless upheld the findings of both Labor Arbiter Jerez and the National Labor Relations Commission that they failed to support their allegation that they were illegally dismissed, thus: </p><blockquote> <p> In illegal dismissal cases, it is incumbent upon the employees to first establish the fact of their dismissal before the burden is shifted to the employer to prove that the dismissal was legal. Here, [the National Labor Relations Commission] found no dismissal, much less, an illegal one as petitioners failed to substantiate their bare allegation that [L. Natividad] verbally notified them of their dismissal. It is settled that in the absence of proof of dismissal, the remedy is reinstatement without backwages.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Illegal dismissal is essentially a factual issue,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> and therefore, not proper in a Rule 45 petition. This Court does not try facts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> Moreover, the labor tribunals and the Court of Appeals unanimously held that petitioners were not illegally dismissed. This Court sees no reason to overturn their findings as it is settled that: </p><blockquote> <p> [T]he findings of facts and conclusion of the [National Labor Relations Commission] are generally accorded not only great weight and respect but even clothed with finality and deemed binding on this Court as long as they are supported by substantial evidence. This Court finds no basis for deviating from said doctrine without any clear showing that the findings of the Labor Arbiter, as affirmed by the [National Labor Relations Commission], are bereft of substantiation. Particularly when passed upon and upheld by the Court of Appeals, they are binding and conclusive upon the Supreme Court and will not normally be disturbed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> (Citations omitted)</p> </blockquote> <p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, this Court resolves to <b>PARTIALLY GRANT</b> the petition.
