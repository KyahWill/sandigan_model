Additionally, Solis was found guilty of falsification of public documents punished under Article 171, paragraph 4<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> of the Revised Penal Code. The criminal cases were filed in connection with the execution of a Compromise Agreement involving 4,689 hectares of land located within Fort Magsaysay Military Reservation (Fort Magsaysay), a land of the public domain, but was almost registered under the name of Garcia-Diaz, a private person.<br><br>In 1976, Garcia-Diaz's predecessor-in-interest, Flora L. Garcia (Garcia), filed an application for registration of a 16,589.84-hectare property located in Laur and Palayan City, Nueva Ecija before the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija. Garcia based her application on the supposed title of her predecessor, Melecio Padilla (Padilla), as evidenced by Possessory Information Title No. 216 issued during the Spanish regime. The property was surveyed and its technical description provided in Bureau of Lands (BL) Plan II-6752.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Garcia further alleged that she had been in possession of the property for 26 years, as of the filing of her application, in addition to the possession and enjoyment of her predecessors, which had lasted for more than 80 years.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>The case was docketed as Land Registration Case No. 853, LRC-Record No. N-51127.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>The Republic of the Philippines (the Republic) opposed Garcia's application mainly on the ground that the property sought to be registered formed part of Fort Magsaysay per Presidential Proclamation No. 237 dated December 19, 1955.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> The property, the Republic claimed, formed part of the public domain and was inalienable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Despite the Republic's opposition, the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija granted Garcia's application for registration.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> This led to the Republic's filing of an appeal before the Court of Appeals, which was docketed as CA-G.R.

They went on to file a Petition for Review on Certiorari before this Court, entitled <i>Flora L. Garcia v. Court of Appeals, et al. </i>and docketed as G.R. No. 104561, but it was likewise denied in this Court's April 8, 1992 Resolution for lack of reversible error in the challenged decision. The Motion for Reconsideration of the April 8, 1992 Resolution was denied with finality on June 15, 1992.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>As for Garcia-Diaz, she did not join her co-heirs in appealing before this Court. Instead, during the pendency of her own motion for reconsideration before the Court of Appeals, she chose to amicably settle with the Republic. Through her counsel, then Atty. Fernando A. Santiago (Atty. Santiago), who later retired as a Court of Appeals Justice, Garcia-Diaz submitted a draft Compromise Agreement dated May 16, 1997 to then Solicitor General Silvestre H. Bello III (Solicitor General Bello).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>In relation to the compromise being negotiated, representatives from the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, and Armed Forces of the Philippines on the one hand; and Garcia-Diaz and then Atty.

They were likewise allowed to hire emergency laborers for the survey.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>As directed by Solis and with the assistance of some personnel from the City Environment and Natural Resources Office of Cabanatuan City, Nueva Ecija, Valencia and Viernes proceeded to Laur and conducted the survey. In their Summary Report, they confirmed that they were able to relocate the actual ground positions of comers 6 and 7 of Fort Magsaysay. They found that the Bureau of Lands Location Monuments remained in the position as earlier computed and plotted in the topographic map referred to in Presidential Proclamation No. 237. Attached to the Summary Report were the sketch map of Fort Magsaysay, and Valencia and Viernes' Field Notes or Traverse Computations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Solis then wrote Solicitor General Ricardo P. Galvez (Solicitor General Galvez), who by then had replaced Solicitor General Bello. In his February 12, 1998 Letter, Solis essentially stated that the actual ground location of Fort Magsaysay did not match with the technical description as provided in Presidential Proclamation No. 237. Specifically, the team that surveyed the military reservation, headed by Valencia and Viernes, supposedly found corner points 6 and 7 in the technical description "misleading" and that "the [tie point] cannot be located, hence comparison with BL Plan II-6752 cannot be effected." Solis then recommended that Presidential Proclamation No. 237 be amended accordingly. The February 12, 1998 Letter more comprehensively stated:<br><br><blockquote>This refers to CA-G.R. No. 22217 (LRC Case No. 853, LRC Rec. 511-27) regarding evaluation of the technical description of Proclamation No. 237 establishing Fort Magsaysay Military Reservation containing an approximate area of 73,000 hectares more or less.<br><br>In an agreement signed among the parties concerned (AFP, LMB, Applicant and NAMRIA), this office was tasked and authorized to replot and check the technical description of Proclamation No. 237 in reference to BL Plan II-6752, (Possessory Title Reg. No. 216).<br><br>Finding[s] disclose that the military reservation is not located in the topographic map sheets referred to in the technical description in Proclamation No. 237, that the description of corner points 6 and 7 are misleading and that the [tie point] cannot be located, hence comparison with BL Plan II-6752 cannot be effected.<br><br>The existence of the tie point of BL Plan II-6752 was verified by a team dispatched to relocate BLLM No. 1 and 2 and BBM 41 and 42 of Laur and Barangay San Isidro. It confirmed that the plottings made by this Office is geographically and accurately located in the ground.<br><br>The technical description of the portion of BL Plan II-6752 located outside the Fort Magsaysay Military Reservation is hereto attached as Annex "A". Points 6 and 7 of the Military Reservation were plotted in relation to BL Plan II-6752 in the survey plan attached hereto as Annex "B".<br><br>It is the recommendation of this authority to amend Proclamation No. 237 and to complete and finalize the plotting of the Military Reservation with corner points 6 and 7, which were located in relation to land monuments in Laur and Barangay San Isidro, N.E. in the attached plan, as the bases for the amendments.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></blockquote><br><br>However, it appears that three (3) drafts of the February 12, 1998 Letter were prepared. Two (2) of the drafts, both signed by Solis, explicitly provided that "the military reservation is not located in the topographic map sheets referred to in the technical description in Proclamation No. 237." Attached to the drafts was a survey plan, which plotted comer points 6 and 7 bounding Fort Magsaysay and showed the technical description of a portion of the property covered by BL Plan II-6752 that was located outside the military reservation. Thus, Solis recommended in those two (2) drafts that Presidential Proclamation No. 237 be amended and that the plotting of the military reservation with comer points 6 and 7 be completed and finalized. The third draft was not signed by Solis but was initialed by Fabian. It did not state that the existence of the tie point was verified by a survey team. This draft had no attachments.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>The draft that reached Solicitor General Galvez was one of the two drafts declaring that the actual ground location of Fort Magsaysay did not conform with the technical description in Presidential Proclamation No. 237. This draft was signed by Solis but did not reflect Fabian's initials.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Based on the findings stated in the February 12, 1998 Letter, the Republic, through Solicitor General Galvez, and Garcia-Diaz, through her counsel, then Atty. Santiago, signed and jointly filed a Motion for Approval of Amicable Settlement dated May 18, 1999. In the Compromise Agreement, Garcia-Diaz agreed to withdraw her application for registration of the property covered by BL Plan II-6752 that was within Fort Magsaysay in exchange for the Republic's withdrawal of its opposition to the registration of the portion outside the reservation, a portion which was supposedly comprised of 4,689 hectares. Gaudencio A. Mendoza, Assistant Executive for Legal Affairs, and Bonnevie served as witnesses.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> The Compromise Agreement particularly provided:<br><br><blockquote>1. The First Party [Garcia-Diaz] hereby withdraws her application for registration of title for the portion of the land described in BL Plan II-6752 which is situated within the military reservation described under Presidential Proclamation No. 237;<br><br>2. The First Party [Garcia-Diaz] undertakes to set aside and donate to the government five hundred (500) hectares for development as housing project;<br><br>3. The Second Party [the Republic] hereby withdraws its opposition to the registration in the name of the First Party FLORENCIA GARCIA DIAZ, Filipino, of legal age, widow, of the portion of BL Plan II[-]6752 with an area of 4,689 hectares more or less (Annex "B") which is situated outside the Fort Magsaysay military reservation;<br><br>4. Both parties agree to submit this Compromise Agreement for approval and for judgment in accordance therewith by the Court of Appeals.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></blockquote><br><br>In its June 30, 1999 Resolution, the Court of Appeals granted the Motion for Approval of Amicable Settlement and rendered judgment based on the compromise.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>On January 12, 2000, Solicitor General Galvez filed a Manifestation and Motion before the Court of Appeals. Thereafter, in its March 9, 2000 Resolution, the Court of Appeals <i>motu proprio</i> ordered and directed the Land Registration Authority to hold in abeyance the processing and issuance of the registration decree and certificate of title covering the 4,689-hectare property until Garcia-Diaz commented on the January 12, 2000 Manifestation and Motion filed by the Office of the Solicitor General.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>In the meantime, Secretary of Environment and Natural Resources Antonio Cerilles directed the new NAMRIA Administrator, Isidro S.

The accusatory portion of the Information in Criminal Case No. 27974 read:<br><br><blockquote>That on or about May 18, 1999 or sometime prior (or) subsequent thereto, in the City of Makati, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, accused <b>Ricardo P.

The accusatory portion of the Information in Criminal Case No. 27975 read:<br><br><blockquote>That on or about February 12, 1998 in the City of Makati, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, accused <b>Jose G.

This Motion was denied by the Sandiganbayan in its August 2, 2006 Resolution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>As for Solicitor General Galvez, he died during the pendency of the case. Thus, the charge against him was dismissed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>The case then proceeded to arraignment during which all the accused, except Fabian, who was and still remains at large, pleaded not guilty to the charges.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>After trial, the Sandiganbayan found Garcia-Diaz and Solis guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating Section 3(g) of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act. According to the Sandiganbayan, the prosecution established the following elements of the crime: first, that the accused is a public officer; second, that he or she entered into a contract or transaction on behalf of the government; and, third, that such contract or transaction is grossly and manifestly disadvantageous to the government.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>With respect to the first issue, it was undisputed that accused Solis, Bonnevie, Valencia, and Viernes were public officers as they were officials of the NAMRIA, an agency attached to the Department of Environment and Natural Resources. While it is true that Garcia-Diaz was a private person, the Sandiganbayan nevertheless held that a private person may be held liable under the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act if he or she acts in conspiracy with a public officer. It cited as basis <i>Go v. Sandiganbayan</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> as well as the "avowed policy" of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act "to repress certain acts of public officers and <i> private persons alike </i> which may constitute graft or corrupt practices or which may lead thereto."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>As for the second element, the Sandiganbayan found that Solicitor General Galvez, in conspiracy with Solis and Garcia-Diaz, entered into the Compromise Agreement on behalf of the government. Garcia-Diaz was the first party in the Compromise Agreement,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> while Solis' statement in his February 12, 1998 Letter "completed the conspiracy and complemented the whole scheme"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> by making it appear that 4,689 hectares of the land covered by BL Plan II-6752 was alienable, disposable, and may be the subject of a compromise.<br><br>On the third element, the Sandiganbayan discussed how entering into the Compromise Agreement was grossly and manifestly disadvantageous to the government. Like the Court of Appeals, the Sandiganbayan cited <i>Director of Lands v. Reyes,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> where this Court found that Padilla's purported possessory information title, from which Garcia-Diaz ultimately derived her title to the property described in BL Plan II-6752, was an unreliable evidence of title. In addition, the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 22217 found that the entire property covered by BL Plan II-6752 was within Fort Magsaysay. The execution of the Compromise Agreement would have led to the loss of 4,689 hectares in public land, to the disadvantage of the government.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>For the Sandiganbayan, Garcia-Diaz could not claim good faith in entering into the Compromise Agreement; It held that violation of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act is <i>malum prohibitum </i> where good faith is not a defense.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>The Sandiganbayan noted that the execution of the Compromise Agreement would not have been possible if not for Solis' false representation in his February 12, 1998 Letter that 4,689 hectares of the property described in BL Plan II-6752 was located outside Fort Magsaysay.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Solis could not dispute his liability, according to the Sandiganbayan, for even assuming that Fabian prepared the letter, Solis admitted on direct examination that he had examined it and its attachments. Further, the Sandiganbayan disbelieved Solis' claim that he only perfunctorily signed the letter because it was a product of several negotiations. Solis knew the purpose and importance of his recommendation to Solicitor General Galvez: the Republic's withdrawal of opposition to the registration in favor of Garcia-Diaz of a portion of Fort Magsaysay.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>The Sandiganbayan, however, acquitted Bonnevie, Valencia, and Viernes. It found that Bonnevie, who was then the executive assistant of Solis, only followed the orders of his superior, Solis, when he presided over the meeting where the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, the Armed Forces of the Philippines, and Garcia-Diaz agreed to a re-survey of Fort Magsaysay. It ruled that Bonnevie's signing as witness to the Compromise Agreement did not prove that he had a hand in its execution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>As for Valencia and Viernes, the Sandiganbayan found no evidence that they were part of the conspiracy to register in Garcia-Diaz's name 4,689 hectares of land within Fort Magsaysay. Valencia and Viernes re-surveyed the property only in compliance with the Travel Order issued by their superior, Solis. Further, in their Summary Report, they never represented that a portion of the property described in BL Plan II-6752 was located outside Fort Magsaysay. All they said was that they conducted a survey and they were able to retrieve the tie points and relocate the actual ground positions of comers 6 and 7 referred to in Presidential Proclamation No. 237.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>Aside from the graft charge, Solis was found guilty of falsification by a public officer punished under Article 171, paragraph 4 of the Revised Penal Code. The Sandiganbayan found that the February 12, 1998 Letter of Solis to Solicitor General Galvez was a public document, having been written and transmitted in Solis' official capacity.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> Solis had a legal obligation to disclose the truth of the facts narrated in the letter. Not only did he head the country's central mapping agency, he also knew that his letter would be the basis for approval of the Compromise Agreement.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> Lastly, the statement that 4,689 hectares of the property described in BL Plan II-6752 were outside Fort Magsaysay described in Presidential Proclamation No. 237 was absolutely false. The contention that comers 6 and 7 were misleading was likewise false and was contrary to Valencia and Viernes' findings in their Summary Report that they were able to relocate comers 6 and 7 as computed and positioned based on the topographic map of the reservation. Further, superimposing BL Plan II-6752 on the already available topographic map of Fort Magsaysay easily revealed that the whole property claimed by Garcia-Diaz was within the military reservation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>As for Bonnevie, Valencia, and Viernes, the Sandiganbayan said that "[t]here is a dearth of evidence as to [their] participation . . . in the falsification."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> They were, therefore, acquitted.<br><br>The dispositive portion of the Sandiganbayan March 3, 2010 Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> read:<br><br><blockquote>IN LIGHT OF ALL THE FOREGOING, judgment is hereby rendered as follows:<br><br>1.

Furthermore, he points out that the registration of the 4,689 hectares in the name of petitioner Garcia-Diaz did not push through; hence, there was no gross and manifest disadvantage to the government.<br><br>In so arguing, petitioner Solis disregards the essence of conspiracy where the act of one is the act of all.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup> A finding of conspiracy means that all the accused are deemed to have "consented to and adopted as their own, the offense [of the other accused]."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup> Co-conspirators are answerable collectively <i>and equally,</i> regardless of the degree of their participation in the crime,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup> because it is <i>the common scheme, purpose, or objective</i> that is punished, not the individual acts of each of the accused.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup><br><br>Here, the common scheme was to make it appear that part of the property described in BL Plan II-6752 is outside Fort Magsaysay as described in Presidential Proclamation No. 237, and hence, alienable, disposable, and can be the subject of a compromise. So while it is true that petitioner Solis was not the party who entered into the Compromise Agreement on behalf of the government, it was his recommendation in his February 12, 1998 Letter that served as the basis for its execution. In the words of petitioner Solis, "finding[s] disclose that the military reservation is not located in the topographic map sheets referred to in the technical description in Proclamation No. 237."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup> Without this recommendation, there would be nothing to compromise on in the first place. Petitioner Solis' recommendation was indispensable for the existence of the second element.<br><br>It was also the recommendation of petitioner Solis that caused the existence of the third element. The segregation of 4,689 hectares of land of the public domain, to be registered in the name of a private person, was grossly and manifestly disadvantageous to the government. It is immaterial that the registration in the name of petitioner Garcia-Diaz did not push through. Petitioner Solis remains liable because "the core element" of Section 3(g) is that the "engagement in a transaction or contract . . . is grossly and manifestly disadvantageous to the government."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup> Section 3(g) is unlike Section 3(e) 117 of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, which requires actual injury to the government. 118 Surely, surrendering 4,689 hectares of public domain is grossly and manifestly disadvantageous to the government.<br><br>Petitioner Solis' other arguments, i.e., that Fabian prepared his February 12, 1998 Letter and that petitioner Solis routinely affixed his signature in it, and that he did not personally know Solicitor General Galvez and petitioner Garcia-Diaz, are factual in nature and cannot be raised in the present Petition.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup> In any case, it was never established that Fabian or any other of petitioner Solis' subordinates prepared his February 12, 1998 Letter. This Court agrees with the following findings of the Sandiganbayan:<br><br><blockquote>To exonerate himself, accused Solis contended that he only relied on his subordinates when he signed the said February 12, 1998 letter, because it had already passed the 5 offices of the NAMRIA, as shown by the routing slip. He did not thoroughly examine the attachments to the letter but relied on his technical people. However, the conformity to the contents of these offices to the letter, dated February 12, 1998, could not be ascertained on the face of the routing slip. In fact, in item no. 4, Basa merely requested accused Fabian of the Land Classification Division a briefing before the records would be forwarded to accused Solis. Nonetheless, the said briefing did not happen, as could be gleaned from Basa's testimony that the papers directly went to accused Bonnevie. Moreover, Basa testified, which accused Solis failed to rebut, that the February 12, 1998 letter did not pass through the usual procedure. Except for the initial of accused Fabian under accused Solis' name, the letter did not bear the signatures of the Assistant Director and Deputy Administrator Vinia. In fact, the letter appears to have been drafted even before the routing slip reached Basa on February 16, 1998. As to accused Solis' testimony that he did not examine the attachments to the letter but depended on his technical people, the same is inconsistent with his statement on direct examination. He claimed that he studied the letter the first time he saw it, because of the map and several documents attached thereto. This simply means that he also scrutinized the attachments because these were the very reason why he studied the letter. He was also the one who ordered the relocation survey, thus, it is impossible that he did not peruse the survey report or the field notes. Moreover, to represent that 4,689 hectares of BL Plan II-6752 are outside the military reservation is certainly a decision of great importance, as it would decide the fate of the compromise settlement. Accused Solis knew this, having been told by the Office of the Solicitor General of the purpose of the relocation survey. Thus, we find it incredible that he only signified his conformity without bothering to examine the attachments, unless, such decision had been a foregone conclusion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup></blockquote><br><br>Therefore, petitioner Solis cannot put the blame on any of his subordinates as to the contents of his February 12, 1998 Letter.<br><br>Further, it is immaterial that petitioner Solis knew Solicitor General Galvez and petitioner Garcia-Diaz personally. Their collective acts nevertheless show the common purpose of giving the Compromise Agreement a semblance of legitimacy. Petitioners Garcia-Diaz and Solis remain equally liable as co-conspirators.<br><br>In sum, the prosecution established beyond reasonable doubt the guilt of petitioners Garcia-Diaz and Solis. They conspired to make it appear that a 4,689-hectare portion of the property described in BL Plan II-6752 is outside the reservation described in Presidential Proclamation No. 237. Garcia-Diaz cannot claim good faith because as early as 1975, this Court held in <i>Director of Lands v. Reyes</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[121]</sup> that the source of her supposed ownership—Possessory Information Title No. 216—does not exist. As for petitioner Solis, he issued his February 12, 1998 Letter as basis to claim that the 4,689 hectares of land described in BL Plan II-6752 are located outside Fort Magsaysay, knowing fully well that this statement is false. Petitioners Garcia-Diaz and Solis are liable for violation of Section 3(g) of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, and the sentence of six (6) years and one (1) month to 10 years, with perpetual disqualification from office, conforms with the penal provision of the statute<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup> and with the Indeterminate Sentence Law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup><br><br><center><b>III</b></center><br><br>Article 171 of the Revised Penal Code defines and penalizes the felony of falsification by a public officer, thus:<br><br><blockquote>Article 171. <i>Falsification by public officer, employee or notary or ecclesiastic minister. </i>— The penalty of <i>prisión mayor </i>and a fine not to exceed 5,000 pesos shall be imposed upon any public officer, employee, or notary who, taking advantage of his official position, shall falsify a document by committing any of the following acts:<br><br><ol><li>Counterfeiting or imitating any handwriting, signature or rubric;<br></li><li>Causing it to appear that persons have participated in any act or proceeding when they did not in fact so participate;<br></li><li>Attributing to persons who have participated in an act or proceeding statements other than those in fact made by them;<br></li><li>Making untruthful statements in a narration of facts;<br></li><li>Altering true dates;<br></li><li>Making any alteration or intercalation in a genuine document which changes its meaning;<br></li><li>Issuing in authenticated form a document purporting to be a copy of an original document when no such original exists, or including in such copy a statement contrary to, or different from, that of the genuine original; or<br></li><li>Intercalating any instrument or note relative to the issuance thereof in a protocol, registry, or official book.</li></ol><br>The same penalty shall be imposed upon any ecclesiastical minister who shall commit any of the offenses enumerated in the preceding paragraphs of this article, with respect to any record or document of such character that its falsification may affect the civil status of persons.</blockquote><br><br>In general, the elements of Article 171 are: first, "the offender is a public officer, employee, or notary public"; second, he or she takes advantage of his or her official position; and third, he or she falsifies a document by committing any of the acts enumerated in Article 171.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[124]</sup><br><br>Specific to the fourth mode in Article 171, i.e., making untruthful statements in a narration of facts, the elements are: first, "the offender makes in a [public] document untruthful statements in a narration of facts"; second, the offender "has a legal obligation to disclose the truth of the facts narrated by him [or her]"; and, third, the facts that he or she narrated are absolutely false.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[125]</sup> Further, to be convicted under Article 171, the public officer must have taken advantage of his or her official position to commit the falsification either because "he [or she] has the duty to make or prepare or otherwise to intervene in the preparation of a document," or because he or she has the official custody of the falsified document.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[126]</sup><br><br>Petitioner Solis contends that the second element is absent because he had no legal obligation to disclose the truth of the facts that he narrated in his February 12, 1998 Letter to Solicitor General Galvez.

There being no modifying circumstance in this case, the indeterminate penalty of two (2) years, four (4) months, and one (1) day of <i>prisión correccional </i>medium as minimum to six (6) years and one (1) day of <i>prisión mayor </i>medium as maximum is in order.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[134]</sup><br><br>This Court notes that from the Office of the Solicitor General, only the late Solicitor General Galvez was charged before the Sandiganbayan.
