				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Kidnapping should never be part of the functions of a soldier. It cannot be done in a soldier's official capacity.

Osorio on December 19, 2011.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>The next day, at about 3:00 p.m., SSgt. Osorio was arrested by Colonel Herbert Yambing, the Provost Marshall General of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. SSgt. Osorio was turned over to the Criminal Investigation and Detection Unit Group in Camp Crame, Quezon City and was detained in Bulacan Provincial Jail. He was later transferred to the Philippine Army Custodial Center in Fort Bonifacio, Taguig City where he is currently detained.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Contending that he was being illegally deprived of his liberty, SSgt. Osorio filed a Petition<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> for Habeas Corpus before the Court of Appeals on July 21, 2015. Impleaded as respondents were Presiding Judge Teodora Gonzales of Branch 14, Regional Trial Court, Malolos City, Bulacan, the judge who issued the warrants of arrest; Assistant State Prosecutors Juan Pedro Navera and Irwin A. Maraya, and Associate Prosecution Attorney Ethel Rhea G. Suril, who filed the Informations for kidnapping and illegal detention; and Colonel Robert M. Arevalo, Colonel Rosalio G. Pompa, and Captain Telesforo C. Balasabas, SSgt. Osorio's superiors.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>SSgt. Osorio mainly argued that courts-martial, not a civil court such as the Regional Trial Court, had jurisdiction to try the criminal case considering that he was a soldier on active duty and that the offense charged was allegedly "service-connected." In the alternative, SSgt. Osorio argued that the Ombudsman had jurisdiction to conduct preliminary investigation and the Sandiganbayan had jurisdiction to try the case because among his co-accused was Major General Palparan, a public officer with salary grade higher than 28.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>SSgt. Osorio added that he could not be charged with the felony of kidnapping and serious illegal detention because under Article 267 of the Revised Penal Code,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> the felony may only be committed by a private individual, not a ranking officer of the Armed Forces of the Philippines.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Lastly, he claimed deprivation of due process because he was allegedly charged without undergoing proper preliminary investigation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals held that SSgt. Osorio's confinement was "by virtue of a valid judgment or a judicial process[.]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Under Republic Act No. 7055, Section 1, a crime penalized under the Revised Penal Code, even if committed by a member of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, is to be tried "by the proper civil court." The only exception to this rule is when the crime is "service-connected," i.e., those defined in Articles 54 to 70, Articles 72 to 92, and Articles 95 to 97 of the Articles of War,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> in which case, the courts-martial have jurisdiction. Since the crime of kidnapping and serious illegal detention is punished under the Revised Penal Code and is not "service-connected," the Regional Trial Court of Malolos City properly took cognizance of the case and, consequently, the warrants of arrest against SSgt. Osorio were issued under a valid judicial process.<br><br>As to SSgt. Osorio's other arguments, the Court of Appeals said that they "should be resolved through other appropriate remedies such as a motion to quash." According to the Court of Appeals, habeas corpus is not a "writ of error," and questions relating to procedure or merits of the case cannot be addressed in habeas corpus proceedings.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>In its July 27, 2015 Resolution,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> the Court of Appeals denied SSgt. Osorio's Petition for Habeas Corpus. SSgt. Osorio's Motion for Reconsideration was likewise denied in the Court of Appeals February 22, 2016 Resolution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>On April 20, 2016, SSgt. Osorio filed his Petition for Review on Certiorari.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Upon the directive of this Court, respondents, through the Office of the Solicitor General, filed their Comment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> on the Petition.<br><br>SSgt. Osorio maintains that he is being illegally deprived of his liberty because he was charged with an "inexistent offense." He argues that kidnapping and serious illegal detention can only be committed by a private person, not by a member of the Armed Forces of the Philippines.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Given that he is a soldier on active duty, SSgt. Osorio adds that only courts-martial have jurisdiction to hear, try, and decide a criminal case against him. In the alternative, SSgt. Osorio argues that the Ombudsman and Sandiganbayan, not the Department of Justice or the Regional Trial Court, have jurisdiction to conduct preliminary investigation and to hear, try, and decide the criminal case because one of his co-accused, Major General Palparan, was an officer in the Philippine Army with a rank higher than colonel and with a salary grade of 28.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Lastly, SSgt. Osorio claims that he was deprived of his right to due process of law because no preliminary investigation was allegedly conducted in this case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Respondents counter that a public officer such as SSgt. Osorio may be charged under Article 267 of the Revised Penal Code on kidnapping and serious illegal detention. A public officer detaining a person without authority is acting in a private, not official, capacity. Since kidnapping is not part of the duties of an officer of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, respondents argue that SSgt. Osorio acted in a private capacity when he took part in illegally detaining Empeño and Cadapan.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>On the issue of jurisdiction, respondents argue that the Regional Trial Court properly took cognizance of the case. Under Republic Act No. 7055, Section 1, members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines charged with crimes or offenses punished under the Revised Penal Code "shall be tried by the proper civil court." The only exception is when the crime is "service-connected," in which case, courts-martial assume jurisdiction. Considering that kidnapping is not a "service-connected" offense, SSgt. Osorio was properly charged before a civil court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Lastly, respondents argue that no writ of habeas corpus should be issued in this case. Respondents contend that habeas corpus "does not extend beyond an inquiry into the jurisdiction of the court by which it was issued and the validity of the process upon its face."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Habeas corpus, being an extraordinary remedy, "will not issue where the person alleged to be restrained of his [or her] liberty is in custody of an officer under a process issued by the court which has jurisdiction to do so."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>The principal issue for this Court's resolution is whether or not a writ of habeas corpus is petitioner SSgt. Edgardo L. Osorio's proper remedy. Subsumed in the resolution of this issue are the following: first, whether or not a civil court may take cognizance of a criminal case against a soldier on active duty; and, second, whether or not a public officer may be charged with kidnapping and serious illegal detention under Article 267 of the Revised Penal Code, considering that the provision speaks of "any private individual."<br><br>This Petition must be denied.<br><br><center><b>I</b></center><br><br>Rule 102, Section 1 of the Rules of Court provides:<br><br><blockquote>Section 1. <i>To what habeas corpus extends. </i>— Except as otherwise expressly provided by law, the writ of habeas corpus shall extend to all cases of illegal confinement or detention by which any person is deprived of his liberty, or by which the rightful custody of any person is withheld from the person entitled thereto.</blockquote><br><br>The "great writ of liberty"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> of habeas corpus "was devised and exists as a speedy and effectual remedy to relieve persons from unlawful restraint, and as the best and only sufficient defense of personal freedom."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Habeas corpus is an extraordinary,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> summary,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> and equitable writ, consistent with the law's "zealous regard for personal liberty."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Its primary purpose "is to inquire into all manner of involuntary restraint as distinguished from voluntary, and to relieve a person therefrom if such restraint is illegal. Any restraint which will preclude freedom of action is sufficient."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>The restraint of liberty need not be confined to any offense so as to entitle a person to the writ. Habeas corpus may be availed of as a post-conviction remedy<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> or when there is an alleged violation of the liberty of abode.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>In <i>In re: Saliba v. Warden,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> this Court allowed the issuance of the writ due to mistaken identity. Instead of Butukan S. Malang, authorities arrested and detained one Datukan Malang Salibo (Salibo) for his alleged participation in the Maguindanao Massacre. Salibo, having proved that he was not the accused Butukan S. Malang named in the arrest warrant, and that he was in Mecca for the Hajj pilgrimage at the time of the incident, was ordered released. To detain a person, when he has proven that he is not the person accused of the crime, is a deprivation of liberty without due process of law.<br><br>Habeas corpus, therefore, effectively substantiates the implied autonomy of citizens constitutionally protected in the right to liberty in Article III, Section 1 of the Constitution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> With liberty being a constitutional right, courts must apply a conscientious and deliberate level of scrutiny so that the substantive right to liberty will not be further curtailed in the labyrinth of other processes.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>However, a writ of habeas corpus may no longer be issued if the person allegedly deprived of liberty is restrained under a lawful process or order of the court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> The restraint then has become lega1.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Therefore, the remedy of habeas corpus is rendered moot and academic.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Rule 102, Section 4 of the Rules of Court provides:<br><br><blockquote>Section 4. <i>When writ not allowed or discharge authorized. </i>— If it appears that the person alleged to be restrained of his liberty is in the custody of an officer under process issued by a court or judge or by virtue of a judgment or order of a court of record, and that the court or judge had jurisdiction to issue the process, render the judgment, or make the order, the writ shall not be allowed; or if the jurisdiction appears after the writ is allowed, the person shall not be discharged by reason of any informality or defect in the process, judgment, or order. Nor shall anything in this rule be held to authorize the discharge of a person charged with or convicted of an offense in the Philippines, or of a person suffering imprisonment under lawful judgment.</blockquote><br><br>If an accused is confined under a lawful process or order of the court, the proper remedy is to pursue the orderly course of trial and exhaust the usual remedies.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> This ordinary remedy is to file a motion to quash the information or the warrant of arrest<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> based on one or more of the grounds enumerated in Rule 117, Section 3 of the Rules of Court:<br><br><blockquote>Section 3. <i>Grounds. </i>— The accused may move to quash the complaint or information on any of the following grounds:<br><br><table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">(a) </div> </td> <td width="95%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">That the facts charged do not constitute an offense;</div> </td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">(b)</div> </td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">That the court trying the case has no jurisdiction over the offense charged;</div> </td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">(c)</div> </td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">That the court trying the case has no jurisdiction over the person of the accused;</div> </td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">(d)</div> </td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">That the officer who filed the information had no authority to do so;</div> </td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">(e)</div> </td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">That it does not conform substantially to the prescribed form;</div> </td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">(f) </div> </td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">That more than one offense is charged except when a single punishment for various offenses is prescribed by law;</div> </td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">(g) </div> </td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">That the criminal action or liability has been extinguished;</div> </td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">(h)</div> </td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">That it contains averments which, if true, would constitute a legal excuse or justification; and</div> </td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">(i) </div> </td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">That the accused has been previously convicted or acquitted of the offense charged, or the case against him was dismissed or otherwise terminated without his express consent. </div> </td> </tr> </tbody></table><br></blockquote>With a motion to quash, the accused "assails the validity of a criminal complaint or information ... for insufficiency on its face in [a] point of law, or for defects which are apparent in the face of the information."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> An accused filing a motion to quash "hypothetically admits the facts alleged in the information" and cannot present evidence aliunde or those extrinsic from the Information.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>The effect of the grant of the motion to quash depends on the grounds availed of.

An amendment from "Butukan S. Malang" to "Datukan Malang Salibo" in the information will not cure this defect.<br><br><center><b>II</b></center><br><br>In availing himself of habeas corpus, SSgt. Osorio mainly contends that the Regional Trial Court that issued the warrants for his arrest had no jurisdiction to take cognizance of the kidnapping case against him. SSgt. Osorio argues that courts-martial, not civil courts, have jurisdiction to try and decide a case against a soldier on active duty. In the alternative, SSgt. Osorio argues that the Ombudsman and Sandiganbayan should have conducted the preliminary investigation and decided the kidnapping case against him since his co-accused, Major General Palparan, had a rank higher than colonel and had salary grade 28 at the time of the commission of the offense.<br><br>SSgt. Osorio's claim lacks merit. The Regional Trial Court properly took cognizance of the kidnapping case against him.<br><br>Republic Act No. 7055,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Section 1 provides that if the accused is a member of the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the crime involved is one punished under the Revised Penal Code, civil courts shall have the authority to hear, try, and decide the case, thus:<br><br><blockquote>Section 1. Members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines and other persons subject to military law, including members of the Citizens Armed Forces Geographical Units, who commit crimes or offenses penalized under the Revised Penal Code, other special penal laws, or local government ordinances regardless of whether or not civilians are co-accused, victims, or offended parties which may be natural or juridical persons, shall be tried by the proper civil court except when the offense, as determined before arraignment by the civil court, is service-connected, in which case the offense shall be tried by court-martial: <i>Provided, </i>That the President of the Philippines may, in the interest of justice, order or direct at any time before arraignment that any such crimes or offenses be tried by the proper civil courts.<br><br>As used in this Section, service-connected crimes or offenses shall be limited to those defined in Articles 54 to 70, Articles 72 to 92, and Articles 95 to 97 of Commonwealth Act No. 408, as amended.<br><br>In imposing the penalty for such crimes or offenses, the court-martial may take into consideration the penalty prescribed therefor in the Revised Penal Code, other special laws, or local government ordinances.</blockquote><br><br>Under this Section, the only time courts-martial may assume jurisdiction is if, before arraignment, the civil court determines that the offense is "service-connected."

Osorio was charged with kidnapping, a crime punishable under Article 267 of the Revised Penal Code.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[52]</sup></font> Applying Republic Act No. 7055, Section 1, the case shall be tried by a civil court, specifically by the Regional Trial Court, which has jurisdiction over the crime of kidnapping.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> The processes which the trial court issued, therefore, were valid.<br><br>Contrary to SSgt. Osorio's claim, the offense he committed was not service-connected. The case filed against him is none of those enumerated under Articles 54 to 70, Articles 72 to 92, and Articles 95 to 97 of the Articles of War.<br><br>Further, kidnapping is not part of the functions of a soldier. Even if a public officer has the legal duty to detain a person, the public officer must be able to show the existence of legal grounds for the detention. Without these legal grounds, the public officer is deemed to have acted in a private capacity and is considered a "private individual." The public officer becomes liable for kidnapping and serious illegal detention punishable by <i>reclusion perpetua, </i>not with arbitrary detention punished with significantly lower penalties.<br><br>The cases cited by respondents are on point. In <i>People v. Santiano,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> members of the Philippine National Police were convicted of kidnapping with murder. On appeal, they contended that they cannot be charged with kidnapping considering that they were public officers. This Court rejected the argument and said that "in abducting and taking away the victim, [the accused] did so neither in furtherance of official function nor in the pursuit of authority vested in them. It is not, in fine, in relation to their office, but in purely private capacity, that they [committed the crime]."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> This Court, thus, affirmed the conviction of the accused in <i>Santiano.</i><br><br>In <i>People v. PO1 Trestiza,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> members of the Philippine National Police were initially charged with kidnapping for ransom. The public prosecutor, however, filed a motion to withdraw information before the trial court and filed a new one for robbery. According to the public prosecutor, the accused cannot be charged with kidnapping because the crime may only be committed by private individuals. Moreover, the accused argued that the detention was allegedly part of a "legitimate police operation."<br><br>The trial court denied the motion to withdraw. It examined the Pre-Operation/Coordination Sheet presented by the defense and found that it was neither authenticated nor its signatories presented in court. The defense failed to show proof of a "legitimate police operation" and, based on <i>Santiano,</i> the accused were deemed to have acted in a private capacity in detaining the victims. This Court affirmed the conviction of the police officers for kidnapping.<br><br>It is not impossible for a public officer to be charged with and be convicted of kidnapping as <i>Santiano</i> and <i>Trestiza</i> illustrated. SSgt. Osorio's claim that he was charged with an "inexistent crime" because he is a public officer is, therefore, incorrect.<br><br>Further, since SSgt. Osorio is charged with a crime committed in a private capacity, the Sandiganbayan cannot take cognizance of the case.
