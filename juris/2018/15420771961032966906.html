Failure of the seafarer to comply with the mandatory reporting requirement shall result in his forfeiture of the right to claim the above benefits.<br><br>If a doctor appointed by the seafarer disagrees with the assessment, a third doctor may be agreed jointly between the Employer and the seafarer.

In a medical report dated May 14, 2014, the company-designated physician gave petitioner an "interim" assessment of Grades 8 and 12 for his orthopedic and pulmonary conditions, respectively.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> While the orthopedic specialist, in his medical report dated July 10, 2014, opined that petitioner's Degenerative Changes, Thoracolumbar Spine, Left Parathoracic Muscle Strain "may be [a] pre-existing"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> condition, and therefore not work-related, the pulmonary specialist, on the other hand, merely reiterated the previous disability rating of Grade 12, <i>i.e., </i>slight residual or disorder.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> From the foregoing medical report, it can be reasonably inferred that petitioner's bronchial asthma was deemed a work-related illness unlike his degenerative changes of the spine (back condition), which was declared by the specialist to be not work-related in view of the specialist's observation that it was a pre-existing condition that "could not have developed during his [22-day] period on board."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br><br>However, there are conditions that should be met before an illness, such as degenerative changes of the spine, can be considered as pre-existing under the 2010 POEA-SEC, namely: (a) the <b>advice of a medical doctor on treatment </b>was given for such continuing illness or condition; or (b) the seafarer had been <b>diagnosed and has knowledge </b>of such illness or condition but failed to disclose the same during PEME, and such cannot be diagnosed during the PEME,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> none of which had been established in this case.<br><br>Moreover, degenerative changes of the spine, also known as osteoarthritis,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> is a listed occupational disease under Sub-Item Number 21 of Section 32-A of the 2010 POEA-SEC if the occupation involves <b> <u>any</u> </b>of the following:<br><br><blockquote><ol type="a"><li>Joint strain from carrying heavy loads, or unduly heavy physical labor, as among laborers and mechanics;<br></li><li>Minor or major injuries to the joint;<br></li><li>Excessive use or constant strenuous usage of a particular joint, as among sportsmen, particularly those who have engaged in the more active sports activities;<br></li><li>Extreme temperature changes (humidity, heat and cold exposures) and;<br></li><li>Faulty work posture or use of vibratory tools[.]</li></ol></blockquote><br><br>Here, petitioner, as Bosun of respondents' cargo vessel that transported logs, undeniably performed tasks that clearly involved unduly heavy physical labor and joint strain. Hence, the NLRC cannot be faulted in finding petitioner's back problem to be work-related.<br><br>In the same vein, petitioner's bronchial asthma, which is also a listed occupational disease, undeniably progressed while in the performance of his duties and in the course of his last employment contract. Respondents' assertion that the said illness also existed prior to petitioner's embarkation, and therefore a pre-existing ailment, was not substantiated given that no such declaration was made by the company-designated physician or the attending specialist. Besides, such fact alone does not detract from the compensability of an illness. It is not required that the employment be the sole factor in the growth, development or acceleration of the illness to entitle the claimant to the benefits incident thereto. It is enough that the employment had contributed, even in a small measure, to the development of the disease.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> Perforce, absent controverting proof that petitioner's illnesses were not work-related, no grave abuse of discretion was committed by the NLRC in declaring petitioner's bronchial asthma and degenerative changes of the thoracolumbar spine to be compensable ailments.<br><br><div align="CENTER"><b>II.</b><br></div><br><br>Pursuant to Section 20 (A) of the 2010 POEA-SEC, when a seafarer suffers a work-related injury or illness in the course of employment, the company-designated physician is obligated to arrive at a <b>definite assessment</b> of the former's fitness or degree of disability within a period of 120 days from repatriation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> During the said period, the seafarer shall be deemed on <b>temporary total disability</b> and shall receive his basic wage until he is declared fit to work or his temporary disability is acknowledged by the company to be permanent, either partially or totally, as his condition is defined under the POEA-SEC and by applicable Philippine laws. However, if the 120-day period is exceeded and no <b><i>definitive declaration </i></b>is made because the seafarer requires <b><i>further medical attention,</i></b> then the temporary total disability period may be extended up to a maximum of 240 days, subject to the right of the employer to declare within this period that a permanent partial or total disability already exists.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> But before the company-designated physician may avail of the allowable 240-day extended treatment period, he must perform some significant act to justify the extension of the original 120-day period.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> Otherwise, <b>the law grants the seafarer the relief of permanent total disability benefits due to such non-compliance</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup><br><br>In this regard, the Court, in <i> Elburg Shipmanagement Philippines, Inc. v.

Notwithstanding the temporariness of his findings, the company-designated physician, however, failed to indicate the need for further treatment/rehabilitation or medication, and provide an estimated period of treatment to justify the extension of the 120-day treatment period. In fact, while petitioner had subsequent follow-up sessions, the company-designated physician still failed to arrive at a definitive assessment within the 120-day period or indicate the need for further medical treatment. Evidently, without the required final medical assessment declaring petitioner fit to resume work or the degree of his disability, the characterization of the latter's condition after the lapse of the 120-day period as total and permanent ensued in accordance with law, since the ability to return to one's accustomed work before the applicable periods elapse cannot be shown.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> Thus, because of these circumstances, petitioner should be entitled to permanent total disability benefits by operation of law.<br><br>Notwithstanding petitioner's apparent entitlement to permanent total disability benefits as discussed above, the CA nonetheless declared petitioner's complaint to have been prematurely filed on June 4, 2014 due to the fact that there was no final disability assessment issued at that time. However, it should be made clear that what was filed on June 4, 2014 was for non-payment of sickness allowance, medical expenses, and rehabilitation fees. Petitioner only sought permanent total disability benefits when he filed his amended complaint therefor on June 18, 2014. At that time, the 120-day period within which the company-designated physician should have issued a final assessment of petitioner's condition already lapsed. Further, as mentioned, there was no reason for respondents to extend this period to 240 days since no sufficient justification exists to extend the treatment period for another 120 days. As such, contrary to the findings of the CA, petitioner had rightfully commenced his complaint for disability compensation on June 18, 2014, or after the expiration of the 120-day period from the time of his repatriation on February 15, 2014 <i>(i.e., </i>123 days). As aptly ruled in <i> C.F. Sharp Crew Management, Inc. v. Taok,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> "<b>a seafarer may pursue an action for total and permanent disability benefits</b> if x x x the company-designated physician failed to issue a declaration as to his fitness to engage in sea duty or disability even after the lapse of the 120-day period and <u><b>there is no indication that further medical treatment would address his temporary total disability, hence, justify an extension of the period to 240 days</b></u> x x x,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> as in this case.<br><br>Neither is petitioner's complaint for disability compensation rendered premature by his failure to refer the matter to a third-doctor pursuant to Section 20 (A) (3) of the 2010 POEA-SEC. It bears stressing that a seafarer's compliance with the conflict-resolution procedure under the said provision presupposes that the company-designated physician came up with an assessment as to his fitness or unfitness to work before the expiration of the 120-day or 240-day periods.
