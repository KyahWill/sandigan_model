It posits that these acts are at par with the court's acquisition of jurisdiction over the subject matter and the person of the accused. These acts have nothing to do with the suspension of arraignment provided for under Rule 116, Section 11 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure, which ordinarily happens after a trial court has acquired jurisdiction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br><br>The Office of the Solicitor General also adds that the insertion of the phrase <i>"conspiring and confederating together" </i>in the amended information will not affect Samonte's substantial rights.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> Thus, the original charge against Samonte of murder and his deliberate manner of shooting Angelita remain unaltered:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br><blockquote>Even if one or all of the elements of the crime of murder as alleged in the original information filed against petitioner Samonte is not proven, the addition of conspiracy in the amended information, if duly proven, would not in any way result in his conviction because conspiracy is not an essential or qualifying element of the crime of murder.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup></blockquote><br><br>The Office of the Solicitor General avers that respondent judge was well acquainted with the legal and factual circumstances behind the filing of the original information against Samonte. The amended information merely added Corpus as a co-conspirator. Thus, before respondent judge issued the assailed order, a prior hearing was held on February 13, 2009, when all the parties were heard.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br>The Office of the Solicitor General also asserts that while respondent judge committed error when he denied petitioners' motion to suspend proceedings, what the law only requires under Rule 116, Section 11 is a maximum of 60-day suspension of the arraignment. In this case, the 60-day period had already lapsed, rendering the issue raised by petitioners moot. Hence, there is no longer any hindrance for respondent judge to continue with Corpus' arraignment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup><br><br>Petitioners filed their reply on August 7, 2009.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> They claim that respondent judge should have suspended action on the issuance of a warrant considering the pendency of their Petition for Review before the Department of Justice.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> They cite <i>Ledesma v.

Such deferment or suspension, however, does not signify that the trial court is <i>ipso facto </i>bound by the resolution of the secretary of justice. Jurisdiction, once acquired by the trial court, is not lost despite a resolution by the secretary of justice to withdraw the information or to dismiss the case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup></blockquote><br><br>Petitioners also cite the dispositive portion of <i>Tolentino v.

The respondent judge should not be more anxious than the prosecution in expediting the disposition of the case absent any indication of collusion between it and the defense. <u><i>The Ministry of Justice should not be deprived of its power to review the action of the City Fiscal by a precipitate trial of the case.</i></u><br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petition is granted.

They insist that the February 26, 2009 Order only consists of three (3) short sentences, which merely pointed out a certain legal provision, instead of facts, that would supposedly justify the issuance of the warrant of arrest, thus:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup><br><br><blockquote>Elementary is the rule that the existence of probable cause is indispensable in the filing of the complaint or information and in the issuance of warrant of arrest. The legion of jurisprudence has defined probable cause to be concerned with probability, not absolute or even moral certainty. The prosecution need not present at this stage proof beyond reasonable doubt.

If the judge finds no probable cause, the judge cannot be forced to issue the arrest warrant.<br><br>[T]he public prosecutor exercises a wide latitude of discretion in determining whether a criminal case should be filed in court, and that courts <i>must respect the exercise of such discretion when the information filed against the person charged is valid on its face, and that no manifest error or grave abuse of discretion can be imputed to the public prosecutor.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[129]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)</blockquote><br><br>Thus, courts do not meddle with the prosecutor's conduct of a preliminary investigation because it is exclusively within the prosecutor's discretion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[130]</sup><br><br>However, once the information is already filed in court, the court has acquired jurisdiction of the case.

The Court thereby acquires jurisdiction over the case, which is the authority to hear and determine the case. When after the filing of the complaint or information a warrant for the arrest of the accused is issued by the trial court and the accused either voluntarily submitted himself to the Court or was duly arrested, the Court thereby acquired jurisdiction over the person of the accused.<br><br><i>The preliminary investigation conducted by the fiscal for the purpose of determining whether a prima facie case exists warranting the prosecution of the accused is terminated upon the filing of the information in the proper court. In turn, as above stated, the filing of said information sets in motion the criminal action against the accused in Court. </i>Should the fiscal find it proper to conduct a reinvestigation of the case, at such stage, the permission of the Court must be secured. After such reinvestigation the finding and recommendations of the fiscal should be submitted to the Court for appropriate action. <i>While it is true that the fiscal has the quasi-judicial discretion to determine whether or not a criminal case should be filed in court or not, once the case had already been brought to Court whatever disposition the fiscal may feel should be proper in the case thereqfter should be addressed for the consideration of the Court. </i>The only qualification is that the action of the Court must not impair the substantial rights of the accused or the right of the People to due process of law.<br><br>Whether the accused had been arraigned or not and whether it was due to a reinvestigation by the fiscal or a review by the Secretary of Justice whereby a motion to dismiss was submitted to the Court, the Court in the exercise of its discretion may grant the motion or deny it and require that the trial on the merits proceed for the proper determination of the case.<br><br>However, one may ask, if the trial court refuses to grant the motion to dismiss filed by the fiscal upon the directive of the Secretary of Justice will there not be a vacuum in the prosecution? A state prosecutor to handle the case cannot possibl[y be] designated by the Secretary of Justice who does not believe that there is a basis for prosecution nor can the fiscal be expected to handle the prosecution of the case thereby defying the superior order of the Secretary of Justice.<br><br>The answer is simple. The role of the fiscal or prosecutor as We all know is to see that justice is done and not necessarily to secure the conviction of the person accused before the Courts. Thus, in spite of his opinion to the contrary, it is the duty of the fiscal to proceed with the presentation of evidence of the prosecution to the Court to enable the Court to arrive at its own independent judgment as to whether the accused should be convicted or acquitted. The fiscal should not shirk from the responsibility of appearing for the People of the Philippines even under such circumstances much less should he abandon the prosecution of the case leaving it to the hands of a private prosecutor for then the entire proceedings will be null and void. The least that the fiscal should do is to continue to appear for the prosecution although he may turn over the presentation of the evidence to the private prosecutor but still under his direction and control.<br><br><i>The rule therefore in this jurisdiction is that once a complaint or information is filed in Court any disposition of the case as [to] its dismissal or the conviction or acquittal of the accused rests in the sound discretion of the Court. Although the fiscal retains the direction and control of the prosecution of criminal cases even while the case is already in Court he cannot impose his opinion on the trial court. The Court is the best and sole judge on what to do with the case before it. The determination of the case is within its exclusive jurisdiction and competence. A motion to dismiss the case filed by the fiscal should be addressed to the Court who has the option to grant or deny the same. It does not matter if this is done before or after the arraignment of the accused or that the motion was filed after a reinvestigation or upon instructions of the Secretary of Justice who reviewed the records of the investigation.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[133]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)</blockquote><br><br>Hence, when a Regional Trial Court has already determined that probable cause exists for the issuance of a warrant of arrest, like in this case, jurisdiction is already with the Regional Trial Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[134]</sup> Therefore, it can proceed in conducting further proceedings on the amended information and on the issuance of a warrant despite the pendency of a Petition for Review before the Department of Justice.<br><br><center><b>III.A</b></center><br><br>Petitioners insist that respondent judge should have deferred from conducting further proceedings on the amended information and on the issuance of a warrant considering the pendency of their Petition for Review before the Department of Justice.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[135]</sup> They cite Rule 116, Section 11 (c) of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure, which provides:<br><br><blockquote><center>RULE 116<br>Arraignment and Plea</center><br>....<br><br>Section 11.

Upon finding "sufficient legal and factual basis,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[148]</sup> the City Prosecutor's Office filed an information against Ledesma before the Regional Trial Court. Ledesma then filed a petition for review before the Department of Justice, which gave due course to the petition directing the Prosecutor to move for the deferment of further proceedings and to elevate the records of the case to it. Conformably, the Prosecutor filed a Motion to Defer Arraignment before the Regional Trial Court, which granted the motion and deferred arraignment until termination of the Department of Justice's petition for review. Without the trial prosecutor's consent, the counsel for private complainant filed a motion to lift the order and to set the case for trial or arraignment. The Regional Trial Court granted the motion then consequently scheduled Ledesma's arraignment. However, the Secretary of Justice reversed the prosecutor's findings directing the trial prosecutor to file before the Regional Trial Court a motion to withdraw information, which was subsequently denied. Its denial of the motion was affirmed by the Court of Appeals.<br><br>The main issue in <i> Ledesma </i> was whether the respondent judge in that case erred in denying the motion to withdraw information and the consequent motion for reconsideration. This Court held that the act of the judge was erroneous since he failed to give his reasons for denying the motions, and to make any independent assessment of the motion and of the resolution of the Secretary of Justice. Thus:<br><br><blockquote>In the light of recent holdings in <i> Marcelo </i>and <i> Martinez; </i>and considering that the issue of the correctness of the justice secretary's resolution has been amply threshed out in petitioner's letter, the information, the resolution of the secretary of justice, the motion to dismiss, and even the exhaustive discussion in the motion for reconsideration â all of which were submitted to the court â the trial judge committed grave abuse of discretion when it denied the motion to withdraw the information, based solely on his bare and ambiguous reliance on <i>Crespo. </i>The trial court's order is inconsistent with our repetitive calls for an independent and competent assessment of the issue(s) presented in the motion to dismiss. <i>The trial judge was tasked to evaluate the secretary's recommendation finding the absence of probable cause to hold petitioner criminally liable for libel. He failed to do so. He merely ruled to proceed with the trial without stating his reasons for disregarding the secretary's recommendation.</i><br><br>Had he complied with his judicial obligation, he would have discovered that there was, in fact, sufficient ground to grant the motion to withdraw the information. The documents before the trial court judge clearly showed that there was no probable cause to warrant a criminal prosecution for libel.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[149]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><br>This was reiterated in the ratio of that case, which read:<br><br><blockquote>When confronted with a motion to withdraw an information on the ground of lack of probable cause based on a resolution of the secretary of justice, <i>the bounden duty of the trial court is to make an independent assessment of the merits of such motion. Having acquired jurisdiction over the case, the trial court is not bound by such resolution but is required to evaluate it before proceeding further with the trial. While the secretary's ruling is persuasive, it is not binding on courts. </i> A trial court, however, commits reversible error or even grave abuse of discretion if it refuses/neglects to evaluate such recommendation and simply insists on proceeding with the trial on the mere pretext of having already acquired jurisdiction over the criminal action.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[150]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><br>Petitioners in this case hinge their claim on <i> Ledesma </i> in arguing that respondent Judge Pamular should have suspended action on the issuance of a warrant considering the pendency of their Petition for Review before the Department of Justice, which stated:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[151]</sup><br><br><blockquote>Where the secretary of justice exercises his power of review only after an information has been filed, trial courts should defer or suspend arraignment and further proceedings until the appeal is resolved. Such deferment or suspension, however, does not signify that the trial court is <i>ipso facto </i>bound by the resolution of the secretary of justice. Jurisdiction, once acquired by the trial court, is not lost despite a resolution by the secretary of justice to withdraw the information or to dismiss the case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[152]</sup></blockquote><br><br>While the quoted portion relates to the issue on suspending arraignment pending the review of the Department of Justice, there is nothing in <i> Ledesma </i> that speaks of suspending the issuance of a warrant of arrest. Although there is an error on the part of Judge Pamular in denying petitioners' motion to suspend the arraignment of Corpus, he can validly issue a warrant of arrest upon finding probable cause to acquire jurisdiction over Corpus. Hence, this was strengthened in the cited case of <i> Ledesma, </i> stating that "[j]urisdiction, once acquired by the trial court, is not lost despite a resolution by the secretary of justice to withdraw the information or to dismiss the case."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[153]</sup><br><br>They also cited the dispositive portion of <i> Tolentino,</i> which directed the respondent judge in that case to desist from proceeding with the trial until after the Department of Justice would have finally resolved the pending petition for review:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[154]</sup><br><br><blockquote>While We have noted from the <i> expediente </i>that the petitioner has utilized dilatory tactics to bring the case against her to trial, still she is entitled to the remedy she seeks.

The amendment thereby widens the battlefront to allow the use by the prosecution of newly discovered weapons, to the evident discomfiture of the opposite camp. Thus it would seem inequitable to sanction the tactical movement at this stage of the controversy, bearing in mind that the accused is only guaranteed two-days' preparation for trial. Needless to emphasize, as in criminal cases, the liberty, even the life, of the accused is at stake, it is always wise and proper that he be fully apprised of the charges, to avoid any possible surprise that may lead to injustice.

In case of doubt on the existence of probable cause, the judge may order the prosecutor to present additional evidence within five (5) days from notice and the issue must be resolved by the court within thirty (30) days from the filing of the complaint or information.

Respondent Judge Pamular, therefore, is familiar with the incidents of this case, which were his basis for issuing the warrant. Thus, before he issued the assailed Order and warrant, a hearing was conducted on February 13, 2009 regarding the motions and manifestations filed in the case:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[231]</sup><br><br><blockquote>On February 13, 2009, a hearing was held wherein the parties presented their arguments.

The pertinent portion of the Order provided:<br><br><blockquote>Elementary is the rule that the existence of probable cause is indispensable in the filing of complaint or information and in the issuance of warrant of arrest. The legion of jurisprudence has defined probable cause to be concerned with probability, not absolute or even moral certainty. The prosecution need not present at this stage proof beyond reasonable doubt. The standards of judgment are those of a reasonably prudent man and not the exacting calibrations of a judge after a full blown trial. No law or rule states that probable cause requires a specific kind of evidence. It is determined in the light of conditions obtaining in a given situation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[233]</sup></blockquote><br><br>In respondent Judge Pamular's Comment, he claimed that:<br><br><blockquote>Be that as it may, still, the undersigned respondent judge made a careful perusal of the records of the case.<b> <i>Sufficient copies of supporting documents and/or evidence were read and evaluated upon wlticll, independent judgment as to the existence of probable cause was based. </i></b>But, then again, still not satisfied, the undersigned even went beyond the face of the resolution and evidences (sic) presented before this Court.

Lozano saw respondent hand to Samonte a stainless gun, then heard respondent angrily say, "PUTANG INANG LITO YAN, SIGE! BIRAHIN MO!" Lozano immediately assumed that respondent referred to the victim, Espinosa, because he knew respondent entertained a grudge against the victim, since the latter led a campaign against the alleged abuses in the respondent mayor's office, and instigated the filing of criminal and administrative charges against him before the Ombudsman. Thus, he immediately proceeded to the victim's office and told the latter what he witnessed and heard, and advised him to take care.<br><br>Lozano did not include the foregoing matters in his first affidavit due to fear of reprisal, since it will implicate the respondent mayor in the killing of the victim."</blockquote><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Id. at 514.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Id. at 84-88 and 411.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Id. at 75-83. <i> See rollo, </i> p. 311 where the Department of Justice June 26, 2009 Resolution stated, in part:<br><blockquote>....<br>"Respondent, in his counter-affidavit, denied the accusation against him and stated that he neither had any involvement nor participation in the quarrel between Samonte and the victim.
