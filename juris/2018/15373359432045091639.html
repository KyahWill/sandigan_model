G Holding bought 90% of Maricalum Mining's shares and financial claims in the form of company notes. In exchange, the PSA obliged G Holdings to pay APT the amount of P673,161,280.00, with a down payment of P98,704,000.00 and with the balance divided into four tranches payable in installment over a period of ten years.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Concomitantly, G Holdings also assumed Maricalum Mining's liabilities in the form of company notes. The said financial liabilities were converted into three (3) Promissory Notes (<i>PNs</i>) totaling P550,000,000.00 (P114,715,360.00, P186,550,560.00 and P248,734,080.00), which were secured by mortgages over some of Maricalum Mining's properties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> These PNs obliged Maricalum Mining to pay G Holdings the stipulated amount of P550,000,000.00.<br><br>Upon the signing of the PSA and paying the stipulated down payment, G Holdings immediately took physical possession of Maricalum Mining's Sipalay Mining Complex, as well as its facilities, and took full control of the latter's management and operations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>On January 26, 1999, the Sipalay General Hospital, Inc. (<i>Sipalay Hospital</i>) was duly incorporated to provide medical services and facilities to the general public.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Afterwards, some of Maricalum Mining's employees retired and formed several manpower cooperatives,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> as follow:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td width="50%"><div align="center"><strong>COOPERATIVE</strong></div></td><td width="50%"><div align="center"><strong>DATE OF REGISTRATION</strong></div></td></tr><tr><td>San Jose Multi-Purpose Cooperative (<em>SJMPC</em>)</td><td>December 8, 1998</td></tr><tr><td>Centennial Multi-Purpose Cooperative (<em>CeMPC</em>)</td><td>April 5, 1999</td></tr><tr><td>Sipalay Integrated Multi-Purpose Cooperative (<em>SIMPC</em>)</td><td>April 5, 1999</td></tr><tr><td>Allied Services Multi-Purpose Cooperative (<em>ASMPC</em>)</td><td>July 23, 1999</td></tr><tr><td>Cansibit Multi-Purpose Cooperative (<em>CaMPC</em>)</td><td>September 16, 1999</td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>In 2000, each of the said cooperatives executed identical sets of Memorandum of Agreement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> with Maricalum Mining wherein they undertook, among others, to provide the latter with a steady supply of workers, machinery and equipment for a monthly fee.<br><br>On June 1, 2001, Maricalum Mining's Vice President and Resident Manager Jesus H.

Sitchon and Dennis Abelida which attested that, prior to the formation of the manpower cooperatives, their services were terminated by Maricalum Mining as part of its retrenchment program.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> They claimed that, in 1999, they were called by the top executives of Maricalum Mining and G Holdings and informed that they will have to form a cooperative for the purpose of providing manpower services in view of the retrenchment program.&nbsp; Thus, they were "rehired" only after their respective manpower cooperative services were formed. Moreover, they also submitted the following documents: (a) Cash Vouchers<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> representing payments to the manpower cooperatives; (b) a Payment Schedule<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> representing G Holdings' payment of social security contributions in favor of some Sipalay Hospital employees (c) Termination Letters<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> written by representatives of G Holdings, which were addressed to complainants including those employed by Sipalay Hospital; and (d) Caretaker Schedules<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> prepared by G Holdings to prove the existence of employment relations.<br><br>After the hearings were concluded, complainants presented their Position Paper<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> claiming that: they have not received any increase in wages since they were allegedly rehired; except for Sipalay Hospital's employees, they worked as an augmentation force to the security guards charged with securing Maricalum Mining's assets which were acquired by G Holdings; Maricalum Mining's assets have been exposed to pilferage by some of its rank-and-file employees whose claims for collective bargaining benefits were undergoing litigation; the Sipalay Hospital is purportedly "among the assets" of Maricalum Mining acquired by G Holdings; the payrolls for their wages were supposedly prepared by G Holdings' accounting department; since the second half of April 2007, they have not been paid their salary; and some of their services were dismissed without any due process.<br><br>Based on these factual claims, complainants posited that: the manpower cooperatives were mere alter egos of G Holdings organized to subvert the "tenurial rights" of the complainants; G Holdings implemented a retrenchment scheme to dismiss the caretakers it hired before the foreclosure of Maricalum Mining's assets; and G Holdings was their employer because it allegedly had the power to hire, pay wages, control working methods and dismiss them.<br><br>Correspondingly, G Holdings filed its Position Paper<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> maintaining that: it was Maricalum Mining who entered into an agreement with the manpower corporations for the employment of complainants' services for auxiliary or seasonal mining activities; the manpower cooperatives were the ones who paid the wages, deducted social security contributions, withheld taxes, provided medical benefits and had control over the working means and methods of complainants; despite Maricalum Mining's decision to stop its mining and milling operations, complainants still continued to render their services for the orderly winding down of the mines' operations; Maricalum Mining should have been impleaded because it is supposed to be the indispensable party in the present suit; (e) Maricalum Mining, as well as the manpower cooperatives, each have distinct legal personalities and that their individual corporate liabilities cannot be imposed upon each other; and there was no employer-employee relationship between G Holdings and complainants.<br><br>Likewise, the manpower cooperatives jointly filed their Position Paper<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> arguing that: complainants had exhibited a favorable response when they were properly briefed of the nature and benefits of working under a cooperative setup; complainants received their fair share of benefits; complainants were entitled to cast their respective votes in deciding the affairs of their respective cooperatives; complainants, as member of the cooperatives, are also co-owners of the said cooperative and they cannot bargain for higher labor benefits with other co-owners; and the LA has no jurisdiction over the case because there is no employer-employee relationship between a cooperative and its members.<br><br><i>The LA Ruling</i><br><br>In its decision dated April 28, 2011, the LA ruled in favor of complainants. It held that G Holdings is guilty of labor-only contracting with the manpower cooperatives thereby making all of them solidarily and directly liable to complainants. The LA reasoned that: G Holdings connived with Marcalum Mining in orchestrating the formation of manpower cooperatives to circumvent complainants' labor standards rights; it is highly unlikely that complainants (except Sipalay Hospital's employees) would spontaneously form manpower cooperatives on their own and in unison without the guidance of G Holdings and Maricalum Mining; and complainants effectively became the employees of G Holdings because their work had changed from assisting in the mining operations to safeguarding the properties in the Sipalay Mining Complex, which had already been acquired by G Holding. On the other hand, the LA denied the claims of complainants Nenet Arita and Domingo Lavida for lack of factual basis. The <i>fallo</i> of the LA decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered DIRECTING respondent "G" HOLDINGS, INC. to pay complainants as follows:

It held that Dr. Welilmo T. Neri, Erlinda L. Fernandez and Edgar M. Sobrino are not entitled to the monetary awards because they were not able to establish the fact of their employment relationship with G Holdings or Maricalum Mining because Sipalay Hospital has a separate and distinct corporate personality. As to the remaining complainants, it found that no evidence was adduced to prove that the salaries/wages and the 13<sup>th</sup> month pay had been paid.<br><br>However, the NLRC imposed the liability of paying the monetary awards imposed by the LA against Maricalum Mining, instead of G Holdings, based on the following observations that: it was Maricalum Mining-not G Holdings-who entered into service contracts by way of a Memorandum of Agreement with each of the manpower cooperatives; complainants continued rendering their services at the insistence of Maricalum Mining through their cooperatives; Maricalum Mining never relinquished possession over the Sipalay Mining Complex; Maricalum Mining continuously availed of the services of complainants through their respective manpower cooperatives; in <i>G Holdings, Inc. v. National Mines and Allied Workers Union Local 103 (NAMAWU), et al.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> (NAMAWU Case), the Court already held that G Holdings and Maricalum Mining have separate and distinct corporate personalities.

The Decision promulgated by the Commission on 29 November 2011 modifying the Labor Arbiter's decision as stated therein, is further MODIFIED to the effect that the monetary awards adjudged in favor of complainants Wilfredo Taganile and Bartholomew T.

It ratiocinated that factual issues are not fit subjects for review via the extraordinary remedy of <i>certiorari</i>. The CA emphasized that the NLRC's factual findings are conclusive and binding on the appellate courts when they are supported by substantial evidence.

Moreover, it also stressed that the NLRC should have remanded the case to the LA for the determination of the manpower cooperatives' net surpluses and how these amounts were distributed to their members to aid the proper determination of the total amount of the monetary award. Finally, Maricalum Mining avers that the awards in favor of some of the complainants are "improbable" and completely unfounded.<br><br>On the other hand, G Holdings argues that piercing the corporate veil of Maricalum Mining is not proper because: (a) it did not acquire all of Maricalum Mining's assets; (b) it is primarily engaged in the business of owning and holding shares of stocks of different companies-not participating in the operations of its subsidiaries; (c) Maricalum Mining, the actual employers of complainants, had already manifested its willingness to settle the correct money claims; (d) Bernardino is not a controlling stockholder of Maricalum Mining because the latter's corporate records show that almost all of its shares of stock are owned by the APT; (e) Joost Pekelharing-not Bernardino-is G Holdings' president; (f) in the NAMAWU Case, it was already held that control over Maricalum Mining was exercised by the APT and not G Holdings; (g) the NLRC did not commit any grave abuse of discretion when it allowed Maricalum Mining to intervene after the LA's decision was promulgated; (h) the cash vouchers, payment schedule, termination letters and caretaker schedules presented by complainants do not prove the employment relationship with G Holdings because the signatories thereto were either from Maricalum Mining or the manpower cooperatives; (i) this Court's pronouncements in the NAMAWU Case and in <i>Republic v.

Hydro Resources Contractors Corporation</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> to wit:<br><blockquote>The first prong is the <b>"instrumentality" or "control" test</b>. This test requires that the subsidiary be completely under the control and domination of the parent. It examines the parent corporation's relationship with the subsidiary. It inquires whether a subsidiary corporation is so organized and controlled and its affairs are so conducted as to make it a mere instrumentality or agent of the parent corporation such that its separate existence as a distinct corporate entity will be ignored. It seeks to establish whether the subsidiary corporation has no autonomy and the parent corporation, though acting through the subsidiary in form and appearance, "is operating the business directly for itself."<br><br>The second prong is the <b>"fraud" test</b>. This test requires that the parent corporation's conduct in using the subsidiary corporation be unjust, fraudulent or wrongful. It examines the relationship of the plaintiff to the corporation. It recognizes that piercing is appropriate only if the parent corporation uses the subsidiary in a way that harms the plaintiff creditor. As such, it requires a showing of "an element of injustice or fundamental unfairness."<br><br>The third prong is the <b>"harm" test</b>. This test requires the plaintiff to show that the defendant's control, exerted in a fraudulent, illegal or otherwise unfair manner toward it, caused the harm suffered. A causal connection between the fraudulent conduct committed through the instrumentality of the subsidiary and the injury suffered or the damage incurred by the plaintiff should be established. The plaintiff must prove that, unless the corporate veil is pierced, it will have been treated unjustly by the defendant's exercise of control and improper use of the corporate form and, thereby, suffer damages.<br><br>To summarize, piercing the corporate veil based on the <i>alter ego</i> theory <u><b>requires the concurrence of three elements</b></u>: control of the corporation by the stockholder or parent corporation, fraud or fundamental unfairness imposed on the plaintiff, and harm or damage caused to the plaintiff by the fraudulent or unfair act of the corporation. <u><b>The absence of any of these elements prevents piercing the corporate veil.</b></u> (emphases and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Again, all these three elements must concur before the corporate veil may be pierced under the alter ego theory.

This is because this Court had already upheld the validity and enforceability of the PSA between the APT and G Holdings. It was stipulated in the PSA that APT shall transfer 90% of Maricalum Mining's equity securities to G Holdings and it establishes the presence of absolute control of a subsidiary's corporate affairs. Moreover, the Court evinces its observation that Maricalum Mining's corporate name appearing on the heading of the cash vouchers issued in payment of the services rendered by the manpower cooperatives is being superimposed with G Holding's corporate name. Due to this observation, it can be reasonably inferred that G Holdings is paying for Maricalum Mining's salary expenses. Hence, the presence of both circumstances of dominant equity ownership and provision for salary expenses may adequately establish that Maricalum Mining is an instrumentality of G Holdings.<br><br>However, mere presence of control and full ownership of a parent over a subsidiary is not enough to pierce the veil of corporate fiction.

transfer of assets from Maricalum Mining to G Holdings is enough to invoke the equitable remedy of piercing the corporate veil. The same issue was resolved in <i>Y-I Leisure Phils., Inc., et al. v. Yu</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> where this Court applied the "Nell Doctrine"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> regarding the <b>transfer of all the assets of one corporation to another</b>. It was discussed in that case that as a general rule that where one corporation sells or otherwise transfers <i>all</i> of its assets to another corporation, the latter is not liable for the debts and liabilities of the transferor, except:<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">1) </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">Where the purchaser expressly or impliedly agrees to assume such debts;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">2) </div></td><td><div align="justify">Where the transaction amounts to a consolidation or merger of the corporations;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">3) </div></td><td><div align="justify">Where the purchasing corporation is merely a continuation of the selling corporation; and</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">4) <strong></strong></div></td><td><div align="justify"><strong>Where the transaction is entered into fraudulently in order to escape liability for such debts.</strong></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>If any of the above-cited exceptions are present, then the transferee corporation shall assume the liabilities of the transferor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br>In this case, G Holdings cannot be held liable for the satisfaction of labor-related claims against Maricalum Mining under the fraud test for the following reasons:<br><br><i>First</i>, the transfer of some Maricalum Mining's assets in favor G Holdings was by virtue of the PSA as part of an official measure to dispose of the government's non-performing assets-not to evade its monetary obligations to the complainants. Even before complainants' monetary claims supposedly existed in 2007, some of Maricalum Mining's assets had already been validly extrajudicially foreclosed and eventually sold to G Holdings in 2001. Thus, G Holdings could not have devised a scheme to avoid a non-existent obligation. No fraud could be attributed to G Holdings because the transfer of assets was pursuant to a previously perfected valid contract.<br><br>Settled is the rule that where one corporation sells or otherwise transfers all its assets to another corporation for value, the latter is not, by that fact alone, liable for the debts and liabilities of the transferor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> In other words, control or ownership of substantially all of a subsidiary's assets is not by itself an indication of a holding company's fraudulent intent to alienate these assets in evading labor-related claims or liabilities. As discussed earlier, the PSA was not designed to evade the monetary claims of the complainants. Although there was proof that G Holdings has an office in Maricalum Mining's premises and that that some of their assets have been commingled due to the PSA's unavoidable consequences, there was no fraudulent diversion of corporate assets to another corporation for the sole purpose of evading complainants' claim.<br><br>Besides, it is evident that the alleged continuing depletion of Maricalum Mining's assets is due to its disgruntled employees' own acts of pilferage, which was beyond the control of G Holdings. More so, complainants also failed to present any clear and convincing evidence that G Holdings was grossly negligent and failed to exercise the required degree of diligence in ensuring that Maricalum Mining's assets would be protected from pilferage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> Hence, no fraud can be imputed against G Holdings considering that there is no evidence in the records that establishes it systematically tried to alienate Maricalum Mining's assets to escape the liabilities to complainants.<br><br><i>Second</i>, it was not proven that all of Maricalum Mining's assets were transferred to G Holdings or were totally depleted. Complainants never offered any evidence to establish that Maricalum Mining had absolutely no substantial assets to cover for their monetary claims. Their allegation that their claims will be reduced to a mere "paper victory" has not confirmed with concrete proof. At the very least, substantial evidence should be adduced that the subsidiary company's "net realizable value"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> of "current assets"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> and "fair value"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> of "non-current assets"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> are collectively insufficient to cover the whole amount of its liability subject in the instant litigation.<br><br><i>Third</i>, G Holdings purchased Maricalum Mining's shares from the APT not for the purpose of continuing the latter's existence and operations but for the purpose of investing in the mining industry without having to directly engage in the management and operation of mining. As discussed earlier, a holding company's primary business is merely to invest in the equity of another corporation for the purpose of earning from the latter's endeavors. It generally does not undertake to engage in the daily operating activities of its subsidiaries that, in turn, have their own separate sets of directors and officers. Thus, there should be proof that a holding company had indeed fraudulently used the separate corporate personality of its subsidiary to evade an obligation before it can be held liable. Since G Holdings is a holding company, the corporate veil of its subsidiaries may only be pierced based on fraud or gross negligence amounting to bad faith.<br><br><i>Lastly</i>, no clear and convincing evidence was presented by the complainants to conclusively prove the presence of fraud on the part of G Holdings. Although the quantum of evidence needed to establish a claim for illegal dismissal in labor cases is substantial evidence,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> the quantum need to establish the presence of fraud is clear and convincing evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> Thus, to disregard the separate juridical personality of a corporation, the wrongdoing must be established clearly and convincingly-it cannot be presumed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup><br><br>Here, the complainants did not satisfy the requisite quantum of evidence to prove fraud on the part of G Holdings. They merely offered allegations and suppositions that, since Maricalum Mining's assets appear to be continuously depleting and that the same corporation is a subsidiary, G Holdings could have been guilty of fraud. As emphasized earlier, <b>bare allegations do not prove anything</b>. There must be proof that fraud-not the inevitable effects of a previously executed and valid contract such as the PSA-was the cause of the latter's total asset depletion. To be clear, the presence of control <i>per se</i> is not enough to justify the piercing of the corporate veil.<br><br><i>III. Harm or Casual Connection Test</i><br><br>In <i>WPM International Trading, Inc., et al. v. Labayen</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> the Court laid down the criteria for the harm or casual connection test, to wit:<br><blockquote>In this connection, we stress that the control necessary to invoke the instrumentality or <i>alter ego</i> rule is not majority or even complete stock control but such domination of finances, policies and practices that the controlled corporation has, so to speak, no separate mind, will or existence of its own, and is but a conduit for its principal. The control must be shown to have been exercised <u>at the time the acts complained of took place</u>. Moreover, the <u>control and breach of duty <b>must <i>proximately cause</i> the injury or unjust loss</b></u> for which the complaint is made. (emphases and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Proximate cause is defined as that cause, which, in natural and continuous sequence, unbroken by any efficient intervening cause, produces the injury, and without which the result would not have occurred.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> More comprehensively, the proximate legal cause is that "acting first and producing the injury, either immediately or by setting other events in motion, all constituting a natural and continuous chain of events, each having a close causal connection with its immediate predecessor, the final event in the chain immediately effecting the injury as a natural and probable result of the cause which first acted, under such circumstances that the person responsible for the first event should, as an ordinary prudent and intelligent person, have reasonable ground to expect at the moment of his act or default that an injury to some person might probably result therefrom."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> Hence, for an act or event to be considered as proximate legal cause, it should be shown that such act or event had indeed caused injury to another.<br><br>In the case at bench, complainants <b>have not yet even suffered any monetary injury. They have yet to enforce their claims against Maricalum Mining.</b> It is apparent that complainants are merely anxious that their monetary awards will not be satisfied because the assets of Maricalum Mining were allegedly transferred surreptitiously to G Holdings. However, as discussed earlier, since complainants failed to show that G Holdings's mere exercise of control had a clear hand in the depletion of Maricalum Mining's assets, no proximate cause was successfully established. The transfer of assets was pursuant to a valid and legal PSA between G Holdings and APT.<br><br>Accordingly, complainants failed to satisfy the second and third tests to justify the application of the alter ego theory. This inevitably shows that the CA committed no reversible error in upholding the NLRC's Decision declaring Maricalum Mining as the proper party liable to pay the monetary awards in favor of complainants.<br><br><i>G Holdings and Sipalay Hospital</i><br><br>Sipalay Hospital was incorporated by Romulo G. Zafra, Eleanore B. Gutierrez, Helen Grace B. Fernandez, Evelyn B. Badajos and Helen Grace L. Arbolario.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> However, there is absence of indication that G Holdings subsequently acquired the controlling interests of Sipalay Hospital. There is also no evidence that G Holdings entered into a contract with Sipalay Hospital to provide medical services for its officers and employees. This lack of stockholding or contractual connection signifies that Sipalay Hospital is not affiliated<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> with G Holdings. Thus, due to this absence of affiliation, the Court must apply the tests used to determine the existence of an employee-employer relationship; rather than piercing the corporate veil.<br><br>Under the <b>four-fold test</b>, the employer-employee relationship is determined if the following are present: a) the selection and engagement of the employee; b) the payment of wages; c) the power of dismissal; and d) the power to control the employee's conduct, or the so-called "control test."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup><br><br>Here, the "control test" is the most important and crucial among the four tests.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> However, in cases where there is no written agreement to base the relationship on and where the various tasks performed by the worker bring complexity to the relationship with the employer, the better approach would therefore be to adopt a <b>two-tiered test</b> involving: a) the putative employer's power to control the employee with respect to the means and methods by which the work is to be accomplished; and b) the underlying economic realities of the activity or relationship.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup><br><br>In applying the second tier, the determination of the relationship between employer and employee depends upon the circumstances of the whole economic activity (<b>economic reality or multi-factor test</b>), such as: a) the extent to which the services performed are an integral part of the employer's business; b) the extent of the worker's investment in equipment and facilities; c) the nature and degree of control exercised by the employer; d) the worker's opportunity for profit and loss; e) the amount of initiative, skill, judgment or foresight required for the success of the claimed independent enterprise; f) the permanency and duration of the relationship between the worker and the employer; and g) the degree of dependency of the worker upon the employer for his continued employment in that line of business.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> Under all of these tests, the burden to prove by substantial evidence all of the elements or factors is incumbent on the employee for he or she is the one claiming the existence of an employment relationship.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup><br><br>In light of the present circumstances, <b>the Court must apply the four­fold test</b> for lack of relevant data in the case records relating to the underlying economic realities of the activity or relationship of Sipalay Hospital's employees.<br><br>To prove the existence of their employment relationship with G Holdings, complainants Dr. Welilmo T.

Fernandez, Edgar M. Sobrino and Wilfreda C. Taganile, Sr. were indeed selected and engaged by either Maricalum Mining or G Holdings. <b>This gap in evidence clearly shows that the first factor of the four-fold test, or the selection and engagement of the employee, was not satisfied and not supported by substantial evidence.</b><br><br>However, the same cannot be said as to the second and third factors of the four-fold test (the payment of wages and the power of dismissal). Since substantial evidence is defined as that amount of relevant evidence which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to justify a conclusion,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup> the cash vouchers, social security payments and notices of termination are reasonable enough to draw an inference that G Holdings and Maricalum Mining may have had a hand in the complainants' payment of salaries and dismissal.<br><br>Notwithstanding the absence of the first factor and the presence of the second and third factors of the four-fold test, the Court still deems it best to examine the fourth factor-the presence of control-in order to determine the employment connection of complainants Dr. Welilmo T. Neri, Erlinda L. Fernandez, Edgar M. Sobrino and Wilfreda C. Taganile, Sr. with G Holdings.<br><br>Under the control test, an employer-employee relationship exists where the person for whom the services are performed reserves the right to control not only the end achieved, but also the manner and means to be used in reaching that end.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup> As applied in the healthcare industry, an employment relationship exists between a physician and a hospital if the hospital controls both the means and the details of the process by which the physician is to accomplish his task.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup> But where a person who works for another performs his job more or less at his own pleasure, in the manner he sees fit, not subject to definite hours or conditions of work, and is compensated according to the result of his efforts and not the amount thereof, no employer-employee relationship exists.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup><br><br>A corporation may only exercise its powers within the definitions provided by law and its articles of incorporation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup> Accordingly, in order to determine the presence or absence of an employment relationship between G Holdings and the employees of Sipalay Hospital by using the control test, the Court deems it essential to examine the salient portion of Sipalay Hospital's Articles of Incorporation imparting its 'primary purpose,'<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup> to wit:<br><blockquote>To own, manage, lease or operate hospitals or clinics offering and providing medical services and facilities <u>to the <b>general public</b></u>, provided that purely professional, medical or surgical services shall be <u>performed by duly qualified physicians or surgeons who may or <b>may not be connected with</b> the corporation</u> and who shall be freely and individually contracted by patients. (emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>It is immediately apparent that Sipalay Hospital, even if its facilities are located inside the Sipalay Mining Complex, does not limit its medical services only to the employees and officers of Maricalum Mining and/or G Holdings. Its act of holding out services to the public reinforces the fact of its independence from either Maricalum Mining or G Holdings because it is free to deal with any client without any legal or contractual restriction. Moreover, G Holdings is a holding company primarily engaged in investing substantially in the stocks of another company-not in directing and managing the latter's daily business operations. Because of this corporate attribute, <b>the Court can reasonably draw an inference that G Holdings does not have a considerable ability to control means and methods of work of Sipalay Hospital employees</b>. Markedly, the records are simply bereft of any evidence that G Holdings had, in fact, used its ownership to control the daily operations of Sipalay Hospital as well as the working methods of the latter's employees. There is no evidence showing any subsequent transfer of shares from the original incorporators of Sipalay Hospital to G Holdings. Worse, it appears that complainants Dr. Welilmo T. Neri, Erlinda L. Fernandez, Wilfreda C. Taganile, Sr. and Edgar M. Sobrino are trying to derive their employment connection with G Holdings merely on an assumed premise that the latter owns the controlling stocks of Maricalum Mining.<br><br>On this score, the CA committed no reversible error in allowing the NLRC to delete the monetary awards of Dr. Welilmo T. Neri, Erlinda L. Fernandez, Wilfreda C. Taganile, Sr. and Edgar M. Sobrino imposed by the Labor Arbiter against G Holdings.<br><br><center><i>Conclusion</i><br></center><br>A holding company may be held liable for the acts of its subsidiary only when it is adequately proven that: a) there was control over the subsidiary; b) such control was used to protect a fraud (or gross negligence amounting to bad faith) or evade an obligation; and c) fraud was the proximate cause of another's existing injury. Further, an employee is duly­burdened to prove the crucial test or factor of control thru substantial evidence in order to establish the existence of an employment relationship­especially as against an unaffiliated corporation alleged to be exercising control.<br><br>In this case, complainants have not successfully proven that G Holdings fraudulently exercised its control over Maricalum Mining to fraudulently evade any obligation. They also fell short of proving that G Holdings had exercised operational control over the employees of Sipalay Hospital.

SP No. 06835.<br><br>In G.R. No. 221813, Maricalum Mining Corporation (Maricalum Mining) is questioning the computation of its total monetary liability.<br><br>In G.R. No. 222723, Ely G. Florentino, Glenn Buenviaje, Rudy J. Gomez, represented by his heir Thelma Gomez, Fernando Siguan, Dennis Abelida, Noel S. Accolador, Wilfreda Taganile, Sr., Martir S.

Trespeces, Edgar Sobrino, Alejandro H. Sitchon, Nenet Arita, Welilmo T. Neri, Erlinda Fernandez, and Edgardo Pefiaflorida (collectively, complainants) are insisting that G Holdings, Inc. (G Holdings) should be held liable with Maricalum Mining for their labor claims.<br><br>The following are the antecedent facts:<br><br>The Philippine National Bank and the Development Bank of the Philippines previously owned Maricalum Mining. When Maricalum Mining became a non-performing asset, both banks transferred their ownership of Maricalum Mining to the National Government for disposition or privatization.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>On October 2, 1992, the National Government, through the Asset Privatization Trust, sold 90% of Maricalum Mining's shares and financial claims to G Holdings, a domestic corporation engaged in owning and holding shares of stock of different companies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>The Asset Privatization Trust and G Holdings executed a Purchase and Sale Agreement. It provided for the purchase price for Maricalum Mining's shares. As for the value of Maricalum Mining's financial claims, Maricalum Mining executed promissory notes in favor of G Holdings. The notes were secured by Maricalum Mining's properties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>When G Holdings had paid the down payment, it immediately took possession of Maricalum Mining's mine site, facilities, and took full control of the latter's management and operations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>In 1999, several Maricalum Mining employees retired and formed manpower cooperatives.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>In 2000, the cooperatives executed separate but identical Memoranda of Agreement with Maricalum Mining, undertaking to supply the latter with workers, machinery, and equipment in exchange for a monthly fee.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>On June 1, 2001, Maricalum Mining informed the cooperatives that it was undergoing continuing losses because of high cost of production and low metal prices. Consequently, it would cease its mining and milling operations beginning July 1, 2001.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>In July 2001, Maricalum Mining's properties mortgaged in favor of G Holdings were extra-judicially foreclosed. On December 3, 2001, the properties were sold to G Holdings as the highest bidder.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>On September 23, 2010, the complainants filed an illegal dismissal case against G Holdings and the cooperatives. They also sought payment for several money claims, damages, and attorney's fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>The Labor Arbiter ruled that G Holdings, Maricalum Mining, and the manpower cooperatives were guilty of labor-only contracting, and thus, are liable for the money claims and attorney's fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>On appeal, the National Labor Relations Commission modified the ruling. It found that only Maricalum Mining was liable to the employees because Maricalum Mining and G Holdings had separate and distinct corporate personalities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals affirmed the ruling of the National Labor Relations Commission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>The complainants filed a Petition for Review with this Court, asserting that G Holdings should be held liable for their claims because the doctrine of piercing the corporate veil applies.<br><br>The <i>ponencia</i> affirmed the Court of Appeals' ruling. It held that the corporate veil should not be pierced because there is no evidence of fraud on the part of G Holdings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>It explained that the corporate veil must be lifted only if it was used to shield fraud, defend crime, justify a wrong, defeat public convenience, insulate bad faith, or perpetuate injustice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Control and ownership of all assets of another corporation is not an indication of a fraudulent intent to evade labor claims and liabilities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> The <i>ponencia</i> ruled that the employees must present clear and convincing evidence to prove that the holding company is guilty of fraud or gross negligence amounting to bad faith to evade the obligation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>It held that the transfer of Maricalum Mining's assets to G Holdings does not indicate fraud, as it was done pursuant to the Purchase and Sale Agreement executed in 1992. It noted that some of the assets had been foreclosed as early as 2001, even before the labor claims existed, and thus, there was no evidence that the transfer was done to evade their obligations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>The <i>ponencia</i> also lent credence to the allegation that the continuing depletion of Maricalum Mining's assets is due to its employees' pilferage, and that there is no evidence that G Holdings was negligent in that aspect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>It further ruled that there is no showing that all of Maricalum Mining's assets have been depleted such that it is insufficient to meet the employees' claims.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>It also concluded that G Holdings is a holding company that merely purchased Maricalum Mining's shares to invest in the mining industry, not to continue its existence and operations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Moreover, it ruled that there is no showing that the employees have suffered any monetary injury, as they have yet to enforce their claims against Maricalum Mining.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>I dissent. I opine that the corporate veil should be pierced and that G Holdings should be held solidarily liable with Maricalum Mining.<br><br>A corporation has a separate and distinct personality from that of its stockholders, officers, or any other legal entity to which it is related.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> It is presumed to be a bona fide legal entity that has its own powers and attributes. Its assets and properties are its own, and it is liable for its own acts and obligations.<br><blockquote>A corporation is an artificial being created by operation of law. It possesses the right of succession and such powers, attributes, and properties expressly authorized by law or incident to its existence.

The Philippine National Bank and the Development Bank of the Philippines foreclosed and acquired the mortgaged properties of Marinduque Mining, and assigned their rights to the properties to three (3) newly created mining corporations. Remington then filed a collection case against Marinduque Mining, and impleaded the Philippine National Bank, the Development Bank of the Philippines, and the three (3) mining companies. It argued that the transfer of Marinduque Mining's properties to the three (3) mining corporations were made in fraud of creditors considering that the Philippine National Bank and the Development Bank of the Philippines practically wholly own the three (3) newly created entities. This Court ruled that the piercing of the corporate veil is not warranted because the transfer was done in good faith and in accordance with law and sound business practice:<br><blockquote>[T]his Court has disregarded the separate personality of the corporation where the corporate entity was used to escape liability to third parties. In this case, however, we do not find any fraud on the part of Marinduque Mining and its transferees to warrant the piercing of the corporate veil.<br><br>It bears stressing that [the Philippine National Bank] and [the Development Bank of the Philippines] are mandated to foreclose on the mortgage when the past due account had incurred arrearages of more than 20% of the total outstanding obligation . . .<br><br>Thus, [the Philippine National Bank] and [the Development Bank of the Philippines] did not only have a right, but the duty under said law, to foreclose upon the subject properties.

As Remington itself concedes, [the Development Bank of the Philippines] is not authorized by its charter to engage in the mining business. The creation of the three corporations was necessary to manage and operate the assets acquired in the foreclosure sale lest they deteriorate from non-use and lose their value. In the absence of any entity willing to purchase these assets from the bank, what else would it do with these properties in the meantime? Sound business practice required that they be utilized for the purposes for which they were intended.<br><br>Remington also asserted in its third amended complaint that the use of Nonoc Mining, Maricalum and Island Cement of the premises of Marinduque Mining and the hiring of the latter's officers and personnel also constitute badges of bad faith.<br><br>Assuming that the premises of Marinduque Mining were not among those acquired by [the Development Bank of the Philippines] in the foreclosure sale, convenience and practicality dictated that the corporations so created occupy the premises where these assets were found instead of relocating them.

The same reasons of convenience and practicality, not to mention efficiency, justified the hiring by Nonoc Mining, Maricalum and Island Cement of Marinduque Mining's personnel to manage and operate the properties and to maintain the continuity of the mining operations.<br><br>To reiterate, the doctrine of piercing the veil of corporate fiction applies only when such corporate fiction is used to defeat public convenience, justify wrong, protect fraud or defend crime. To disregard the separate juridical personality of a corporation, the wrongdoing must be clearly and convincingly established. It cannot be presumed.

This Court refused to pierce the corporate veil:<br><blockquote>The rationale behind piercing a corporation's identity is to remove the barrier between the corporation from the persons comprising it to thwart the fraudulent and illegal schemes of those who use the corporate personality as a shield for undertaking certain proscribed activities.<br><br>While it is true that Aircon is a subsidiary of the petitioner, it does not necessarily follow that Aircon's corporate legal existence can just be disregarded. In <i>Velarde v.

In applying the doctrine, the following requisites must be established: (1) control, not merely majority or complete stock control; (2) such control must have been used by the defendant to commit fraud or wrong, to perpetuate the violation of a statutory or other positive legal duty, or dishonest acts in contravention of plaintiff's legal rights; and (3) the aforesaid control and breach of duty must proximately cause the injury or unjust loss complained of.<br><br>The records bear out that Aircon is a subsidiary of the petitioner only because the latter acquired Aircon's majority of capital stock. It, however, does not exercise complete control over Aircon; nowhere can it be gathered that the petitioner manages the business affairs of Aircon. Indeed, no management agreement exists between the petitioner and Aircon, and the latter is an entirely different entity from the petitioner.<br><br>Jardine Davies, Inc., incorporated as early as June 28, 1946, is primarily a financial and trading company . . .<br><br>On the other hand, Aircon, incorporated on December 27, 1952, is a manufacturing firm.

But even when there is dominance over the affairs of the subsidiary, the doctrine of piercing the veil of corporate fiction applies only when such fiction is used to defeat public convenience, justify wrong, protect fraud or defend crime. To warrant resort to this extraordinary remedy, there must be proof that the corporation is being used as a cloak or cover for fraud or illegality, or to work injustice. Any piercing of the corporate veil has to be done with caution. The wrongdoing must be clearly and convincingly established. It cannot just be presumed.<br><br>In the instant case, there is no evidence that Aircon was formed or utilized with the intention of defrauding its creditors or evading its contracts and obligations. There was nothing fraudulent in the acts of Aircon in this case. Aircon, as a manufacturing firm of air conditioners, complied with its obligation of providing two air conditioning units for the second floor of the Blanco Center in good faith, pursuant to its contract with the respondent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Thus, it is not enough that there is dominance over the subsidiary company.

He continued to retain his AZCOR Identification Card, his pay slips contained the name of AZCOR, and he was paid the same salary.

This Court ruled, thus:<br><blockquote>The doctrine that a corporation is a legal entity or a person in law distinct from the persons composing it is merely a legal fiction for purposes of convenience and to subserve the ends of justice. This fiction cannot be extended to a point beyond its reason and policy. Where, as in this case, the corporate fiction was used as a means to perpetrate a social injustice or as a vehicle to evade obligations or confuse the legitimate issues, it would be discarded and the two (2) corporations would be merged as one, the first being merely considered as the instrumentality, agency, conduit or adjunct of the other.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>In fine, we see in the totality of the evidence a veiled attempt by petitioners to deprive Capulso of what he had earned through hard labor by taking advantage of his low level of education and confusing him as to who really was his true employer - such a callous and despicable treatment of a worker who had rendered faithful service to their company.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>In <i>De Leon v. National Labor Relations Commission</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> Fortune Tobacco Corporation (Fortune Tobacco) contracted Fortune Integrated Services, Inc. (Fortune Integrated) to provide security guards. Around 11 years later, Fortune Integrated's incorporators and stockholders sold out their shares lock, stock, and barrel. Fortune Integrated's corporate name in the Articles of Incorporation was amended to read as Magnum Integrated Services, Inc. (Magnum Integrated). Fortune Tobacco then terminated its contract for security services with Fortune Integrated and engaged the services of two (2) other security agencies, thus, displacing 582 security guards who were originally assigned to it. Several security guards, through their labor union, filed a complaint for illegal dismissal and unfair labor practice, alleging that they were regular employees of Fortune Tobacco, which also used the corporate names Fortune Integrated and Magnum Integrated. In this case, this Court pierced the corporate veil:<br><blockquote>We are not persuaded by the argument of respondent [Fortune Tobacco] denying the presence of an employer-employee relationship. We find that the Labor Arbiter correctly applied the doctrine of piercing the corporate veil to hold all respondents liable for unfair labor practice and illegal termination of petitioners' employment. It is a fundamental principle in corporation law that a corporation is an entity separate and distinct from its stockholders and from other corporations to which it is connected. However, when the concept of separate legal entity is used to defeat public convenience, justify wrong, protect fraud or defend crime, the law will regard the corporation as an association of persons, or in case of two corporations, merge them into one. The separate juridical personality of a corporation may also be disregarded when such corporation is a mere alter ego or business conduit of another person. In the case at bar, it was shown that [Fortune Integrated] was a mere adjunct of [Fortune Tobacco]. [Fortune Integrated], by virtue of a contract for security services, provided [Fortune Tobacco] with security guards to safeguard its premises. However, records show that [Fortune Integrated] and [Fortune Tobacco] have the same owners and business address, and [Fortune Integrated] provided security services only to [Fortune Tobacco] and other companies belonging to the Lucio Tan group of companies. The purported sale of the shares of the former stockholders to a new set of stockholders who changed the name of the corporation to Magnum Integrated Services, Inc. appears to be part of a scheme to terminate the services of [Fortune Integrated]'s security guards posted at the premises of [Fortune Tobacco] and bust their newly-organized union which was then beginning to become active in demanding the company's compliance with Labor Standards laws. Under these circumstances, the Court cannot allow [Fortune Tobacco] to use its separate corporate personality to shield itself from liability for illegal acts committed against its employees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> (Citation omitted)<br></blockquote>In <i>Reynoso IV v.

National Mines and Allied Workers Union Local 103</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> This Court ruled that the transfer pursuant to the Purchase and Sale Agreement was valid, considering it was entered into by the Philippine government, thus, giving rise to the presumption of its regularity. Moreover, the mortgages had existed since 1992, and thus, cannot be said to have been executed to evade labor claims, which arose later on:<br><blockquote>It may be remembered that [the Asset Privatization Trust] acquired the [Maricalum Mining] from the [the Philippine National Bank] and the [the Development Bank of the Philippines]. Then, in compliance with its mandate to privatize government assets, [the Asset Privatization Trust] sold the aforesaid [Maricalum Mining] shares and notes to [G Holdings]. To repeat, this Court has recognized this Purchase and Sale Agreement in <i>Republic, etc., v. "G" Holdings, Inc.</i><br><br>The participation of the Government, through [the Asset Privatization Trust], in this transaction is significant. Because the Government had actively negotiated and, eventually, executed the agreement, then the transaction is imbued with an aura of official authority, giving rise to the presumption of regularity in its execution. This presumption would cover all related transactional acts and documents needed to consummate the privatization sale, inclusive of the Promissory Notes. It is obvious, then, that the Government, through [the Asset Privatization Trust], consented to the "establishment and constitution" of the mortgages on the assets of [Maricalum Mining] in favor of [G Holdings], as provided in the notes. Accordingly, the notes (and the stipulations therein) enjoy the benefit of the same presumption of regularity accorded to government actions. Given the Government consent thereto, and clothed with the presumption of regularity, the mortgages cannot be characterized as sham, fictitious or fraudulent.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>It is difficult to conceive that these mortgages, already existing in 1992, almost four (4) years before [the National Mines and Allied Workers Union Local 103] filed its notice of strike, were a "fictitious" arrangement intended to defraud [the National Mines and Allied Workers Union Local 103]. After all, they were agreed upon long before the seeds of the labor dispute germinated.<br><br>While it is true that the Deed of Real Estate and Chattel Mortgage was executed only on September 5, 1996, it is beyond cavil that this formal document of mortgage was merely a derivative of the original mortgage stipulations contained in the Promissory Notes of October 2, 1992. The execution of this Deed in 1996 does not detract from, but instead reinforces, the manifest intention of the parties to "establish and constitute" the mortgages on [Maricalum Mining]'s real and personal properties.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>The execution of the subsequent Deed of Real Estate and Chattel Mortgage on September 5, 1996 was simply the formal documentation of what had already been agreed in the seminal transaction (the Purchase and Sale Agreement) between [the Asset Privatization Trust] and [G Holdings]. It should not be viewed in isolation, apart from the original agreement of October 2, 1992. And it cannot be denied that this original agreement was supported by an adequate consideration. The [Asset Privatization Trust] was even ordered by the court to deliver the shares and financial notes of [Maricalum Mining] in exchange for the payments that [G Holdings] had made.<br><br>It was also about this time, in 1996, that [the National Mines and Allied Workers Union Local 103] filed a notice of strike to protest non­ payment of its rightful labor claims. But, as already mentioned, the outcome of that labor dispute was yet unascertainable at that time, and [the National Mines and Allied Workers Union Local 103] could only have hoped for, or speculated about, a favorable ruling. To paraphrase <i>MR Holdings</i>, we cannot see how [the National Mines and Allied Workers Union Local 103]'s right was prejudiced by the Deed of Real Estate and Chattel Mortgage, or by its delayed registration, when substantially all of the properties of [Maricalum Mining] were already mortgaged to [G Holdings] as early as October 2, 1992. Given this reality, the Court of Appeals had no basis to conclude that this Deed of Real Estate and Chattel Mortgage, by reason of its late registration, was a simulated or fictitious contract.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>Under the Torrens system, registration is the operative act which gives validity to the transfer or creates a lien upon the land. Further, entrenched in our jurisdiction is the doctrine that registration in a public registry creates constructive notice to the whole world . . .<br><br>But, there is nothing in Act No. 496, as amended by P.D. No. 1529, that imposes a period within which to register annotations of "conveyance, mortgage, lease, lien, attachment, order, judgment, instrument or entry affecting registered land". If liens were not so registered, then it "shall operate only as a contract between the parties and as evidence of authority to the Registry of Deeds to make registration". If registered, it "shall be the operative act to convey or affect the land insofar as third persons are concerned". The mere lapse of time from the execution of the mortgage document to the moment of its registration does not affect the rights of a mortgagee.<br><br>Neither will the circumstance of [G Holdings]'s foreclosure of [Maricalum Mining]'s properties on July 31, 2001, or after the [Department of Labor and Employment] had already issued a Partial Writ of Execution on May 9, 2001 against [Maricalum Mining], support the conclusion of the [Court of Appeals] that [G Holdings]'s act of foreclosing on [Maricalum Mining]'s properties was "<i>effected to prevent satisfaction of the judgment award</i>". [G Holdings]'s mortgage rights, constituted in 1992, antedated the Partial Writ of Execution by nearly ten (10) years. [G Holdings]'s resort to foreclosure was a legitimate enforcement of a right to liquidate a <i>bona fide</i> debt. It was a reasonable option open to a mortgagee which, not being a party to the labor dispute between [the National Mines and Allied Workers Union Local 103] and [Maricalum Mining], stood to suffer a loss if it did not avail itself of the remedy of foreclosure.<br><br>The well-settled rule is that a mortgage lien is inseparable from the property mortgaged. While it is true that [G Holdings]'s foreclosure of [Maricalum Mining]'s mortgaged properties may have had the "effect to prevent satisfaction of the judgment award against the specific mortgaged property that first answers for a mortgage obligation ahead of any subsequent creditors", that same foreclosure does not necessarily translate to having been "<i>effected to prevent sati faction of the judgment award</i>" against [Maricalum Mining].<br><br>. . . .<br><br>We also observe the error in the [Court of Appeals]'s finding that the 1996 Deed of Real Estate and Chattel Mortgage was not supported by any consideration since at the time the deed was executed, "<i>all the real and personal property of</i> [Maricalum Mining] <i>had already been transferred in the hands of G Holdings</i>". It should be remembered that the Purchase and Sale Agreement between [G Holdings] and [the Asset Privatization Trust] involved large amounts (P550M) and even spawned a subsequent court action (Civil Case No. 95-76132, RTC of Manila). Yet, nowhere in the Agreement or in the RTC decision is there any mention of real and personal properties of [Maricalum Mining] being included in the sale to [G Holdings] in 1992. These properties simply served as mortgaged collateral for the 1992 Promissory Notes. The Purchase and Sale Agreement and the Promissory Notes themselves are the best evidence that there was ample consideration for the mortgage.<br><br>Thus, we must reject the conclusion of the [Court of Appeals] that the Deed of Real Estate and Chattel Mortgage executed in 1996 was a simulated transaction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> (Emphasis in the original, citations omitted)<br></blockquote>In the same case, the separate and distinct personalities of Maricalum Mining and G Holdings in relation to the mortgage and transfer of the properties were also ruled on:<br><blockquote>The negotiations between the [G Holdings] and the Government through [the Asset Privatization Trust], dating back to 1992 culminating in the Purchase and Sale Agreement, cannot be depicted as a contrived transaction. In fact, in the said <i>Republic, etc. v. "G" Holdings, Inc.</i>, this Court adjudged that [G Holdings] was entitled to its rightful claims-not just to the shares of [Maricalum Mining] itself, or just to the financial notes that already contained the mortgage clauses over [Maricalum Mining's] disputed assets, but also to the delivery of those instruments. Certainly, we cannot impute to this Court's findings on the case any badge of fraud. Thus, we reject the [Court of Appeals]'s conclusion that it was right to pierce the veil of corporate fiction, because the foregoing circumstances belie such an inference. Furthermore, we cannot ascribe to the Government, or the [Asset Privatization Trust] in particular, any undue motive to participate in a transaction designed to perpetrate fraud. Accordingly, we consider the [Court of Appeals] interpretation unwarranted.<br><br>We also cannot agree that the presumption of fraud in Article 1387 of the Civil Code relative to property conveyances, when there was already a judgment rendered or a writ of attachment issued, authorizes piercing the veil of corporate identity in this case. We find that Article 1387 finds less application to an involuntary alienation such as the foreclosure of mortgage made before any final judgment of a court. We thus hold that when the alienation is involuntary, and the foreclosure is not fraudulent because the mortgage deed has been previously executed in accordance with formalities of law, and the foreclosure is resorted to in order to liquidate a <i>bona fide</i> debt, it is not the alienation by onerous title contemplated in Article 1387 of the Civil Code wherein fraud is presumed.<br><br>Since the tactual antecedents of this case do not warrant a finding that the mortgage and loan agreements between [Maricalum Mining] and [G Holdings] were simulated, then their separate personalities must be recognized. To pierce the veil of corporate fiction would require that their personalities as creditor and debtor be conjoined, resulting in a merger of the personalities of the creditor ([G Holdings]) and the debtor ([Maricalum Mining]) in one person, such that the debt of one to the other is thereby extinguished. But the debt embodied in the 1992 Financial Notes has been established, and even made subject of court litigation (Civil Case No. 95-76132, RTC Manila). This can only mean that [G Holdings] and [Maricalum Mining] have separate corporate personalities.<br><br>Neither was [Maricalum Mining] used merely as an alter ego, adjunct, or business conduit for the sole benefit of [G Holdings], to justify piercing the former's veil of corporate fiction so that the latter could be held liable to claims of third-party judgment creditors, like [the National Mines and Allied Workers Union Local 103]. In this regard, we find American jurisprudence persuasive. In a decision by the Supreme Court of New York bearing upon similar facts, the Court denied piercing the veil of corporate fiction to favor a judgment creditor who sued the parent corporation of the debtor, alleging fraudulent corporate asset-shifting effected after a prior final judgment. Under a factual background largely resembling this case at bar, <i>viz</i>.:<br><br>. . . .<br><br>This doctrine is good law under Philippine jurisdiction.<br><br>In <i>Concept Builders, Inc.v. National Labor Relations Commission</i>, we laid down the test in determining the applicability of the doctrine of piercing the veil of corporate fiction, to wit:<br><ol><li>Control, not mere majority or complete control, but complete domination, not only of finances but of policy and business practice in respect to the transaction attacked so that the corporate entity as to this transaction had at the time no separate mind, will or existence of its own.<br><br></li><li>Such control must have been used by the defendant to commit fraud, or wrong, to perpetuate the violation of a statutory or other positive legal duty, or dishonest and, unjust act in contravention of plaintiffs legal rights; and,<br><br></li><li>The aforesaid control and breach of duty must proximately cause the injury or unjust loss complained of.<br></li></ol>. . . .<br><br>Time and again, we have reiterated that mere ownership by a single stockholder or by another corporation of all or nearly all of the capital stock of a corporation is not, by itself, a sufficient ground for disregarding a separate corporate personality. It is basic that a corporation has a personality separate and distinct from that composing it as well as from that of any other legal entity to which it may be related. Clear and convincing evidence is needed to pierce the veil of corporate fiction.<br><br>In this case, the mere interlocking of directors and officers does not warrant piercing the separate corporate personalities of [Maricalum Mining] and [G Holdings]. Not only must there be a showing that there was majority or complete control, but complete domination, not only of finances but of policy and business practice in respect to the transaction attacked, so that the corporate entity as to this transaction had at the time no separate mind, will or existence of its own. The mortgage deed transaction attacked as a basis for piercing the corporate veil was a transaction that was an offshoot, a derivative, of the mortgages earlier constituted in the Promissory Notes dated October 2, 1992. But these Promissory Notes with mortgage were executed by [G Holdings] with [the Asset Privatization Trust] in the name of [Maricalum Mining], in a full privatization process. It appears that if there was any control or domination exercised over [Maricalum Mining], it was [the Asset Privatization Trust], not [G Holdings], that wielded it. Neither can we conclude that the constitution of the loan nearly four (4) years prior to [the National Mines and Allied Workers Union Local 103]'s notice of strike could have been the proximate cause of the injury of [the National Mines and Allied Workers Union Local 103] for having been deprived of [Maricalum Mining]'s corporate assets.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>However, I maintain that the application or non-application of the doctrine of piercing the corporate veil in a particular case is not a fixed and permanent ruling on the subject corporations' legal personalities. The ruling applies only to the particular instance for which that doctrine was applied. Thus, in <i>Koppel (Phils.), Inc. v. Yatco</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><blockquote>I. In its first assignment of error appellant submits that the trial court erred in not holding that it is a domestic corporation distinct and separate from and not a mere branch of Koppel Industrial Car and Equipment Company. It contends that its corporate existence as a Philippine corporation [cannot] be collaterally attacked and that the Government is estopped from so doing. As stated above, the lower court did not deny legal personality to appellant for any and all purposes, but held in effect that in the transactions involved in this case the public interest and convenience would be defeated and what would amount to tax evasion perpetrated, unless resort is had to the doctrine of "disregard of the corporate fiction." In other words, in looking through the corporate form to the ultimate person or corporation behind that form, in the particular transactions which were involved in the case submitted to its detennination and judgment, the court did so in order to prevent the contravention of the local internal revenue laws, and the perpetration of what would to a play evasion, inasmuch as it considered - and in our opinion, correctly - that appellant Koppel (Philippines) Inc. . . . as a mere branch or agency or dummy ("<i>hechura</i>") of Koppel Industrial Car and Equipment Co. <i>The court did not hold that the corporate personality of Koppel (Philippines), Inc., would also be disregarded in other cases or for other purposes. It would have had no power to so hold. The courts' action in this regard must he confined to the transactions involved in the case at bar "for the purpose of adjudging the rights and liabilities of the parties in the case. They have no jurisdiction to do more."</i> . . .<br><br>A leading and much cited case puts it as follows:<br><blockquote>"If any general rule can be laid down, in the present state of authority, it is that a corporation will be looked upon as a legal entity as a general rule, and until sufficient reason to the contrary appears, but, when the notion of legal entity is used to defeat public convenience, justify wrong, protect fraud, or defend crime, the law will regard the corporation as an association of persons."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> (Citations omitted, emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote></blockquote>Thus, while the corporate veil cannot be pierced as to the mortgage and transfer of Maricalum Mining's properties to G Holdings, the corporate veil may still be pierced for other acts in which the elements for the application of the doctrine are present.<br><br>It is my position that it cannot be said that G Holdings had no participation in the labor-only contracting arrangement with the complainants.<br><br>As the <i>ponencia</i> stated, G Holdings immediately took physical possession of Maricalum Mining's mine site and facilities, and took full control of its management and operations upon signing the Purchase and Sale Agreement and fully paying the down payment for the shares.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>It also found that G Holdings exercised absolute control over Maricalum Mining since it held 90% of its equity securities, and paid for the latter's salary expenses.

Likewise, they asserted that it was both Maricalum Mining and G Holdings that advised the employees to form the manpower cooperatives after the retrenchment program.<br><br>Moreover, as stated by the <i>ponencia</i>, the Labor Arbiter also ruled in favor of the employees on the following grounds:<br><blockquote>(a) G Holdings connived with Mar[i]calum Mining in orchestrating the formation of manpower cooperatives to circumvent the complainants' labor standards rights; (b) it is highly unlikely that complainants (except Sipalay Hospital's employees) would spontaneously form manpower cooperatives on their own and in unison without the guidance of G Holdings and Maricalum Mining; and (c) the complainants effectively became the employees of G Holdings because their work had changed from assisting in the mining and milling operations to caretaking and safeguarding the properties in the Sipalay Mining Complex which had already been acquired from Maricalum Mining. Additionally it denied the claims of complainants Nenet Arita and Domingo Lavida for lack of factual basis.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br></blockquote>G Holdings did not merely own Maricalum Mining sa holding company. It had a say in its processes and procedures. Thus, it cannot claim to be innocent. It cannot participate in the illegal disn;issal of employees and thereafter hide behind its separate corporate personality to avoid the liability arising from it.<br><br>It likewise cannot be said that no injury arose from the arrangement. While the <i>ponencia</i> found that there is no <i>monetary</i> injury to the employees, it still held that the employees were illegally dismissed. Thus, it cannot be denied that they suffered an injury, albeit not a monetary one.<br><br>The elements of control, bad faith, and injury are present in the case at bar.<br><br>Moreover, assuming that the case does not fall within the purview of fraud or alter-ego cases, the doctrine of piercing the corporate veil still applies when the separate personality of the corporation is being used to "defeat . . . public convenience as when the corporate fiction is used as a vehicle for the evasion of an existing obligation."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> Likewise, it applies when recognizing a parent company and its subsidiary as separate entities would aid in the consummation of a wrong, such as illegal dismissal and avoiding labor claims.<br><br>Labor contracts operate on a higher plane in light of the social justice provisions in the Constitution.
