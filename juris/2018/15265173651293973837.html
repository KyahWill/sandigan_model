South Cembo). After verifying the said tip, or at around five o'clock in the afternoon of May 19, 2015, the SAID-SOTG team, together with the informant and in coordination with the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> organized a buy-bust operation and thereafter, proceeded to the target area. Upon arriving thereat, the informant introduced Police Officer (PO) 3 Luisito Leif F. Marcelo (PO3 Marcelo), the designated poseur-buyer, to Magsano, who then asked PO3 Marcelo how much<em> shabu</em> he intended to buy. When PO3 Marcelo informed Magsano that he wanted to buy P500.00 worth of<em> shabu</em>, the former immediately handed over the marked money to the latter. Afterwards, Magsano took out three (3) small plastic sachets of white crystalline substance and instructed PO3 Marcelo to choose one. Accordingly, PO3 Marcelo took one sachet and after examining the same, executed the pre-arranged signal by scratching his forehead. Consequently, PO1 Mauro A. Pagulayan (PO1 Pagulayan) rushed towards the scene and performed a body search on Magsano, which search yielded two (2) more sachets of suspected<em> shabu</em> and the buy-bust money. Moments later, Magsano was taken to the barangay hall of Brgy. South Cembo, where the confiscated drugs were marked and inventoried in the presence of Barangay <em>Kagawad </em>George Achacoso.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> After the inventory, PO3 Marcelo turned over the confiscated items to PO3 Voltaire A.

Shortly after, PO3 Marcelo delivered the seized items to the Philippine National Police (PNP) Crime Laboratory, where they were received by Police Chief Inspector May Andrea A. Bonifacio (PCI Bonifacio) at 10:10 in the evening.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> In Chemistry Report No. D-551-15,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> PCI Bonifacio revealed that the specimen drugs contained the presence of<em> methamphetamine hydrochloride</em>, a dangerous drug.</p> <p> In his defense,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Magsano simply denied the charges against him, claiming that at around eight o'clock in the evening of May 19, 2015, some men suddenly barged into his house, handcuffed him, and conducted a search therein. When the search proved futile, the men took Magsano to the office of the SAID-SOTG. Subsequently, he was brought to the barangay hall of Brgy. South Cembo, where he allegedly saw for the first time the sachets of<em> shabu</em> that were supposedly recovered from him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> </p><p> During trial, Shabina Agas testified<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> in behalf of Magsano to corroborate his claims. She maintained that she was outside their house when some men arrived and asked for Magsano's whereabouts.

Case No. 15-1652, to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and to pay a fine of P500,000.00; and (<em>b</em>) in Crim. Case No. 15-1653, to suffer the penalty of imprisonment of twelve (12) years and one (1) day, as minimum, to fourteen (14) years and eight (8) months, as maximum, and to pay a fine of P300,000.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> </p><p> The RTC ruled that the prosecution proved all the essential elements of the crimes charged.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Further, it found an unbroken chain of custody in the handling of the dangerous drugs, as it was established that: (a) after seizing the drugs at the place of arrest, PO3 Marcelo marked and inventoried them at the barangay hall of Brgy. South Cembo; (b) subsequently, PO3 Marcelo turned them over to PO3 Esguerra, who prepared and signed the request for laboratory examination; (c) thereafter, PO3 Esguerra returned the seized items to PO3 Marcelo for delivery to the PNP Crime Laboratory; (d) the said items were then received by PCI Bonifacio, who confirmed the presence of <i>methamphetamine hydrochloride</i> therein; and (e) finally, PCI Bonifacio brought the items to the court for presentation as evidence. In this relation, it held that the absence of representatives from the media and the DOJ during the inventory did not render the buy-bust operation illegal, since it was shown that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized drugs was nevertheless preserved.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></p><p> Aggrieved, Magsano appealed to the CA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></p><p align="center"> <b>The CA Ruling</b> </p><p> In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> dated November 4, 2016, the CA affirmed <em>in toto</em> the conviction of Magsano. It rejected Magsano's claim that the seized drugs were not the same items presented in court as the police officers allegedly failed to put them in a separate sealed plastic container before delivery to the PNP Crime Laboratory, considering that RA 9165 and its Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) do not require the observance of such procedure. It ruled that the facts of this case do not fall squarely with the case of <em>People v. Martinez</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> as it was established that the seized drugs were properly identified from the time of their marking and inventory until their presentation in court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> </p><p> Moreover, the CA observed that the seized drugs were adequately handled before, during, and after the conduct of the laboratory examination.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Further, it declared that Magsano could no longer raise the issue with respect to the police officers' purported non-compliance with Section 21, Article II of RA 9165 on appeal, since he failed to question the same during trial. In fact, he had every opportunity to object to the exhibits and testimonies of the prosecution, yet he did not.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> He instead relied on his defense of denial, which was, however, insufficient to overcome the positive testimonies of the prosecution witnesses.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></p><p> Hence, the instant appeal.</p><p align="center"> <b>The Issue Before the Court</b> </p><p> The issue for the Court's resolution is whether or not Magsano's conviction should be upheld.</p><p align="center"> <b>The Court's Ruling</b> </p><p> The appeal is meritorious.</p><p> At the outset, it must be stressed that an appeal in criminal cases opens the entire case for review and it is the duty of the reviewing tribunal to correct, cite, and appreciate errors in the appealed judgment whether they are assigned or unassigned.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> "The appeal confers the appellate court full jurisdiction over the case and renders such court competent to examine the records, revise the judgment appealed from, increase the penalty, and cite the proper provision of the penal law."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></p><p> In this case, Magsano was charged with the crimes of illegal sale and illegal possession of dangerous drugs, respectively defined and penalized under Sections 5 and 11, Article II of RA 9165. Case law states that in every prosecution for illegal sale of dangerous drugs, the following elements must be proven with moral certainty: (<em>a</em>) the identity of the buyer and the seller, the object, and the consideration; and (<em>b</em>) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Meanwhile, to convict an accused for illegal possession of dangerous drugs, the prosecution must establish the necessary elements thereof, to wit: (<em>a</em>) the accused was in possession of an item or object identified as a prohibited drug; (<em>b</em>) such possession was not authorized by law; and (<em>c</em>) the accused freely and consciously possessed the said drug.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> </p><p> In both instances, it is equally essential that the identity of the prohibited drugs be established beyond reasonable doubt, considering that the prohibited drug itself forms an integral part of the <em>corpus delicti</em> of the crime. The prosecution has to show an unbroken chain of custody over the dangerous drugs so as to obviate any unnecessary doubts on the identity of the dangerous drugs on account of switching, "planting," or contamination of evidence. Accordingly, the prosecution must be able to account for each link of the chain of custody from the moment the illegal drugs are seized up to their presentation in court as evidence of the crime.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> </p><p> In this regard, Section 21,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Article II of RA 9165, as amended by RA 10640,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> outlines the procedure which the police officers must follow when handling the seized drugs in order to preserve their integrity and evidentiary value.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Under the said section, the apprehending team shall, among others, <b>immediately after seizure and confiscation conduct a physical inventory and photograph the seized items <u>in the presence of the accused or the person from whom the items were seized, or his representative or counsel, with an elected public official <em>AND</em> a representative from the National Prosecution Service (NPS) (which falls under the Department of Justice [[DO])<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> <i>OR </i>the media</u></b> who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy of the same, and the seized drugs must be turned over to the PNP Crime Laboratory within twenty-four (24) hours from confiscation for examination.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> In the case of <i>People v. Mendoza</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> the Court stressed that "<b><u>[w]ithout the insulating presence of the representative from the media or the [NPS/DOJ], [and] any elected public official during the seizure and marking of the [seized drugs], the evils of switching, 'planting' or contamination of the evidence</u></b> that had tainted the buy-busts conducted under the regime of [RA] 6425 (<i>Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972</i>) again reared their ugly heads as to <b><u>negate the integrity and credibility of the seizure and confiscation of the [said drugs] that were evidence herein of the<i> corpus delicti</i>, and thus adversely affected the trustworthiness of the incrimination of the accused. </u></b>Indeed, the x x x presence of such witnesses would have preserved an unbroken chain of custody."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> </p><p> The Court, however, clarified that under varied field conditions, strict compliance with the requirements of Section 21, Article II of RA 9165 may not always be possible.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> In fact, the IRR of RA 9165 - which is now crystallized into statutory law with the passage of RA 10640 - provides that the said inventory and photography may be conducted at the nearest police station or office of the apprehending team in instances of warrantless seizure, and that <b>non-compliance with the requirements of Section 21, Article II of RA 9165</b>, — <b><u>under justifiable grounds</u></b> — <b>will not render void and invalid the seizure and custody over the seized items <u>so long as the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer or team</u></b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Tersely put, the failure of the apprehending team to strictly comply with the procedure laid out in Section 21, Article II of RA 9165 does not <i>ipso facto</i> render the seizure and custody over the items as void and invalid, provided that the prosecution satisfactorily proves that: (a) there is justifiable ground for non-compliance; <b><u>and</u></b> (b) the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> In <i>People v. Almorfe</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> <b><u>the Court stressed that for the above-saving clause to apply, the prosecution must explain the reasons behind the procedural lapses, and that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized evidence had nonetheless been preserved</u></b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Also, in <i>People v. De Guzman</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> it was emphasized that <b><u>the justifiable ground for non-compliance must be proven as a fact, because the Court cannot presume what these grounds are or that they even exist</u></b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></p><p> In this case, the Court finds that the police officers committed an unjustified deviation from the prescribed chain of custody rule, thereby putting into question the integrity and evidentiary value of the items purportedly seized from Magsano.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup></p><p> An examination of the records reveals that while the inventory of the seized drugs was conducted in the presence of Magsano and an elected public official, the same was not done in the presence of a representative from the media or the DOJ. By their own account, both PO3 Marcelo and PO1 Pagulayan explicitly admitted that there were no witnesses from either the media or the DOJ during the inventory of the seized drugs: </p><blockquote> <p> <b><i>PO3 Marcelo on Cross Examination</i></b></p> <p> Q: Where did you conduct the inventory? </p> <p>A: At the barangay hall of Brgy. South Cembo, sir. </p> <p>Q: When you arrived at the barangay hall, was the barangay official already there? </p> <p>A: Not yet, sir.</p> <p> Q: How long did you have to wait? </p> <p>A: More or less ten (10) minutes, sir. </p> <p>Q: And then when the barangay official arrived, you conducted the inventory? </p> <p>Q: Yes, sir. We conducted the markings and inventory. </p> <p>Q. Was there a representative from the DOJ? </p> <p>A: None, sir. </p> <p>Q. How about a representative from the media?</p> <p> A: None, sir. <br></p><p>x x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></p> <p> <b><i>PO1 Pagulayan on Cross Examination</i></b></p> <p> Q: You did not conduct the inventory at the place of operation? </p> <p>A: Yes, sir. </p> <p>Q: You conducted it at the barangay, correct? </p> <p>A: Yes, sir. </p> <p>x x x x </p> <p>Q: And when you arrived at the barangay, was the barangay official already there?</p> <p> A: No, sir.</p> <p>Q: How long did you have to wait before the barangay official arrived?</p> <p> A: Ten (10) minutes, sir. </p> <p>Q. Was there any representative from the DOJ? </p> <p>A: None, sir. </p> <p>Q. How about any media personnel? </p> <p>A: None also, sir. </p> <p>x x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Despite such admissions, the police officers did not provide any plausible explanation as to why the presence of these required witnesses was not procured. Thus, their unjustified non-compliance with the prescribed procedure under Section 21, Article II of RA 9165 puts into question the integrity and evidentiary value of the drugs purportedly seized from the accused.</p><p> Notably, as held in <i>People v. Miranda</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> (<i>Miranda</i>), "the fact that [an accused such as Magsano in this case] raised his objections against the integrity and evidentiary value of the [dangerous] drugs seized from him only for the first time [on appeal] x x x <b><u>does not preclude</u></b> [the CA], or even this Court[,] from passing upon the same."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> This is because "[a]n appeal in criminal cases confers upon the court full jurisdiction and renders it competent to examine the record and revise the judgment appealed from."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Accordingly, "errors in an appealed judgment [of a criminal case], even if not specifically assigned, may [therefore] be corrected <i>motu propio</i> by the court if the consideration of these errors is necessary to arrive at a just resolution of the case."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> In <i>Miranda</i>, the Court explained: </p><blockquote> <p> In this case, the Court cannot simply turn a blind eye against the unjustified deviations in the chain of custody on the sole ground that the defense failed to raise such errors in detail before the trial court. Considering the nature of appeals in criminal cases as above-discussed, it is then only proper to review the said errors even if not specifically assigned. Verily, these errors, which go to the sufficiency of the evidence of the<em> corpus delicti</em> itself, would indeed affect the court's judgment in ultimately ascertaining whether or not the accused should be convicted and hence, languish in prison for possibly a significant portion of his life. In the final analysis, a conviction must prudently rest on the moral certainty that guilt has been proven beyond reasonable doubt. <b><u>Therefore, if doubt surfaces on the sufficiency of the evidence to convict, regardless that it does only at the stage of an appeal, our courts of justice should nonetheless rule in favor of the accused, lest it betray its duty to protect individual liberties within the bounds of law</u></b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> All told, the prosecution failed to provide justifiable grounds for the police officers' non-compliance with Section 21, Article II of RA 9165, as amended by RA 10640, as well as its IRR. Thus, even if the same only surfaced on appeal, reasonable doubt now persists in upholding the conviction of the accused. As the integrity and evidentiary value of the <i>corpus delicti </i>had been compromised,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Magsano's acquittal is in order.</p><p> As a final note, the Court finds it fitting to echo its recurring pronouncement in recent jurisprudence on the subject matter: </p><blockquote> <p> The Court strongly supports the campaign of the government against drug addiction and commends the efforts of our law enforcement officers against those who would inflict this malediction upon our people, especially the susceptible youth. But as demanding as this campaign may be, it cannot be more so than the compulsions of the Bill of Rights for the protection of liberty of every individual in the realm, including the basest of criminals. The Constitution covers with the mantle of its protection the innocent and the guilty alike against any manner of high-handedness from the authorities, however praiseworthy their intentions.</p> <p> Those who are supposed to enforce the law are not justified in disregarding the right of the individual in the name of order. [For indeed,] [o]rder is too high a price for the loss of liberty, x x x.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> "In this light, prosecutors are strongly reminded that they have the positive duty to prove compliance with the procedure set forth in Section 21[, Article II] of RA 9165, as amended. As such, <b>they must have the<u> initiative </u>to not only <u>acknowledge</u> but also <u>justify</u> any perceived deviations from the said procedure during the proceedings before the trial court</b>. Since compliance with this procedure is determinative of the integrity and evidentiary value of the <em>corpus delicti</em> and ultimately, the fate of the liberty of the accused, the fact that any issue regarding the same was not raised, or even threshed out in the court/s below, would not preclude the appellate court, including this Court, from fully examining the records of the case if only to ascertain whether the procedure had been completely complied with, and if not, whether justifiable reasons exist to excuse any deviation. If no such reasons exist, then it is the appellate court's bounden duty to acquit the accused, and perforce, overturn a conviction."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> </p><p> <strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the appeal is <strong>GRANTED</strong>.
