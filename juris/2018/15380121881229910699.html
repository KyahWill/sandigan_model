				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Before the Court is an administrative matter filed with the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) against respondent Judge Bill D.

No. 1096.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Further, respondent Judge Buyucan alleged that the two (2)-storey house described in the Report dated May 16, 2013 is actually owned by his brother, Gabriel Buyucan, who purchased the lot sometime in June 2008 from a certain Larry Valdez, as evidenced by a Waiver of Rights and corroborated by several affidavits.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Thereafter, in compliance with the Resolution dated October 15, 2014, Judge Flor submitted a Report dated January 20, 2015,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> submitting additional evidence and essentially refuting respondent Judge Buyucan's statements in his Letter dated December 13, 2013.

After a judicious review of the records, the Court adopts the findings in the OCA Memorandum with modification only as to the penalty recommended.<br><br>In administrative cases, the quantum of proof required is only substantial evidence, or that amount of relevant evidence which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Pertinently, as with factual findings of trial courts, credence should be accorded to the findings of the investigating judge who had the opportunity to hear witnesses and observe their demeanor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>In this case, the liability of respondent Judge Buyucan hinges on whether he is in fact illegally occupying a portion of the Subject Property. The Court finds in the affirmative.<br><br>The evidence on record is unequivocal. As summarized in the OCA Memorandum:<br><br><blockquote>To prove that Judge Buyucan illegally occupied the land reserved for the DA-CVHILROS, Executive Judge Flor submitted a Sworn Statement executed by Ernesto Bagos, Antonio M. Balut and Reynaldo G. Garcia, Jr. The affidavit states that: (1) Bagos was one of the vendors who sold his occupation of the land and its improvements to Judge Buyucan; (2) Balut was one of the carpenters who constructed the 2-storey house and was paid by Edwin Buyucan, nephew of Judge Buyucan; and (3) Garcia, Jr. was the <i>Barangay </i>Captain of Villaros who witnessed the execution of the Waiver of Rights between Bagos and Judge Buyucan. He also submitted the Affidavit dated January 29, 2009 of Ms. Celerina T. Miranda stating that Judge Buyucan is one of those who is occupying a portion of the area of DA-CVHILROS and built a rest house and cultivated portions thereof and planted pineapple, mangoes and corn. The affidavit was executed to support a Motion to Inhibit Judge Buyucan. In another affidavit, Ms. Miranda stated that Judge Buyucan up to the present is squatting on the land reserved for the DA and his acts have emboldened others to enlarge their occupations of the land to the detriment of the outreach projects of the DA-CVHILROS. It also stated that Assistant Solicitor General Hector Calilung who was providing legal assistance to the DA in 2008 had several confrontations with Judge Buyucan regarding his illegal occupation of the DA's land and that he was present during the taking of a survey questionnaire where Judge Buyucan stated that he was a transferee of the land. In addition, Executive Judge Flor in his Supplemental Report dated February 16, 2015 also points out that the land occupied by Judge Buyucan is not only the land beside the national highway where he built a native Ifugao house but also occupied about 20 to 30 meters of the DA-CVHILROS reserved land where he built his rest house.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></blockquote><br><br>In addition, respondent Judge Buyucan's claim that he was not occupying a portion of the Subject Property is plainly belied by the verification plan prepared by the DENR, which forms part of the records of this case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Proceeding therefrom, the Court so finds that respondent Judge Buyucan was indeed an illegal occupant of the Subject Property.<br><br>In any case, even assuming that respondent Judge Buyucan did not occupy a portion of the Subject Property, he is still liable due to his admission in his Letter dated December 13, 2013 that he was then occupying a portion of the RRW of the DPWH Nueva Vizcaya-Isabela National Road.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> As aptly observed in the OCA Memorandum, such act nevertheless constitutes a violation of P.O. No. 17, which makes it unlawful for any person to "usurp any portion of a right-of-way, to convert any part of any public highway, bridge, wharf or trail to his own private use or to obstruct the same in any manner, or to use any highway ditch for irrigation or other private purposes x x x."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>Aside from the foregoing, the Court also notes several other acts of respondent Judge Buyucan that renders him administratively liable.<br><br>By his own admission, respondent Judge Buyucan acquired the occupied portion of the Subject Property (subject of Civil Case No. 626, entitled "Province of Nueva Vizcaya v. Eling Valdez, et al.") in August of 2008 – <b>only a few months after dismissing Civil Case No. 626.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> As stated earlier, it bears stressing that one of the vendors in the alleged transaction was Eling Valdez, one of the respondents in Civil Case No. 626 and the accused in Criminal Case No. 4691.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>Lastly, the Court also notes that despite repeated demands from the DA, respondent Judge Buyucan refused to cease his illegal occupation of the Subject Property.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>Persons involved in the administration of justice are expected to uphold the strictest standards of honesty and integrity in the public service; their conduct must always be beyond reproach and circumscribed with the heavy burden of responsibility.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> In this regard, the Court has consistently admonished any act or omission that would violate the norm of public accountability and diminish the faith of the people in the judiciary.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>At the outset, respondent Judge Buyucan's continued illegal settlement erodes the public's confidence in its agents of justice considering that such act amounts to an arbitrary deprivation of the DA's ownership rights over the Subject Property. Even worse, his continued refusal to vacate instigated the continued illegal occupation of other informal settlers residing therein. Canon 2 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> requires that the conduct of judges must reaffirm the people's faith in the integrity of the judiciary and that their conduct must, at the least, be perceived to be above reproach in the view of a reasonable observer. Based on the foregoing acts alone, it is clear the respondent Judge Buyucan fell short of the required conduct of all members of the bench.<br><br>In the same vein, the Court faults respondent Judge Buyucan for his act of acquiring a portion of the Subject Property from a respondent in a case pending before his <i>sala. </i>His act is further aggravated by the fact that the respondent therein, Eling Valdez, received a favorable judgment just a few months before the purported sale.<br><br>Impartiality is essential to the proper discharge of the judicial office.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> Section 2 of Canon 3 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct mandates that a judge shall ensure that his conduct, both in and out of court, maintains and enhances the confidence of the public and litigants in his impartiality and that of the judiciary. In this respect, respondent Judge Buyucan's conduct incites intrigue and puts into question his impartiality in deciding the cases then pending before him. Such conduct unquestionably gives rise to the impression that he was motivated by extraneous factors in ruling on the said cases.<br><br>In <i>Agpalasin v. Agcaoili,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> the respondent Judge was found administratively liable for allowing an accused in a robbery case pending before his <i>sala </i>to pay for freight charges of his personal acquisitions. Therein, the Court held that the subsequent acquittal of the accused gave rise to the impression that the judge was swayed by other factors than the evidence on record, thereby casting doubt on the independence and integrity of the entire judiciary:<br><br><blockquote>That the accused who indulged respondent Judge's corrupt tendencies was subsequently acquitted further gives rise to suspicions that the judge was influenced by the favors the accused extended to him. It gives the impression that the judge was swayed by factors other than the evidence on record, that he arrived at the decision of acquittal other than by his own independent judgment.<br><br><b>A judge should, in pending or prospective litigation before him, be scrupulously careful to avoid such action as may reasonably tend to waken the suspicion that his social or business relations or friendships constitute an element in determining his judicial course. He must not only render a just, correct and impartial decision but should do so in such a manner as to be free from any suspicion as to his fairness, impartiality and integrity.</b> A decision which correctly applies the law and jurisprudence will nevertheless be subject to questions of impropriety when rendered by a magistrate or tribunal believed to be less than impartial and honest.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><br>Guided by the foregoing standards, the Court hereby finds respondent Judge Buyucan guilty of gross misconduct for his flagrant violation of the standard of conduct embodied in the New Judicial Code of Judicial Conduct.<br><br>Gross misconduct is classified as a grave offense under Section 8, Rule 140 of the Rules of Court, and is punishable under Section 11(A) of the same rule by: (1) dismissal from the service, forfeiture of benefits except accrued leave credits and disqualification from reinstatement or appointment to any public office; (2) suspension from office without salary or other benefits for more than three (3) months but not exceeding six (6) months; or (3) a fine of more than P20,000.00 but not exceeding P40,000.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>The interests of justice require no less than a penalty commensurate to the violations committed by the person charged. In this regard, the OCA's recommendation to penalize respondent Judge Buyucan with a six (6)-month suspension without benefits is far too light given the gravity and multiplicity of infractions committed by respondent Judge Buyucan. Such acts betray his utter lack of integrity and impartiality, both mandatory and continuing requirements, which renders him unfit to continue his service as an esteemed member of the bench. Bearing the foregoing in mind, the Court hereby imposes the penalty of dismissal from the service and forfeiture of benefits following Rule 140.<br><br>Further, the Court adopts the finding and recommendation of the OCA to order respondent Judge Buyucan to immediately vacate the Subject Property:<br><br><blockquote>[J]udge Buyucan's claim that he is not occupying the land of the DA but a portion of the road right of way of the Nueva Vizcaya-Isabela road is inconsistent with the survey map of the entire land of the DA-CVHILROS. The map shows that Judge Buyucan occupies lot 45 (in orange highlight) of parcel no. 1 located near the Nueva Vizacaya-Isabel <i>(sic)</i> national road. As pointed out by Executive Judge Flor, Judge Buyucan does not only occupy the land beside the national highway where he built his native Ifugao house but also about 20 to 30 meters of the DA-CVHILROS land. But even assuming that the land he occupies is not within the DA-CVHILROS land, his possession of a portion of the road right of way of the national highway of the DPWH is still unlawful. x x x<br><br>To prove that he legally occupies the subject land, Judge Buyucan presented the Waiver of Rights executed by Ernesto Bagos in his favor. However, the said land transferred to him is within the land owned by the DA-CVHILROS which has been the subject of a controversy between the DA and the occupants of the land which was brought to his court for adjudication. Hence, Judge Buyucan's rights over the land are still questionable as the DA has yet to take appropriate action against him and claimants of the land.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup></blockquote><br><br>The Court takes note of the undisputed fact that respondent Judge Buyucan is occupying public land. Thus, while respondent Judge Buyucan denies the DA's ownership, he nevertheless admitted on record he is encroaching on what he claims to be the RRW of the DPWH beside the Nueva Vizcaya-Isabela National Road.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> In this regard, the Court, which is vested with disciplinary authority over its officers, finds that respondent Judge Buyucan must likewise be ordered to immediately vacate the Subject Property.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the foregoing considered, Judge Bill D. Buyucan of the Municipal Circuit Trial Court, Bagabag-Diadi, Nueva Vizcaya, is hereby found <b>GUILTY</b> of Gross Misconduct for violating the New Code of Judicial Conduct and is hereby <b>DISMISSED</b> from the service, with <b>FORFEITURE OF ALL BENEFITS,</b> except accrued leave credits.
