SP No. 133482, finding that Union School illegally dismissed respondent Charley Jane Dagdag (Dagdag) from her employment.<p align="center"> <b>Facts of the Case</b> </p><p> Dagdag was employed as an Elementary School Teacher on a probationary status by Union School from July 16, 2012 to May 31, 2013. During her employment, or on November 23, 2012, she found out that she was eight weeks and five days pregnant. Soon thereafter, Dagdag informed Mandapat of her pregnancy and that the father of the child was marrying another woman. As Dagdag was single, the matter of being charged with gross immorality and Dagdag's resignation was discussed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></p><p> On December 3, 2012, Dagdag did not report for work without informing the school earlier of her absence. She was then suspended for four days for abandonment of work. In addition, a suspension of one day was likewise imposed as this was her second offense of absence without official leave.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></p><p> On December 12, 2012, Dagdag received a copy of a notice addressed to the members of the Grievance Committee to attend to a Teacher's Disciplinary Committee on December 14, 2012 regarding the disciplinary action against her for gross immorality. The notice indicated that she was advised to nominate her representative from the current full-time staff of the school. For her failure to attend the same, however, the hearing was rescheduled on December 17, 2012.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></p><p> During the hearing, Dagdag acknowledged the contents of the school's Faculty and Staff Handbook, which includes the offense on gross immorality and the Professional Code of Ethics for Teachers. She was apprised of the possible consequences if she will be dismissed from service as it might affect her next job application as compared to resigning which, petitioners thought, was a better option. Dagdag then agreed to resign. The Minutes of the hearing also stated that she consulted her mother and relatives and that she was accepting dismissal as a disciplinary action but she will wait for the decision of the school.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></p><p> On the same date, Dagdag filed a complaint against petitioners for illegal dismissal, non-payment of salaries and benefits, moral and exemplary damages, and attorney's fees.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></p><p> Meanwhile, prior to the scheduled mandatory conference, Dagdag received a Memorandum dated December 19, 2012 from petitioners regarding her alleged violations discussed during the grievance committee meeting. Dagdag was required to submit her explanation on why she should not be dismissed. For her failure to submit the required written explanation, however, the grievance committee recommended her termination from the service.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></p><p> For its part, Union School denied the accusations of Dagdag and maintained that they did not suspend, transfer, demote, or prevent Dagdag from performing her work as a result of her pregnancy out of wedlock.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></p><p> On June 7, 2013, the Labor Arbiter (LA) issued its Decision,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> wherein it found that Dagdag was illegally dismissed from employment. The LA maintained that Union School committed acts of persecution, discrimination, insensitivity and disdain when Dagdag was coerced into resigning from her job after having admitted to Mandapat that she was pregnant out of wedlock with no intentions of getting married to the father of her child as he had already married another woman. The<em> fallo</em> of the Decision, reads: </p><blockquote> <p> <strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, premises duly considered, judgment is hereby rendered finding [Dagdag] constructively dismissed.</p> <p> [Union School] and [Mandapat] shall pay [Dagdag] jointly and severally the following:</p> <ol start="" type="a"><li> Backwages inclusive of all benefits and allowances amounting to P59,627.50;</li><li>Moral damages amounting to P50,000.00; </li><li> Exemplary damages amounting [to] P30,000.00; and</li><li> Attorney's fees amounting to P5,962.75.</li></ol> <p> All other claims are dismissed for lack of basis. </p> <p> SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> On appeal, the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) issued its Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> dated September 13, 2013, wherein it vacated the decision of the LA and dismissed the complaint for illegal dismissal and money claims of Dagdag for lack of merit.</p><p> In reversing the Decision of the LA, the NLRC held that there was no evidence that Dagdag was ever subjected to persecution or contempt after she reported her pregnancy; hence, she failed to prove by substantial evidence that she was constructively dismissed. The dispositive portion of the Decision, reads: </p><blockquote> <p> <strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the appeal is hereby declared with merit. The assailed decision is hereby <strong>VACATED</strong> and the case dismissed for lack of merit.</p> <p> [Union School] however is hereby oredered to pay [Dagdag's] salary corresponding to the period December 1-17, 2012 and 13<sup>th</sup> month pay in the amount of P10,370.00.</p> <p> <strong>SO ORDERED.</strong><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Aggrieved, the matter was elevated to the CA<em> via</em> a Petition for <em>Certiorari</em> under Rule 65. </p><p> In its Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> dated November 10, 2016, the CA annulled and set aside the ruling of the NLRC. The CA maintained that Dagdag was illegally dismissed from service as the minutes of the grievance meeting disclosed that she was only given two options â€” to resign or to be dismissed from service, upon Union School's finding of her pregnancy out of wedlock. As such, the CA held that it constituted a violation under Article 135<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> of the Labor Code which prohibits the employer to discharge a woman employee on account of her pregnancy, to wit: </p><blockquote> <p> <strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the petition is GRANTED. The decision of the [NLRC] dated September 30, 2013, and resolution dated October 30, 2013 in NLRC LAC No. 07-002158-13 (NLRC RAB CAR Case No. 12-0314-12) are ANNULLED and SET ASIDE.</p> <p> [Union School] is declared to have committed illegal dismissal and is ORDERED to pay [Dagdag] the following: (a) separation pay in lieu of actual reinstatement equivalent to one (1) month pay for every year of service, with a fraction of at least six (6) months considered as one (1) whole year from the date of her dismissal on December 17, 2012 up to the finality of this decision; (b) full backwages from the time of her illegal dismissal up to the finality of this decision; and (c) attorney's fees equivalent to ten percent (10%) of the total monetary award. The monetary awards herein granted shall earn legal interest at the rate of six percent (6%) <em>per annum</em> from the date of the finality of this decision until fully paid. The case is REMANDED to the [LA] for computation of [Dagdag's] monetary awards.</p> <p> SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> A Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> was filed by the petitioners but it was subsequently denied in a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> dated May 17, 2017.</p><p> Hence, the instant petition.</p><p align="center"> <b>Ruling of the Court</b> </p><p> The petition is without merit.</p><p> "[Constructive dismissal [is] a cessation of work because continued employment is rendered impossible, unreasonable or unlikely; when there is a demotion in rank or diminution in pay or both; or when a clear discrimination, insensibility, or disdain by an employer becomes unbearable to the employee."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> "The test of constructive dismissal is whether a reasonable person in the employee's position would have felt compelled to give up his employment/position under the circumstances."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></p><p> As aptly observed by the CA, Mandapat's act of suggesting that Dagdag should simply tender her resignation, as the school may impose harsher penalties, left Dagdag with no choice but to discontinue working for Union School. Also, the CA noted that although there was a conduct of grievance meeting, its outcome was already predetermined as petitioners were already resolute in their decision to terminate Dagdag's employment. This is evident by the fact that Dagdag was left with two choicesâ€”resignation or dismissal and threatening her with possible revocation of her teaching license.</p><p> Indeed, Dagdag agreed to resign because her actuation was perceived by petitioners as a ground for the revocation of her license as a teacher. Such license serves as a permit for Dagdag to secure an employment and find a means of livelihood.</p><p> Be that as it may, it appears that the grievance committee finally voted on Dagdag's dismissal, per minutes of the meeting.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Said committee made a conclusion that Dagdag committed gross immorality in violation of the school rules and the Code of Ethics for Professional Teachers.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></p><p> To determine whether a conduct is disgraceful or immoral, a consideration of the totality of the circumstances surrounding the conduct; and an assessment of the said circumstances <i>vis-a-vis</i> the prevailing norms of conduct, <i>i.e</i>., what the society generally considers moral and respectable, are necessary.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></p><p> In the case of <i>Capin-Cadiz v. Brent Hospital and Colleges, Inc.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> it is held that: </p><blockquote> <p> Jurisprudence has already set the standard of morality with which an act should be gauged â€” it is public and secular, not religious. Whether a conduct is considered disgraceful or immoral should be made in accordance with the prevailing norms of conduct, which, as stated in <i>Leus</i>, refer to those conducts which are proscribed because they are detrimental to conditions upon which depend the existence and progress of human society. The fact that a particular act does not conform to the traditional moral views of a certain sectarian institution is not sufficient reason to qualify such act as immoral unless it, likewise, does not conform to public and secular standards. More importantly, there must be substantial evidence to establish that premarital sexual relations and pregnancy out of wedlock is considered disgraceful or immoral.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> (Citations and emphasis in the original omitted)</p> </blockquote> <p> The totality of evidence in this case does not justify the dismissal of Dagdag from her employment considering that there was no legal impediment to marry between Dagdag and the father of her child at the time of the conception. To reiterate the ruling of this Court in <i>Leus and Capin-Cadiz</i>, pregnancy of a school teacher out of wedlock is not a just cause for termination of an employment absent any showing that the pre-marital sexual relations and, consequently, pregnancy out of wedlock, are indeed considered disgraceful or immoral. </p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>.

I submit this Opinion to show that (I) considering jurisprudential precedents and Filipino tradition, it is high time this Court recognize this liberty interest as a <b>fundamental</b> right entitled to State protection. Thus, pregnancy of an employee out of wedlock cannot constitute just cause for termination from employment absent any showing that the pregnancy was contracted under grossly immoral circumstances; and (II) a contrary ruling would violate the constitutional guarantee of equal protection of the law and result in an unwarranted difference in treatment of men and women under like circumstances.</p><p align="center"> I </p><p> Our Constitution guarantees that no person shall be deprived of liberty without due process of law. Liberty, in turn, has been generally defined by this Court as the freedom to do those things which are ordinarily done by free men.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Traditionally, the exercise of liberty interests is protected from arbitrary government interference. Where the government is able to show a rational relation between its action and a legitimate governmental interest, judicial attitude toward the challenged state action is deferential and government intrusions into liberty interests are generally upheld.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> This deference, however, stops when the governmental act infringes on a fundamental right. In such cases, the Court requires "a stricter and more exacting adherence to constitutional limitations. Rational basis should not suffice."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></p><p align="center"> A </p><p> An unmarried woman has a liberty interest to engage in consensual sexual relations with an unmarried man and bear a child with him as a result of said relations. I submit that it is high time that the Court recognize this liberty interest as "fundamental," as to require a higher burden of proof to justify its intrusion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></p><p> In this jurisdiction, fundamental rights have been deemed to include only those basic liberties explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the Bill of Rights of the Constitution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Admittedly, there is nothing in our Bill of Rights which explicitly guarantees a right in favor of an unmarried woman to engage in consensual sexual relations with an unmarried man, and thereafter bear a child with him. Precedential decisions of this Court, however, support the recognition of the fundamental nature of this liberty interest.</p><p> A general right to personal privacy is recognized in the United States, with its Supreme Court declaring that liberties extend to "certain personal choices central to individual dignity and autonomy x x x"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> The right to privacy was first expressly recognized in the 1965 case of <i>Griswold v. Connecticut</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> where the US Supreme Court upheld a privacy right to use contraceptives in favor of married couples. (Later on, a similar right in favor of unmarried individuals would be recognized in the case of <i>Eisenstadt v. Baird</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>)</p><p> In this jurisdiction, the constitutional right to <i>personal</i> privacy was first explicitly acknowledged in 1968<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> when the Court, in <i>Morfe v. Mutuc</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> adopted the ruling in <i>Griswold</i>, declaring thus: </p><blockquote> <p> x x x The due process question touching on an alleged deprivation of liberty as thus resolved goes a long way in disposing of the objections raised by plaintiff that the provision on the periodical submission of a sworn statement of assets and liabilities is violative of the constitutional right to privacy. There is much to be said for this view of Justice Douglas: "Liberty in the constitutional sense must mean more than freedom from unlawful governmental restraint; it must include privacy as well, if it is to be a repository of freedom. The right to be let alone is indeed the beginning of all freedom." As a matter of fact, this right to be let alone is, to quote from Mr. Justice Brandeis "the most comprehensive of rights and the right most valued by civilized men."</p> <p> <b>The concept of liberty would be emasculated if it does not likewise compel respect for his personality as a unique individual whose claim to privacy and interference demands respect. x x x</b></p> </blockquote> <p align="center"> x x x x </p><blockquote> <p> The <i>Griswold</i> case invalidated a Connecticut statute which made the use of contraceptives a criminal offense on the ground of its amounting to an unconstitutional invasion of the right of privacy of married persons; rightfully it stressed "a relationship lying within the zone of privacy created by several fundamental constitutional guarantees." It has wider implications though. <b>The constitutional right to privacy has come into its own.</b></p> <p> So it is likewise in our jurisdiction. <b>The right to privacy as such is accorded recognition independently of its identification with liberty; in itself, it is fully deserving of constitutional protection. </b>x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> (Emphasis supplied; citations omitted.)</p> </blockquote> <p> On the other hand, in <i>Leus v. St. Scholastica 's College Westgrove</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> this Court has held that the fact that an unmarried female employee gives birth out of wedlock does not give cause for administrative sanction for disgraceful and immoral conduct under the 1992 Manual of Regulations for Private Schools (1992 MRPS)<em> if</em><i> the father of her child is himself unmarried</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> The Court said: </p><blockquote> <p> x x x It may be a not-so-ideal situation and may cause complications for both mother and child but it does not give cause for administrative sanction. There is no law which penalizes an unmarried mother under those circumstances by reason of her sexual conduct or proscribes the consensual sexual activity between two unmarried persons. Neither does the situation contravene any fundamental state policy as expressed in the Constitution, a document that accommodates various belief systems irrespective of dogmatic origins.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> (Emphasis omitted.)</p> </blockquote> <p> This ruling was subsequently affirmed in <i>Capin-Cadiz v. Brent Hospital and Colleges, Inc</i>.,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> which involved a suit questioning Brent Hospital's act of putting an unwed, pregnant employee on suspension until she marries her child's father in accordance with law. In ruling in favor of the female employee, the Court in <i>Cadiz</i> recognized a woman's <b>inherent, intangible and inalienable right to choose her status</b>, that is, to choose freely a spouse and to enter into marriage only with her free and full consent.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> In my Concurring Opinion in <i>Cadiz</i>, I first ventured that this freedom to choose also includes the freedom to decide whether she will bear and rear her child without the benefit of marriage.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></p><p> More recently, the fundamental right to marry was again recognized in <i>Republic v. Manalo</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> where this Court upheld a liberty interest on the part of a Filipino spouse to be re-capacitated to marry, in cases where a valid foreign divorce has been obtained.</p><p> I submit that the foregoing jurisprudential holdings recognizing fundamental rights to marriage and privacy <i>can and should</i> extend to include a right on the part of an unmarried woman to engage in consensual sexual relations with an <i>unmarried</i> man and bear a child with him as a result. As I explained in my Concurring Opinion in <i>Cadiz</i>: </p><blockquote> <p> x x x [T]he rights to personal liberty and privacy are embodied in the Due Process Clause and expounded by jurisprudence. <b>These rights pertain to the freedom to make personal choices that define a human being's life and personhood. The decision to marry and to whom are two of the most important choices that a woman can make in her life.</b> In the words of the US Supreme Court in <em>Obergefell</em> "[n]o union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family. In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than once they were." <b>The State has no business interfering with this choice. Neither can it sanction any undue burden of the right to make these choices.</b> Brent, in conditioning Christine Joy's reinstatement on her marriage, has effectively burdened her freedom. She was forced to choose to lose her job or marry in order to keep it. By invoking the MRPS and the Labor Code, Brent is, in effect, saying that this kind of compelled choice is sanctioned by the State. Contrary to this position, the State cannot countenance placing a woman employee in a situation where she will have to give up one right (the right to marry as a component of personal liberty and privacy) for another (the right to employment). This is not the kind of State that we are in. Nor is it the kind of values that our Constitution stands for. </p> </blockquote> <p align="center"> x x x x </p><blockquote> <p> <b>Christine Joy has the right to decide how she will rear her child. If this choice involves being a single mother for now or for good, no law or government issuance may be used to interfere with this decision. Christine Joy, and all other women similarly situated, should find refuge in the protection extended by the Constitution.</b> </p> <p> <b>The Constitution highlights the value of the family as the foundation of the nation. Complementary to this, the Family Code of the Philippines provides that marriage is the foundation of the family. Indeed, our laws and tradition recognize that children are usually reared and families built within the confines of marriage. The Constitution and the laws, however, merely express an ideal. While marriage is the ideal starting point of a family, there is no constitutional or statutory provision limiting the definition of a family or preventing any attempt to deviate from our traditional template of what a family should be.</b> </p> <p> In other jurisdictions, there is a growing clamor for laws to be readjusted to suit the needs of a rising class of womenâ€”single mothers by choice. These countries are faced with the same predicament that Brent confronted in this case â€” their rules have lagged behind the demands of the times. Nevertheless, in our jurisdiction, the Constitution remains as the guide to ascertain how new situations are to be dealt with. In Christine Joy's case, <b>the Constitution tells us that her right to personal liberty and privacy protects her choice as to whether she will raise her child in a marriage. Brent, in dismissing Christine Joy because of her pregnancy outside of wedlock, unduly burdened her right to choose. </b>Again, the MRPS and the Labor Code cannot be used to justify Brent's acts. These government issuances respect the Constitution and abide by it. Any contrary interpretation cannot be countenanced. </p> <p> In my proposed reading of the constitutional right to personal liberty and privacy, Christine Joy and other women similarly situated are free to be single mothers by choice. <b>This cannot be curtailed in the workplace through discriminatory policies against pregnancy out of wedlock.</b> The Constitution allows women in this country to design the course of their own lives.

And it concerns a law which, in forbidding the use of contraceptives, rather than regulating their manufacture or sale, seeks to achieve its goals by means having a maximum destructive impact upon that relationship. Such a law cannot stand in light of the familiar principle, so often applied by this Court, that a "governmental purpose to control or prevent activities constitutionally subject to state regulation may not be achieved by means which sweep unnecessarily broadly and thereby invade the area of protected freedoms." x x x Would we allow the police to search the sacred precincts of marital bedrooms for telltale signs of the use of contraceptives?

It is true that in <i>Griswold</i> the right of privacy in question inhered in the marital relationship. Yet the marital couple is not an independent entity with a mind and heart of its own, but an association of two individuals each with a separate intellectual and emotional makeup. If the right of privacy means anything, it is the right of the individual, married or single to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child. x x x </p> <p> On the other hand, if <i>Griswold</i> is no bar to a prohibition on the distribution of contraceptives, the State could not, consistently with the Equal Protection Clause, outlaw distribution to unmarried, but not to married, persons. In each case, the evil, as perceived by the State, would be identical, and the under inclusion would be invidious. xxx (Citations omitted.)</p> <p> See also <i>Roe v.
