Respondent invokes that services rendered by VAT-registered persons to persons engaged in international air transport operations is subject to zero percent (0%) rate, pursuant to Section 108 of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) of 1997, as amended.</p> <p> To reiterate, it is not enough for respondent to invoke Section 108 of the NIRC of 1997, as amended. Respondent has likewise the burden to show compliance with the invoicing requirements laid down in Section 113 of the NIRC of 1997, as amended, to be entitled to zero rating. Needless to say, unless appropriately refuted, tax assessments by tax examiners are presumed correct and made in good faith.</p> <p> In fine, the issue of compliance with Section 113 of the NIRC of 1997, as amended, is vital in the disposition of the present controversy which the Court should consider, lest an indispensable requirement for the availment of VAT zero-rating is blatantly ignored.</p> <p> For all the foregoing, I VOTE to grant petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration and UPHOLD the VAT assessment."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> Hence, this petition with CIR adopting Justice Del Rosario's dissent and that Euro-Phil had to comply with the invoicing requirements to be entitled to zero rating of VAT.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> CIR also takes exception to the doctrine of "issues cannot be raised the first time on appeal." </p><p align="center"> The Issues </p><ol><li> Whether or not the issue of non-compliance of the invoicing requirements by Euro-Phil must be recognized despite being raised only on appeal; and <br><br> </li><li> Whether or not the Court of Tax Appeals <em>En Banc</em> erred in finding that the transaction sale made by respondent is entitled to the benefit of zero-rated VAT despite its failure to comply with invoicing requirements as mandated by law. </li></ol> <p align="center"> <b>Our Ruling</b> </p><p> The petition is denied. </p><table width="50%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><b>The CTA <i>En Banc</i> did not commit any reversible error.</b> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>Euro-Phil contends that CIR raised new matters in its Petition for Review with the CTA <em>En Banc</em> and does it again in this Petition for Review which should not be allowed by this Court. </p><p> We agree. </p><p> In the case of <i>Aguinaldo Industries Corporation (Fishing Nets Division) vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue and the Court of Tax Appeals</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> this doctrine was explained by this Court as follows: </p><blockquote> <p> To allow a litigant to assume a different posture when he comes before the court and challenge the position he had accepted at the administrative level would be to sanction a procedure whereby the court – which is supposed to review administrative determinations would not review, but determine and decide for the first time, a question not raised at the administrative forum. This cannot be permitted, for the same reason that underlies the requirement of prior exhaustion of administrative remedies to give administrative authorities the prior opportunity to decide controversies within its competence, and in much the same way that, on the judicial level, issues not raised in the lower court cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> Here, it is not disputed that CIR raised the issue that the alleged failure to present VAT official receipts with the imprinted words "zero rated" adopting the dissent of Justice Del Rosario, only at the latter stage of the appeal on Motion for Reconsideration of the CTA <em>En Banc</em>'s decision. Accordingly, with the doctrine that issues may not be raised for the first time on appeal, CIR should not be allowed by this Court to raise this matter. </p><p> Moreover, while the issue arose from the dissent of Justice Del Rosario, the law is clear on the matter. Section 108 of the NIRC of 1997 imposes zero percent (0%) value-added tax on services performed in the Philippines by VAT-registered persons to persons engaged in international air transport operations, as it thus provides: </p><blockquote> <p> <b>Section 108. Value-added Tax on Sale of Services and Use or Lease of Properties. –</b></p> <p> (A) x x x x </p> <p>(B) <b>T<i>ransactions Subject to Zero Percent (0%) Rate</i> -<u> The following services performed in the Philippines by VAT- registered persons shall be subject to zero percent (0%) rate.</u></b> </p> <p> (1) x x x x </p> <p> x x x x </p> <p>(4) <b><u>Services rendered to persons engaged in</u></b> international shipping or <b><u>International air-transport operations</u></b>, including leases of property for use thereof; </p> <p> x x x x</p> </blockquote> <p> Here, there is no dispute that Euro-Phil is VAT registered. Next, it is also not disputed that the services rendered by Euro-Phil was to a person engaged in international air-transport operations. Thus, by application, Section 108 of the NIRC of 1997 subjects the services of Euro-Phil to British Airways PLC, to the rate of zero percent VAT. </p><p> While CIR contends that the dissenting opinion of Justice del Rosario that Euro-Phil's failure to present and offer any proof to show that it has complied with the invoicing requirements, deems its sale of services to British Airways PLC subject to 12% VAT, it does not negate the established fact that British Airways PLC is engaged in international air-transport operations.</p><p> Moreover, as dictated by Section 113 of the NIRC of 1997, on the said provisions on the "Consequences of Issuing Erroneous VAT Invoice of VAT Official Receipt,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> nowhere therein is a presumption created by law that the non-imprintment of the word "zero rated" deems the transaction subject to 12 % VAT. In addition, Section 4. 113-4 of Revenue Regulations 16-2005,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Consolidated Value-Added Tax Regulations of 2005, also does not state that the non-imprintment of the word "zero rated" deems the transaction subject to 12 %VAT. Thus, in this case, failure to comply with invoicing requirements as mandated by law does not deem the transaction subject to 12% VAT. </p><p> In view of the foregoing considerations, the Court finds that the CTA <em>En Banc</em> did not commit any reversible error. </p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition for Review is <b>DENIED</b>.

The CIR asserts that since respondent failed to print the word "zero-rated" in its VAT official receipts, the subject transaction cannot be considered as zero-rated. In support of this argument, the CIR alludes to the case of Kepco Philippines Corporation v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> (Kepco) and other VAT refund cases,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> where the Court has consistently ruled that the failure to print the word "zero-rated" on the invoices or receipts is fatal to a claim for refund or credit of input VAT on zero-rated sales. The CIR, adopting the dissenting opinion of Presiding Justice Roman G. Del Rosario, posits that the strict compliance with the invoicing requirement in refund cases should also be applied in this case. </p> <p> However, I find the ruling in Kepco and other relevant VAT refund cases on the strict compliance with invoicing requirement inapplicable to the instant case.</p><p> In <i>Panasonic Communications Imaging Corp. of the Philippines v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> involving a claim for refund of input VAT attributable to zero-rated sales, the Court explained that the requirement of printing the word "zero-rated" on the invoice or receipt "is reasonable and is in accord with the efficient collection of VAT from the covered sales of goods and services. x x x [T]he appearance of the word "zero-rated" on the face of invoices covering zero-rated sales prevents buyers from falsely claiming input VAT from their purchases when no VAT was actually paid. If, absent such word, a successful claim for input VAT is made, the government would be refunding money it did not collect."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> In other words, the ratio for requiring the printing of the word "zero-rated" was essentially to protect the government from refunding a tax it did not actually collect; thus, unjustly enriching the taxpayer at the expense of the government.</p><p> However, the "evil" of refunding taxes not actually paid is not present in this case. Here, respondent is not claiming for a refund of its unutilized input VAT attributable to its zero-rated sales. On the contrary, respondent is being assessed by the government for deficiency VAT on transactions which, under the NIRC of 1997, as amended, and as sufficiently proven by respondent, are clearly subject to 0% VAT rate. Thus, to apply the strict compliance rule in this case is tantamount to allowing the government to collect taxes not authorized by law. Upholding the deficiency VAT assessment against respondent simply because the word "zero-rated" does not appear on the VAT official receipts will only result in the government effectively enriching itself at the expense of the taxpayer – the very evil which the strict compliance rule seeks to prevent in the first place.</p><p> Verily, in light of the foregoing considerations, I concur with the denial of the CIR's petition and affirmance of the decision and resolution of the CTA <em>En Banc</em> cancelling the deficiency VAT assessment issued against respondent. <br><br></p><p> </p><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="noshade" align="LEFT"> <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 656 Phil. 68, 85-86 (2011). <p> <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <i>Kepco Philippines Corporation v.
