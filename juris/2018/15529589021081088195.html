				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This administrative case stemmed from a complaint<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated September 1, 2012 filed by Spouses Julian T. Balbin (Julian) and Dolores E. Balbin (Dolores; collectively, complainants) before the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) against respondent Atty. Mariano B.

To secure the loan, the latter's Manager, Charles M. Guianan (Charles), asked them to affix their signatures on two (2) blank documents, specifically a Deed of Real Estate Mortgage<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> and a Promissory Note,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> both dated January 24, 2003 (subject documents). Respondent notarized the subject documents on January 29, 2003.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> When complainants failed to pay the loan, RLC foreclosed the mortgage.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Aggrieved, they filed a case before the Regional Trial Court of Legazpi City, Branch 4 (RTC) for the annulment of the subject documents, claiming that they were made to sign the two (2) blank documents as security for the loan but they never received the loan proceeds.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> However, in a Joint Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> dated July 6, 2009, the RTC dismissed the case for failure of the complainants to substantiate their allegations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> While the civil case was pending on appeal,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> complainants filed the present administrative case against respondent, faulting him for notarizing the subject documents without Dolores' presence, which he admitted in open court before the RTC, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Atty.

As such, he should be held administratively liable for his professional indiscretion. Notaries Public have been repeatedly reminded that they must be mindful of the significance of the notarial act when performing their duties. Notarization is not an empty, meaningless, or routinary act.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Rather, it converts a private document into a public one and renders it admissible in court without further proof of its authenticity. A notarial document is by law entitled to full faith and credit upon its face and, for this reason, notaries public are mandated to observe with the utmost care the basic requirements in the performance of their duties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> In this light, lawyers commissioned as notaries public have been reminded that compliance with the Notarial Law is in line with their solemn oath under the CPR to obey the laws and to do no falsehood or consent to the doing of any.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>As regards the penalty to be imposed, recent jurisprudence shows that when a document is notarized despite the non-appearance of a party or an affiant before the notary public, the Court generally imposes the following penalties upon the latter: <i>(a) </i>immediate revocation of his notarial commission, if still existing; <i>(b) </i>disqualification from being appointed as a notary public for a period of two (2) years; and <i>(c) </i>suspension from the practice of law – the terms of which vary based on the circumstances of each case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> In <i>Ferguson v.

Real,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> the suspensions imposed were for a period of one (1) year.<br><br>Here, the Court finds that suspension from the practice of law for six (6) months would suffice, considering respondent's prompt admission of his error, his expression of sincere apology for his carelessness, the fact that he is already in the twilight years of his life, and complainants' admission that Dolores placed her signatures on the subject documents, thereby raising no dispute on the due execution thereof.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>Finally, the Court agrees with the IBP that respondent was not disqualified from notarizing the subject documents by the mere fact that he subsequently became counsel of RLC, which was one of the signatories thereon. No such prohibition appears in both the Notarial Law and its present iteration.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE, </b>the Court finds respondent Atty. Mariano B.
