Doromal (Doromal), the owner and administrator of St. Martha's Day Care Center and Tutorial Center, Inc. (St. Martha's), went to the Davao Office of the Bureau of Immigration to inquire about its letter requiring her school to obtain an accreditation to admit foreign students. There, she met Regalado, who told her that she needed to pay P50,000.00 as "processing fee" for the accreditation. Doromal commented that the amount was prohibitive. Regalado responded that she could reduce the amount.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Citing a copy of Office Memorandum Order No. RBR 00-57 of the Bureau of Immigration, Regalado claimed that "the head office of the Bureau of Immigration, through the Immigration Regulation Division, ha[d] the authority to allow the accreditation at a lower amount, depending on her recommendation."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>In January 2007, St. Martha's Assistant Headmaster, Syren T.

Doromal responded by saying that the school was ready for inspection, but not to pay P50,000.00 as accreditation fee. Regalado persuaded Doromal to pay P50,000.00 directly to her by claiming that the cost of the inspection could soar as high as P100,000.00 if it were to be don:e instead by officers coming from the Bureau of Immigration's Manila Office, as Doromal would still have to spend for the inspectors' plane fares, billeting at the Marco Polo Hotel, and a special dinner on top of the P50,000.00 "honorarium."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>&nbsp; Regalado insisted on how paying just P50,000.00 directly to her would benefit Doromal.

Doromal replied that she did not mind re-applying, as long she would be relieved of having to pay P50,000.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>On April 10, 2007, Regalado sent Doromal a text message asking to meet "so that the amount being asked may be reduced."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>On May 3, 2007, Regalado sent Doromal another text message encouraging her to pursue the accreditation as Regalado allegedly managed to reduce the accreditation fee to P10,000.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>On May 21, 2007, Regalado came to inspect St. Martha's. When Regalado had finished, Doromal asked if it was possible to pay the P10,000.00 by check but Regalado insisted on payment by cash. She also reminded Doromal that she would also have to pay "honorarium." Doromal inquired how much it was. Regalado responded, <i>"[I]kaw na bahala, ayaw ko na talaga i-mention yan baka umatras ka pa.</i>"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>&nbsp; Regalado further instructed Doromal to come to her office on May 23, 2007 with the cash enclosed in an unmarked brown envelope and to say that it contained "additional documents," if anyone were to inquire about its contents.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Doromal could not personally come to Regalado's office on May 23, 2007 as she had to leave for the United States, so Diaz went in Doromal's stead.

Diaz asked how much the honorarium should be. Regalado replied that it should be at least P30,000.00. Diaz asked what the P30,000.00 was for. Regalado retorted, "It will go to my boss along with your accreditation papers and endorsement letter . . . <i>Ganyan ang system dito pag magprocess, actually na lower na nga ang amount because the inspectors are not from Manila, you will not book them at the Marco Polo Hotel, you will no longer entertain them, it's cheaper."</i><i> </i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><i>&nbsp;</i> Diaz asked, "Is this under the table ma'am?"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Regalado brazenly replied, "Yes, my dear, that's the system ng government."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Diaz lamented, "So sad to know that."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Regalado scoffed, <i>"Ganito ang system, ano ako magmamalinis</i>?"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Diaz and Tautho underscored that the transaction was illegal and asked what would happen if someone were to pry around.

She then directed them to pay the accreditation fee of P10,000.00 with the cashier. After payment, Regalado demanded that they surrender to her: the official receipt. Before leaving, Regalado asked Diaz about her companion. Upon finding out that Tautho was a teacher at St. Martha's, Regalado remarked, <i>"Ah at least safe tayo, mahirap na baka magsumbong."</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>On May 24, 2007, Regalado called Diaz, asking if she had cleared with Doromal the payment of P30,000.00 and emphasized that it was for her boss.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>On May 29, 2007, Doromal, Diaz, and Tautho filed with the Office of the Ombudsman for Mindanao a Complaint against Regalado.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Thus, an administrative case was filed for Grave Misconduct, penalized by Rule IV, Section 52(A)(3) of Civil Service Commission Resolution No. 991936,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> and for violation of Section 7(d) of Republic Act No. 6713.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>In her defense, Regalado denied ever extorting money from Doromal, Diaz, and Tautho, claiming they were merely in league with "people who ha[d] a grudge against her."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> She admitted asking for P50,000.00 but cited that per Office Memorandum Order No. RBR 00-57, this was the amount properly due from a school accredited to admit foreign students.

Public office is a public trust. Public officers and employees must at all times be accountable to the people, serve them with utmost responsibility, integrity, loyalty, and efficiency, act with patriotism and justice, and lead modest lives.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> </blockquote><br><br>The fundamental notion that one's tenure in government springs exclusively from the trust reposed by the public means that continuance in office is contingent upon the extent to which one is able to maintain that trust. As Chief Justice Enrique Fernando eloquently wrote in his concurrence in <i> Pineda v. Claudio:</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br><blockquote>[W]e must keep in mind that the Article on the Civil Service, like other provisions of the Constitution, was inserted primarily to assure a government, both efficient and adequate to fulfill the ends for which it has been established. That is a truism. It is not subject to dispute. It is in that sense that a public office is considered a public trust.<br><br>Everyone in the public service cannot and must not lose sight of that fact. While his right as an individual although employed by the government is not to be arbitrarily disregarded, he cannot and should not remain unaware that the only justification for his continuance in such service is his ability to contribute to the public welfare.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> (Citation omitted)</blockquote><br><br>No one has a vested right to public office. One can continue to hold public office only for as long as he or she proves worthy of public trust.<br><br><div align="CENTER"><b>II</b></div><br>Consistent with the dignity of public office, our civil service system maintains that misconduct tainted with "any of the additional elements of corruption, willful intent to violate the law or disregard of established rules"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> is grave. This gravity means that misconduct was committed with such depravity that it justifies not only putting an end to an individual's current engagement as a public servant, but also the foreclosure of any further opportunity at occupying public office.<br><br>Accordingly, the 2017 Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service (2017 RACCS)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> consider grave misconduct as a grave offense warranting the ultimate penalty of dismissal from service with the accessory penalties of cancellation of eligibility, perpetual disqualification from public office, bar from taking civil service examinations, and forfeiture of retirement benefits.

This is in keeping with the three (3)-fold liability rule in the law on public officers, "which states that the wrongful acts or omissions of a public officer may give rise to civil, criminal and administrative liability. An action for each can proceed independently of the others."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br><div align="CENTER"><b>IV</b></div><br><br>It is without question that respondent violated Section 7(d) of Republic Act No. 6713. The Court of Appeals summarized her "modus operandi," as follows:<br><br><blockquote>[T]he <i> modus operandi </i>of [Regalado] is to present to applicants for accreditation a fake copy of Office Memorandum Order No. RBR 00-57 providing an accreditation fee of P50,000.00 to be able to charge the said amount, when the actual fee required is only P10,000.00. If the applicant cannot afford to pay such a high amount, [Regalado], as she did in the present case, will tell the applicant that through her efforts, she will be able to reduce the accreditation fee to P10,000.00. However, in return, the applicant will have to give an honorarium to [Regalado's] boss amounting to at least P30,000.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> </blockquote><br><br>The matter is not a question of whether or not, as respondent mentions in her Comment to the present Petition, she actually received or profited from the solicitation of any amount from the complainants, or that she solicited even after she had completed the inspection of St. Martha's.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> Section 7(d) of Republic Act No. 6713 penalizes both solicitation and acceptance. This is similar to how Section 3(c) of Republic Act No. 3019 penalizes both the requesting and receiving of pecuniary or material benefits. In Section 7(d), the prior or subsequent performance of official acts is also immaterial.<br><br>It is equally without question that respondent engaged in misconduct that was tainted with corruption and with willful intent to violate the law and to disregard established rules. The act of requesting pecuniary or material benefits is specifically listed by. Section 3(c) of Republic Act No. 3019 as a "corrupt practice." Further, there is certainly nothing in the records to suggest that respondent's actions were not products of her own volition.<br><br>It is clear, then, that respondent's actions deserve the supreme penalty of dismissal from service. The Court of Appeals, however, held that certain circumstances warrant the reduction of respondent's penalty to a year-long suspension.<br><br>The Court of Appeals was in serious error.<br><br><div align="CENTER"><b>V</b></div><br><br>The Court of Appeals noted, as a mitigating circumstance, "that petitioner has not been previously charged of any offense and this is the very first time that she was found to be administratively liable."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br>In taking this as a mitigating circumstance, the Court of Appeals ran afoul of the clear text of the Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service. Rule IV, Section 52(A)(3) of these Rules unqualifiedly states that dismissal shall be meted even if it is only the first offense:<br><br><blockquote><div align="center">RULE IV<br><br>Penalties<br></div><br>Section 52. Classification of Offenses. â Administrative offenses with corresponding penalties are classified into grave, less grave or light, depending on their gravity or depravity and effects on the government service.<br><blockquote>A. The following are grave offenses with their corresponding penalties:<br>. . . .<br>3. Grave Misconduct<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1st offense â Dismissal<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> </blockquote></blockquote><br>Jurisprudence has been definite on this point. This Court's <i>En Banc </i>Decision in <i>Duque v. Veloso</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> underscored how "the clear language of Section 52, Rule IV does not consider a first-time offender as a mitigating circumstance."<br><br><blockquote>[T]he circumstance that this is the respondent's first administrative offense should not benefit him. By the express terms of Section 52, Rule IV of the Uniform Rules, the commission of an administrative offense classified as a serious offense (like dishonesty) is punishable by dismissal from the service even for the first time. In other words, the clear language of Section 52, Rule IV does not consider a first-time offender as a mitigating circumstance. Likewise, under statutory construction principles, a special provision prevails over a general provision. Section 53, Rule IV of the Uniform Rules, a general provision relating to the appreciation of mitigating, aggravating or alternative circumstances, must thus yield to the provision of Section 52, Rule IV of the Uniform Rules which expressly provides for the penalty of dismissal <i>even for the first commission of the offense.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup>&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><br>In <i> Medina v. Commission on Audit,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> this Court emphasized that "a grave offense cannot be mitigated by the fact that the accused is a first-time offender or by the length of service of the accused."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br><blockquote>Jurisprudence is replete with cases declaring that a grave offense cannot be mitigated by the fact that the accused is a first time offender or by the length of service of the accused. In <i>Civil Service Commission v. Cortez,</i> the Court held as follows:<br><blockquote>The gravity of the offense committed is also the reason why we cannot consider the "first offense" circumstance invoked by respondent. In several cases, we imposed the heavier penalty of dismissal or a fine of more than P20,000.00, considering the gravity of the offense committed, even if the offense charged was respondent's first offense. Thus, in the present case, even though the offense respondent was found guilty of was her first offense, the gravity thereof outweighs the fact that it was her first offense.</blockquote><br>Also, in <i>Concerned Employees v. Nuestro,</i> a court employee charged with and found guilty of dishonesty for falsification was meted the penalty of dismissal notwithstanding the length of her service in view of the gravity of the offense charged.<br><br>To end, it must be stressed that dishonesty and grave misconduct have always been and should remain anathema in the civil service. They inevitably reflect on the fitness of a civil servant to continue in office. When an officer or employee is disciplined, the object sought is not the punishment of such officer or employee but the improvement of the public service and the preservation of the public's faith and confidence in the government.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote><br><br>The fact that an offender was caught for the first time does not, in any way, abate the gravity of what he or she actually committed. Grave misconduct is not a question of frequency, but, as its own name suggests, of gravity or weight. One who commits grave misconduct is one who, by the mere fact of that misconduct, has proven himself or herself unworthy of the continuing confidence of the public. By his or her very commission of that grave offense, the offender forfeits any right to hold public office.<br><br>Underscoring the severity of grave misconduct and other offenses meriting dismissal, the 2017 RACCS now specifically state that no mitigating circumstances, of any sort, may be appreciated in cases involving an offense punishable by dismissal from service:<br><br><blockquote>Section 53. Mitigating and Aggravating Circumstances. â Except for offenses punishable by dismissal from the service, the following may be appreciated as either mitigating or aggravating circumstances in the determination of the penalties to be imposed:<br><ol type="a"><li>Physical illness;<br></li><li>Malice;<br></li><li>Time and place of offense;<br></li><li>Taking undue advantage of official position;<br></li><li>Taking undue advantage of subordinate;<br></li><li>Undue disclosure of confidential information;<br></li><li>Use of government property in the commission of the offense;<br></li><li>Habituality;<br></li><li>Offense is committed during office hours and within the premises of the office or building;<br></li><li>Employment of fraudulent means to commit or conceal the offense;<br></li><li>First offense;<br></li><li>Education;<br></li><li>Length of service; or<br></li><li>Other analogous circumstances.</li></ol><br>In the appreciation thereof, the same must be invoked or pleaded by the respondent, otherwise, said circumstances will not be considered in the imposition of the proper penalty.

A more appropriate summation of respondent's actions should recognize how she was so brazen in extortingânot merely soliciting, but downright badgeringâmoney from the complainants. Throughout a prolonged period extending seven (7) months from October 2006 to May 2007, she pestered the complainants for bribes that she variably referred to as "processing fee,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> "accreditation fee,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> and "honorarium."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> Respondent could not even bear to be consistent about the language she would use in her attempts to conceal extortion.<br><br>In the course of pressing the complainants for money, respondent even knowingly used a falsified copy of an official issuance of the Bureau of Immigration. The Court of Appeals took lengths to explain how respondent did this and then proceeded to explain the incredulity of respondent's denials:<br><br><blockquote>First, the records of the case show that when Doromal first met [respondent] at the Bureau, the latter told her that the accreditation fee is P50,000.00. [Respondent's] basis in assessing such amount was her copy of <i>Office Memorandum Order No. RBR 00-57 </i>which petitioner showed to Doromal when the latter was applying for accreditation. A copy of the said memorandum was also attached by petitioner to her counter-affidavit. The certified copy of the same memorandum submitted by Mr. Estrada, Chief of the Student Desk of the Bureau of Immigration, however, shows that the accreditation fee is merely P10,000.00.<br><br>Conspicuously missing also from petitioner's copy is the signature of the Commissioner of the Bureau of Immigration, Rufus Rodriguez. By reason of these dissimilarities, Atty. Tansingco, Chief of Staff of the Commissioner of the Bureau of Immigration was prompted to declare petitioner's copy as fake in his letter dated 05 December 2007 submitted to the Ombudsman.<br><br>[Respondent] denies knowing that the copy she was using is fake as she alleges that she merely obtained it from the available records of the Davao District Office. She, however, failed to present any proof to support this contention. Mere allegation is not proof. It was incumbent on the part of [respondent] to prove this allegation by at least submitting any copy of the memorandum existing in their Davao office similarly showing that the accreditation fee being charged is P50,000.00 and also not bearing the signature of the Commissioner of the Bureau of Immigration. Petitioner could have also submitted the affidavit of any of her officemates that they have also used or even came in contact with a copy of the said memorandum with the same omissions. [Respondent's] failure to do any of these greatly prejudiced her case.<br><br>Furthermore, WE agree with the observation of the Ombudsman that [respondent's] explanation that she does not know that the copy she was using is falsified and that she merely relied on the copy of <i><u>Office Memorandum No. RBR 00-57</u> </i>available at their office, to be flimsy and crude to be worthy of belief. For even as [respondent] alleges that at the time she was merely an entry level employee when she was assigned to the Student's Desk at the Office and that to perform her duties she had to rely on her superior officers as well as the records of the office for information as to the applicable rules and regulations, it is still hard to believe that she was not able to discern the illegality of the copy of the memorandum she was using as it is clear that the same was unsigned.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> (Citation omitted)</blockquote><br><br>Still in the course of badgering the complainants for money, respondent professed exercising undue influence over other officers of the Bureau of Immigration. She stated, <i>"I'll be backing you up, walang gugulo sa inyo.</i>"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> Likewise, she implicated other officers, repeatedly asserting that she was only soliciting for her boss, implying others were in on her corrupt scheme, and suggesting that Bureau of Immigration officers from Manila would have been more prodigal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup><br><br>Respondent's incessant demands also came with less than subtle threats that the complainants' inability to comply with her exaction would result in the denial of benefits that was available to St. Martha's. Recall that respondent told Doromal that it would be to Doromal's disadvantage were she to decline paying P50,000.00 as she would have to go through the entire accreditation process all over again. This was despite the fact that St. Martha's did not even need to go through accreditation, as the Court of Appeals explained, and how it submitted accreditation papers, even if it did not need to.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup><br><br>Apart from these, when Diaz and Tautho paid through the Bureau of Immigration's official cashier, respondent, with neither reason nor any right to do so, demanded that they surrender to her their official receipt.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup><br><br>Most telling of respondent's audacity and depravity is how she did not mince words in not only professing her own corruption, but even besmirching the entire government. Asked by Diaz if she was making demands "under the table," respondent answered, <i>"Yes, my dear, that's the system ng government.</i>"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> She even added, <i>"Ganito ang system, ano ako magmamalinis?"</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup><br><br>Far from demonstrating considerations that should mitigate respondent's liability, her litany of transgressions could conceivably be appreciated as even aggravating. Her case makes it seem like someone breathed life to a caricature of a corrupt bureaucrat.<br><br>The civil service cannot have itself overrun by officers such as respondent. They make a mockery of every ideal that public service exemplifies. For once, some individuals had the courage to not condone her corruption. This is enough to show that respondent is nowhere near deserving of public trust. As a measure of recompense to the public, and as a portent to others who may be similarly disposed, this Court does not hesitate to impose upon respondent the supreme administrative penalty of dismissal from government service.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the Petition for Review on Certiorari is <b>GRANTED.</b> The July 19, 2013 Amended Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
