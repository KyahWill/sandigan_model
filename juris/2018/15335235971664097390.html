In this case, the 2000 version of the POEA-SEC applies since respondent was hired in December 2005 and he filed his complaint in 2008. </p><p> The 120-day period mandated in Section 20(B)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> of the POEA-SEC, within which a company-designated physician should declare a seafarer's fitness for sea duty or degree of disability, should accordingly be harmonized with Article 198 [192](c)(1) of the Labor Code, in relation with Book IV, Title II, Rule X of the Implementing Rules of the Labor Code, or the Amended Rules on Employee Compensation. Book IV, Title II, Article 198 [192](c)(1) of the Labor Code, as amended, reads: </p><blockquote> <p> Article 198. [192] Permanent total disability. — . . .</p> <p> . . . . </p> <p> (c) The following disabilities shall be deemed total and permanent: </p> <p> (1) Temporary total disability lasting continuously for more than one hundred twenty days, except as otherwise provided for in the Rules.,]</p> </blockquote> <p> Meanwhile, Rule X, Section 2 of the Implementing Rules of the Labor Code, reads: </p><blockquote> <p>Section 2. <i>Period of entitlement</i>. — (a) The income benefit shall be paid beginning on the first day of such disability. If caused by an injury or sickness it shall not be paid longer than 120 consecutive days <em>except where such injury or sickness still requires medical attendance beyond 120 days but not to exceed 240 days</em> from onset of disability in which case benefit for temporary total disability shall be paid. However, the System may declare the total and permanent status at any time after 120 days of continuous temporary total disability as may be warranted by the degree of actual loss or impairment of physical or mental functions as determined by the System. (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> This Court discussed the interplay of these provisions in <i>Vergara v. Hammonia Maritime Services, Inc.</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> As these provisions operate, the seafarer, upon sign-off from his vessel, must report to the company-designated physician within three (3) days from arrival for diagnosis and treatment. For the duration of the treatment but in no case to exceed 120 days, the seaman is on <em>temporary total disability</em> as he is totally unable to work. He receives his basic wage during this period until he is declared fit to work or his temporary disability is acknowledged by the company to be permanent, either partially or totally, as his condition is defined under the POEA Standard Employment Contract and by applicable Philippine laws. If the 120 days initial period is exceeded and no such declaration is made because the seafarer requires further medical attention, then the temporary total disability period may be extended up to a maximum of 240 days, subject to the right of the employer to declare within this period that a permanent partial or total disability already exists.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> (Emphasis in the original, citations omitted)</p> </blockquote> <p> Petitioners aptly argue that starting with <em>Vergara</em>, the prevailing rule is that a seafarer's mere inability to perform his or her usual work after 120 days does not automatically lead to entitlement to permanent and total disability benefits because the 120-day period for treatment and medical evaluation by a company-designated physician may be extended to a maximum of 240 days.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> </p><p>Subsequent cases,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> nonetheless, emphasized that there must be a sufficient justification to extend the medical treatment from 120 days to 240 days. In other words, the 240-day extended period remains to be an exception, and as such, must be clearly shown to be warranted under the circumstances of the case before it can be applied. </p><p> For instance, in <i>Marlow Navigation Philippines, Inc. v. Osias</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> this Court found the medical report of a company-designated physician to have been properly issued within the 240-day extended period because the seafarer was uncooperative, resulting in the extended period of treatment. </p><blockquote> <p>In the case at bench, <i>the sufficient justification to apply the 240-day extended period would be the uncooperativeness of Osias</i>. Based on the evidence presented, it is clear that he did not fully comply with the prescribed medical therapy. In his medical report, dated March 31, 2010, Dr. Arago, as company-designated physician, required Osias to undergo 10 sessions of physical therapy every Monday, Tuesday and Thursday, starting on April 5, 2010. After four (4) sessions, however, Osias failed to appear for the continuation of his physical therapy without any prior notice for his sudden non-attendance. It was only on May 14, 2010, or after more than a month, that Osias returned to see Dr. Arago after coming back from La Union. Osias neither denied nor attempted to justify his abrupt absence. His disregard of the doctor's orders was duly noted by Dr. Arago in his medical report, dated May 14, 2010. </p> <p> The manifest non-compliance of Osias with the prescribed therapy by the company-designated physician demonstrates that he was uncooperative with the treatment. Osias utterly disregarded the limited amount of time the company-designated physician had to finalize his medical assessment by ignoring the scheduled therapy sessions. The LA correctly ruled that, by going to La Union, Osias capriciously and wittingly dispensed with the treatment of the company-designated physician. Likewise, the NLRC observed that it would be unfair to award disability benefits to Osias due to the lapse of 120-day period because the extended period of the treatment was attributable to him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> However, in <i>Aldaba v. Career Philippines, Inc</i>.,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> this Court deemed the disability of a seafarer to be permanent and total despite the Grade 8 disability rating given by a company-designated physician because the assessment was issued only on the 163rd day of the seafarer's medical treatment without any justifiable reason.</p><p> <i>Talaroc v. Arpaphil Shipping Corp</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> stressed that for a company-designated physician to avail of the extended 240-day period, he or she must perform some complete and definite medical assessment to show that the illness still requires medical attendance beyond the 120 days, but not to exceed 240 days. In such case, the temporary total disability period is extended to a maximum of 240 days. Without sufficient justification for the extension of the treatment period, a seafarer's disability shall be conclusively presumed to be permanent and total. This Court summarized the following guidelines to be observed when a seafarer claims permanent and total disability benefits: </p><ol><li> The company-designated physician must issue a final medical assessment on the seafarer's disability grading within a period of 120 days from the time the seafarer reported to him;<br><br></li><li>If the company-designated physician fails to give his assessment within the period of 120 days, without any justifiable reason, then the seafarer's disability becomes permanent and total;<br><br></li><li> If the company-designated physician fails to give his assessment within the period of 120 days with a sufficient justification (e.g., seafarer required further medical treatment or seafarer was uncooperative), then the period of diagnosis and treatment shall be extended to 240 days. The employer has the burden to prove that the company-designated physician has sufficient justification to extend the period; and<br><br></li><li> If the company-designated physician still fails to give his assessment within the extended period of 240 days, then the seafarer's disability becomes permanent and total, regardless of any justification.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup></li></ol> <p> In this case, the company-designated physician did not issue a medical assessment within the 120-day period. Nonetheless, the surgical procedure performed on respondent on January 9, 2008, or 159 days from his repatriation, shows that his condition required further medical treatment, justifying the extension of the 120-day period to 240 days. Thus, this Court deems the temporary total disability period to be accordingly extended up to a maximum of 240 days.</p><p> Petitioners contend that the Court of Appeals erred in applying the 240-day presumptive rule and awarding respondent permanent and total disability benefits despite the Grade 11 disability rating issued by the company-designated physician. Invoking the ruling in <i>Santiago v. Pacbasin Shipmanagement, Inc</i>.,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> petitioners contend that the 240-day presumptive disability rule operates only in default of a declaration of a seafarer's fitness or disability assessment from a company-designated physician.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup></p><p> Petitioners further insist that respondent's complaint should have been dismissed for lack of cause of action because the 240-day period had yet to lapse when the complaint was filed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> </p><p>This Court is not persuaded. </p><p> In <i>Island Overseas Transport Corporation v. Beja</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> this Court clarified that: </p><blockquote> <p> [I]f the maritime compensation complaint was filed <i>prior to October 6, 2008, the rule on the 120-day period</i>, during which the disability assessment should have been made in accordance with <i>Crystal Shipping, Inc. v. Natividad</i>, that is, the doctrine then prevailing before the promulgation of <i>Vergara</i> on October 6, 2008, stands; if, on the other hand, the complaint was filed from October 6, 2008 onwards, the 240-day rule applies.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)</p> </blockquote> <p> When respondent filed his Complaint on March 6, 2008, or after more than 120 days had lapsed, the company-designated physician had not yet determined his disability and respondent had not yet fully recovered. Applying the above ruling in <i>Island Overseas Transport Corporation</i>, respondent is deemed to have already acquired a cause of action for permanent and total disability benefits.</p><p> This Court, nonetheless, will tackle the timeliness and appropriateness of the disability rating issued by the company-designated physician.</p><p> The case of <i>Santiago</i> cited by petitioners is not <i>apropos</i>. There, a seafarer underwent several tests and treatment two (2) days after his repatriation on March 17, 2005. On August 13, 2005, or on the 148<sup>th</sup> day, clearly within the 240-day period, a company-designated physician declared that he was suffering from a Grade 12 disability only, not a permanent total one. This Court ruled that the seafarer's condition could not be considered a permanent total disability. It also held that "a temporary total disability only becomes permanent when the company-designated physician, within the 240[-]day period, declares it to be so, or when after the lapse of the same, he fails to make such declaration."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> </p><p> In contrast, this case has no medical or progress report that was ever made by the company-designated physician other than that issued on May 29, 2008, or 300 days from respondent's repatriation on August 3, 2007. </p><p> Respondent was last seen by the company-designated physician on March 17, 2008, or on the 227<sup>th</sup> day from his repatriation. At this point, the company-designated physician is nearing the end of the extended period of 240 days, 13 days to be exact, within which to give respondent's final disability assessment, yet none was given.

While both doctors gave a brief description of psoriasis, it was only Dr. Fugoso who categorically stated a factor that triggered the activity of the respondent's disease — stress, drug or alcohol intake, etc. <i>Dr. Alegre immediately concluded that it is not work-related on the basis merely of the absence of psoriasis in the schedule of compensable diseases in Sections 32 and 32-A of the POEA-SEC. Dr. Alegre failed to consider the varied factors the respondent could have been exposed to while on board the vessel. At best, his certification was merely concerned with the examination of the respondent for purposes of diagnosis and treatment and not with the determination of his fitness to resume his work as a seafarer</i> in stark contrast with the certification issued by Dr. Fugoso which categorically declared the respondent as "disabled." <i>The certification of Dr. Alegre is, thus, inconclusive for purposes of determining the compensability of psoriasis under the POEA-SEC</i>. Moreover, Dr. Alegre's specialization is General Surgery while Dr. Fugoso is a dermatologist, or one with specialized knowledge and expertise in skin conditions and diseases like psoriasis. Based on these observations, it is the Court's considered view that Dr. Fugoso's certification deserves greater weight.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted)</p> </blockquote> <p> In <i>HFS Philippines, Inc., et al. v.

On the other hand, the independent physicians stated that respondent's major depression persisted and constituted a disability. More importantly, while the former totally ignored the diagnosis of the Japanese doctor that respondent was also suffering from gastric ulcer, the latter addressed this. The independent physicians thus found that respondent was suffering from chronic gastritis and declared him unfit for work.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> In <i>Island Overseas Transport Corp. v.

Upon repatriation on November 22, 2007, he was referred to a company-designated physician who recommended a knee operation. Roughly a month after the knee operation, or on May 26, 2008, the company-designated physician rendered Grades 10 and 13 partial disability grading of his medical condition. This Court considered this assessment as tentative because the seafarer continued his physical therapy sessions, which even went beyond 240 days. It further noted that the company-designated physician "did not even explain how he arrived at the partial permanent disability assessment"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup> or provided any justification for his conclusion that the seafarer was suffering from Grades 10 and 13 disability.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup></p><p> Furthermore, while the assessment of a company-designated physician <i>vis à vis</i> the schedule of disabilities under the POEA-SEC is the basis for compensability of a seafarer's disability, it is still subject to the periods prescribed in the law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup> Otherwise, the fate of the seafarer would completely rest in the hands of the company-designated physician, without redress, should the latter fail or refuse to give a disability rating.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup> </p><p> Accordingly, in <i>Carcedo v. Maine Marine Philippines, Inc</i>.,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup> this Court declared that a partial and permanent disability could, by legal contemplation, become total and permanent when a company-designated physician fails to arrive at a definite assessment within the 120- or 240-day periods prescribed under Article 198 [192](c)(1) of the Labor Code and the Amended Rules on Employee Compensation, implementing Book IV, Title II of the Labor Code. Thus: </p><blockquote> <p> The Court in <i>Kestrel Shipping Co., Inc. v. Munar</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup> held that the declaration by the company-designated physician is an obligation, the abdication of which transforms the temporary total disability to permanent total disability, regardless of the disability grade, <em>viz</em>.:</p> <blockquote> <p> Indeed, under Section 32 of the POEA-SEC, only those injuries or disabilities that are classified as Grade 1 may be considered as total and permanent. However, if those injuries or disabilities with a disability grading from 2 to 14, hence, partial and permanent, would incapacitate a seafarer from performing his usual sea duties for a period of more than 120 or 240 days, depending on the need for further medical treatment, then he is, under legal contemplation, totally and permanently disabled. In other words, an impediment should be characterized as partial and permanent not only under the Schedule of Disabilities found in Section 32 of the POEA-SEC but should be so under the relevant provisions of the Labor Code and the Amended Rules on Employee Compensation (AREC) implementing Title II, Book IV of the Labor Code. That while the seafarer is partially injured or disabled, he is not precluded from earning doing the same work he had before his injury or disability or that he is accustomed or trained to do. Otherwise, if his illness or injury prevents him from engaging in gainful employment for more than 120 or 240 days, as the case may be, he shall be deemed totally and , permanently disabled.</p> <p> <i>Moreover, the company-designated physician is expected to arrive at a definite assessment of the seafarer's fitness to work or permanent disability within the period of 120 or 240 days. That should he fail to do so and the seafarer's medical condition remains unresolved, the seafarer shall be deemed totally and permanently disabled</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> Aside from the belated assessment of respondent's injury, the medical report dated May 29, 2008 did not contain any definitive declaration as to the seafarer's fitness to work. On the contrary, the report stated that as of his last check up on March 17, 2008, respondent was still complaining of left knee pain especially upon doing left knee flexion. Under the circumstances of this case, it would be improbable to expect that by March 30, 2008, or the last day of the 240-day period, respondent would have fully recovered from his injury or regained his pre-injury capacity as to be able to go back to his sea duty.</p><p> In <i>Fil-Pride Shipping Company, Inc. v. Balasta</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup> this Court awarded permanent and total disability benefits to a seafarer despite the premature filing of his complaint before the lapse of the 240-day period. This Court held that by that time, it was already evident that the seafarer would be unable to return to his work given his delicate post-operative condition and a definitive assessment by a company-designated physician was, under the circumstances, unnecessary. </p><blockquote> <p> Concededly, the period September 18, 2005 to April 19, 2006 is less than the statutory 240-day — or 8-month — period. Nonetheless, it is impossible to expect that by May 19, 2006, or on the last day of the statutory 240-day period, respondent would be declared fit to work when just recently — or on February 24, 2006 — he underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery; by then, respondent would not have sufficiently recovered. In other words, it became evident as early as April 19, 2006 that respondent was permanently and totally disabled, unfit to return to work as seafarer and earn therefrom, given his delicate post-operative condition; a definitive assessment by Dr. Cruz before May 19, 2006 was unnecessary. Respondent would to all intents and purposes still be unfit for sea-duty. Even then, with Dr. Cruz's failure to issue a definite assessment of respondent's condition on May 19, 2006, or the last day of the statutory 240-day period, respondent was thus deemed totally and permanently disabled pursuant to Article 192 (c) (1) of the Labor Code and Rule X, Section 2 of the AREC.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> It is well to point out that in disability compensation, "it is not the injury which is compensated, but rather it is the incapacity to work resulting in the impairment of one's earning capacity."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup> Total disability refers to an employee's inability to perform his or her usual work.

Zafra, Jr.</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup> this Court held that: </p><blockquote> <p> [P]ermanent partial disability presupposes a seafarer's fitness to resume sea duties before the end of the 120/240-day medical treatment period despite the injuries sustained. The premise is that such partial injuries did not disable a seafarer to earn wages in the same kind of work or similar nature for which he was trained. <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> The facts of this case show respondent's inability to perform his customary sea duties and the company-designated physician's failure to declare his fitness or unfitness to work, despite the lapse of 240 days. This entitles respondent, under the law, to permanent and total disability compensation.</p><p> In this regard, non-compliance with the third-doctor-referral provision as provided in the POEA-SEC will not prejudice respondent's claim. The third-doctor rule does not apply when there is no valid final and definitive assessment from a company-designated physician.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup></p><p> In <i>Kestrel Shipping Co., Inc. v.

Alternatively put, absent a certification from the company-designated physician, the seafarer had nothing to contest and the law steps in to conclusively characterize his disability as total and permanent</i>. (Emphasis supplied)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Without a valid final and definitive assessment from the company-­designated physician, respondent's temporary and total disability, by operation of law, became permanent and total.</p><p> Thus, the Court of Appeals did not err in reversing and setting aside the National Labor Relations Commission's decision and granting respondent permanent and total disability benefits.</p><p> The standard provisions in the 2000 POEA-SEC is a regulatory attempt to balance the constitutional protection to labor with the need for shipping and manning agencies to have an efficient basis for the resolution of claims against them. Hence, the 120- and 240-day periods within which a company-designated physician should make a full, complete, and definitive assessment are accommodations for them. Generally, between companies and an ordinary Filipino seafarer, it is the former that has the better capability to comply with the requirements for determining disabilities of a claimant. Certainly, the period given to them is more than sufficient and it would be the height of inequity for this Court to grant them more at the expense of the seafarer.</p><p align="center"> <b>II</b> </p><p> This Court finds no ground to disturb the uniform findings of the Labor Arbiter, National Labor Relations Commission, and the Court of Appeals in awarding attorney's fees.

The National Labor Relations Commission affirmed the findings of the Labor Arbiter. The Court of Appeals, likewise, did not award moral and exemplary damages.</p><p> Respondent contends that he suffered depression and anxiety because of this case. He also claims exemplary damages for the inhumane treatment he received from petitioners.</p><p> In <i>Sharpe Sea Personnel, Inc. v.

Petitioners' bad faith was further exacerbated when they tried to invalidate the findings of respondent's private physicians, for his supposed failure to move for the appointment of a third-party physician as required by the POEA-SEC, despite their own deliberate concealment of their physician's interim diagnosis from respondent and the labor tribunals. Thus, this Court concurs with the Court of Appeals when it stated:</p> <blockquote> <p> We also grant petitioner's prayer for moral and exemplary damages. Private respondents acted in bad faith when they belatedly submitted petitioner's Grade 8 disability rating only via their motion for reconsideration before the NLRC. By withholding such disability rating from petitioner, the latter was compelled to seek out opinion from his private doctors thereby causing him mental anguish, serious anxiety, and wounded feelings, thus, entitling him to moral damages of P50,000.00. Too, by way of example or correction for the public good, exemplary damages of P50,000.00 is awarded.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup></p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> In <i>Magsaysay Maritime Corp. v. Chin, Jr</i>.,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup> Oscar D. Chin, Jr. (Chin), a seafarer, was found by a company-designated physician to have a moderate rigidity of tract a year after his operation. When he claimed for disability compensation, his employer offered US$30,000.00, which Chin accepted. Chin then executed a Release and Quitclaim in favor of Magsaysay Maritime Corporation. Subsequently, Chin filed a complaint for underpayment of disability benefits and damages. The labor tribunals dismissed his complaint. The Court of Appeals ruled that Chin was entitled to permanent and total disability benefit of US$60,000.00 and remanded the case to the Labor Arbiter for determination of Chin's other monetary claims.</p><p> The Labor Arbiter awarded Chin P200,000.00 as moral damages and P75,000.00 as exemplary damages, among others. This Court sustained the awards of damages, but reduced the amounts for being excessive. The amount of P30,000.00 as moral damages was deemed commensurate to the anxiety and inconvenience Chin suffered. Furthermore, the award of P25,000.00 as exemplary damages was considered "sufficient to discourage petitioner Magsaysay from entering into iniquitous agreements with its employees that violate their right to collect the amounts to which they are entitled under the law."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[124]</sup></p><p> In this case, respondent's travails started when, due to no fault of his, petitioners' ship sunk. Respondent did not receive any disability rating from the company-designated physician despite the lapse of more than seven (7) months of treatment. He demanded disability benefits from petitioners, considering that he had not yet fully recovered from his knee injury, but his demands were unheeded.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[125]</sup> The uncertainty of his medical condition caused his anxiety about his future as a seafarer.</p><p> Indeed, petitioners only submitted the medical report with the Grade 11 disability rating when they filed their Position Paper<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[126]</sup> dated May 27, 2008 with the Labor Arbiter and, accordingly, expressed their willingness to pay disability benefits equivalent only to Grade 11 disability. This reveals petitioners' disregard of respondent's unfortunate plight. Petitioners' bad faith is further evident when they tried to invalidate respondent's complaint for his supposed failure to move for the appointment of a third-party physician as required by the POEA-SEC, when they knew that no prognosis whatsoever was issued by the company-designated physician other than the medical report dated May 29, 2008. </p><p>Considering the blithe manner in which petitioners dealt with respondent's condition and the rulings in Sharp Sea<i> and Magsaysay Maritime</i>, the amount of P100,000.00 as moral damages would be commensurate to the anxiety and inconvenience suffered by respondent. Exemplary damages of P100,000.00 is also granted by way of example or correction for the public good. </p><p> This Court notes the sacrifice that many of our seafarers have to contend with just to earn decent wages so their families could live a dignified existence. Their absence often imprints into their families' psyche. There will be many significant moments when their families will need the seafarers' presence but which will not be possible because they will be devoting their time with companies represented by petitioners.</p><p> Respondent was injured and forced to go home because the ship he was on sunk.
