SP No. 134666 declaring the annual stockholder's meeting held by Cecilia Que Yabut, Eumir Carlo Que and Ma. Corazon Que Garcia (Cecilia Que, et al.) on January 25, 2014 void for lack of quorum and declared all acts performed by Cecilia Que, et al. as <em>ultra vires</em> acts as they were not legally clothed with corporate authority to do so. <p> The pertinent facts of the case as found by the CA are as follows: </p><blockquote> <p> Phil-Ville Development and Housing Corporation (Phil-Ville) is a family corporation founded by Geronima Gallego Que (Geronima) that is engaged in the real estate business. The authorized capital stock of Phil-Ville is Twenty Million Pesos (P20,000,000) divided into Two Hundred Thousand (200,000) shares with a par value of One Hundred Pesos (P100.00) per share. During her lifetime, Geronima owned 3,140 shares of stock while the remaining 196,860 shares were equally distributed among Geronima's six children, namely: Carolina Que Villongco, Ana Maria Que Tan, Angelica Que Gonzales, Cecilia Que Yabut, Ma. Corazon Que Garcia, and Maria Luisa Que Camara, as follows: </p> <blockquote> <p> (a) Carolina Que Villongco- 32,810 shares;<br> (b) Ana Maria Que Tan- out of her 32,810 shares, she retained 17,710 shares and transferred the rest to her six children, thus: Edmund Williams Que Tan- 2,600 shares; Edward Williams Que Tan- 2,500 [shares]; Edison Williams Que Tan- 2,500 shares; Elaine Victoria Que Tan[-] 2,500 shares; Eloisa Victoria- 2,500 shares; and Elinor Victoria- 2,500 shares;<br> (c) Angelica Que Gonzales- 32,810; <br> (d) Cecilia Que Yabut- out of her 32,810 shares, she retained 22,810 shares and transferred the rest to her four children, thus: Geminiano Que Yabut III- 2,500 shares; Carlos Que Yabut- 2,500 shares; Geronimo Que Yabut- 2,500 shares; and Jose Elston Que Yabut- 2,500 shares;<br> (e) Ma. Corazon Que Garcia- out of her 32,810 shares, she retained 21,460 shares and transferred the rest to her four children, thus: Anthony Que Garcia- 2,500 shares; Geronima Que Garcia- 2,950 shares; Michelle Que Garcia- 2,950 shares; and Ma. Christina Que Garcia- 2,950 shares;<br> (f) Maria Luisa Que Camara- upon her death, her shares were divided among her children: Eumir Que Camara- 10,936.67 shares; Pablo Que Camara- 10,936.67 shares; and Abimar Que Camara- 10,936.66 shares. </p> </blockquote> <p> Geronima died on August 31, 2007. By virtue of the <i>Sale of Shares of Stocks</i> dated June 11, 2005 purportedly executed by Cecilia as the attorney-in-fact of Geronima, Cecilia allegedly effected an inequitable distribution of the 3,140 shares that belonged to Geronima, to wit: </p> <blockquote> <p> (a) Carolina's children were given a total of 523 shares distributed as follows: Francis Villongco- 131 shares; Carlo Villongco- 131 shares; Michael Villongco- 131 shares; and Marcelia Villongco- 130 shares;<br> (b) Ana Maria's daughter Elaine Victoria Que Tan was given 523 shares;<br> (c) Angelica- 523 shares;<br> (d) Cecilia's children were given a total of 524 shares distributed as follows: Geminiano Yabut- 131 shares; Carlos Yabut- 131 shares; Geronimo Yabut- 131 shares; and John Elston Yabut- 131 shares; <br> (e) Ma. Corazon's son Anthony Garcia was given 523 shares;<br> (f) Maria Luisa's children were given a total of 524 shares distributed as follows: Eumir Carlo Camara- 174 shares; Paolo Camara- 175 shares; Abimar Camara-175 shares[.] </p> </blockquote> <p> Accordingly, the distribution of Geronima's shares in accordance with the<em> Sale of Shares of Stocks</em> was reflected in the General Information Sheets filed by Phil-Ville in 2010 and 2011, x x x </p> <p> On January 18, 2013, Cecilia, Eumir Carlo Que Camara and Ma. Corazon [Cecilia Que, et. al.] wrote a letter to Ana Maria, Corporate Secretary of Phil-Ville, to send out notices for the holding of the annual stockholders' meeting. However, before Ana Maria could reply thereto, on January 21, 2013, several letters were sent to Phil-Ville's stockholders containing a document captioned "Notice of Annual Stockholders' Meeting" signed by Cecilia and Ma. Corazon as directors, x x x</p> <p> xxxx</p> <p> Thereafter, Carolina, Ana Maria, and Angelica, comprising the majority of the Board of Directors of Phil-Ville held an emergency meeting and made a decision, by concensus, to postpone the annual stockholders' meeting of Phil-Ville until the issue of the distribution of the 3,140 shares of stocks in the name of certain stockholders is settled. All the stockholders were apprised of the decision to postpone the meeting in a letter dated January 21, 2013. Ana Maria, in her capacity as Corporate Secretary and Director of Phil-Ville likewise gave notice to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with regard to the postponement of the meeting.</p> <p> xxxx</p> <p> Despite the postponement, however, [Cecilia Que, et al.] proceeded with the scheduled annual stockholder's meeting participated only by a few stockholders. In the said meeting, they elected the new members of the Board of Directors and officers of Phil-Ville namely: Cecilia, Ma. Corazon and Eumir, Chairman/Vice President/Treasurer, President/General Manager, and Secretary, respectively. </p> <p> Meantime, two days prior to the stockholders' meeting, Carolina, Ana Maria, and Angelica, together with several others, had already filed a <i>Complaint for Annulment of Sale/Distribution or Settlement of Shares of Stock/Injunction</i> against Cecilia, Eumir Carlo and Ma. Corazon. They subsequently filed an <i>Amended and Supplemental Complaint for Annulment of Sale/Distribution or Settlement of Shares of Stock/Annulment of Meeting/Injunction (with Prayer for the Issuance of Temporary Restraining Order and Writ of Preliminary Prohibitory and Mandatory Injunction)</i>. x x x </p> <p> xxxx </p> <p> While Civil Case No. CV-940-MN was still pending, on January 15, 2014, Eumir Carlo sent a Notice of Annual Stockholders' Meeting to all the stockholders of Phil-Ville, notifying them of the setting of the annual stockholders' meeting on January 25, 2014 at 5:00 P.M. at Max's Restaurant, Gov. Pascual comer M.H. Del Pilar Streets, Tugatog, Malabon City. During the meeting, Cecilia, Ma. Corazon and Eumir Carlo were elected as directors and later elected themselves to the following positions: Cecilia as Chairperson/Vice President/Treasurer; Ma. Corazon as ViceÂ­ Chairperson/President/General Manager; and Eumir Carlo as Corporate Secretary/Secretary. </p> <p> x x x x </p> <p> Consequently, on February 10, 2014, Carolina, Ana Maria, Angelica, Elaine and Edison Williams [Carolina, et al.] filed the instant election case against [Cecilia Que, et al.] before the RTC of Malabon City docketed as SEC Case No. 14-001-MN. The Complaint prayed that the election of Cecilia, Ma. Corazon and Eumir Carlo as directors be declared void considering the invalidity of the holding of the meeting at Max's Restaurant for lack of <i>quorum</i> therein, the questionable manner by which it was conducted, including the invalid inclusion in the voting of the shares of the late Geronima, the questionable validation of proxies, the representation and exercise of voting rights by the alleged proxies representing those who were not personally present at the said meeting, and the invalidity of the proclamation of the winners. [Carolina, et al.] also questioned the election of Cecilia, Ma. Corazon and Eumir Carlo as officers of the corporation. They likewise prayed that all the actions taken by the petitioners in relation to their election as directors and officers of the corporation be declared void, including but not limited to the filing of the General Information Sheet with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 27, 2014.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Cecilia Que, et al., filed a <i>Motion for Additional Time to file Answer </i>on March 7, 2014 arguing that the summons was not properly served on them. The RTC however denied said motion since it should have been filed within ten (10) days or on March 2, 2014, in accordance with Section 5; Rule 6<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> of the Interim Rules of Procedure for Intra-Corporate Controversies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> </p><p> Thus, On March 14, 2014, the RTC rendered a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> declaring the election of Cecilia Que, et al. as void and of no effect considering the lack of quorum during the annual stockholders' meeting conducted by the latter, thus: </p><blockquote> <p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, judgment is hereby rendered: </p> <p> a.

If the defendant knowingly does an act inconsistent with the right to object to the lack of personal jurisdiction as to him, like voluntarily appearing in the action, he is deemed to have submitted himself to the jurisdiction of the court. Seeking an affirmative relief is inconsistent with the position that no voluntary appearance had been made, and to ask for such relief, without the proper objection, necessitates submission to the Court's jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> In the instant case, Cecilia Que, et al., filed a motion for extension to file an answer.

They alleged that "the decision thoroughly passed upon all the allegations in the complaint, <i>vis-a-vis </i>the Judicial affidavit of x x x Carolina x x x, which remams unrebutted."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> We are not persuaded. </p><p> The RTC decision is hereby quoted <i>in toto</i>: </p><blockquote> <p> Before the Court is the Election Contest filed by plaintiffs stockholders/board members/officers of Phil-Ville Housing and Development Corporation questioning the validity of the election held by defendants on January 25, 2014 at Max's Restaurant, Malabon City. </p> <p> Having been served with Summons on February 20, 2014, and not having filed an Answer but instead filed a Motion for Extension of Time to the Answer on March 7, 2014 by registered mail, which was received by this Court only on March 13, 2014, the Court is duty bound to render judgment<em> motu proprio</em> within ten (10) days from the lapse of the period to file an Answer, as may be warranted by the allegations of the Complaint, as well as the affidavits, documentary and other evidence on record, awarding relief, if any, only as prayed for. </p> <p> After thoroughly passing upon all and[sic] the allegations in the Complaint, vis-a-vis the Judicial Affidavit of plaintiff Carolina Que Villongco, which remains unrebutted, the Court finds that plaintiffs have fully established that there was no quorum during the annual stockholder's meeting held on 25 January 2014 at Max's Restaurant, Malabon City. Only 98,428 voting shares out of the 200,000 outstanding shares were represented. Therefore, no valid election of board members/officers of Phil-Ville could have taken place. </p> <p> Necessarily, the organizational meeting supposedly conducted thereafter is likewise null and void and could not possibly binding[sic] to the said corporation. </p> <p> WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered: </p> <p> a.

People</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> this Court held that: </p><blockquote> <p> Under Section 14, Article VIII of the Constitution, no decision shall be rendered by any court without expressing therein clearly and distinctly the facts and the law on which it is based. Section 1 of Rule 36 of the Rules of Court provides that a judgment or final order determining the merits of the case shall be in writing personally and directly prepared by the judge, stating clearly and distinctly the facts and the law on which it is based, signed by him and filed with the clerk of the court. </p> <p> Faithful adherence to the requirements of Section 14, Article VIII of the Constitution is indisputably a paramount component of due process and fair play. A decision that does not clearly and distinctly state the facts and the law on which it is based leaves the parties in the dark as to how it was reached and is precisely prejudicial to the losing party, who is unable to pinpoint the possible errors of the court for review by a higher tribunal. More than that, the requirement is an assurance to the parties that, in arriving at a judgment, the judge did so through the processes of legal reasoning. It is, thus, a safeguard against the impetuosity of the judge, preventing him from deciding <i>ipse dixit</i>. </p> <p> The standard "expected of the judiciary" is that the decision rendered makes clear why either party prevailed under the applicable law to the facts as established. Nor is there any rigid formula as to the language to be employed to satisfy the requirement of clarity and distinctness. The discretion of the particular judge in this respect, while not unlimited, is necessarily broad. There is no sacramental form of words which he must use upon pain of being considered as having failed to abide by what the Constitution directs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> Thus, Section 14, Article VIII of the Constitution mandates Us to craft Our decisions stating clearly and distinctly the facts and the law on which We based Our decisions. It should be emphasized that the mere fact that the defendant was not able to file an answer does not automatically mean that the trial court will render a judgment in favor of the plaintiff. The trial court must still determine whether the plaintiff is entitled to the reliefs prayed for. Thus, it is incumbent upon the RTC to clearly and distinctly state the facts and the legal basis on which it based its decision. This is sadly not followed by the RTC in its Decision dated March 14, 2014. The RTC merely adopted the allegations of Carolina et al. without any rhyme or reason. The decision merely stated that quorum was not established during the annual stockholders meeting conducted by Cecilia Que, et al. and that only 98,428 shares were present during the said meeting without any explanation or justification as to why the trial court ruled that way. Therefore, We agree with the CA that the RTC decision is null and void for violating the constitutional provision. </p><table width="50%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><b><i>Total outstanding capital stocks, without distinction as to disputed or undisputed shares of stock, is the basis in determining the presence of quorum.</i></b> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>Carolina et. al., claimed that the basis for determining quorum should have been the total number of <u>undisputed shares of stocks </u>of Phil-Ville due to the exceptional nature of the case since the 3,140 shares of the late Geronima and the fractional .67, .67, and .66 shares of Eumir Que Camara, Paolo Que Camara and Abimar Que Camara are the subject of another dispute filed before the RTC. Thus, excluding the 3,142 shares from the 200,000 outstanding capital stock, the proper basis of determining the presence of quorum should be 196,858 shares of stocks.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> We do not agree. </p><p> Section 52 of the Corporation Code states that: </p><blockquote> <p> <b>Section 52. </b><i>Quorum in meetings</i>. - Unless otherwise provided for in this Code or in the by-laws, a quorum shall consist of the stockholders representing a majority of the outstanding capital stock or a majority of the members in the case of non-stock corporations. </p> </blockquote> <p> While Section 137 of the same Code defines "outstanding capital stock", thus: </p><blockquote> <p> <b>Section 137. </b><i>Outstanding capital stock defined</i>. - The term "outstanding capital stock", as used in this Code, means the total shares of stock issued under binding subscription agreements to subscribers or stockholders, whether or not fully or partially paid, except treasury shares. </p> </blockquote> <p> The right to vote is inherent in and incidental to the ownership of corporate stocks. It is settled that unissued stocks may not be voted or considered in determining whether a quorum is present in a stockholders' meeting. Only stocks actually issued and outstanding may be voted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Thus, for stock corporations, the quorum is based on the <i>number of outstanding voting stocks</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> The distinction of undisputed or disputed shares of stocks is not provided for in the law or the jurisprudence. <i>Ubi lex non distinguit nec nos distinguere debemus</i> â when the law does not distinguish we should not distinguish.

It is only when the transfer has been recorded in the stock and transfer book that a corporation may rightfully regard the transferee as one of its stockholders. From this time, the consequent obligation on the part of the corporation to recognize such rights as it is mandated by law to recognize arises.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> The contention of Cecilia Que, et al., that they should not be faulted for their failure to present the stock and transfer book because the same is in the possession of the corporate secretary, Ana Maria Que Tan, who has an interest adverse from them, is devoid of merit. It is basic that a stockholder has the right to inspect the books of the corporation,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> and if the stockholder is refused by an officer of the corporation to inspect or examine the books of the corporation, the stockholder is not without any remedy. The Corporation Code grants the stockholder a remedyâto file a case in accordance with Section 144.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> </p><p> In this case, there is no evidence that the 3,140 shares of the late Geronima were recorded in the stocks and transfer book of Phil-Ville. Thus, insofar as Phil-Ville is concerned, the 3,140 shares of the late Geronima allegedly transferred to several persons is non-existent. Therefore, the transferees of the said shares cannot exercise the rights granted unto stockholders of a corporation, including the right to vote and to be voted upon. </p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the instant Petitions for Review on <em>Certiorari</em> are <b>DENIED</b>.
