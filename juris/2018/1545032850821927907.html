				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Quitters are responsible for their own quitting. Persons who willingly turn their backs on their own relations cannot demand to be taken back and restored to their previous state as though nothing happened. <p> Public officers and employees who actively petition for retirement or separation benefits willfully affirm their separation from service. They are bound by their own voluntary departure. Absent any indication that their choice was vitiated by confounding predicaments, like desperate financial need, they cannot renege on their self-imposed state, and later importune the government to reinstate them to the position they readily relinquished and to pay them backwages in the intervening period. This is especially so when the voluntary severance of their employer-employee relationship with the government was done as part of an attempt to forestall a finding of administrative liability and to evade a dishonorable removal from service. To rule otherwise condones a preposterous predicament rendered unworkable by their own abdication, rewards their desertion and duplicity, and exposes an adjudicatory body's inability to come to terms with the reality foisted by the fact of willful separation from service.</p><p> This resolves the consolidated petitions for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.

Isip</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> articulated the basic parameters of and the rationale for adhering to the doctrine of immutability of a final judgment: </p><blockquote> <p> A judgment becomes "final and executory" by operation of law. Finality becomes a fact when the reglementary period to appeal lapses and no appeal is perfected within such period. As a consequence, <i>no court (not even this Court) can exercise appellate jurisdiction to review a case or modify a decision that has bec[o]me final</i>. </p> <p> <i>When a final judgment is executory, it becomes immutable and unalterable. It may no longer be modified in any respect either by the court which rendered it or even by this Court. The doctrine is founded on considerations of public policy and sound practice that, at the risk of occasional errors, judgments must become final at some definite point in time</i>. </p> <p> The doctrine of immutability and inalterability of a final judgment has a two-fold purpose: <i>(1) to avoid delay in the administration of justice and thus, procedurally, to make orderly the discharge of judicial business and (2) to put an end to judicial controversies, at the risk of occasional errors, which is precisely why courts exist. Controversies cannot drag on indefinitely.</i> The rights and obligations of every litigant must not hang in suspense for an indefinite period of time.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted) </p> </blockquote> <p> In staying its own hand in disturbing final judgments, this Court emphasized that the immutability of final judgments is not a matter of mere technicality, "but of substance and merit." In <i>Pe√±a v. Government Service Insurance System</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> [I]t is axiomatic that final and executory judgments can no longer be attacked by any of the parties or be modified, directly or indirectly, even by the highest court of the land. Just as the losing party has the right to file an appeal within the prescribed period, so also the winning party has the correlative right to enjoy the finality of the resolution of the case.</p> <p> . . . .</p> <p> The rule on finality of decisions, orders or resolutions of a judicial, quasi-judicial or administrative body is "not a question of technicality but of substance and merit," [as its] <b><i>underlying consideration [is] . . . protecti[n]g . . . the winning party['s substantive rights] . . . </i></b> <i>Nothing is more settled in law than that a decision that has acquired finality becomes immutable and unalterable and may no longer be modified in any respect Even if the modification is meant to correct erroneous conclusions of fact or law and whether it will be made by the court that rendered it or by the highest court of the land</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> As is clear from <i>Pe√±a</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> the doctrine of immutability of judgments applies as much to decisions of agencies exercising quasi-judicial powers as they do to judicial decisions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> Jurisprudence is categorical: "the principle of conclusiveness of prior adjudications is not confined in its operation to the judgments of what are ordinarily known as courts, but extends to all bodies upon which judicial powers had been conferred."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> Specifically concerning the Civil Service Commission, this Court has stated that: </p><blockquote> <p> <em>The [Civil Service Commission] has no power or authority to reconsider its decision which has become final and executory. </em>More so in this case when more than a period of one year had lapsed since the [Civil Service Commission] decision became final and executory. Even ordinary courts may not, as a rule, set aside or even modify its decision that have become final and executory. The duty of the [Civil Service Commission] in such instance is to enforce its final decision rather than disturb it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> Likewise, in <i>Provincial Government of Aurora v. Marco</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> <i>The doctrine of immutability of final judgments applies to decisions rendered by the Civil Service Commission</i>. A decision of the Civil Service Commission becomes final and executory if no motion for reconsideration is filed within the 15-day reglementary period under Rule VI, Section 80 of the Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service: </p> <blockquote> <p> Section 80. Execution of Decision.‚ÄîThe decisions of the Commission Proper or its Regional Offices shall be immediately executory after fifteen (15) days from receipt thereof, unless a motion for reconsideration is seasonably filed, in which case the execution of the decision shall be held in abeyance.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> The doctrine of immutability of judgments is not itself absolutely and inescapably immutable. "While firmly ingrained as a basic procedural tenet in Philippine jurisprudence, [it] was never meant to be an inflexible tool to excuse and overlook prejudicial circumstances."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> This Court has recognized that it "must yield to practicality, logic, fairness and substantial justice.'' <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> </p><p> Jurisprudence enumerates instances in which a final judgment's execution may be disturbed: (1) the correction of clerical errors; (2) <i>nunc pro tunc</i> entries that do not prejudice a party; (3) void judgments; and (4) whenever supervening events or circumstances transpire after the decisions' finality, making the decision's execution unjust and inequitable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> </p><p> This Court's enumeration of exceptions reveals a grounded consideration of, and a commitment to honor, matters at the heart of "serv[ing] substantial justice." In <i>Barnes v. Padilla</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> Such failure carries with it the result that no court can exercise appellate jurisdiction to review the case. Phrased elsewise, a final and executory judgment can no longer be attacked by any of the parties or be modified, directly or indirectly, even by the highest court of the land. </p> <p> However, this Court has relaxed this rule in order to serve substantial justice considering (a) matters of life, liberty, honor or property, (b) the existence of special or compelling circumstances, (c) the merits of the case, (d) a cause not entirely attributable to the fault or negligence of the party favored by the suspension of the rules, (e) a lack of any showing that the review sought is merely frivolous and dilatory, and (f) the other party will not be unjustly prejudiced thereby.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> (Citations omitted) </p> </blockquote> <p> Still in <i>Barnes</i>, this Court expounded on how the recognized exceptions serve as instruments of equity, countervailing conventional rigidities: </p><blockquote> <p> <i>Invariably, rules of procedure should be viewed as mere tools designed to facilitate the attainment of justice. Their strict and rigid application, which would result in technicalities that tend to frustrate rather than promote substantial justice, must always be eschewed</i>. Even the Rules of Court reflects this principle. The power to suspend or even disregard rules can be so pervasive and compelling as to alter even that which this Court itself had already declared to be final. </p> <p> In <i>De Guzman vs. Sandiganbayan</i>, this Court, speaking through the late Justice Ricardo J. Francisco, had occasion to state: </p> <blockquote> <p> The Rules of Court was conceived and promulgated to set forth guidelines in the dispensation of justice but not to bind and chain the hand that dispenses it, for otherwise, courts will be mere slaves to or robots of technical rules, shorn of judicial discretion. That is precisely why <i>courts in rendering justice have always been, as they ought to be guided by the norm that when on the balance, technicalities take a backseat against substantive rights, and not the other way around.

This is the inescapable implication of his deliberate petitioning for benefits occasioned by what he mistakenly thought was retirement, but which was more accurately a simulation of resignation. In any case, regardless of the technical nomenclature that flawlessly encapsulates every nuance of his voluntary act of ending his employment, the naked truth and the pivotal element of <i>voluntary</i> termination of employment remain.</p><p> This voluntary termination of employment was made before the administrative complaint against Moralde could be resolved by the Province, at the first instance, and then referred to the Commission, on appeal. It was also successfully concealed for almost nine (9) years. Its discovery was made only long after the Commission ruled on his appeal. The Civil Service Commission's willingness to rule on his appeal reveals that it was under the mistaken impression that Moralde's continuance in office was still an unresolved, justiciable matter. Evidently, however, the Civil Service Commission's ruling on Moralde's appeal was a pointless superfluity. Any pronouncement on his continuance in office was reduced to a purely academic exercise as Moralde had already put himself out of office.</p><p> Such antecedent, voluntary termination of employment was the "realit[y] of the situation,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> the "practicality"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> that the Civil Service Commission had to contend with when it was unexpectedly notified of Moralde's successful application for benefits under Republic Act No. 8291. <i>Common sense dictated that the Civil Service Commission endeavored to come to terms with Moralde's importuning to occupy a position, which had become vacant because Moralde himself vacated it <u>before</u> the Province could even remove him</i>. Basic sensibility impelled the Civil Service Commission to consider the primordial question of whether it was even still possible to compel the restoration to office of an employee who himself terminated his employment. The Civil Service Commission's rumination was not confined to the basal question of practicability, but extended into the matter of whether this restoration was logical and, even more importantly, fair and just.</p><p> The subsequent unraveling of the pointlessness and utter absurdity of reinstating an employee who voluntarily left employment changed the entire complexion of Moralde's case.

Separation Benefits. ‚Äî The separation benefit shall consist of: (a) a cash payment equivalent to one hundred percent (100%) of his average monthly compensation for each year of service he paid contributions, but not less than Twelve thousand pesos (P12,000) payable upon reaching sixty (60) years of age or upon separation, whichever comes later: Provided, That the member resigns or separates from the service after he has rendered at least three (3) years of service but less than fifteen (15) years; or</p> <p> (b) A cash payment equivalent to eighteen (18) times his basic monthly pension payable at the time of resignation or separation, plus an old-age pension benefit equal to the basic monthly pension payable monthly for life upon reaching the age of sixty (60): Provided, That the member resigns or separates from the service after he has rendered at least fifteen (15) years of service and is below sixty (60) years of age at the time of resignation or separation.</p> </blockquote> <p> The availing of retirement benefits differs from the availing of separation benefits with respect to the requisite age and length of service. For retirement, the applicant needs to be at least 60 years old and must have served for at least 15 years. For separation benefits, the applicant must be below 60 years old. There are further distinctions for availing of separation benefits under Section 11, paragraphs (a) and (b). Under paragraph (a), the applicant needs to have served for at least three (3) years, but less than 15 years. Under paragraph (b), the applicant must have served for at least 15 years.</p><p> Retirement and separation benefits differ on the availability of monthly pensions, and the computation of the amount that will be immediately released to an approved applicant. For retirees, with their two (2) options specified in Section 13(a)(1) and Section 13(a)(2), an old-age or basic monthly pension is always assured. It is for the applicant to choose between starting to receive it five (5) years after leaving the service, as provided for by Section 13(a)(1), or immediately upon retiring, as provided for under Section 13(a)(2). For recipients of separation benefits, a basic monthly pension can be obtained only by those who have served for at least 15 years, as expressed in Section 11(b). Even then, they may only avail of this pension upon reaching the age of 60.</p><p> As to the computation of awards, the amounts that can be granted to a retiree far exceed those that can be given to a recipient of separation benefits. This is because one's number of years in service is a key component of the computations for both retirement and separation benefits. </p><p> GSIS' Retirement Brochure explains retirement benefits, as follows:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> <b><u>Option 1: Lump sum and old-age (basic monthly) pension</u></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup></p> <p> This consists of the following: </p> <ul><li> <b><i>Lump sum</i></b>- equivalent to your 60-month (or 5-year) <b><i>basic monthly pension (BMP)</i></b> payable at the time of retirement; and<br><br> </li><li><b><i>BMP</i></b> - payable for life after the 5-year guaranteed period</li></ul> <p> <b><u>Option 2: Cash payment and old-age (basic monthly) pension</u></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup></p> <p> This consists of the following: </p> <ul><li><b><i> Cash Payment</i></b> - equivalent to 18-month BMP payable upon retirement; and <br><br></li><li> <b><i>Immediate BMP</i></b> - payable for life from the date of retirement.</li></ul> <p> Here is how BMP is computed.</p> <blockquote> <p> <b>BMP = (0.025) (AMC + P700) (PPP)</b></p> <p> where: </p> <p><b>AMC = average monthly compensation</b> and<br> <b>PPP = periods with paid premiums.</b> </p> </blockquote> <p> Your AMC is computed as follows:</p> <p> 1.

This is because, by their very nature, retirement and separation benefits become available only when employment ceases. </p><p> This Court's treatment of retirement is definite and unmistakable: it is "a withdrawal from office, public station, business, occupation, or public duty,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> the "very essence [of which] . . . is the termination of the employer¬≠ employee relationship."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup></p><p> Concerning the retirement of private sector employees, jurisprudence states that retirement arises as the result of "a voluntary [employer-employee] agreement . . . where the latter, after reaching a certain age, agrees to sever his employment with the former."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup> Retirement, in this context, is a bilateral act of the employee and the employer.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup> In <i>Gerlach v.

The second type is one set up by agreement between the employer and the employees in collective bargaining agreements or other agreements between them.

Retirement as a public officer or employee is no less "a withdrawal from office, public station, . . . occupation, or public duty."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup> </p><p>Republic Act No. 8291 's retirement benefits are not predicated upon the forcible termination of a civil servant's employment arising from the employer's desire to cease professional relations with a specific, unwanted individual. While retirement upon reaching the compulsory age is not per se an action out of one's personal volition, there is still no coercive removal of someone otherwise pinpointed as undesirable. Section 13-A even contemplates voluntary retirement, as early as at age 60, five (5) years ahead of Section 13(b)'s compulsory retirement age. </p><p> In any case, a person of advanced years who retires manifests a personal acceptance of the reality of his or her state when he or she applies to receive the benefits attendant to his or her retirement. Retirement itself may not be voluntary, but the retiree's acceptance of his or her state and ensuing pursuit of benefits certainly is. Applying for benefits is an independent, willful act through which a civil servant consciously manifests before the concerned government organ, the GSIS, his or her intent to avail of a utility attendant to his or her state. </p><p>As to the receipt of Republic Act No. 8291's separation benefits, it is true that a public officer or employee who avails of separation benefits is not irreversibly precluded from again rendering service to the government at a later time. Nevertheless, at that moment that a public officer or employee manifests intent to avail of <i>separation</i> benefits, that public officer or employee concedes his or her intent to actually "<i>separate</i> from" government, that is, to put an end to his or her employment. By Section 11's own text, availing of such benefits demands specific action on the part of the applicant, i.e., that he or she "resigns or separates from the service." </p><p>On availing of retirement benefits, neither is availing of Republic Act No. 8291's separation benefits predicated upon the forcible termination of a civil servant's employment. Section 11's benefits are very clearly available to a civil servant who voluntarily or willfully ends his or her employment. An employee's own "resign[ation] or separat[ion] from the service" is the necessary precondition to avail of separation benefits. </p><p align="center"><b>V</b> </p><p> The Court of Appeals was correct in noting that Moralde was in no position to receive retirement benefits. At 38 years of age, he was not qualified for Section 13's benefits. Logically, what he qualified for and received must have been in the nature of Republic Act No. 8291's separation benefits. </p><p>However, the distinction that the Court of Appeals harps on hardly works to turn the tide in Moralde's favor. It is clear, whether he received retirement or separation benefits, that he voluntarily and personally intended to put his public employment to a complete and unequivocal end. </p><p> Insisting on the receipt of retirement benefits cannot result in a successful disavowal of willingness. At 38 years of age, Moralde was nowhere near the age at which Section 13(b) would have compelled him to retire. He may have mistakenly intended to avail of Section 13(a)'s retirement benefits but, not having yet reached the compulsory retirement age of 65, Moralde could not claim that this availment was involuntarily thrusted upon him. </p><p> Insisting on his receipt of separation benefits is even more crippling to Moralde's cause. From Section 11's plain text, the mere act of availing these benefits presupposes both a civil servant's conscious "resign[ation] or separat[ion] from the service," and a concurrently deliberate petition or application for benefits. </p><p>Moralde's confusion on the nuances between Section 13's and Section 11 's benefits may be overlooked, but the underlying voluntariness of his separation from service cannot be denied. </p><p>This voluntary intent to separate from service, erroneously stated as "retirement," is demonstrated by the records. </p><p>Annex H of the Civil Service Commission's Rule 45 Petition, a communication signed by GSIS Manager Teresita J. Rojas and addressed to Moralde, specifically used the phrase "<i>APPLICATION</i> FOR RETIREMENT."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup> Acting on Moralde's application for benefits, it informed Moralde that his "APPLICATION FOR RETIREMENT UNDER RA 8291, EFFECTIVE NOV. 8, 1998 AT AGE 38.5 YRS.

Moralde was not in a position to retire for the simple reason that a technical nuance made it impossible. However, the technical nuance between Sections 11 and 13 does not detract from how, in any case, Moralde personally chose to, fully intended to, and positively worked to sever the employer-employee relationship between him and the government to avail of the monetary benefits available only through such severance. </p><p> Moralde terminated his employer-employee relationship with the government, which is indeed the essence of what he mistakenly understood to be retirement.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> He may have conflated retirement with resignation but the essence of these declarations and actions remains. </p><p> The Court of Appeals was overly solicitous. It ignored the bare truth of this case: the intricate distinctions between Sections 11 and 13 aside, Moralde's underlying objective was to terminate his tenure with the government. Only then could he avail of the monetary benefits for which he applied. Without the termination of his tenure, his application for monetary benefits was a hollow and ridiculous exercise.</p><p align="center"> <b>VI</b> </p><p> It would be remiss of this Court to fail to appreciate the totality of the circumstances and the specific context in which Moralde both manifested his separation from service and sought to avail of monetary benefits under Republic Act No. 8291.</p><p> Prior to November 8, 1998, when his supposed retirement took effect, he had admitted in his written explanation that contrary to what his Daily Time Records indicated, he did not render service from March 16 to 30, 1998. By then, an investigation had been completed by Atty. Rubio, who specifically noted that Moralde had previously committed the same infraction of falsifying his Daily Time Records.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup> Contending that Moralde was a repeat offender, Atty. Rubio recommended that he be dismissed from service.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup></p><p> Moralde's manifestation of his separation from service and the accompanying application for Republic Act No. 8291's benefits should not be viewed in isolation. Instead, they must be perceived with a concomitant appreciation of how, with his own admission of wrongdoing, a guilty verdict was probably, if not certainly, forthcoming. Likewise, it must be viewed with a sense of how a particularly graver penalty, such as dismissal from service, was equally possible given his history of delinquency and Atty. Rubio's specific recommendation. Indeed, not longer than a day after his "retirement" took effect, Governor Calingin issued Memorandum No. APC 1019, finding him guilty of falsification and ruling that he must be dismissed from service.</p><p> Thus, one must appreciate that at the bottom of Moralde's actions was a desire to forestall a forthcoming guilty verdict and dishonorable removal from government service. He may not have been animated by a monetary motive per se, i.e., to enrich himself through the benefits which he petitioned from GSIS, but it is not difficult to see how he was really looking to secure an honorable conclusion to his 16 years of service.</p><p> Having successfully carried out that intention, Moralde cannot now claim that he should be reinstated.</p><p> Quitters cannot blame others for their own quitting. An employee who voluntarily ends his employment cannot later cry foul over the end of such employment and compel his employer to reinstate him. Moralde has put an end to his employment, he has vacated his own position; it would be laughably ridiculous to force others to restore him to it.</p><p> Not only would a ruling favoring Moralde run afoul of common sense. It would also amount to condoning the injustice of his reneging on his own word.</p><p> Moralde is estopped by his own actions.

Moralde's concealments impaired its ability to act. It was mistakenly led to believe that administrative proceedings were merely taking their proper, uninterrupted course. The reality of how the Province and the Civil Service Commission would have acted differently had information not been denied them is borne out by how, on the part of the Province, it rushed to file a Motion for New Trial and/or Modification of Judgement as soon as it realized that Moralde had "retired" ahead of his dismissal. On the part of the Civil Service Commission, this is borne by how it promptly corrected itself and declared its Resolution No. 061984 moot and academic.</p><p> By definition, reinstatement works to restore a person to his or her former status.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[131]</sup> Reinstatement is given as a remedy to those whose employment was illegally terminated because the law considers them as having been unduly deprived of their positions. In <i>Verdadero v. Barney Autolines Group of Companies Transport, Inc</i>.: <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[132]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> <i>Reinstatement and backwages are reliefs available to an illegally dismissed employee. <b>Reinstatement restores the employee who was unjustly dismissed to the position from which he was removed, that is, to his status quo ante dismissal</b></i>, while the grant of backwages allows the same employee to recover from the employer that which he had lost by way of wages as a result of his dismissal. These twin remedies ‚Äî reinstatement and payment of backwages ‚Äî make the dismissed employee whole who can then look forward to continued employment. Thus, do these two remedies give meaning and substance to the constitutional right of labor to security of tenure.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[133]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> It is preposterous to consider reinstatement when there was no prior removal. <i>Verdadero</i>'s pronouncements on reinstatement cannot encompass those who, like Moralde, did not only voluntarily intend and declare their intent to relinquish their position, but even petitioned to receive monetary benefits available only through the consummation of such relinquishment. </p><p> <i>United Laboratories, Inc. v. Domingo</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[134]</sup> explained that reinstatement is rooted in the State's policy of ensuring a worker's security of tenure. Employees who voluntarily sever their employer-employee relations willfully abandon the security of their own tenure. No one took that security away from them. It would be unfair for an employer to be compelled to reinstate employees who personally, consciously, and willfully acted in a manner that betrays their intent to cease employment.</p><p> Moralde's acceptance of the benefits which he himself petitioned from GSIS sealed his fate. By receiving them, he affirmed his avowed intent to end his employment</p><p align="center"> <b>VII</b> </p><p> The Court of Appeals cited <i>Dytiapco v. Civil Service Commission</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[135]</sup> and <i>Yenko v. Gungon</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[136]</sup> drawing parallels between those cases and Moralde's to maintain that the latter's receipt of separation benefits could not have mooted his reinstatement: "[he] could still be reinstated in the service despite his availment and acceptance of the separation benefits form the GSIS."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[137]</sup></p><p> The Court of Appeals quoted at length from <i>Dytiapco</i>. In the interest of an exhaustive comparison, this Court reproduces in their entirety the statements in <i>Dytiapco</i> that the Court of Appeals relied on: </p><blockquote> <p>Petitioner never abandoned his appeal for reinstatement when he accepted separation pay and terminal leave benefits. In fact as early as December 22, 1987, petitioner was protesting respondent Bureau of Broadcast's findings that he lacked writing experience when it conducted evaluation of employees in preparation to the reorganization of said office pursuant to Executive Order No. 297. </p> <p>This was followed by his letter to Chairman Patricia Sto. Tomas of respondent Commission, dated May 12, 1988 or seven (7) days after receiving his separation and terminal leave benefits on May 5, 1988, appealing for his reinstatement on the ground that his dismissal was without a valid cause as he is a permanent civil service eligible employee. Again, on July 28, 1988 and June 9, 1989, he wrote Chairman Sto. Tomas following up his appeal for reinstatement. These acts of petitioner can in no way be interpreted as abandonment of his appeal. On the contrary, it showed petitioner's strong desire for reinstatement and not separation from government service. <i>His acceptance of separation and terminal leave benefits was dictated more by economic necessity rather than a desire to leave government employment</i>. </p> <p> . . . . </p> <p> Petitioner's dismissal was not for a valid cause, thereby violating his right to security of tenure. . . .</p> <p> Respondent Commission's reliance on its earlier decision in the Teofilo Pa-alan case promulgated on April 21, 1989, that acceptance of benefits renders an appeal "closed and terminated", is misplaced. It deprives petitioner of his right to due process and added another ground for his removal not contemplated by R.A. No. 6665, that is, the mere payment of his separation and terminal leave benefits. </p> <p> . . . .</p> <p> Respondent Civil Service Commission gravely abused its discretion in finding that petitioner's receipt of separation and terminal leave benefits renders his appeal closed and terminated and consequently its Resolutions of June 28, 1989 and November 27, 1989 are hereby annulled and set aside.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[138]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> It likewise quoted at length from <i>Yenko</i>. Again, this Court reproduces in their entirety the statements in <i>Yenko</i> that the Court of Appeals relied on:</p> <blockquote> <p> In fine, Gungon is entitled to reinstatement, without qualification, for having been illegally dismissed. A government official or employee reinstated for having been illegally dismissed is considered as not having left his office. His position does not become vacant and any new appointment made in order to replace him is null and void ab initio.</p> <p> As regards the award of Gungon's back salaries, it is settled jurisprudence that an illegally terminated civil service employee is entitled to back salaries limited only to a maximum period of five years, and not full back salaries from his illegal termination up to his reinstatement.<br> . . . . </p> <p> The Court cannot subscribe to the assertion of Municipal Administrator Yenko and Mayor Estrada that mere application for terminal leave or the commutation of leave credits ended Gungon's employment because an application for terminal leave and receipt of terminal leave benefits are not legal causes for the separation or dismissal of an employee from the service. The Constitution explicitly states that "[n]o officer or employee of the civil service shall be removed or suspended except for cause provided by law".</p> <p> At most, <i>an application for terminal leave</i> under Sec. 35 of the amended Rule XVI of the Omnibus Civil Service Rules and Regulations <i>shows the intent of an employee to sever his employment, which intent is clear if he has resigned or retired from the service. However, such intent may be disproved</i> in cases of separation from the service without the fault of the employee, who questions his separation, even if the government agency, pending the employee's appeal, grants his application for terminal leave because it has already dropped him from the rolls. <i>In Dytiapco v. Civil Service Commission, the Court understood the predicament of an employee who accepted terminal leave benefits because of economic necessity rather than the desire to leave his employment with the government.</i></p> <p> In this case, the Court of Appeals correctly held that Gungon's application for terminal leave and his acceptance of terminal leave benefits could not be construed as an abandonment of his claim for reinstatement or indicative of his intent to voluntarily sever his employment with the government, because Gungon had appealed his case to the CSC and had a pending motion for reconsideration of CSC Resolution No. 982525 before he received his terminal leave benefits. Indeed, Gungon's appeal against his dismissal to the CSC and, thereafter, to the Court of Appeals, and his petition before this Court ‚Äî all taken within a span of 11 years ‚Äî show his desire to be reinstated, not separated from the government service. In this connection, the Court of Appeals aptly stated that it would have been unjust for petitioner, who was dropped from the rolls not to claim his terminal leave pay considering that it would take some time for his appeal to be resolved. Gungon had no permanent employment and had to sustain the needs of his two sons.</p> <p> Further, Municipal Administrator Yenko and Mayor Estrada contend that the Court of Appeals erred in ordering the payment to Gungon of five years back salaries equivalent to five years from the date he was dropped from the rolls on March I, 1998 despite the fact that Gungon did not render any service to the Municipal Government of San Juan from the time he was reassigned to POSO up to the time he opted to voluntarily sever his employment when he applied for terminal leave.</p> <p> The contention is without merit.</p> <p> It is settled that a government official or employee who had been illegally dismissed and whose reinstatement was later ordered is considered as not having left his office, so he is entitled to all the rights and privileges that should accrue to him by virtue of the office that he held. Thus, Gungon is entitled to payment of back salaries equivalent to a maximum period of five years.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[139]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Neither <i>Dytiapco nor Yenko</i> corresponds with the facts of this case. <i>Dytiapco</i> and <i>Yenko</i> share the same narrative elements. First, a ruling dismissing an employee is made.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[140]</sup> Second, the dismissed employee immediately instituted and zealously pursued an appeal of his dismissal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[141]</sup> Third, during the pendency of the appeal, economic necessity forced the employee to apply for and receive monetary benefits attendant to separation from service.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[142]</sup> Fourth, the dismissal is finally ruled to be illegal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[143]</sup> Finally, the employee was declared to be entitled to reinstatement with backwages.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[144]</sup></p><p> Moralde's case could not be farther removed from this mold. First, faced with an administrative case against him but <em>before any ruling could be made</em>, he secretly went to GSIS to apply for retirement benefits.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[145]</sup> Second, it was only after he had declared his "retirement" that a ruling was made, finding him guilty and terminating his employment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[146]</sup> Third, without informing anyone of his pending retirement application, he appealed his dismissal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[147]</sup> Fourth, while his appeal was pending, his application for benefits was approved, with his retirement and the consummation of his voluntary severance of employment becoming effective ahead of the ruling terminating his employment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[148]</sup> Fifth, he kept knowledge of GSIS' approval to himself; the Province accepted the Civil Service Commission's overturning of his dismissal and facilitated his reinstatement.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[149]</sup> Sixth, while processing his reinstatement, the Province discovered how he had been "retired" all along.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[150]</sup> Seventh, the Province, invoking this discovery, filed before the Civil Service Commission a Motion for New Trial and/or Modification of Judgement.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[151]</sup> Eighth, the Civil Service Commission recognized that Moralde's reinstatement was impracticable and unfair in the wake of his own act of vacating his post.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[152]</sup> Lastly, Moralde appealed the Civil Service Commission's ruling before the Court of Appeals and emerged victorious, but is now before this Court, given the Province's and Civil Service Commission's appeals.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[153]</sup> </p><p> The biggest difference between this case and <i>Yenko</i> and <i>Dytiapco</i> is plain to see: the time when an application for monetary benefits attendant to an employee's leaving the service is filed.</p><p> In <i>Yenko</i> and <i>Dytiapco</i>, rulings dismissing employees from service were made first. Thereafter, appeals from those rulings were filed. <i>The dismissed employees filed for separation benefits only when their appeals had been pending for so long, they could not bear the lack of a source of income</i>. They sought monetary benefits attendant to separation from service because the length of time that had elapsed without their salaries forced them into <i>demonstrably</i> difficult financial situations. On the other hand, in Moralde's case, his application for retirement benefits preceded any appeal. Worse, it even preceded a ruling at the first instance.</p><p> Moralde jumped the gun. He did not bother to wait for a resolution of the administrative case against him. He sought to arrest the possibility that his public service career would end in dishonor, and with his separation benefits forfeited. His case is not a case of a hapless worker pushed to his economic breaking point. Rather, it is one of an admittedly dishonest civil servant endeavoring to dodge a guilty verdict to the extent of consciously and willfully leaving his job just so he would not otherwise get fired.</p><p> This exact point was captured by the Civil Service Commission when it emphasized in its Petition, thus: </p><blockquote> <p> In respondent's case, the fact that [Moralde] received his benefits under the GSIS Act of 1997, whether upon his <strong>retirement</strong>, as shown by the tenor of the documents presented, i.e. <strong>a)</strong> respondent's letter dated December 17, 2002; <strong>b)</strong> Letter of the Branch Manager of GSIS Cagayan de Oro; and <strong>c)</strong> respondent's letter to the Provincial Government dated June 20, 2005 - or on account of his <b>resignation</b> from the government service, clearly shows that <b>respondent voluntarily severed</b> his employment with the government, which places him outside of the coverage of <b>Dytiapco</b> and <b>Yenko</b>.</p> <p> In <b>Yenko</b> and <b>Dytiapco</b>, the petitioners therein each applied for and/or received terminal leave and separation benefits <b>long after they were dropped from the rolls</b>, or were dismissed by their respective government offices, and their cases were already pending review before the Court of Appeals or respondent CSC. The acceptance by the petitioners therein of the separation and terminal leave benefits was brought about by economic necessity rather than the desire to leave government employment. The same cannot be said in the present case as . . . respondent was no longer a government employee when the [Province] . . . dismissed him from service.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[154]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)</p> </blockquote> <p> The distinction in the timing of filing applications for monetary benefits reveals how the applicants in <i>Yenko</i> and <i>Dytiapco</i> were first forcibly removed from their posts, and thus, had a factually existing impetus for seeking reinstatement. In this case, on the other hand, Moralde's application for benefits prior to dismissal indicates that his voluntary cessation of employment overtook his removal. He had already simulated resignation before the Province had the chance to terminate his employment.</p><p> Moreover, in <i>Yenko</i> and <i>Dytiapco</i>, the applications for separation benefits were done openly or publicly. The basic matter of their factuality were not points of contention. What was disputed was only the applications' consequence on the viability of reinstatement. In contrast, Moralde applied for Republic Act No. 8291's benefits in total secrecy. He also kept to himself its other incidents: first, the application's approval; second, the approval's retroactivity to the date of filing, which was the day before he was terminated from service; third, his actual receipt of separation benefits; and fourth, the assurance that he would start getting monthly pensions upon turning 60 years old. This fact of secrecy betrays ulterior intent.</p><p> The critical differences between Moralde's case on one hand and <i>Yenko</i> and <i>Dytiapco</i> on the other mean that the latter cannot be binding precedents here. They cannot bolster Moralde's claim to reinstatement and entitlement to backwages.</p><p> The conclusion made by <i>Yenko</i> and <i>Dytiapco</i> that acceptance of separation benefits does not equate to the abandonment of one's plea for reinstatement does not obtain here. Applying for retirement benefits before any ruling on his liability, appealing his dismissal during his application's pendency, benefitting from his application's approval, and now seeking to double his windfall by insisting that he be reinstated are clear signs that Moralde valued escaping a finding of guilt, while securing monetary benefits in the interim, more than maintaining the employment he had already enjoyed. It was never about him merely keeping his job. It was about circumventing the law: Moralde effected a contingency plan to forestall a forthcoming guilty verdict and the ensuing loss of his job, but he realized later on that by leaving, yet still appealing for reinstatement, he could doubly profit.</p><p align="center"> <b>VIII</b> </p><p> The truth of the circumstances and Moralde's discernible motivations reveal the Court of Appeals' error in maintaining that Moralde's application for benefits under Republic Act No. 8291 was made in good faith.</p><p> It strains credulity to insist that Moralde was naive to what his application for "retirement" benefits signified. He was neither uneducated nor plainly ignorant; he was a qualified Dental Aide.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[155]</sup> He served in the government for 16.06735 years.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[156]</sup> He must have had discussions, casual and serious, with colleagues on the matter of retirement. He must have had colleagues who actually retired in the course of his 16 years of service. He knew of the mechanics of separating from the government service and petitioning for that separation's attendant benefits. Indeed, he had the wherewithal to actually petition for and consummate his own availing of those benefits. <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[157]</sup></p><p> Moralde's almost decade-long concealment of his successful application indicates not only his more than sufficient knowledge of how the application process worked, but also of the gains he could reap by preventing his successful application from impairing his chances of succeeding in his other gambit of seeking reinstatement. His double dealings reveal that he was, by no means, a hapless victim of circumstance but the percipient architect of an insidiously duplicitous design.</p><p> This Court cannot condone what the Civil Service Commission has rightly described as "reinstatement of a deceitful person to an institution when dishonesty is anathema in the civil service."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[158]</sup></p><p> Any such reinstatement strains the bounds of logic and tramples on common sense. Moralde was not forced out, he left of his own accord and did so in the face of a looming finding of liability. With his prior willful departure, there was not even a dismissal, let alone an illegal one, to speak of. Any discussion on reinstatement can make for interesting thought experiments, but they are just that: purely academic theorizing that is ineffectual in the face of Moralde's voluntary act of terminating his employment.</p><p> With his own cessation of employment, there was no longer an issue for the Civil Service Commission to resolve on appeal. It has been almost 20 years since Moralde filed his appeal on November 24, 1998. All these years, Moralde has taken the Civil Service Commission on a ride to nowhere, asking that he be restored to what he himself abandoned.</p><p> Moralde foisted unfairness and injustice on the Province, asking that it keep his seat warm until his complete vindication and return, even in the face of his written admission to committing repeated falsehoods. He foisted the same unfairness and injustice on the Civil Service Commission, perverting its procedures as tools in a double-dealing but antithetical gambit to both abandon and be restored. He did the same to GSIS, squandering it as a monetary fallback option as he evaded a looming guilty verdict.</p><p> He forces the same unfairness and injustice on the entire civil service, the government, and the Filipino people. His restoration to office rewards deceit and dishonesty. It sanctions the corrupting misuse of administrative remedies and undeserved availing of employee benefits. It will only perpetuate, by actual occupation of office and by feeding popular imagination, every caricature of a bureaucrat that festers in the government.</p><p> This Court must end the inanity and debasement. It cannot allow a duplicitous former civil servant to use the Judiciary as a tool to render administrative disciplinary processes inutile. A decision rendered by this Court cannot be the means to restore Moralde to the service that he so willingly abandoned and against which he admitted to committing repeated falsehoods. Jurisprudence cannot be the key to enable him to wrest undue benefits from the government. This Court cannot be consigned as a tool to helplessly validate Moralde's duplicity.</p><p> Public officers and employees cannot forestall a finding of liability by opting out of employment. It is doubly worse when they reap financial benefits through severance packages upon opting out of employment. Public service is a public trust, and to hold a government position, no matter the rank, is a privilege, not a right.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[159]</sup> As such, it must be earned, and to be kept, one must continuously prove oneself worthy not only in terms of competence, but also of integrity. </p><p> Let Moralde's case be a testament that in the public service, lying, even by omission, does not pay.</p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the consolidated petitions for review on certiorari are <b>GRANTED</b>.
