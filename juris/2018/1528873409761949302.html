Her eldest brother works in a junkshop, while her elder brother usually stays home because of a lingering illness. Her parents work in a mountainous area in x x x Albay, When nobody else can, ["AAA"] usually assumes the obligation to tether the cows (4 heads of them) in the morning and untether them in the afternoon after [arriving] from school.<p> On April 10, 2004 at about 12:00 noon, after tethering the cows, [''AAA"] heard a clapping [sound]. On her way back home, appellant [Nuyte] suddenly appeared, grabbed her by the hair, held her up and at knife point, warned her against telling her mother, or else he will kill them both. Nuyte forced ["AAA"] to the ground and started kissing her chest. He removed her undergarment and his, mounted her and inserted his penis into her vagina. After ejaculating, he wiped his penis, wore back his underwear and left.</p><p> The same act was committed under the same instance and in the same place on April 12, 2004 at 4:00 o'clock in the afternoon, and on April 19, 2004 at 7:00 o'clock in the afternoon." ["AAA"] tried to make an outcry, but because of the distance of the <em>situs criminis</em> from the neighboring houses, nobody heard her. </p><p> On May 3, 2004 at 5:00 o'clock in the afternoon and on May 6, 2004 at 7:00 o'clock in the morning, Nuyte again succeeded in carrying out his dastardly acts against ["AAA"] also at knifepoint, [This time, "AAA" broke] her silence and finally decided to divulge everything to her mother, notwithstanding [appellant's] threat of physical harm against her and her mother. </p><p> On May 12, 2004, the parents of ["AAA", "BBB" and "CCC", who were] in a coconut plantation [attending] to the copra at the kiln[,] were fetched by ["DDD"], sister of Rowena Nuyte, wife of the [appellant], allegedly because ["AAA"] was raped by Nuyte. The spouses rushed home and saw ["AAA"] crying and [thereupon] revealed to them about the rape committed by Nuyte. They repaired to the house of Nuyte, but the latter was already nowhere to be found. They thus decided to make a report to the police and submitted ["AAA"] for physical examination, whereupon ["AAA"] was found to have multiple healed deep and superficial [hymenal] lacerations x x x.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></p></blockquote> <p>The evidence for the defense was also summarized by the trial court as follows: </p> <blockquote> <p>xxx [N]uyte had been living in x x x Albay for thirty years already. [His mother-in-law] and the grandfather of ["AAA" were] siblings. x x x ["AAA"] and [appellant's wife], Rowena, would usually exchange conversations when the latter visits the Nuyte household. The family of ["AAA"] owns a sari-sari store which [Nuyte] also frequents to buy some stuff. It was only [in] December 2003 that Nuyte met ["AAA"] when the latter introduced herself to him. This meeting was followed by regular exchange of tete-a-tete which eventually blossomed into a relationship which lasted for about a year. Even prior thereto, Rowena already observed the budding closeness between her husband and ["AAA"]. Her doubts were confirmed v/hen she discovered from the wallet of Nuyte the letter of ["AAA"] particularly telling him - "<i>Kahit wala ka rito mahal na mahal kita. Kahit na laglagan na ako di pa rin kita malilimutan</i>." </p> <p> Rowena showed the letter to ["EEE”], brother of the father of ["AAA"], but after reading the letter, ["EEE"] told them that he cannot do anything about it because ["AAA's"] parents were still in the mountain, so Rowena requested ["DDD"] to fetch them.</p><p> The parents of ["AAA"] proceeded directly to the residence of Nuyte. ["BBB"], the father of ["AAA"], was particularly very mad and started hacking the banana plants nearby. Because Nuyte did not go out of his house, ["BBB"] decided to leave.</p><p> The discovery of ["AAA's"] letter fomented domestic strife between Nuyte and his wife. [AAA"] tried to talk to him about the letter, but [Nuyte] advised her to better stay home to avoid adding fuel to the fire. That was the last [time] that they talked. To the mind of the accused, these cases were [filed because] the parents of ["AAA"] could not accept what had happened to their daughter. </p><p> Theirs was a consensual sex, Nuyte admitted. In fact their sexual congress happened [several times], usually at noontime in the same grassy place where ["AAA"] tethers the cows x x x, around 50 to 60 meters away from the residence of Nuyte. She was then only 14 years old and he was 29. Nuyte recalls that in the letter, ["AAA"] was begging him not to leave as she was about to receive the sacrament of confirmation. Their sexual relations bore a child, but it was aborted when ["AAA"] was undergoing Citizens Army Training.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> </p></blockquote> <p><b><i>Ruling of the Regional Trial Court</i></b> </p> <p>On December 9, 2011, the RTC found appellant guilty as charged, ruling in this wise: </p> <blockquote> <p> ALL THE FOREGOING CONSIDERED, this Court entertains no doubt that the prosecution had established that the accused raped the private complainant under the circumstances mentioned in Article 266-A paragraph 1 (a) of the Revised Penal Code and that he violated Sec. 5(b) of Republic Act 7610. Accordingly, accused NELSON NUYTE is hereby found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt in Criminal Case No. FC-00-780 and sentenced to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>. He is likewise found GUILTY of five (5) counts of violation of Section 5(b) of Republic Act No, 7610 and likewise meted the penalty of imprisonment ranging from 8 years and 1 day of<em> prision mayor</em> in its medium period as minimum to 17 years, 4 months and 1 day of r<em>eclusion temporal</em> in its maximum period as maximum, subject to the provision of Article 70 of the Revised Penal Code.</p> <p> Consistent with relevant jurisprudence, Nelson Nuyte is likewise ordered to indemnify the private offended party, ["AAA"], the sum of Php75,000.00 for each case as civil indemnity; Php75,000.00 as moral damages and Php30,000.00 as exemplary damages.</p> <p> SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> The trial court found conclusive evidence that on April 10, 2004, "AAA" was raped at knifepoint with the use of force and intimidation against her will. Thus, it convicted appellant of rape in Crim. Case No. FC-00-780. In addition, the court took into consideration appellant's admission of having sexual intercourse with "AAA" several times. Thus, it deemed "AAA" as a child exploited and subjected to sexual abuse under Section 5(b) of RA 7610 and convicted appellant of five counts of violation of Section 5(b) of RA 7610.</p><p> Insisting on his innocence by invoking love affair as his defense, appellant elevated the judgment of conviction to the CA via a Notice of Appeal.</p><p> <b><i>Ruling of the Court of Appeals</i></b> </p><p>On September 25, 2014, the CA affirmed appellant's conviction in the six cases, <em>viz</em>.: </p><blockquote> <p>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the assailed Decision is hereby AFFIRMED.</p> <p> SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> The CA was not persuaded by appellant's contentions that no force or intimidation was actually employed on the victim; that it was impossible for "AAA" to have been sexually abused considering that her classes began in the morning and ended in the afternoon and that she did not suffer any physical injury though the incident happened on grassy ground. The CA did not accord weight to his contention that the inaction of "AAA's" mother and the delay in the disclosure of the incidents affected "AAA's" credibility.</p><p> Hence, this appeal.</p><p> In our Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> dated September 2, 2015, we required the parties to submit their respective supplemental briefs if they so desired within 30 days from notice. The parties filed their separate manifestations that they were no longer filing supplemental briefs; instead, they were adopting their briefs filed before the CA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></p><p align="center"> <b>Our Ruling</b></p><p> The appeal is partly granted.</p><p> In assailing his conviction, appellant harps on the credibility of "AAA" and her mother, contending that it was unnatural for the mother not to take prompt action upon learning the fate suffered by her daughter; that it was impossible for "AAA" to have been at the crime scene on April 10, 2004, April 19, 2004, and May 3, 2004 considering that these were school days; the absence of physical injury on "AAA's" body was enough proof that she was not forced to lie on a grassy ground; and, her delayed disclosure of the incidents was just an act to protect her relationship with him.</p><p> Appellant's arguments are untenable.</p><p> Assuming that ''AAA's" mother did not show any sign of outrage upon learning of her daughter's fate, such was not of relevant consideration for being extraneous. It did not refer to the central fact of the crime and was not an element thereof. Besides, it is well-settled that "different people react differently to a given situation or type of situation."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Neither did the delay in disclosing the incidents to her mother undermine the credibility of "AAA". "[D]elay in reporting rape incidents, in the face of threats of physical violence, cannot be taken against the victim because delay in reporting an incident of rape is not an indication of a fabricated charge and does not necessarily cast doubt on the credibility of the complainant."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> </p><p> Appellant's contention that it was quite impossible for "AAA" to have attended her afternoon classes after having been sexually abused fails to persuade. It has been consistently ruled that "no standard form of behavior can be anticipated of a rape victim following her defilement, particularly a child who could not be expected to fully comprehend the ways of an adult. People react differently to emotional stress and rape victims are no different from them."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> </p><p>Neither did the absence of physical injury on "AAA" taint the veracity of her testimony. "Infliction of physical injury is not an essential element of rape."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> </p><p> As to appellant's claim that there was no resistance exhibited by "AAA" before and during the incidents since they had an amorous relation, the same cannot be taken in his favor. "Tenacious resistance against rape is not required; neither is a determined or a persistent physical struggle on the part of the victim necessary. x x x Rape through intimidation includes the moral kind such as the fear caused by threatening the girl with a knife or pistol."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> In the case at bar, appellant's act of pointing a knife at "AAA" while doing his dastardly acts easily cowed the latter into submission.</p><p> The "sweetheart theory" claimed by appellant is futile. It was never substantiated by the evidence on record. The only evidence adduced to show such relationship were his testimony and that of his wife. The alleged love letter supposedly written by "AAA" was never presented in court. Thus, other than his self-serving assertion and that of his wife, which were rightly discredited by the trial court, nothing supported his claim that he and "AAA" were indeed lovers. As the Court emphasized in <i>People v. Gito</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> "being sweethearts does not negate the commission of rape because such fact does not give appellant license to have sexual intercourse against her will and will not exonerate him from the criminal charge of rape. Being sweethearts does not prove consent to the sexual act."</p><p> This Court finds no reason to reverse appellant's conviction for rape in Criminal Case No. FC-00-780. "AAA" categorically testified that on April 10, 2004, the appellant had carnal knowledge of her against her will and consent, <em>viz</em>.: </p><blockquote> <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td colspan="2">PROS.

Here, the Informations in Criminal Case No. FC-00-782 and Criminal Case No. FC-00-783 clearly charged appellant with rape. Thus, he cannot claim denial of his right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation and to fully defend himself.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></p><p> Appellant therefore, should be held guilty of rape under Article 266-A(1)(a) of the RPC and sentenced to<em> reclusion perpetua </em>instead of violation of Section 5(b)of RA 7610.</p><p> <i>The penalty and pecuniary liabilities</i></p><p> Pursuant to Article 266-B of the RPC, whenever the crime of rape is committed with the use of deadly weapon, the penalty shall be <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death. The Information in Criminal Case No. FC-00-780 specifically alleged the use of a knife, a bladed weapon, in the commission of the rape. The prosecution duly proved this allegation from the testimony of "AAA". Under the aforesaid Article, the use of a deadly weapon qualified the rape so that the imposable penalty is <em>reclusion perpetua </em>to death. Since the two penalties are indivisible, Article 63 of the RPC finds application in that, when there are neither mitigating nor aggravating circumstances in the commission of a deed, the lesser penalty shall be imposed. In the case at bar, there was no other aggravating circumstance alleged in the Information and proven during the trial, hence, the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> imposed on appellant by the trial court and affirmed by the appellate court is proper.</p><p> As to the pecuniary liabilities, the Court upholds the award of P75,000.00 as civil indemnity since this is mandatory upon the finding of the fact of rape. The award of P75,000.00 as moral damages is likewise upheld as the same is automatically granted in rape cases without need of further proof other than the commission of the crime. However, the award of exemplary damages is increased to P75,000.00 following prevailing jurisprudence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Likewise, interest at the rate of 6% <em>per annum</em> shall be imposed on all damages awarded from the date of finality of this Decision until fully paid.</p><p> The same penalty and pecuniary liabilities are imposed on appellant in Criminal Case Nos.
