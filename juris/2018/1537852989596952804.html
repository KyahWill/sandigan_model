No. 3019.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> She claims that among the elements to hold a person criminally liable under Sec. 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019, no other element is present in this case except that she was a public officer.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> She explains that the primary evidence as per Information, i.e. the letter request<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> and the purchase request,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> merely show the letter is simply a request and the purchase request shows on its face that it was the DA officials who made the same. Reyes likewise claims that no real evidence of conspiracy was found or established by the evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></p><p> Moreover, Reyes argues that there is no probable cause to charge her under Article 220 of the RPC.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> She claims that she is not the administrator of the funds in question with whom it remains.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> She further claims that nothing of inducement is stated in the letter request<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> She concluded in accordance with Article 220 of the RPC, it is already clear that not all the elements of the crime charged are met.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></p><p> Reyes further argues that the Sandiganbayan committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction when it denied her assertion that no probable cause exists for either case. Reyes assails the Sandigabayan's reliance on the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee Report being not part of the record of the case and considers it hearsay, as well as the finding that the "arguments propounded by the accused-movants reveal that they are matters of defense."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></p><p align="center"> <b>Ruling of this Court</b> </p><p> The petition is without merit.</p><p> At the outset, it bears to stress that a<em> certiorari</em> proceeding is limited in scope and narrow in character. The special civil action for <em>certiorari</em> lies only to correct acts rendered without jurisdiction, in excess of jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion. <em>Certiorari</em> will issue only to correct errors of jurisdiction, not errors of procedure or mistakes in the findings or conclusions of the lower court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> </p><p> After a careful and thorough review of the facts and the issue at hand, as well as the law and jurisprudence pertinent thereto, this Court finds that the First Division of the Sandiganbayan did not commit grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction when it the denied peititioner's Urgent Omnibus Motion/s (For Judicial Determination of Probable Cause).</p><p> As to the first two issues, Reyes contends that the letter request and purchase request are incomplete to show that the elements are present for charges of violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 and Article 220 of the RPC, further claiming no evidence to show conspiracy.</p><p> We are not persuaded.</p><p> In this case, Reyes's contentions are matters of defense that should be resolved in a trial.</p><p> As public respondent correctly contends: </p><blockquote> <p> At first glance and on its face, petitioner Reyes' request had the appearance of being regular. But after a careful analysis, her request was actually inducing and/or even ordering the DA to procure the subject equipments from the LCV as the latter, according to petitioner Reyes, was "<em>the inventor, manufacturer and exclusive distributor</em>" thereof. Indeed, petitioner Reyes' mere mention in her letter of the name "LCV" as the alleged "<em>inventor; manufacturer and exclusive distributor</em>" of the equipment could be considered as a strong indication that she seriously wanted DA to procure the equipments with LCV. As a matter of fact, in the Purchase Request dated May 3, 2004, and the Requisition and Issue Slip dated May 5, 2004, petitioner Reyes had categorically mentioned the brand name "TORNADO" Brush Chipper/ Shredder, which was the brand claimed to be exclusively distributed by LCV Moreover, no less than her co-respondents in the case, the DA FRFU-IV employees, in their <em>Joint-Counter-Affidavit</em>, openly alleged that the proponents, petitioner Reyes included, had a direct hand in the purchase of the equipments, <em>viz</em>:</p> <p> <i>11.) With respect to paragraph 13, it must be pointed out that the four (4) proponents (Congressmen Nanette Daza, Federico Sandoval, and Oscar Gozos, and Governor Carmencita Reyes) not only had direct hand in the questioned transactions but much more than that. They were not only ordinary proponents or endorsers of the farm implements in question, but they actually initiated the transactions in question as borne out by their respective letters to Respondent Dennis B. Araullo, then the Regional Executive Director of the DA RFU No. IV The four (4) elective public officials concerned categorically and unmistakably manifested in their respective letters the extent of their participation and the fact their sole determination of the specifications (and even the supplier) of the items purchased, purpose and justification why the various farm implements or machines were purchased for their constituencies,</i> ...<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> From the foregoing, it is shown that the letter request and purchase request are enough to engender a well-founded belief that the crime charged may have been committed by Reyes and that any assertion by Reyes that negates the complication of the documents are matters of defense. Besides, the Requisition and Issue Slip<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> dated May 5, 2004, as alluded to by the Ombudsman, would show that petitioner Reyes had categorically mentioned the brand name "TORNADO" Brush Chipper/Shredder, which was the brand claimed to be exclusively distributed by LCV Design and Fabrication Corporation. On this score, said connections can also establish probable cause which the Sandiganbayan may disprove during the trial. Under these circumstances, We concur with the Sandiganbayan as it aptly found, thus: </p><blockquote> <p> A judicious reading of the arguments propounded by the accused-movants reveal that they are matters of defense which should be ventilated during the trial proper. Indubitably, whether or not undue injury was caused or unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference was extended to any party when direct contracting was resorted to instead of public bidding in the acquisition of the subject equipment from LCV in the case of DA RFU IV, and whether or not said supplier was indeed its exclusive distributor of the equipment which could be considered as farm inputs/farm implements to fall under the category provided under the GMA program, and which in effect would help settle the issue if there was illegal use of public funds or not, are matters of defense which are not relevant considerations during the initial stage of the proceedings.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> As to the third issue, Reyes contends that the Sandiganbayan committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction when it denied her assertion that no probable cause exists for both cases. In addition to her previous contentions, Reyes assails the Sandigabayan's reliance on the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee Report being not part of the record of the case and considers it hearsay. She considers such as highly irregular and improper for the Sandiganbayan to have used the findings of such report as bases for upholding the existence of probable cause.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></p><p> Reyes's contention is misplaced.</p><p> It must be emphasized that the Ombudsman itself conducted its own preliminary investigation in this case. It was during this investigation that the Ombudsman, faced with the facts and circumstances extant herein, was led to believe that (1) a crime has been committed; and (2) there is probable cause that Reyes was guilty thereof. That the Ombudsman referred to the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee Report as additional basis for its findings does nothing to refute the validity of the preliminary investigation, the evidence gathered therein, or the conclusion of the Ombudsman after that investigation.</p><p> Thus, We once more find favor m the Resolution of the Sandiganbayan, <i>viz</i>: </p><blockquote> <p> The Court finds no grave abuse of discretion on the part of the Office of the Ombudsman when it found probable cause to file the Information against the accused in these cases. x x x It is noteworthy that aside from its own exhaustive investigation, the Office of the Ombudsman also referred to the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee Report to supplement its findings of probable cause, on the basis of which the investigating prosecutors were able to determine that an offense had probably been committed and that the accused probably perpetrated it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> On the basis of these findings, the Sandiganbayan cannot be said to have committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction when it denied Reyes's assertion that no probable cause exists for both cases.</p><p> In a petition for <em>certiorari,</em> the public respondent acts without jurisdiction if it does not have the legal power to determine the case; there is excess of jurisdiction where the respondent, being clothed with the power to determine the case, oversteps its authority as determined by law. There is grave abuse of discretion where the public respondent acts in a capricious, whimsical, arbitrary or despotic manner in the exercise of its judgment as to be said to be equivalent to lack of jurisdiction. Mere abuse of discretion is not enough.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Here, there is none. </p><p> <strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the Petition is <strong>DENIED</strong>.
