CR No. 38528, which affirmed the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> dated August 27, 2015 of the Regional Trial Court of Binangonan, Rizal, Branch 67 (RTC) in Criminal Case No. 12-0227, finding petitioner Alfredo A. Ramos (Ramos) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs as defined and penalized under Section 11, Article II of Republic Act (RA) No. 9165,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> otherwise known as the "Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002."<br><br><center><b>The Facts</b><br></center><br>On May 8, 2012 an Information was filed before the RTC charging Ramos of violation of Section 11, A1ticle II of RA 9165, the accusatory portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>That on or about the 1<sup>st</sup> day of May 2012, in the Municipality of Angono, Province of Rizal, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, without having been authorized by law to possess any dangerous drug, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and knowingly possess and have in his custody and control 0.05 gram of white crystalline substance contained in one (1) heatÂ­-sealed transparent plastic sachet, which was found positive to the test for Methamphetamine Hydrochloride, also known as "shabu", a dangerous drug, in violation of the above-cited law.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br></blockquote>The prosecution alleged that on May 1, 2012, acting upon the information of a police asset that a certain "Nonong" later identified as Ramos - was bringing in <i>shabu</i> from Lupang Arienda to Barangay (Brgy.) San Roque, Angono, Rizal, Senior Police Officer 1 (SPO1) Pablo Medina (SPO1 Medina), together with three (3) other police officers, took their positions at Col. Guido St., Brgy. San Roque. After waiting for a while, Ramos arrived at the location, and later, two (2) unidentified men came and talked to him. The three (3) men then started fighting, which prompted the police officers to approach and pacify them. However, the men escaped, except for Ramos who was caught by SPO1 Medina. Ramos then took something from his pocket and tried to throw away a pack of cigarettes containing a plastic sachet, which SPO1 Medina was able to intercept. Thereafter, the latter proceeded to the Angono Police Station where he turned over Ramos and the seized items to police investigator SPO1 Ian Voluntad (SPO1 Voluntad) for marking and taking of photographs. Thereat, SPO1 Voluntad marked the plastic sachet with "AAR-1" and the cigarette pack as "AAA-2" and then delivered the items to the crime laboratory where it was confirmed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> that the seized items contained 0.05 gram of methamphetamine hyrdrochloride or <i>shabu</i>, an illegal drug.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>In his defense, Ramos pleaded not guilty and denied the charge against him. He then narrated that on the date he was arrested, he received a call from his friend Brandon Balais (Balais) who invited him to go to Angono, Rizal for Balais's birthday. At around 4:00 o'clock in the afternoon, he arrived at the Angono Caltex gas station, lit a cigarette, and while waiting, a man in civilian clothes started to frisk him. Thereafter, the man showed him a cigarette case with <i>shabu</i> inside and claimed that he owned it. When he denied, he was brought inside an office where a report was instantly prepared against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br><center><b>The RTC Ruling</b><br></center><br>In a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> dated August 27, 2015, the RTC found Ramos guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime charged, and accordingly, sentenced him to suffer the penalty of imprisonment for an indeterminate period of twelve (12) years and one (1) day, as minimum, to thirteen (13) years, as maximum, and to pay a fine in the amount of P300,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>The RTC found that the prosecution had established beyond reasonable doubt that Ramos committed the crime charged as he was caught <i>in flagrante delicto</i> by the arresting police officers in possession of a sachet containing <i>shabu</i>. In this regard, the RTC pointed out that the chain of custody of the seized drug had been preserved, since it was brought to the crime laboratory on the date of the seizure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Aggrieved, Ramos appealed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> to the CA.<br><br><center><b>The CA Ruling</b><br></center><br>In a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> dated March 21, 2017, the CA upheld the RTC ruling, finding all the elements of the crime present, and further holding that the prosecution was able to establish an unbroken chain of custody of the illegal drug from the time of its confiscation by SPO1 Medina until its identification in court. It ruled that despite the failure to strictly follow the requirements under Section 21, Article II of RA 9165, the following circumstances show substantial compliance thereof: (<i>a</i>) the marking and inventory of the subject specimen were immediately done at the police station; and (<i>b</i>) the absence of representatives from the DOJ and the media, or any elected official during the inventory was justified, since SPO1 Medina exerted efforts to secure their presence but they failed to appear. The CA further pointed out that while the photographs of the seized items were not presented as evidence, SPO1 Medina testified that pictures were actually taken by SPO1 Voluntad. Finally, the CA held that it is within the prosecution's discretion whether or not to present SPO1 Voluntad but in any case, the failure to do so was not crucial in proving Ramos's guilt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Unperturbed, Ramos moved for reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> which was, however, denied in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> dated August 4, 2017; hence, this petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br><center><b>The Issue Before the Court</b><br></center><br>The issue for the Court's resolution is whether or not Ramos is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating Section 11, Article II of RA 9165.<br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b><br></center><br>The appeal is meritorious.<br><br>At the outset, it must be stressed that an appeal in criminal cases opens the entire case for review, and thus, it is the duty of the reviewing tribunal to correct, cite, and appreciate errors in the appealed judgment whether they are assigned or unassigned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> "The appeal confers the appellate court full jurisdiction over the case and renders such court competent to examine records, revise the judgment appealed from, increase the penalty, and cite the proper provision of the penal law."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>In this case, Ramos was charged with Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs, defined and penalized under Section 11, Article II of RA 9165. In order to properly secure the conviction of an accused charged with Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs, the prosecution must prove that: (<i>a</i>) the accused was in possession of an item or object identified as a dangerous drug; (<i>b</i>) such possession was not authorized by law; and (<i>c</i>) the accused freely and consciously possessed the said drug.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Notably, it is essential that the identity of the prohibited drug be established with moral certainty, considering that the dangerous drug itself forms an integral part of the <i>corpus delicti</i> of the crime. Thus, in order to obviate any unnecessary doubt on the identity of the dangerous drugs, the prosecution has to show an unbroken chain of custody over the same and account for each link in the chain of custody from the moment the drugs are seized up to their presentation in court as evidence of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Section 21, Article II of RA 9165 outlines the procedure which the police officers must follow when handling the seized drugs in order to preserve their integrity and evidentiary value.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Under the said section, prior to its amendment by RA 10640,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> the apprehending team shall, among others, <b>immediately after seizure and confiscation conduct a physical inventory and photograph the seized items <u>in the presence of the accused or the person from whom the items were seized, or his representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official</u></b> who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy of the same, and the seized drugs must be turned over to the PNP Crime Laboratory&nbsp; within twenty-four (24) hours from confiscation for examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> In the case of <i>People v. Mendoza</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> the Court stressed that "<b><u>[w]ithout the insulating presence of the representative from the media or the Department of Justice, or any elected public official during the seizure and marking of the [seized drugs], the evils of switching, 'planting' or contamination of the evidence</u></b> that had tainted the buy-busts conducted under the regime of RA No. 6425 (<i>Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972</i>) again reared their ugly heads as to <u><b>negate the integrity and credibility of the seizure and confiscation of the [said drugs] that were evidence herein of the corpus delicti, and thus adversely affected the trustworthiness of the incrimination of the accused</b></u>. Indeed, the x x x presence of such witnesses would have preserved an unbroken chain of custody."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>The Court, however, clarified that under varied field conditions, strict compliance with the requirements of Section 21 of RA 9165 may not always be possible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> In fact, the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA 9165 - which is now crystallized into statutory law with the passage of RA 10640 - provide that the said inventory and photography may be conducted at the nearest police station or office of the apprehending team in instances of warrantless seizure, and that <b>non-compliance with the requirements of Section 21 of RA 9165 - <u>under justifiable grounds</u> - will not render void and invalid the seizure and custody over the seized items <u>so long as the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer or team</u></b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> In other words, the failure of the apprehending team to strictly comply with the procedure laid out in Section 21 of RA 9165 and its IRR does not ipso facto render the seizure and custody over the items as void and invalid, provided that the prosecution satisfactorily proves that: (<i>a</i>) there is justifiable ground for nonÂ­compliance; <u><b>and</b></u> (<i>b</i>) the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> In <i>People v. Almorfe</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> <b><u>the Court explained that for the above-saving clause to apply, the prosecution must explain the reasons behind the procedural lapses, and that the integrity and evidentiary&nbsp; value of the seized evidence had nonetheless been preserved</u></b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Also, in <i>People v. De Guzman</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> it was emphasized that <b><u>the justifiable ground for non-compliance must be proven as a fact, because the Court cannot presume what these grounds are or that they even exist</u></b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>After a judicious study of the case, the Court finds that the police officers committed unjustified deviations from the prescribed chain of custody rule, thereby putting into question the integrity and evidentiary value of the dangerous drugs allegedly seized from Ramos.<br><br>It is glaring from the records that no less than SPO1 Medina admitted on cross-examination that the inventory of the drugs purportedly seized from Ramos was conducted <u><b><i>without</i></b></u> the presence of any elected public official or representatives from both the DOJ and the media.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> When questioned on the reason behind such irregularity, SPO1 Medina offered the following justification:<br><blockquote>[PROSECUTOR CO]: In this inventory it appears that there is no signature coming from an elected official, media representative and DOJ representative, why is it so?<br><br>[SPO1 Medina]: At that time, there were no available barangay kagawad(s), Sir.<br><br>[PROSECUTOR CO]: How [about] the media and the DOJ representative, did you exert effort at that time?<br><br>[SPO1 Medina]: We exerted effort but there nobody was (sic) available, Sir.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br></blockquote>At this point, it is well to note that the absence of these required witnesses does not <i>per se</i> render the confiscated items inadmissible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> However, a justifiable reason for such failure or a showing of any genuine and sufficient effort to secure the required witnesses under Section 21 of RA 9165 must be adduced.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> In <i>People v. Umipang</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> the Court held that the prosecution must show that <u><b>earnest efforts</b></u> were employed in contacting the representatives enumerated under the law for "a sheer statement that representatives were unavailable without so much as an explanation on whether serious attempts were employed to look for other representatives, given the circumstances is to be regarded as a flimsy excuse."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Verily, mere statements of unavailability, absent actual serious attempts to contact the required witnesses are unacceptable as justified grounds for nonÂ­compliance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> These considerations arise from the fact that police officers are ordinarily given sufficient time - beginning from the moment they have received the information about the activities of the accused until the time of his arrest - to prepare for a buy-bust operation and consequently, make the necessary arrangements beforehand knowing full well that they would have to strictly comply with the set procedure prescribed in Section 21 of RA 9165. <u><b>As such, police officers are compelled not only to state reasons for their non-compliance, but must in fact, also convince the Court that they exerted earnest efforts to comply with the mandated procedure, and that under the given circumstance, their actions were reasonable.</b></u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>Thus, for failure of the prosecution to provide justifiable grounds or show that special circumstances exist which would excuse their transgression - as in fact the only reason given was that "they exerted effort but nobody was available" - the Court is constrained to conclude that the integrity and evidentiary value of the items purportedly seized from Ramos have been compromised. It is settled that in a prosecution for the illegal sale and possession of dangerous drugs under RA 9165, the State carries the heavy burden of proving not only the elements of the offense, but also to prove the integrity of the <i>corpus delicti</i>, failing in which, renders the case for the State insufficient to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Moreover, jurisprudence dictates that the procedure in Section 21 of RA 9165, as amended by RA 10640, is a matter of substantive law, and cannot be brushed aside as a simple procedural technicality; or worse, ignored as an impediment to the conviction of illegal drug suspects.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Accordingly, since the prosecution failed to provide justifiable grounds for non-compliance therewith, Ramos's acquittal is in order.<br><br>As a final note, the Court finds it fitting to echo its recurring pronouncement in recent jurisprudence on the subject matter:<br><blockquote>The Court strongly supports the campaign of the government against drug addiction and commends the efforts of our law enforcement officers against those who would inflict this malediction upon our people, especially the susceptible youth. But as demanding as this campaign may be, it cannot be more so than the compulsions of the Bill of Rights for the protection of liberty of every individual in the realm, including the basest of criminals. The Constitution covers with the mantle of its protection the innocent and the guilty alike against any manner of high-handedness from the authorities, however praiseworthy their intentions.<br><br>Those who are supposed to enforce the law are not justified in disregarding the right of the individual in the name of order. [For indeed,] [o]rder is too high a price for the loss of liberty. x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br></blockquote>"In this light, prosecutors are strongly reminded that they have the <b>positive duty</b> to prove compliance with the procedure set forth in Section 21, Article II of RA 9165, as amended. As such, <b>they must have the <u>initiative</u> to not only <u>acknowledge</u> but also <u>justify</u> any perceived deviations from the said procedure during the proceedings before the trial court</b>. Since compliance with this procedure is determinative of the integrity and evidentiary value of the <i>corpus delicti</i> and ultimately, the fate of the liberty of the accused, the fact that any issue regarding the same was not raised, or even threshed out in the court/s below, would not preclude the appellate court, including this Court, from fully examining the records of the case if only to ascertain whether the procedure had been completely complied with, and if not, whether justifiable reasons exist to excuse any deviation. If no such reasons exist, then it is the appellate court's bounden duty to acquit the accused, and perforce, overturn a conviction."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appeal is <b>GRANTED</b>.

No. 9165 filled in the details as to where the inventory and photographing of seized items had to be done, and added a saving clause in case the procedure is not followed:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><blockquote>(a) The apprehending officer/team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof: <i>Provided</i>, that the physical inventory and photograph shall be conducted at the place where the search warrant is served; or at the nearest police station or at the nearest office of the apprehending officer/team, whichever is practicable, in case of warrantless seizures; <b><i>Provided, further</i>, that non-compliance with these requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and invalid such seizures of and custody over said items</b>.<br></blockquote>It bears emphasis that R.A. No. 10640,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> which amended Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165, now only requires <b>two (2) witnesses</b> to be present during the conduct of the physical inventory and taking of photograph of the seized items, namely: (a) an elected public official; <u><b>and</b></u> (b) either a representative from the National Prosecution Service <u><b>or</b></u> the media.<br><br>In her Sponsorship Speech on Senate Bill No. 2273, which eventually became R.A. No. 10640, Senator Grace Poe conceded that "while Section 21 was enshrined in the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act to safeguard the integrity of the evidence acquired and prevent planting of evidence, the application of said Section resulted in the ineffectiveness of the government's campaign to stop the increasing drug addiction and also, in the conflicting decisions of the courts."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Senator Poe stressed the necessity for the amendment of Section 21 based on the public hearing that the Senate Committee on Public Order and Dangerous Drugs had conducted, which revealed that "compliance with the rule on witnesses during the physical inventory is difficult. For one, media representatives are not always available in all corners of the Philippines, especially in the remote areas. For another there were instances where elected <i>barangay</i> officials themselves were involved in the punishable acts apprehended and thus, it is difficult to get the most grassroot-elected public official to be a witness as required by law."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>In his Co-sponsorship speech, Senator Vicente C. Sotto III said that in view of a substantial number of acquittals in drug-related cases due to the varying interpretations of prosecutors and judges on Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165, there is a need for "certain adjustments so that we can plug the loopholes in our existing law" and ensure [its] standard implementation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Senator Sotto explained why the said provision should be amended:<br><blockquote>Numerous drug trafficking activities can be traced to operations of highly organized and powerful local and international syndicates. The presence of such syndicates that have the resources and the capability to mount a counter-assault to apprehending law enforcers makes the requirement of Section 21 (a) impracticable for law enforcers to comply with. It makes the place of seizure extremely unsafe for the proper inventory and photograph of the seized illegal drugs.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Section 21 (a) of RA 9165 need to be amended to address the foregoing situation. We did not realize this in 2002 where the safety of the law enforcers and other persons required to be present in the inventory and photography of seized illegal drugs and the preservation of the very existence of seized illegal drugs itself are threatened by an immediate retaliatory action of drug syndicates at the place of seizure. The place where the seized drugs may be inventoried and photographed has to include a location where the seized drugs as well as the persons who are required to be present during the inventory and photograph are safe and secure from extreme danger.<br><br>It is proposed that the physical inventory and taking of photographs of seized illegal drugs be allowed to be conducted either in the place of seizure of illegal drugs or at the nearest police station or office of the apprehending law enforcers. The proposal will provide effective measures to ensure the integrity of seized illegal drugs since a safe location makes it more probable for an inventory and photograph of seized illegal drugs to be properly conducted, thereby reducing the incidents of dismissal of drug cases due to technicalities.<br><br>Non-observance of the prescribed procedures should not automatically mean that the seizure or confiscation is invalid or illegal, as long as the law enforcement officers could justify the same and could prove that the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are not tainted. This is the effect of the inclusion in the proposal to amend the phrase "justifiable grounds." There are instances where there are no media people or representatives from the DOJ available and the absence of these witnesses should not automatically invalidate the drug operation conducted. Even the presence of a public local elected official also is sometimes impossible especially if the elected official is afraid or scared.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br></blockquote>However, under the original provision of Section 21 and its IRR, which is applicable at the time the petitioner committed the crime charged, the apprehending team was required to immediately conduct a physical inventory and photograph the drugs after their seizure and confiscation in the presence of no less than <b>three (3) witnesses</b>, namely: (a) a representative from the media, <u><b>and</b></u> (b) the DOJ, <u><b>and</b></u>; (c) any elected public official who shall be required to sign copies of the inventory and be given copy thereof. The presence of the three witnesses was intended as a guarantee against planting of evidence and frame up, as they were "necessary to insulate the apprehension and incrimination proceedings from any taint of illegitimacy or irregularity."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>The prosecution bears the burden of proving a valid cause for non-compliance with the procedure laid down in Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165, as amended. It has the positive duty to demonstrate observance thereto in such a way that during the trial proceedings, it must initiate in acknowledging and justifying any perceived deviations from the requirements of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Its failure to follow the mandated procedure must be adequately explained, and must be proven as a fact in accordance with the rules on evidence. It should take note that the rules require that the apprehending officers do not simply mention a justifiable ground, but also clearly state this ground in their sworn affidavit, coupled with a statement on the steps they took to preserve the integrity of the seized items.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Strict adherence to Section 21 is required where the quantity of illegal drugs seized is minuscule, since it is highly susceptible to planting, tampering or alteration of evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>In this case, the prosecution never alleged and proved that the presence of all the required witnesses was not obtained for any of the following reasons, such as: (1) <b>their attendance was impossible because the place of arrest was a remote area;</b> (2) <b>their safety during the inventory and photograph of the seized drugs were threatened by an immediate retaliatory action of the accused or any person/s acting for and in his/her behalf;</b> (3) <b>the elected official themselves were involved in the punishable acts sought to be apprehended;</b> (4) <b>earnest efforts to secure the presence of a DOJ or media representative and an elected public official within the period required under Article 125</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> <b>of the Revised Penal Code prove futile through no fault of the arresting officers, who face the threat of being charged with arbitrary detention;</b> or (5) <b>time constraints and urgency of the anti-drug operations, which often rely on tips of confidential assets, prevented the law enforcers from obtaining the presence of the required witnesses even before the offenders could escape</b>.<br><br>Invocation of the disputable presumptions that the police officers regularly performed their official duty and that the integrity of the evidence is presumed to be preserved, will not suffice to uphold petitioner's conviction. Judicial reliance on the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty despite the lapses in the procedures undertaken by the agents of the law is fundamentally flawed because the lapses themselves are affirmative proofs of irregularity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> The presumption may only arise when there is a showing that the apprehending officer/team followed the requirements of Section 21 or when the saving clause found in the IRR is successfully triggered. In this case, the presumption of regularity had been contradicted and overcome by evidence of non-compliance with the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>At this point, it is not amiss to express my position regarding the issue of which between the Congress and the Judiciary has jurisdiction to determine sufficiency of compliance with the rule on chain of custody, which essentially boils down to the application of procedural rules on admissibility of evidence. In this regard, I agree with the view of Hon. Associate Justice Teresita J. Leonardo-De Castro in <i>People v. Teng Moner y Adam</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> that "if the evidence of illegal drugs was not handled precisely in the manner prescribed by the chain of custody rule, the consequence relates not to inadmissibility that would automatically destroy the prosecution's case but rather to the weight of evidence presented for each particular case." As aptly pointed out by Justice Leonardo-De Castro, the Court's power to promulgate judicial rules, including rules of evidence, is no longer shared by the Court with Congress.<br><br>I subscribe to the view of Justice Leonardo-De Castro that the chain of custody rule is a matter of evidence and a rule of procedure, and that the Court has the last say regarding the appreciation of evidence. Evidentiary matters are indeed well within the powers of courts to appreciate and rule upon, and so, when the courts find appropriate, substantial compliance with the chain of custody rule as long as the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items have been preserved may warrant the conviction of the accused.<br><br>I further submit that <b>the requirements of marking the seized items, conduct of inventory and taking photograph in the presence of a representative from the media or the DOJ and a local elective official, are police investigation procedures which call for administrative sanctions in case of non-compliance. Violation of such procedure may even merit penalty under R.A. No. 9165</b>, to wit:<br><blockquote><b>Section 29.</b> <i>Criminal Liability for Planting of Evidence.</i> - Any person who is found guilty of "planting" any dangerous drug and/or controlled precursor and essential chemical, regardless of quantity and purity, shall suffer the penalty of death.<br><br><b>Section 32.</b> <i>Liability to a Person Violating Any Regulation Issued by the Board.</i> - The penalty of imprisonment ranging from six (6) months and one (1) day to four (4) years and a fine ranging from Ten thousand pesos (P10,000.00) to Fifty thousand pesos (P50,000.00) shall be imposed upon any person found violating any regulation duly issued by the Board pursuant to this Act, in addition to the administrative sanctions imposed by the Board.<br></blockquote>However, non-observance of such police administrative procedures should not affect the validity of the seizure of the evidence, because the issue of chain of custody is ultimately anchored on the admissibility of evidence, which is exclusively within the prerogative of the courts to decide in accordance with the rules on evidence.<br><br><hr width="60%" align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> "<i>AN ACT INSTITUTING THE COMPREHENSIVE DANGEROUS DRUGS ACT OF 2002, REPEALING REPUBLIC ACT NO. 6425, OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE DANGEROUS DRUGS ACT OF 1972, AS AMENDED, PROVIDING FUNDS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES</i>"<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Sec. 21. <i>Custody and Disposition of Confiscated, Seized, and/or Surrendered Dangerous Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous Drugs,&nbsp; Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, Instruments/Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment</i>. - The PDEA shall take charge and have custody of all dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, as well as instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment so confiscated, seized and/or surrendered, for proper disposition in the following manner:<br><br>(1) The apprehending team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof;<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> <i>People v.
