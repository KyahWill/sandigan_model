Exploration of the area led to the drilling of the Camago-Malampaya natural gas reservoir about 80 kilometers from the main island of Palawan and 30 kms from the platform.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>The nearest point of the Camago-Malampaya production area is at a distance of 93.264 kms or 50.3585 nautical miles to the Kalayaan Island Group (Kalayaan); 55.476 kms or 29.9546 nm to mainland Palawan (Nacpan Point, south of Patuyo Cove, Municipality of El Nido); and 48.843 kms or 26.9546 nm to the Province of Palawan (northwest of Tapiutan Island, Municipality of El Nido).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>The quantity of natural gas contained in the Camago-Malampaya was estimated to be sufficient to justify the pursuit of gas-to-power projects having an aggregate power-generating capacity of approximately 3,000 megawatts operating at baseload for 20 to 25 years.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Service Contract No. 38, as clarified by the Memorandum of Clarification between the same parties dated December 11, 1990, provides for a production sharing scheme whereby the National Government was entitled to receive an amount equal to sixty percent (60%) of the net proceeds<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> from the sale of petroleum (including natural gas) produced from petroleum operations while SPEX/OXY, as service contractor, was entitled to receive an amount equal to forty percent (40%) of the net proceeds.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>The Contractor was subsequently composed of the consortium of SPEX, Shell Philippines LLC, Chevron Malampaya LLC and Philippine National Oil Company-Exploration Corporation (PNOC-EC).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br><b>Administrative Order No. 381</b><br><br>On February 17, 1998, President Fidel V.

Viray wrote Palawan Governor Salvador P. Socrates, requesting for the deferment of payment of 50% of Palawan's share in the project for the first seven years of operations, estimated at US$222.89 Million, which it would use to pay for the National Power Corporation's Take-or-Pay Quantity (TOPQ) obligations under the latter's Gas Sale and Purchase Agreements with SPEX/OXY.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>On October 16, 2001, the Camago-Malampaya natural gas project was inaugurated.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br><b>Palawan's Claim</b><br><br>The Provincial Government of Palawan asserted its claim over forty percent (40%) of the National Government's share in the proceeds of the project. It argued that since the reservoir is located within its territorial jurisdiction, it is entitled to said share under Section 290<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> of the Local Government Code. The National Government disputed the claim, arguing that since the gas fields were approximately 80 k.ms from Palawan's coastline, they are outside the territorial jurisdiction of the province and is within the national territory of the Philippines.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Negotiations took place between the National Government and the Provincial Government of Palawan on the sharing of the proceeds from the project, with the former proposing to give Palawan 20% of said proceeds after tax. The negotiations, however, were unsuccessful. On March 14, 2003, in a letter to the Secretaries of the Department of Energy (DoE), the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) and the Department of Finance (DoF), Palawan Governor Mario Joel T. Reyes (Governor Reyes) reiterated his province's demand for the release of its 40% share. Attached to said letter was Resolution No. 5340-03<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> of the <i>Sangguniang Panlalawigan</i> of Palawan calling off further negotiations with the National Government and authorizing Governor Reyes to engage legal services to prosecute the province's claim.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br><b>Civil Case No. 3779</b><br><br>On May 7, 2003, the Provincial Government of Palawan filed a petition<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> for declaratory relief before the RTC of Palawan and Puerto Princesa against DoE Secretary Vicente S. Perez, Jr., DoF Secretary Jose Isidro N. Camacho and DBM Secretary Emilia T. Boncodin (Department Secretaries), docketed as Civil Case No. 3779. It sought judicial determination of its rights under A.O. No. 381 (1998), Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7611<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> or the Strategic Environmental Plan (SEP) for Palawan Act, Section 290 of R.A. No. 7160<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> or the Local Government Code of 1991 (Local Government Code), and Provincial Ordinance No. 474<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> (series of 2000). It asked the RTC to declare that the Camago-Malampaya natural gas reservoir is part of the territorial jurisdiction of the Province of Palawan and that the Provincial Government of Palawan was entitled to receive 40% of the National Government's share in the proceeds of the Camago-Malampaya natural gas project.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Commenting on the petition, the Republic maintained that Palawan was not entitled to the 40% share because the Camago-Malampaya reservoir is outside its territorial jurisdiction. It postulated that Palawan's territorial jurisdiction is limited to its land area and to the municipal waters within 15 km from its coastline. It denied being estopped by the acts of government officials who earlier acknowledged Palawan's share in the proceeds of the project.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br><b>The Interim Agreement</b><br><br>On February 9, 2005, DoE Secretary Vincent S. Perez, Jr., DBM Secretary Mario L. Relampagos and DoF Secretary Juanita D. Amatong, with authority from President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, executed an Interim Agreement<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> with the Province of Palawan, represented by its Governor Reyes. The agreement provided for the equal sharing between the National Government and the Province of Palawan of 40% of (a) the funds already remitted to the National Government under Service Contract No. 38 and (b) the funds to be remitted to the National Government up the earlier of (i) the effective date of the final and executory judgment on the petition by a court of competent jurisdiction on Civil Case No. 3779, or (ii) June 30, 2010. The parties also agreed that the amount of P600 Million, which was previously released to the Province of Palawan under E.O. Nos. 254 and 254-A, would be deducted from the initial release of the province's 50% share. Furthermore, the release of funds under the agreement would be without prejudice to the respective positions of the parties . in any legal dispute regarding the territorial jurisdiction over the Camago-Malampaya area. Should Civil Case No. 3779 be decided with finality in favor of either party, the Interim Agreement treated the share which the prevailing party has received as financial assistance to the other.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>The Province of Palawan claims that the National Government failed to fulfill their commitments under the Interim Agreement and that it has not received its stipulated share since it was signed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br><center><b>The RTC Rulings in Civil Case No. 3779</b><br></center><br>On December 16, 2005, the RTC decided Civil Case No. 3779 in favor of the Province of Palawan, disposing as follows:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Court declares that the province of Palawan is entitled to the 40% share of the national wealth pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 7, Article X of the 1987 Constitution and this right is in accord with the provisions of the Enabling Act, R.A. 7160 (The Local Government Code of 1991), computed based on revenues generated from the Camago-Malampaya Natural Gas Project since October 16, 2001.<br><br><b>IT IS SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br></blockquote>The RTC held that it was "unthinkable" to limit Palawan's territorial jurisdiction to its landmass and municipal waters considering that the Local Government Code empowered them to protect the environment, and R.A. No. 7611 adopted a comprehensive framework for the sustainable development of Palawan compatible with protecting and enhancing the natural resources and endangered environment of the province.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Applying the principles of decentralization and devolution of powers to local government units (LGUs) as recognized in the 1987 Constitution, the RTC explained that the State's resources must be shared with the LGUs if they were expected to deliver basic services to their constituents and to discharge their functions as agents of the State in enforcing laws, preserving the integrity of the national territory and protecting the environment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>The RTC rejected the Department Secretaries' reliance on the cases of <i>Tan v. COMELEC</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> and <i>Laguna Lake Development Authority v. CA</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> (<i>LLDA</i>) in arguing that territorial jurisdiction refers only to landmass. The RTC held that the cases were inapplicable as <i>Tan</i> was an election controversy involving the creation of a new province while <i>LLDA</i> merely highlighted the primacy of the said agency's Charter over the Local Government Code. The 1950 case of <i>Municipality of Paoay v. Manaois</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> where a municipality was declared as holding only a usufruct, not exclusive. ownership, over the municipal waters, was also held to be inapplicable since it was rendered before the principle of local autonomy was instituted in the 1987 Constitution and the Local Government Code.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>The RTC further declared that the Regalian Doctrine could not be used by the Department Secretaries as a shield to defeat the Constitutional provision giving LGUs an equitable share in the proceeds of the utilization and development of national wealth within their respective areas. The doctrine, said the RTC, is subject to this Constitutional limitation and the 40% LGU share set by the Local Government Code.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Finally, the RTC noted that from 1992 to 1998, Palawan received a total of P116,343,197.76 from collections derived from the West Linapacan Oil Fields, and that former President Fidel V. Ramos issued A.O. No. 381 acknowledging Palawan's claim and share in the proceeds of the Camago-­Malampaya project. The RTC, thus, held that by its previous actions and issuances, the National Government legally acknowledged Palawan's claim to the proceeds of the Camago-Malampaya project and it was "too late in the day for [it] to take a 180 degree turn."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>On December 29, 2005, the Provincial Government of Palawan filed a motion to require the Secretaries of the DoE, DoF and DBM to render a full accounting of actual payments made by SPEX to the Bureau of Treasury from October 1, 2001 to December 2005, and to freeze and/or place Palawan's 40% share in an escrow account.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>On January 4, 2006, the aforesaid Secretaries filed an urgent manifestation asserting that the motion was premature and should not be heard by the RTC because the Republic still had fifteen (15) days to appeal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>The Provincial Government of Palawan countered that pending finality of the December 16, 2005 Decision, there was a need to secure its 40% share over which it had a "vested and inchoate right."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>The RTC subsequently issued an Order which was erroneously dated December 16, 2006 and later amended to indicate the date as January 16, 2006.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> The dispositive portion of the Amended Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the public respondents individually or collectively DIRECTED within ten (10) days from receipt of this Order pursuant to a "Freeze Order" hereby granted by this Court:<br><br>a.

Mandanas v. Hon. Romulo</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> where, after sharing with the Province of Palawan collections from the West Linapacan oil fields from 1992 to 1998, the National Government "turned its back on its legal commitment to the former." The trial court stressed that the local government of Palawan was merely preempting any possible dissipation of funds that would render any judgment favorable to it an empty victory.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>On February 6, 2006, the Department Secretaries filed a motion for reconsideration<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> of the Amended Order dated January 16, 2006.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br><b>G.R.

In the same petition, the Republic, in anticipation of the RTC's denial of its motion for reconsideration, also assailed the January 16, 2006 Amended Order <i>ad cautelam</i>, ascribing grave abuse of discretion to the RTC for granting affirmative relief in a special civil action for declaratory relief.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>On June 6, 2006, the RTC in its Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> lifted its January 16, 2006 Order, holding that:<br><blockquote>[A] becoming sense of modesty on the part of this Court, compels it to defer to the Supreme Court's First Division as the Movants have deviously appealed to the High Court the very issues raised in the Motion for Reconsideration now pending before this Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br></blockquote>The dispositive portion of the RTC's June 6, 2006 Order, thus, reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Amended Order dated January 16, 2006 is hereby LIFTED and SET ASIDE to await final determination thereof in view of the Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i> filed by Movants in this case directly with the Supreme Court.<br><br>IT IS SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br></blockquote>Consequently, the Republic manifested to the Court that its <i>ad cautelam</i> arguments relative to the Amended Order dated January 16, 2006 need no longer be resolved unless the Provincial Government of Palawan raised the same in its comment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br><b>The Provisional Implementation Agreement</b><br><br>On July 25, 2007, the duly authorized representatives of the National Government and the Province of Palawan, with the conformity of the Representatives of the Congressional Districts of Palawan, agreed on a Provisional Implementation Agreement (PIA) that allowed 50% of the disputed 40% of the Net Government Share in the proceeds of Service Contract No. 38 to be utilized for the immediate and effective implementation of development projects for the people of Palawan.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br><b>E.O.

The Third Division's Clerk of Court also informed them that the records of G.R. No. 170867 were unavailable as the case had already been submitted to the <i>ponente</i> for resolution. Though unable to obtain a copy of the PIA, they submitted a copy of Service Contract No. 38 which they supposedly secured from "unofficial sources." Considering the difficulty they allegedly encountered in obtaining the documents, they asked the CA to direct DoE Secretary Reyes and Executive Secretary Ermita to submit a copy of the petition in G.R.

An LGU's territorial jurisdiction refers only to its land area.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><blockquote>1.1. Since Section 7 of the Local Government Code uses "population" and "land area" as indicators in the creation and conversion of LGUs, it follows that the territorial jurisdiction is the land where the people live and excludes seas or marine areas.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br></blockquote><blockquote>1.2. In describing the territorial requirement for a province, Section 461(a)(i) of the Local Government Code speaks of "a contiguous territory, as certified by the Lands Management Bureau" while Section 461(b) of the same law provides that "the territory need not be contiguous if it comprises two (2) or more islands," indicating that "territory" is limited to the landmass.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br></blockquote><blockquote>1.3. "Territory" as used in Section 461 of the Local Government Code and "land area" as used in Section 7 of the same law, must be attested to by the Lands Management Bureau which has jurisdiction only over land areas.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br></blockquote><blockquote>1.4. In Tan,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> the Court interpreted "territory" to refer only to the mass of land above sea water and excludes the waters over which the political unit exercises control.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> The RTC erred in holding that Tan is not applicable when it also involved the issue of whether the province should include the waters around it. Tan applies whether the purpose is the creation of a province or the determination of its territorial jurisdiction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup><br></blockquote>2. The area referred to under Section 7, Article X of the 1987 Constitution, which grants LGUs a share in the proceeds of the utilization and development of national wealth within their respective areas, refers .to the territorial boundaries of the LGU as defined in its charter and not to its exercise of jurisdiction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br><blockquote>2.1. As examples of such national wealth, members of the 1986 Constitutional Commission referred to natural resources found inland or onshore, even when offshore explorations were being conducted years before the Commission was formed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br></blockquote><blockquote>2.2. The Local Government Code provides that the territorial jurisdiction of municipalities, cities and barangays should be identified by metes and bounds, thus confirming that "territorial jurisdiction" refers to the LOU's territorial boundaries.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup><br></blockquote>3. The Camago-Malampaya reservoir is outside the territorial boundaries of the Province of Palawan as defined in its Charter. Under said Charter, Palawan's territory is composed only of islands.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br><br>4. On municipal waters:</div><div align="JUSTIFY"><blockquote>4.1. As argued in the petition: Assuming an LGU's territory includes the waters around its land area, the same should refer only to the municipal waters as defined under Section 131(r) of the Local Government Code and Section 4.58<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> of R.A.

In defining "municipal waters," Section 131(r) of the Local Government Code only includes marine waters within fifteen (15) kms from the coastline. Section 4.58 of R.A. No. 8550 gives a similar definition of "municipal waters."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup><br></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>4.1.2. Under Sections 6 and 7 of R.A. No. 8550, it is the Department of Agriculture, through the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, that has jurisdiction over Philippine waters beyond the 15-km limit of municipal waters, with respect to the issuance of license, charging of fees and access to fishery resources.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup><br></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>4.1.3. Section 16 of R.A. No. 8550 provides that the jurisdiction of a municipal or city government extends only to the municipal waters, while Section 65 of the same law provides that the enforcement of laws and the formulation of rules, except in municipal waters, are vested in the National Government.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup><br></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>4.1.4. Thus, the LGUs' authority may be enforced only within the 15-km limit of the municipal waters. Beyond it, jurisdiction rests with the National Government through the Philippine Navy, Philippine Coast Guard, Philippine National Police-Maritime Command, and the Department of Agriculture in their respective areas of concern.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup><br></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>4.1.5. It was held in Municipality of Paoay<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> that a municipality's right over municipal waters consists merely of usufruct. Contrary to the RIC's pronouncement, the decision in said case remains good law since nothing in the 1987 Constitution overthrew the principle that the State owns all natural resources whether found on land or under the sea.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup><br></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>4.1.6. Even assuming that the LGU's territory extends 'to the municipal waters, the Camago-Malampaya natural gas reservoir is located approximately 80 kms from mainland Palawan, thus, way beyond the 15-km radius.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup><br></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote>4.2. As argued in the Memorandum: Under the Local Government Code, the 15-km municipal waters and beyond, including the continental margin, do not' form part of the territory of an LGU.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup><br></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>4.2.1. In <i>Tan</i>, the Court excluded from the territory of the political unit the "waters over which [it] exercises control" or the municipal waters.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup><br></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>4.2.3. The Local Government Code and the Philippine Fisheries Code did not redefine and extend the territorial jurisdiction of LGUs to include the 15-km municipal waters. Instead, they merely granted "extraterritorial" jurisdiction over the municipal waters, which is limited only to the waters, excluding the seabed, subsoil and continental shelf; to fishery and aquatic resources, excluding other resources; and to revenue generation and regulation of said resources.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup><br></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>4.2.4. Other than the 15-km municipal waters, the Local Government Code did not vest jurisdiction beyond the LGU's territorial boundaries.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup><br></blockquote></blockquote>5. Under the Archipelagic and Regalian Doctrines enshrined in the 1987 Constitution, the maritime area between Kalayaan and mainland Palawan belongs to the national territory and does not pertain to any local government unit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup><br><blockquote>5.1. The fact that a territorial sea belongs to the internal waters of a coastal State does not necessarily imply that it belongs to the province or local government closest to it. R.A. No. 3046, entitled An Act to Define the Baselines of the Territorial Sea of the Philippines, as amended by R.A. No. 5446, which defines the State's "internal waters," does not expressly state that the internal waters should also belong to the LGU.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup><br></blockquote><blockquote>5.2. The Archipelagic Doctrine, as enunciated in the UNCLOS and affirmed in Article I of the 1987 Constitution, pertains to the sovereign state and does not place within the territory of LGUs the waters between and surrounding its islands. Nowhere in international or domestic law does it state that said doctrine applies in pari materia to LGUs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup><br></blockquote><blockquote>5.3. The application of the Archipelagic Doctrine to a political ·subdivision will encroach on territories that belong to the State. Section 3 of the Water Code provides that "all waters belong to the State" and Section 5 of the same law specifies that "seawater belongs to the State." So also, while the definition of Philippine waters under the Philippine Fisheries Code acknowledges that waters may exist in political subdivisions, nothing therein implies that such waters form part of the territory of the LGU. Furthermore, said definition treats the waters connecting the islands as a separate group from the waters existing in the political subdivisions, implying that waters between islands are not deemed found in LGUs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup><br></blockquote><blockquote>5.4. The Regalian Doctrine, as embodied in Section 2, Article XII of the 1987 Constitution, is all encompassing; thus, it behooves the claimant to present proof of title before his right is recognized. Without a specific and unmistakable grant by the State, the property remains to be that of the State and the LGU cannot claim an area to be part of its territorial jurisdiction. Inclusion of any land or water as part of Palawan's territory must be expressly provided by law and not merely inferred by vague and ambiguous construction. Statutes in derogation of authority should be construed in favor of the State and should not be permitted to divest it of any of its rights or prerogatives unless the legislature expressly intended otherwise.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup><br></blockquote><blockquote>5.5. In a number of cases involving conflicting claims of the United States Federal Government and the coastal states over natural wealth found within the latter's adjoining maritime area, the Supreme Court of the United States of America (U.S.), applying the Federal Paramountcy Doctrine, consistently ruled on the fundamental right of the national government over the national wealth in maritime areas, to the exclusion of the coastal state. The reason behind the doctrine equally applies to the conflicting claims between the Philippine National Government and the Province of Palawan. In fact, there are more reasons to apply the doctrine in the Philippines since unlike the individual states of the America which preexisted the U.S., the LGUs are creations and agents of the Philippine National Government.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup><br></blockquote>6. The inclusion of the Kalayaan Group of Islands (Kalayaan) to the Province of Palawan under Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1596<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup> did not <i>ipso facto</i> make the waters between Kalayaan and the main island of Palawan part of the territorial jurisdiction of Palawan.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup><br><blockquote>6.1. There is nothing in P.D. No. 1596, or the charter of Palawan, Act No. 1396, that states that the waters around Kalayaan are part of Palawan's territory. P.D. No. 1596 refers to Kalayaan as a cluster of islands and islets while Act No. 1396 identifies the islands included in the Province of Palawan. Thus, the areas referred to are limited to the landmass. Since the Camago-Malampaya reservoir is not an island, it cannot possibly be covered by either statute. More importantly, the reservoir is outside the geographical lines mentioned in said laws.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup><br></blockquote><blockquote>6.2. Absent an express grant by Congress, the Province of Palawan cannot validly claim that the area between mainland Palawan and Kalayaan are automatically part of its territorial jurisdiction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup><br></blockquote>7. Section 1, Article X of the 1987 Constitution provides that the territorial and political subdivisions of the Republic are the provinces, cities, municipalities and barangays. It, however, does not require that every portion of the Philippine territory be made part of the territory of an LOU. It was intended merely to institutionalize the LGUs. And even on the supposition that the Constitution intended to apportion the Philippine territory to the LGUs, legislation is still needed to implement said provision. However, no law has been enacted to divide the Philippine territory, including its continental margin and exclusive . economic zones, to all LGUs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup><br><br>8. Palawan's territorial boundaries do not embrace the continental shelf where the Camago-Malampaya reservoir is located. Contrary to Dean Raul Pangalagan's view, the UNCLOS cannot be considered to have vested the LGUs with their own continental shelf based on the doctrine of transformation. The concept of continental shelf under the UNCLOS does not automatically apply to a province.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup><br><blockquote>8.1. A treaty is an agreement between states and governs the legal relations between nations. And even if the UNCLOS were to be deemed transformed as part of municipal law after its ratification by the Batasang Pambansa in 1984 under Resolution No. 121, it did not automatically amend the Local Government Code and the charters of the LGUs. No such intent is manifest either in the UNCLOS nor Resolution No. 121. Instead, the UNCLOS, as transformed into our municipal law, is to be applied <i>verba legis</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup><br></blockquote><blockquote>8.2. Under the express terms of the UNCLOS, the rights and duties over maritime zones and the continental shelf pertain to the State, and no provision therein suggests any reference to an LGU.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup><br></blockquote><blockquote>8.3. In other sovereign states such as Canada and the U.S., the maritime zones were ruled to be outside the LGUs' territorial jurisdiction. The Federal Paramountcy Doctrine was upheld in four leading U.S. cases where the claims of various U.S. coastal states over the marginal and coastal waters and the continental shelf were rejected.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup><br></blockquote>9. The State is not estopped by the alleged mistakes of its officials or agents.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup><br><blockquote>9.1. On June 10, 1988, the DoE requested the Province of Palawan for a seven-year deferment of payment to enable the National Government to pay a portion of NPC's TOPQ obligations. On February 17, 1998, President Ramos issued A.O. No. 381 which projected US$2.1 Billion as Palawan's share from the Camago­-Malampaya project. Although they seem to acknowledge Palawan's share in the proceeds of the Camago-Malampaya project, they cannot contravene the laws that delineate Palawan's territorial jurisdiction. Furthermore, the President has no authority to expand the territorial jurisdiction of a province as this can only be done by Congress.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup><br></blockquote><blockquote>9.2. In issuing A.O. No. 381, President Ramos made no misrepresentation as to give rise to estoppel. The statements in said A.O. were not calculated to mislead the Province of Palawan; they were not even directed to Palawan. No estoppel can be invoked if the complaining party has not been misled to his prejudice. There is no proof that the Province of Palawan sustained injury as a result of a misrepresentation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup><br></blockquote><blockquote>9.3. The doctrine of estoppel should be applied only in extraordinary circumstances and should not be given effect beyond what is necessary to accomplish justice between the parties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup><br></blockquote><blockquote>9.4. The doctrine of estoppel does not preclude the correction of an erroneous construction by the officer himself, by his successor in office, or by the court in an appropriate case. An erroneous construction creates no vested right and cannot be taken as precedent.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup><br></blockquote><blockquote>9.5. Accordingly, the Province of Palawan cannot rely on the fact that in 1992, they shared in the proceeds derived from the West Linapacan oil fields located approximately 76 kms off the western coastline of Palawan.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[121]</sup><br></blockquote><blockquote>9.6. The public funds available for various projects in other provinces would be significantly reduced if Palawan is allowed to receive its claimed 40% share in the Camago-Malampaya project.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup><br></blockquote>10. Ordinance No. 474, series of 2000, enacted by the <i>Sangguniang Panlalawigan</i> of Palawan and delineating the territorial jurisdiction of the province to include the Camago-Malampaya area, is <i>ultra vires</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup><br><blockquote>10.1. Ordinance No. 474 conflicts with the Charter of the Province of Palawan as it expanded the boundaries of the province and included the area between its constituent islands. It is also in conflict with the limits of LGUs' rights over marine areas under the Local Government Code, the Fisheries Code and other pertinent laws.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[124]</sup><br></blockquote><blockquote>10.2. An LGU cannot fix its territorial jurisdiction, or limit or expand the same through an ordinance. Pursuant to Section 10, Article X of the 1987 Constitution and Sections 6 and 10 of the Local Government Code, only Congress can create, divide or merge LGUs and alter their boundaries, subject to the plebiscite requirement. An ordinance cannot contravene the Constitution or any statute.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[125]</sup><br></blockquote><blockquote>10.3. As plotted by the National Mapping and Resource Information Authority (NAMRIA), the territorial boundaries of Palawan under Ordinance No. 474 appear to be inconsistent with the delineation of the Philippine territory under the Treaty of Paris.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[126]</sup><br></blockquote>11. Section 3(1) of R.A. No. 7611 or SEP for Palawan Act contains a definition of "Palawan." The Camago-Malampaya reservoir is undoubtedly within the area described and plotted on the map. However, R.A. No. 7611 did not redefine Palawan's territory or amend its charter.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[127]</sup><br><blockquote>11.1. With the words "(A)s used in this Act," Section 3 of R.A.

Just like Palawan's Charter, Section 3(1) of R.A.

The basis of the description of Palawan is unclear and there is no record that the alteration in Palawan's boundaries complied with Section 10, Article X of the 1987 Constitution which requires that the alteration be in accordance with the criteria established in the local government code and approved by a majority of the votes cast in a plebiscite in the political unit(s) directly affected.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[131]</sup><br></blockquote><blockquote>11.5. Based on the Declaration of Policy in R.A. No. 7611, the object of the law is not to expand the territory of Palawan but to make the province an agent of the National Government in the protection of the environment. There is nothing in the title of the law or any of its provisions indicating that there was a legislative intent to expand or alter the boundaries of the province or to remove certain municipalities from its territory.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[132]</sup><br></blockquote><blockquote>11.6. If the description of Palawan under R.A. No. 7611 would be read as a new definition of its territory, it would be unconstitutional because the title .of the law does not indicate that boundaries would be expanded, in contravention of the Constitutional requirement that every bill must embrace only one subject to be expressed in its title.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[133]</sup><br></blockquote><blockquote>11.7. Even if the term "territorial jurisdiction" were to be understood as including the grant of limited extraterritorial jurisdiction, the Camago-Malampaya reservoir remains to be beyond Palawan's jurisdiction under R.A. No. 7611. The said law did not expand the province's police or administrative jurisdiction; it did not impose any additional function or jurisdiction on the Province of Palawan. If anything, the SEP limited the province's governmental authority since all LGUs in the area must align their projects and budgets with the SEP. Furthermore, tasked to implement the SEP was not the province but the Palawan Council for Sustainable Development (PCSD), a national agency created under the law, composed of both national and local officials. The participation of local officials did not turn PCSD into an arm of the Province of Palawan; their inclusion is to allow a holistic view of the environmental issues and opportunities for coordination.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[134]</sup><br></blockquote>12. A.O. No. 381 was not issued to redefine Palawan's territory; its title precisely states that it was issued to provide for the fulfillment by the National Power Corporation of its obligations under the December 30, 1997 Agreement for Sale and Purchase of Natural Gas with SPEX/OXY and for the compliance of the National Government's performance undertaking. Palawan was mentioned but not in the context of redefining its territory. Only a statute can expand the territory or boundaries of an LGU.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[135]</sup><br><br>13. Sections 465 and 468 of the Local Government Code which respectively authorize the Provincial Governor to adopt measures to safeguard marine resources of the province and the <i>Sangguniang Panlalawigan</i> to impose penalties for destructive fishing, did not give the provinces government authority over marine resources beyond the municipal waters.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[136]</sup><br><br>14. Palawan's Claim that it exercises jurisdiction over the Camago­-Malampaya area is bereft of credible proof.

The proposition of the <i>amici curiae</i> that the principle of equity justifies granting Palawan 40% of the government's share in the Camago-­Malampaya project, may set a dangerous precedent. Furthermore, the principle of equity cannot be applied when there is a law applicable to the case. Applicable to the instant case are Section 7, Article X of the 1987 Constitution and Section 290 of the Local Government Code based on which the Province of Palawan is not entitled to share in the proceeds of the Camago-Malampaya project.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[138]</sup><br><blockquote>15.1. The concerns of the <i>amici curiae</i> appear to rest on the possible damage to the environment surrounding Palawan.

The PIA and E.O. No. 683 do not constitute evidence of the Republic's admission that Palawan is entitled to the proceeds of the Camago-Malampaya project. In civil cases, an offer of compromise is not admissible in evidence against the offeror. Furthermore, the whereas clauses of E.O. No. 683 clearly show that the President issued the E.O. based on a "broad perspective of the requirements to develop Palawan as a major tourism destination" and Section 25 of the Local Government Code which authorizes the President, on the LGU's request, to provide financial assistance to the LGU. The E.O. also expressly states that the amounts released shall be without prejudice to the final resolution of the legal dispute between the National Government and the Province of Palmvan regarding the latter's claimed share under the Service Contract No. 38.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[140]</sup><br><br>17.

Under Section 292 of the Local Government Code, the city or municipality gets 45% and the barangay gets 35%, or a combined share of 80% as against the Province's share of only 20%.

The PIA reduces the share of Palawan's LGUs in two ways: <i>first</i>, by making "net proceeds" the basis for sharing instead of "gross collection" as provided by Section 290 of the Local Government Code; and <i>second</i>, by cutting down the LGUs' equitable share in such proceeds by half, with the Province solely claiming such allocation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[148]</sup><br><br>4.

E.O. No. 683 fails to consider its implications on the country's claim to an Extended Continental Shelf (ECS) under the UNCLOS III regime. The best way to claim an ECS is to consider the Camago-­Malampaya area and the Kalayaan tb be part of Palawan's continental shelf. One basis for the Philippine claim to Kalayaan is that it constitutes a natural prolongation of Palawan's land territory.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[157]</sup><br><br>11. The Republic's invocation of U.S. case law to dispute the LGUs' entitlement under Section 7, Article X of the 1987 Constitution is inappropriate and odd for a unitary state like the Philippines.

The definition of "municipal waters" under applicable laws is irrelevant.

Another requisite - population - is determined as the total number of inhabitants within the territorial jurisdiction of the LGU.

Section 461 of the Local Government Code does not define the territorial jurisdiction of a province. It merely specifies the requisites for the creation of a province. In fact, said provision shows that territory and population are alternative requirements for the creation of a new province, with income being the indispensable requirement. It does not necessarily exclude the maritime area over which a province exercises control and authority, but merely provides that to detennine whether an area is sufficient to constitute a province, only the landmass or land territory shall be included.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[167]</sup><br><br>3. In <i>Tan</i>, which involves the creation of a province under the old Local Government Code, the Court held that the word "territory" as used in said law "has reference only to the mass of land area and excludes the waters over which the political unit exercises control." This ruling affirms that an LGU exercises control over waters, making them part of the political unit's territorial jurisdiction. Furthermore, <i>Tan</i> only defines the word "territory" as used in Section 197 of the old Local Government Code.

Section 468(1)(vi) empowers the <i>Sangguniang Panlalawigan</i> to protect the environment and impose appropriate penalties for acts that endanger it, such as dynamite fishing. More importantly, Section 3, which provides for the operative principles of decentralization and local autonomy, states that the vesting of duties in the LGU shall be accompanied with provision for reasonably adequate resources to effectively carry them out.

Contrarily, the Philippines had a unitary system of government until it adopted the ideas of decentralization and local autonomy as fundamental state principles. Instead of different states surrendering their <i>imperium</i> and <i>dominium</i> over the maritime area to a federal government, the Philippine setting works in the opposite as the National Government, which is presumed to own all resources within the Philippine territory, is mandated to share the proceeds of the national wealth with the LGUs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[193]</sup><br><br>15.

The Camago-Malampaya reservoir, which is part of the Philippines, must necessarily belong to a political and territorial subdivision.

The Province of Palawan is not claiming dominion over said area. It merely contends that since the reservoir is located in an area over which it exercises control and shares in the National Government's management responsibility, it is only just and equitable that the Province of Palawan should share in the proceeds generated from its utilization. Furthermore, the law does not require that the LGUs should own the area where the national wealth is located before they can share in the proceeds of its use and development; it merely requires that the national wealth be "found within their respective areas." It is, thus, error for the Republic to assert that the Camago-­Malampaya area is not part of Palawan's territorial jurisdiction because it belongs to the State. Otherwise, no LGU will share in the proceeds derived from the utilization and development of national wealth because the State owns it under the regalian doctrine.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[204]</sup><br></blockquote>17.

In furtherance of this State policy, the 1987 Constitution conferred on LGUs the power to create its own sources of revenue and the right to share not only in the national taxes, but also in the proceeds of the utilization of national wealth in their respective areas. Thus, Sections 5, 6, and 7 of Article X of the 1987 Constitution provides:<br><blockquote><b>Section 5.</b> Each local government unit shall have the power to create its own sources of revenues and to levy 'taxes, fees, and charges subject to such guidelines and limitations as the Congress may provide, consistent with the basic policy of local autonomy.

(Emphasis ours)<br></blockquote>At the center of this controversy is Section 7, an innovation in the 1987 Constitution aimed at giving fiscal autonomy to local governments. Deliberations of the 1986 Constitutional Commission reveal the rationale for this provision, thus:<br><blockquote>MR. OPLE. x x x<br><br>Just to cite specific examples, in the case of timberland within the area of jurisdiction of the Province of Quirino or the Province of Aurora, we feel that the local governments ought to share in whatever revenues are generated from this particular natural resource which is also considered a national resource in a proportion to be determined by Congress. This may mean sharing not with the local government but with the local population. The geothermal plant in the Machan, Makiling-Banahaw area in Laguna, the Tiwi Geothermal Plant in Albay, there is a sense in which the people in these areas, hosting the physical facility based on the resources found under the ground in their area which are considered national wealth, should participate in terms of reasonable rebates on the cost of power that they pay. This is true of the Maria Cristina area in Central Mindanao, for example. May I point out that in the previous government, this has always been a very nettlesome subject of the Cabinet debates. <b>Are the people in the locality, where God chose to locate His bounty, not entitled to some reasonable modest sharing of this with the national government? Why should the national government claim all the revenues arising from them?</b> And the usual reply of the technocrats at that time is that there must be uniform treatment of all citizens regardless of where God's gifts are located, whether below the ground or above the ground. This, of course, has led to popular disenchantment. In Albay, for example, the government then promised a 20-percent rebate in power because of the contributions of the Tiwi Plant to the Luzon grid. Although this was ordered, I remember that the Ministry of Finance, together with the National Power Corporation, refused to implement it. <b>There is a bigger economic principle behind this, the principle of equity. If God chose to locate the great rivers and sources of hydroelectric power in Iligan, in Central Mindanao, for example, or in the Cordillera, why should the national government impose fuel adjustment taxes in order to cancel out the comparative advantage given to the people in these localities through these resources?</b> So, it is in that sense that under Section 8, the local populations, if not the local governments, should have a share of whatever national proceeds may be realized from this natural wealth of the nation located within their jurisdictions.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>MR. NATIVIDAD. The history of local governments shows that the usual weaknesses of local governments are: 1) <b>fiscal inability to support itself</b>; 2) lack of sufficient authority to carry out its duties; and 3) lack of authority to appoint key officials.<br><br>Under this Article, are these traditional weaknesses of local governments addressed to [sic]?<br><br>MR.

To prevent this, this amendment which Commissioner Davide and I jointly propose will open up <b>a whole new source of local financial self-reliance by establishing a constitutional principle of local governments</b>, and their populations, sharing in the proceeds of national wealth in their areas of jurisdiction. The sharing with the national government can be in the form of shares from revenues, fees and charges levied on the exploitation or development and utilization of natural resources such as mines, hydro­ electric and geothermal facilities, timber, including rattan, fisheries, and processing industries based on indigenous raw materials.<br><br>But the sharing, Madam President, can also take the form of direct benefits to the population in terms of price advantages to the people where, say, cheaper electric power is sourced from a local hydroelectric or geothermal facility.

The same benefit can be extended to the people of Albay, for example, where volcanic steam in Tiwi provides 55 megawatts of cheap power to the Luzon grid.<br><br>The existing policy of slapping uniform fuel adjustment taxes to equalize rates throughout the country in the name of price standardization will have to yield to <b>a more rational pricing policy that recognizes the entitlement of local communities to the enjoyment of their own comparative advantage based on resources that God has given them</b>.

Thus, during the Senate deliberations on the proposed local government code, it was emphasized:<br><blockquote><b>Senator Gonzales.</b> The old concept of local autonomy, Mr. President, is, we grant more powers, more functions, more duties, more prerogatives, more responsibilities to local government units. But actually that is not autonomy. Because autonomy, without giving them the resources or the means in order that they can effectively carry out their enlarged duties and responsibilities, will be a sham autonomy. I understand that the Gentleman's concept of autonomy is really centered in not merely granting them more powers and more responsibilities, but also more means; meaning, funding, more powers to raise funds in order that they can put into effect whatever policies, decisions and programs that the local government may approve.

The question principally raised here is whether the national wealth, in this case the Camago-Malampaya reservoir, is within the Province of Palawan's "area" for it to be entitled to 40% of the government's share under Service Contract No. 38. The issue, therefore, hinges on what comprises the province's "area" which the Local Government Code has equated as its "territorial jurisdiction." While the Republic asserts that the term pertains to the LGU's territorial boundaries, the Province of Palawan construes it as wherever the LGU exercises jurisdiction.<br><br><b>Territorial jurisdiction refers to territorial boundaries as defined in the LGU's charter</b><br><br>The Local Government Code does not define the term "territorial jurisdiction."

This is also clear from other provisions of the Local Government Code, particularly Sections 292 and 294, on the allocation of LGUs' shares from the utilization of national wealth, which speak of the <i>location</i> of the natural resources:<br><blockquote><b>Section 292.</b> <i>Allocation of Shares</i>. - The share in the preceding<br><br>Section shall be distributed in the following manner:<br><br>(a) Where the natural resources are <b>located</b> in the province:<br><br>(1) Province - Twenty percent (20%);<br>(2) Component City/Municipality - Forty-five percent (45%); and<br>(3) Barangay - Thirty-five percent (35%)<br><br>Provided, however, That where the natural resources are <b>located</b> in two (2) or more provinces, or in two (2) or more component cities or municipalities or in two (2) or more barangays, their respective shares shall be computed on the basis of:<br><br>(1) Population - Seventy percent (70%); and<br>(2) Land area - Thirty percent (30%)<br><br>(b) Where the natural resources are <b>located</b> in a highly urbanized or independent component city:<br><br>(1) City - Sixty-five percent (65%); and<br>(2) Barangay - Thirty-five percent (35%)<br><br>Provided, however, That where the natural resources are <b>located</b> in such two (2) or more cities, the allocation of shares shall be based on the formula on population and land area as specified in paragraph (a) of this Section.<br><br><b>Section 294.</b> <i>Development and Livelihood Projects</i>. - The proceeds from the share of local government units pursuant to this chapter shall be appropriated by their respective <i>sanggunian</i> to finance local government and livelihood projects: Provided, however, That at least eighty percent (80%) of the proceeds derived from the development and utilization of hydrothermal, geothermal, and other sources of energy shall be applied solely to lower the cost of electricity in the local government unit <b>where such a source of energy is located</b>. (Emphasis ours)<br></blockquote>That "territorial jurisdiction" refers to the LGU's territorial boundaries is a construction reflective of the discussion of the framers of the 1987 Constitution who referred to the local government as the "locality" that is "hosting" the national resources and a "place where God chose to locate His bounty."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[230]</sup> It is also consistent with the language ultimately used by the Constitutional Commission when they referred to the national wealth as those found within (the LGU's) respective areas.

With its broadened powers and increased responsibilities, a local government unit must now operate on a much wider scale. More extensive operations, in turn, entail more expenses. Understandably, the vesting of duty, responsibility and accountability in every local government unit is accompanied with a provision for reasonably adequate resources to discharge its powers and effectively carry out its functions. Availment of such resources is effectuated through the vesting in every local government unit of (1) the right to create and broaden its own source of revenue; (2) the right to be allocated a just share in national taxes, such share being in the form of internal revenue allotments (IRAs); and (3) the right to be given its <b>equitable share in the proceeds of the utilization and development of the national wealth</b>, if any, within its <b>territorial boundaries</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[233]</sup> (Emphasis ours)<br></blockquote>An LGU has been defined as a political subdivision of the State which is constituted by law and possessed of substantial control over its own affairs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[234]</sup> LGUs, therefore, are creations of law. In this regard, Sections 6 and 7 of the Local Government Code provide:<br><blockquote><b>Section 6.</b> <i>Authority to Create Local Government Units</i>. - A local government unit may be <b>created</b>, divided, merged, abolished, or its boundaries substantially altered either <b>by law enacted by Congress</b> in the case of a province, city, municipality, or any other political subdivision, or <b>by ordinance</b> passed by the <i>sangguniang panlalawigan</i> or <i>sangguniang panlungsod</i> concerned in the case of a barangay located within its territorial jurisdiction, subject to such limitations and requirements prescribed in this Code.<br><br><b>Section 7.</b> <i>Creation and Conversion</i>. - As a general rule, the creation of a local government unit or its conversion from one level to another level shall be based on verifiable indicators of viability and projected capacity to provide services, to wit:<br><br>(a) Income. - It must be sufficient, based on acceptable standards, to provide for all essential government facilities and services and special functions commensurate with the size of its population, as expected of the local government unit concerned;<br><br>(b) Population. - It shall be determined as the total number of inhabitants within the territorial jurisdiction of the local government unit concerned; and<br><br>(c) Land Area. - It must be contiguous, unless it comprises two or more islands or is separated by a local government unit independent of the others; <b>properly identified by metes and bounds with technical descriptions</b>; and sufficient to provide for such basic services and facilities to meet the requirements of its populace.<br><br>Compliance with the foregoing indicators shall be attested to by the Department of Finance (DOF), the National Statistics Office (NSO), and the Lands Management Bureau (LMB) of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR).

COMELEC</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[235]</sup> stressed the need to demarcate the territorial boundaries of LGUs with certitude because they define the limits of the local governments' territorial jurisdiction. Reiterating this <i>dictum</i>, the Court, in <i>Municipality of Pateros v. Court of Appeals, et al.</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[236]</sup> held:<br><blockquote>[W]e reiterate what we already said about the <b>importance and sanctity of the territorial jurisdiction of an LGU</b>:<br><br><b>The importance of drawing with precise strokes the territorial boundaries of a local unit of government cannot be overemphasized. The boundaries must be clear for they define the limits of the territorial jurisdiction of a local government unit. It can legitimately exercise powers of government only within the limits of its territorial jurisdiction. Beyond these limits, its acts are <i>ultra vires</i>.</b> Needless to state, any uncertainty in the boundaries of local government units will sow costly conflicts in the exercise of governmental powers which ultimately will prejudice the people's welfare. This is the evil sought to be avoided by the Local Government Unit in requiring that <b>the land area of a local government unit must be spelled out in metes and bounds, with technical descriptions</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[237]</sup> (Emphasis ours)<br></blockquote>Clearly, therefore, a local government's territorial jurisdiction cannot extend beyond the boundaries set by its organic law.<br><br><b>Area as delimited by law and not exercise of jurisdiction as basis of the LGU's equitable share</b><br><br>The Court cannot subscribe to the argument posited by the Province of Palawan that the national wealth, the proceeds from which the State is mandated to share with the LGUs, shall be wherever the local government exercises any degree of jurisdiction.<br><br>An LGU's territorial jurisdiction is not necessarily co-extensive with its exercise or assertion of powers. To hold otherwise may result in condoning acts that are clearly <i>ultra vires</i>. It may lead to, in the words of the Republic, LGUs "rush[ing] to exercise its powers and functions in areas rich in natural resources (even if outside its boundaries) with the intention of seeking a share in the proceeds of its exploration"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[238]</sup> - a situation that "would sow conflict not only among the local government units and the national government but worse, between and among local government units."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[239]</sup><br><br>There is likewise merit in the Republic's assertion that Palawan's interpretation of what constitutes an LGU's territorial jurisdiction may produce absurd consequences. Indeed, there are natural resources, such as forests and mountains, which can be found within the LGU's territorial boundaries, but are, strictly speaking, under national jurisdiction, specifically that of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[240]</sup> To equate territorial jurisdiction to areas where the LGU exercises jurisdiction means that these natural resources will have to be excluded from the sharing scheme although they are geographically within the LGU's territoriallimits.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[241]</sup> The consequential incongruity of this scenario finds no support either in the language or in the context of the equitable sharing provisions of the 1987 Constitution and the Local Government Code.<br><br>The Court finds it appropriate to also cite Section 150 of the Local Government Code which speaks of the <i>situs</i> of local business taxes under Section 143 of the same law. Section 150 provides:<br><blockquote><b>Section 150.</b> <i>Situs of the Tax</i>. -<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(b) The following <b>sales allocation</b> shall apply to manufacturers, assemblers, contractors, producers, and exporters with factories, project offices, plants, and plantations in the pursuit of their business:<br><blockquote>(1) Thirty percent (30%) of all sales recorded in the principal office shall be taxable by the city or municipality where the principal office is located; and<br></blockquote><blockquote>(2) <b>Seventy percent (70%) of all sales recorded in the principal office shall be taxable by the city or municipality where the factory, project office, plant, or plantation is located.</b><br></blockquote>(c) <b>In case of a plantation located at a place other than the place where the factory is located, said seventy percent (70%) mentioned in subparagraph (b) of subsection (2) above shall be divided as follows:</b><br><blockquote>(1) <b>Sixty percent (60%) to the city or municipality where the factory is located</b>; and<br></blockquote><blockquote>(2) <b>Forty percent (40%) to the city or municipality where the plantation is located.</b><br></blockquote>(d) In cases where a manufacturer, assembler, producer, exporter or contractor has two (2) or more factories, project offices, plants, or plantations located in different localities, the seventy percent (70%) sales allocation mentioned in subparagraph (b) of subsection (2) above shall be <b>prorated among the localities where the factories, project offices, plants, and plantations are located in proportion to their respective volumes of production</b> during the period for which the tax is due.<br><br>(e) <b>The foregoing sales allocation shall be applied irrespective of whether or not sales are made in the locality where the factory, project office, plant, or plantation is located.</b> (Emphasis ours)<br></blockquote>The foregoing provision illustrates the untenability of the Province of Palawan's interpretation of "territorial jurisdiction" based on exercise of jurisdiction. To sustain the province's construction would mean that the <i>territorial</i> jurisdiction of the municipality or city where the factory, plant, project office or plantation is situated, extends to the LGU where the principal office is located because said municipality or city can exercise the authority to tax the sale transactions made or recorded in the principal office. This could not have been the intent of the framers of the Local Government Code.<br><br>The Provincial Government of Palawan argues that its territorial jurisdiction extends to the Camago-Malampaya reservoir considering that its local police maintains peace and order in the area; crimes committed within the waters surrounding the province have been prosecuted and tried in the courts of Palawan; and the provincial government enforces environmental laws over the same area.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[242]</sup> The province also cites Section 468 of the Local Government Code, which authorizes the <i>Sanggunian Panlalawigan</i> to enact ordinances that protect the environment, as well as Sections 26 and 27 of the law, which require consultation with the LGUs concerned and the approval of their respective <i>sanggunian</i> before the National Government may commence any project that will have an environmental impact.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[243]</sup> The province avers that the Contractor, in fact, obtained the necessary endorsement from the <i>Sangguniang Panlalawigan</i> of Palawan before starting its operations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[244]</sup><br><br>The Court notes, however, that the province's claims of maintaining peace and order in the Camago-Malampaya area and of enforcing environmental laws therein have not been substantiated by credible proof. The province likewise failed to adduce evidence of the crimes supposedly committed in the same area or their prosecution in Palawan's courts.<br><br>The province cites illegal fishing, poaching and illegal entry as the cases tried before the courts of Palawan. As conceded by the parties, however, the subject gas reservoir is situated, not in the marine waters, but in the continental shelf. The Province of Palawan has not established that it has, in fact, exercised jurisdiction over this submerged land area.<br><br>The LGU's authority to adopt and implement measures to protect the environment does not determine the extent of its territorial jurisdiction. The deliberations of the Bicameral Conference Committee on the proposed Local Government Code provides the proper context for the exercise of such authority:<br><blockquote>HON. DE PEDRO. The Senate version does not have any specific provision on this. The House's reads:<br><blockquote>"The delegation to each local government unit of the responsibility in the management and maintenance of environmental balance within its territorial jurisdiction."<br></blockquote>CHAIRMAN PIMENTEL. Well, this is a matter of delegating to the local government units power to determine environmental concerns, which is good. However, we have some reservations precisely because <b>environment does not know of territorial boundaries</b>. That is our reservation there. <b>And we have to speak of the totality of the environment of the nation rather than the provincial or municipal in that respect.</b> x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[245]</sup> (Emphasis ours)<br></blockquote>Thus, the LGU's statutory obligation to maintain ecological balance is but part of the nation's collective effort to preserve its environment as a whole. The extent to which local legislation or enforcement protects the environment will not define the LGU's territory.<br><br>Sections 26 and 27 of the Local Government Code provide:<br><blockquote><b>Section 26.</b> <i>Duty of National Government Agencies in the Maintenance of Ecological Balance</i>. - It shall be the duty of every national agency or government-owned or controlled corporation authorizing or involved in the planning and implementation of any project or program that may cause pollution, climatic change, depletion of non-renewable resources, loss of crop land, rangeland, or forest cover, and extinction of animal or plant species, to consult with the local government units, nongovernmental organizations, and other sectors concerned and explain the goals and objectives of the project or program, <b>its impact upon the people and the community in terms of environmental or ecological balance</b>, and the measures that will be undertaken to prevent or minimize the adverse effects thereof.<br><br><b>Section 27.</b> <i>Prior Consultations Required</i>. - No project or program shall be implemented by government authorities unless the consultations mentioned in Sections 2 (c) and 26 hereof are complied with, and prior approval of the <i>sanggunian</i> concerned is obtained: Provided, That occupants in areas where such projects are to be implemented shall not be evicted unless appropriate relocation sites have been provided, m accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. (Emphasis ours)<br></blockquote>It is clear from Sections 26 and 27 that the consideration for the required consultation and <i>sanggunian</i> approval is the environmental impact of the National Government's project on the local community. A project, however, may have an ecological impact on a locality without necessarily being situated therein. Thus, prior consultation made pursuant to the foregoing provisions does not perforce establish that the national wealth sought to be utilized is within the territory of the LGU consulted.<br><br>In fine, an LGU cannot claim territorial jurisdiction over an area simply because its government has exercised a certain degree of authority over it. Territorial jurisdiction is defined, not by the local government, but by the law that creates it; it is delimited, not by the extent of the LGU's exercise of authority, but by physical boundaries as fixed in its charter.<br><br><b>Unless clearly expanded by Congress, the LGU's territorial jurisdiction refers only to its land area.</b><br><br><b>Utilization of natural resources found within the land area as delimited by law is subject to the 40% LGU share.</b><br><br>Since it refers to a demarcated area, the term "territorial jurisdiction" is evidently synonymous with the term "<i>territory</i>." In fact, "territorial jurisdiction" is defined as the limits or territory within which authority may be exercised.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[246]</sup><br><br>Under the Local Government Code, particularly the provisions on the creation of municipalities, cities and provinces, and LGUs in general, territorial jurisdiction is contextually synonymous with territory and the term "territory" is used to refer to the land area comprising the LGU, thus:<br><blockquote><b>Section 442.</b> <i>Requisites for Creation</i>. -<br><br>(a) A municipality may be created if it has an average annual income, as certified by the provincial treasurer, of at least Two million five hundred thousand pesos (P2,500,000.00) for the last two (2) consecutive years based on the 1991 constant prices; a population of at least twenty­ five thousand (25,000) inhabitants as certified by the National Statistics Office; and <b>a contiguous territory of at least fifty (50) square kilometers as certified by the Lands Management Bureau:</b> Provided, That the creation thereof shall not reduce the land area, population or income of the original municipality or municipalities at the time of said creation to less than the minimum requirements prescribed herein.<br><br>(b) The <b>territorial jurisdiction</b> of a newly-created municipality shall be <b>properly identified by metes and bounds</b>.

(Emphasis ours)<br></blockquote>That the LGUs' respective territories under the Local Government Code pertain to the land area is clear from the fact that: (a) the law generally requires the territory to be "contiguous"; (b) the minimum area of the contiguous territory is measured in square kilometers; (c) such minimum area must be certified by the Lands Management Bureau; and (d) the territory should be identified by metes and bounds, with technical descriptions.<br><br>The word "contiguous" signifies two solid masses being in actual contact. Square kilometers are units typically used to measure large areas of land. The Land Management Bureau, a government agency that absorbed the functions of the Bureau ofLands, recommends policies and programs for the efficient and effective administration, management and disposition of alienable and disposable lands of the public domain and other lands outside the responsibilities of other government agencies.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[247]</sup> Finally, "metes and bounds" are the boundaries or limits of a tract of land especially as described by reference and distances between points on the land,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[248]</sup> while "technical descriptions" are used to describe these boundaries and are commonly found in certificates of land title.<br><br>The following pronouncement in <i>Tan v. Comelec</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[249]</sup> is particularly instructive:<br><blockquote>It is of course claimed by the respondents in their Comment to the exhibits submitted by the petitioners (Exhs. C and D, Rollo, pp. 19 and 91), that the new province has a territory of 4,019.95 square kilometers, more or less. This assertion is made to negate the proofs submitted, disclosing that the land area of the new province cannot be more than 3,500 square kilometers because its land area would, at most, be only about 2,856 square kilometers, taking into account government statistics relative to the total area of the cities and municipalities constituting Negros del Norte. <b>Respondents insist that when Section 197 of the Local Government Code speaks of the territory of the province to be created and requires that such territory be at least 3,500 square kilometers, what is contemplated is not only the land area but also the land and water over which the said province has jurisdiction and control. It is even the submission of the respondents that in this regard the marginal sea within the three mile limit should be considered in determining the extent of the territory of the new province. Such an interpretation is strained, incorrect, and fallacious.</b><br><br>The last sentence of the first paragraph of Section 197 is most revealing. As so stated therein the "<i>territory need not be <b>contiguous</b> if it comprises two or more islands</i>." The use of the word territory in this particular provision of the Local Government Code and in the very last sentence thereof, clearly reflects that <b>"<i>territory</i>" as therein used, has reference only to the mass of land area and excludes the waters over which the political unit exercises control</b>.<br><br>Said sentence states that the "territory need not be contiguous." <b>Contiguous means (a) in physical contact; (b) touching along all or most of one side; (c) near, text, or adjacent. "Contiguous", when employed as an adjective, as in the above sentence, is only used when it describes physical contact, or a touching of sides of two solid masses of matter.</b> The meaning of particular terms in a statute may be ascertained by reference to words associated with or related to them in the statute. <b>Therefore, in the context of the sentence above, what need not be "contiguous" is the "territory" the physical mass of land area. There would arise no need for the legislators to use the word coptiguous if they had intended that the term "territory" embrace not only land area but also territorial waters. It can be safely concluded that the word territory in the first paragraph of Section 197 is meant to be synonymous with "land area" only.</b> The words and phrases used in a statute should be given the meaning intended by the legislature. The sense in which the words are used furnished the rule of construction.<br><br><b>The distinction between "territory" and "land area" which respondents make is an artificial or strained construction of the disputed provision whereby the words of the statute are arrested from their plain and obvious meaning and made to bear an entirely different meaning to justify an absurd or unjust result. The plain meaning in the language in a statute is the safest guide to follow in construing the statute. A construction based on a forced or artificial meaning of its words and out of harmony of the statutory scheme is not to be favored.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[250]</sup> (Emphasis ours and citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Though made in reference to the previous Local Government Code or Batas Pambansa Blg. (BP) 337, the above-cited ruling remains relevant in determining an LGU's territorial jurisdiction under the 1991 Local Government Code. Section 197 of BP 337<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[251]</sup> cited the requisites for creating a province, among which was a "territory," with a specified minimum area, which did not need to be "contiguous" if it comprised two or more islands. <i>Tan</i>, therefore, is clearly relevant since it explained the significance of the word "contiguous," which is similarly used in the Local Government Code, in the determination of the LGU's territory. More importantly, it appears that the framers of the Local Government Code drew inspiration from the <i>Tan</i> ruling such that in lieu of the word "territory," they specified that such requisite in the creation of the LGU shall refer to the land area. Thus, in his book on the Local Government Code, Senator Pimentel who, in former Chief Justice Reynato S. Puno's words, "shepherded the Code through the labyrinthine process of lawmaking," wrote:<br><blockquote>When a law was passed in the Batasan Pambansa creating the new province of Negros del Norte, the Supreme Court was asked to rule in <i>Tan v. Commission on Elections</i>, whether or not the new province complied properly with the "territory" requirement that it must have no less then [sic] 3,500 square kilometers.<br><br>The respondents claimed that "the new province has a territory of 4,019.95 square kilometers" by including in that computation not only the land area, but also the "water over which said province had jurisdiction and control," and "the marginal sea within the three mile limit."<br><br>The Supreme Court ruled that such an interpretation is strained, incorrect and fallacious. The Court added that the use of the word "territory" in the Local Government Code clearly reflected that "territory" as therein used had reference only to the mass of land area and excluded the waters over which the political unit exercises control.<br><br><b>Inspired by this Supreme Court ruling, the Code now uses the words "land area" in lieu of "territory" to emphasize that the area required of an LGU does not include the sea for purposes of compliance with the requirements of the Code for its creation.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[252]</sup> (Emphasis ours)<br></blockquote><i>Tan</i>, in fact, establishes that an LGU may have control over the waters but may not necessarily claim them as part of their territory. This supports the Court's finding that the exercise of authority does not determine the LGU's territorial jurisdiction.<br><br>It is true that under Sections 442 and 450 of the Local Government Code, "(t)he requirement on land area shall not apply" if the municipality or city proposed to be created is composed of one or more islands. This does not mean, however, that the territory automatically extends to the waters surrounding the islands or to the open sea. Nowhere in said provisions is it even remotely suggested that marine waters, or for that matter the continental shelf, are consequently to be included as part of the territory. The provisions still speak of "islands" as constituting the LGU, and under Article 121 of the UNCLOS, an island is defined as "a naturally formed <b>area of land</b>, surrounded by water, which is above water at high tide." The inapplicability of the requirement on land area only means that where the proposed municipality or city is an island, or comprises two or more islands, it need not be identified by metes and bounds or satisfy the required minimum area. In that case, the island mass constitutes the area of the municipality or city and its limits are the island's natural boundaries.<br><br>Significantly, during the Senate deliberations on the proposed Local Government Code, then Senate President Jovito Salonga suggested an amendment that would extend the territorial jurisdiction of municipalities abutting bodies of water to at least two kms from the shoreline. The ensuing exchange is worth highlighting:<br><blockquote><b>The President.</b> Here is a proposed amendment: Line 17, to add the following: FOR MUNICIPALITIES ABUTTING BODIES OF WATER THEIR TERRITORIAL JURISDICTION SHALL EXTEND TO AT LEAST TWO KILOMETERS FROM THE SHORELINE; PROVIDED, THAT IN CASE THERE ARE TWO OR MORE MUNICIPALITIES ON EITHER SIDE OF SUCH A BODY OF WATER MAKING THE TWO-KILOMETER JURISDICTION INADVISABLE THE JURISDICTION OF THE AFFECTED MUNICIPALITIES SHALL BE DETERMINED BY DRAWING A LINE AT THE MIDDLE OF SUCH BODY OF WATER. This is only for municipalities abutting bodies of water.<br><br><b>Senator Pimentel.</b> Mr. President, may we invite the attention of our Colleagues that in Book IV, page 273, we define what constitutes municipal waters. And, the measurement is not two kilometers but three nautical miles starting from the sea-line boundary marks at low tide. Therefore, there may be some complications here. We are not against the amendment per se. What we are trying to make of record is the fact that we have to consider also the provision of Section 464 which defines "MUNICIPAL WATERS". So, probably, we can increase the extension of the territorial jurisdiction to three nautical miles instead of two kilometers as mentioned in this proposed amendment.<br><br>In fact, Mr. President, it is also stated at the last sentence of Section 464:<br><blockquote>Where two municipalities are so situated on the opposite shores that there is less than six nautical miles of marine water between them, the third line shall be aligned equally distant from the opposite shores of the respective municipalities.<br></blockquote>So, there is an attempt here to delineate, really, the jurisdiction of the municipalities which may have a common body of water, let us say, in between them.<br><br><b>The President.</b> So, that is acceptable, provided that it is three nautical miles?<br><br><b>Senator Pimentel.</b> Yes. Probably, Mr. President, what we can do is hold in abeyance this proposed amendment and take it up when we reach Section 464. I think, it will be more appropriate in that section, Mr. President.<br><br><b>The President.</b> But, if it is a question of territorial jurisdiction, may not this be the proper place for it?<br><br><b>Senator Pimentel.</b> All right, Mr. President, what we can do is, we will accept the proposed amendment, subject to the observations that we have placed on record.<br><br><b>The President.</b> All right. Subject to the three-nautical-mile limit.<br><br><b>Senator Saguisag.</b> Mr. President.<br><br><b>The President.</b> Senator Saguisag is recognized.<br><br><b>Senator Saguisag.</b> I just would like to find out, Mr. President, if we are codifying something that may represent the present state of the law, or are we creating a new concept here? Ang ibig po bang sabihin nita ay mayroong magmamay-ari ng Pasig River? Kasi, I do not believe that we have ever talked about Manila owning a river or Manila owning Manila Bay. Is that what we are introducing here? And what are its implications?

What do we intend to achieve by now saying that...<br><br><b>The President.</b> Inland waters lamang naman yata ang pinag­uusapang ito.<br><br><b>Senator Saguisag.</b> Opo. Pero, I am not sure whether there is an owner of the Pasig River. I am not sure. Maybe, there is. Pero, my own recollection is that we have never talked of that idea before. I do not know what it means. Does it mean now that the municipality owning it can exclude the rest of the population from using it without going through licensing processes? Ano po ang gusto nating gawin dito?<br><br>Ang alam ko ho riyan, they cannot be owned in the sense that they are really owned by every Filipino. Iyon lamang po.

Why do we not defer this until we can determine which is the better place?<br><br><b>Senator Pimentel.</b> Yes, Mr. President.<br><br><b>The President.</b> All right. So let us defer consideration of this plus the major question that Senator Saguisag is posing, is this something new that we are laying down?<br><br><b>Senator Pimentel.</b> No. Actually the definition of "municipal waters" came about, really, because of several complaints that our Committee has received from fisherpeople. They have complained that the municipality is not able to help them, because the definition of "municipal waters" has not been clearly spelled out. That is the reason why we attempted to introduce some definitions of "municipal waters" here, basically, in answer to the demands of the fisherfolk who believe that their rights are being intruded upon by other people coming from other places.

Neither did the proposed amendment appear in the text of the Local Government Code as approved. By Senator Pimentel's account, the Code deferred to the Court's ruling in <i>Tan</i> which excluded the marginal sea from the LGU's territory. It can, thus, be concluded that under the Local Government Code, an LGU's territory does not extend to the municipal waters beyond the LGU's shoreline.<br><br>The parties all agree that the Camago-Malampaya reservoir is located in the continental shelf.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[254]</sup> If the marginal sea is not included in the LGU's territory, with more reason should the continental shelf, located miles further, be deemed excluded therefrom.<br><br>To recapitulate, an LGU's territorial jurisdiction refers to its territorial boundaries or to its territory. The territory of LGUs, in turn, refers to their land area, unless expanded by law to include the maritime area. Accordingly, only the utilization of natural resources found within the land area as delimited by law is subject to the LGU's equitable share under Sections 290 and 291 of the Local Government Code. This conclusion finds support in the deliberations of the 1986 Constitutional Commission which cited, as examples of national wealth the proceeds from which the LGU may share, the Tiwi Geothermal Plant in Albay, the geothermal plant in Macban, Makiling-Banahaw area in Laguna, the Maria Cristina area in Central Mindanao, the great rivers and sources of hydroelectric power in Iligan, in Central Mindanao, the geothermal resources in the area of Palimpiñon, Municipality of Valencia and mountainous areas, which are all situated inland.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[255]</sup> In his 2011 treatise on the Local Government Code, former Senator Pimentel cited as examples of such national wealth, the geothermal fields of Tongonan, Leyte and Palinpinon, Negros Oriental which are both found inland.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[256]</sup><br><br>Section 6 of the Local Government Code empowers Congress to create, divide, merge and abolish LGUs, and to substantially alter their boundaries, subject to the plebiscite requirement under Section 10 of the law which reads:<br><blockquote><b>Section 10.</b> <i>Plebiscite Requirement</i>. - No creation, division, merger, abolition or substantial alteration of boundaries of local government units shall take effect unless approved by a majority of the votes cast in a plebiscite called for the purpose in the political unit or units directly affected.

The continental shelf, where the Camago-Malampaya reservoir is located, was clearly not included in its territory.<br><br>An island, as herein before-mentioned, is defined under Article 121 of the UNCLOS as "a naturally formed <b>area of land</b>, surrounded by water, which is <b>above water</b> at high tide." The continental shelf, on the other hand, is defined in Article 76 of the same Convention as comprising "<b>the seabed and subsoil</b> of the submarine areas that extend beyond (the coastal State's) territorial sea throughout the natural prolongation of its land territory to the outer edge of the continental margin, or to a distance of 200 nm from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured where the outer edge of the continental margin does not extend up to that distance." Where the continental shelf of the coastal state extends beyond 200 nm, Article 76 allows the State to claim an extended continental shelf up to 350 nm from the baselines.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[265]</sup><br><br>Under Palawan's charter, therefore, the Camago-Malampaya reservoir is not located within its territorial boundaries.<br><br>P.D. No. 1596, which constituted Kalayaan as a separate municipality of the Province of Palawan, cannot be the basis for holding that the Camago-­Malampaya reservoir forms part of Palawan's territory. Section 1 of P.D. No. 1596 provides:<br><blockquote>SECTION 1. The area within the following boundaries:<br><br><center>KALAYAAN ISLAND GROUP<br></center><br>From a point [on the Philippine Treaty Limits] at latitude 7°40' North and longitude 116°00' East of Greenwich, thence due West along the parallel of 7°40' N to its intersection with the meridian of longitude 112°10' E, thence due north along the meridian of 112°10' E to its intersection with the parallel of 9°00' N, thence northeastward to the inter­ section of the parallel of 12°00' N with the meridian oflongitude 114°30' E, thence, due East along the parallel of 12°00' N to its intersection with the meridian of 118°00' E, thence, due South along the meridian of longitude 118°00' E to its intersection with the parallel of 10°00' N, thence Southwestwards to the point of beginning at 7°40' N, latitude and 116°00' E longitude; <b>including the sea-bed, sub-soil, continental margin</b> and air space shall belong and be subject to the sovereignty of the Philippines. <b>Such area is hereby constituted as a distinct and separate municipality of the Province of Palawan and shall be known as "Kalayaan."</b> (Emphasis ours)<br></blockquote>None of the parties assert that the Camago-Malampaya reservoir is within the territory of Kalayaan as delimited in Section 1 of P.D. No. 1596 or as referred to in R.A. No. 9522,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[266]</sup> commonly known as the "2009 baselines law." The Province of Palawan, however, invokes P.D. No. 1596 to argue that similar to Kalayaan, its territory extends to the seabed, the subsoil and the continental margin. The Court is not persuaded.<br><br>The delineation of territory in P.D. No. 1596 refers to Kalayaan alone. The inclusion of the seabed, subsoil and continental margin in Kalayaan's territory cannot, by simple analogy, be applied to the Province of Palawan. To hold otherwise is to expand the province's territory, as presently defined by law, without the requisite legislation and plebiscite.<br><br>The Court likewise finds no merit in the Province of Palawan's assertion that R.A. No. 7611 establishes that the Camago-Malampaya area is within the territorial jurisdiction of Palawan. It is true that R.A. No. 7611 contains a definition of "Palawan" that states:<br><blockquote>Section 3. <b><i>Definition of Terms.</i></b> - As used in this Act, the following terms are defined as follows:<br><br>(1) <b>"Palawan"</b> refers to the Philippine province composed of islands and islets located 7°47' and 12°'22' north latitude and 117°'00' and 119°'51' east longitude, generally bounded by the South China Sea to the northwest and by the Sulu Sea to the east.<br><br>x x x x<br></blockquote>Both the Republic and the Province of Palawan agree that the above geographic coordinates, when plotted, would show that the Camago-­Malampaya reservoir is within the area described. However, no less than the map<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[267]</sup> submitted by the Province of Palawan showed that substantial portions of Palawan's territory were excluded from the area so defined.<br><br>The Republic cites, without controversion from the province, that portions of mainland Palawan and several islands, municipalities or portions thereof, namely, the Municipalities of Balabac, Cagayancillo, Busuanga, Coron, Agutaya, Magsaysay, Cuyo, Araceli, Linapacan and Dumaran were excluded.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[268]</sup> Their exclusion constitutes a substantial alteration of Palawan's territory which, under Section 10 of the Local Government Code, cannot take effect without the approval of the majority of the votes cast for the purpose in a plebiscite in the political units directly affected.<br><br>There is also no showing that the criteria for the alteration, as established in Sections 7 and 461 of the Local Government Code, had been met. The definition, therefore, does not have the effect of redefining Palawan's territory. In fact, R.A. No. 7611 was enacted not for such purpose but to adopt a comprehensive framework for the sustainable development of Palawan compatible with protecting and enhancing the natural resources and endangered environment of the province.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[269]</sup><br><br>The definitions under Section 1 of R.A. No. 7611 are also qualified by the phrase "[A]s used in this Act." Thus, the definition of "Palawan" should be taken, not as a statement of territorial limits for purposes of Section 7, Article X of the 1987 Constitution, but in the context of R.A. No. 7611 which is aimed at environmental monitoring, research and education.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[270]</sup><br><br>It is true, as the Province of Palawan has pointed out, that R.A. No. 7611 includes the coastal or marine area as one of the three components of the Environmentally Critical Areas Network designated in said law, the other two being the terrestrial component and the tribal ancestral lands. R.A. No. 7611 refers to the coastal or marine area as the whole coastline up to the open sea, characterized by active fisheries and tourism activities. By all the parties' accounts, however, the Camago-Malampaya reservoir, is located not in such coastal or marine area but in the continental shelf. Thus, even on the supposition that R.A. No. 7611 redefined Palawan's territory, it clearly did not include the seabed and subsoil comprising the continental shelf. In fact, what it expressly declares as composing the Province of Palawan are the "islands and islets."<br><br>It is also clear that R.A. No. 7611 does not vest any additional jurisdiction on the Province of Palawan. The PCSD, formed under said law, is composed of both provincial officials and representatives from national government agencies. It was also established under the Office of the President. The tasks outlined by R.A. No. 7611, which largely involve policy formulation and coordination, are carried out not by the province, but by the council.<br><br>Thus, even if the Court were to apply the province's definition of "territorial jurisdiction" as co-extensive with its exercise of authority, R.A. No. 7611 cannot be considered as conferring territorial jurisdiction over the Camago-Malampaya reservoir to Palawan since the law did not grant additional power to the province.<br><br>It must be pointed out, too, that the Province of Palawan never alleged in which of its municipalities or component cities and barangays the Camago-Malampaya reservoir is located. Under Section 292 of the Local Government Code, the local government's share in the utilization of national wealth located in a province shall be allocated in the following ratio:<br><blockquote>(1) Province - Twenty percent (20%);<br>(2) Component City/Municipality - Forty-five percent (45%); and<br>(3) Barangay - Thirty-five percent (35%)<br></blockquote>The allocation of the LGU share to the component city/municipality and the barangay cannot but indicate that the natural resource is necessarily found . therein. This is only logical since a province is composed of component cities and municipalities, and municipalities are in turn composed of barangays. Senate deliberations on the proposed Local Government Code also reflect that at bottom, the natural resource is located in the municipality or component city:<br><blockquote><b>Senator Rasul.</b> Mr. President, may I continue. Also on the same page, same section, "<i>Share of Local Government in the Proceeds From the Exploration</i>", I propose that there should be a specific sharing in this section, because this section does not speak of the sharing; how much goes to the barangay, municipality, city, or province?<br><br><b>Senator Pimentel.</b> Yes, in fact, we have Mr. President and I was about to read it into the record, so that, there will be a new paragraph after the word Resources on page 54, and it will read as follows:<br><br>THE SHARES OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT UNITS IN THE PROCEEDS FROM THE EXPLANATION [sic], DEVELOPMENT AND UTILIZATION OF NATURAL RESOURCES LOCATED WITHIN THEIR TERRITORIAL WRISDICTIONS SHALL BE AS FOLLOWS:<br><br>1.

In fact, with the exception of Kalayaan, which includes the seabed, the subsoil and the continental margin as part of its demarcated area, the municipalities are either located within an island or are comprised of islands. That only Kalayaan (under P.D. No. 1596), among the municipalities of Palawan, had land submerged in water as part of its area or territory, was confirmed by the <i>amicus curiae</i>, Atty. Bensurto, during the oral argument as gleaned from the following exchange:<br><blockquote>JUSTICE DE CASTRO: It is not a question of belonging to Palawan, it is a question of Palawan having a share because it is within the area of Palawan, that is the question before the Court now, it is not, the right to govern is not in question, that is not the issue because we are very clear. The Philippines is not a Federal Government x x x So, we are just defining the area of the Province of Palawan, if it is not included in the polygon, <b>what about in other islands of Palawan, is there any continental shelf in the other areas</b>, if there is none here in the polygon, within the polygon and which will extend up to the Camago-Malampaya, <b>is there any other continental shelf in the other islands comprising Palawan where there is such a continental shelf that will extend up to the Camago­-Malampaya</b>.<br><br>ATTY.

(Emphasis ours)<br></blockquote>By indicating that the LGUs comprise the territorial subdivisions of the State, the Constitution did not <i>ipso facto</i> make every portion of the national territory a part of an LGU's territory.<br><br>The above-quoted section is found under the General Provisions of Article X on Local Government. Explaining this provision, the eminent author and member of the 1986 Constitutional Commission, Fr. Joaquin G. Bernas, S.J. wrote:<br><blockquote>The existence of "provinces" and "municipalities" was already acknowledged in the 1935 Constitution. Section 1, however, when first enacted in 1973, went a step further than mere acknowledgment of their existence and recognized them, together with cities and barrios, as "(t)he territorial and political subdivisions of the Philippines." <b>Thus, the municipalities, and barrios (now barangays) have been fixed as the standard territorial and political subdivisions of the Philippines.</b> To these the 1987 Constitution has added the "autonomous regions." But the Constitution allows only two regions: one for the Cordilleras and one for Muslim Mindanao. The creation of other autonomous regions whether by dividing the Cordilleras or Muslim Mindanao into two or by creating others outside these two regions, can be accomplished only by constitutional amendment.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Neither Section 1, however, nor any part of the Constitution prescribed the actual form and structure which individual local government units must take. These are left by Sections 3, 18 and 20 to legislation. <b>As constitutional precepts, therefore, they are very general.</b> x x x<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The designation by the 1973 Constitution of provinces, cities, municipalities and barangays as the political and territorial subdivisions of the Philippines effected <b>a measure of institutional instability</b>. To this extent, it was a move in the direction of real local autonomy. The 1987 Constitution moved farther forward by authorizing the creation of autonomous regions. <b>These are the passive aspects of local autonomy.</b> The dynamic and more important aspect of local autonomy must be measured in terms of the scope of the powers given to the local units.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[300]</sup> (Emphasis ours)<br></blockquote>There is, thus, merit in the Republic's assertion that Section 1, Article X of the 1987 Constitution was intended merely to institutionalize the LGUs.<br><br>The Court is further inclined to agree with the Republic's argument that assuming Section 1 of Article X was meant to divide the entire Philippine territory among the LGUs, it cannot be deemed as self-executing and legislation will still be necessary to implement it. LGUs are constituted by law and it is through legislation that their respective territorial boundaries are delineated. Furthermore, in the creation, division, merger and abolition of LGUs and in the substantial alteration of their boundaries, Section 10 of Article X requires satisfying the criteria set by the Local Government Code. It further requires the approval by the majority of the votes cast in a plebiscite in the political units directly affected. Needless to say, apportionment of the national territory by the LGUs, based solely on the general terms ·of Section 1 of Article X, may only sow conflict and dissension among these political subdivisions.<br><br>As the Republic asserted, no law has been enacted dividing the Philippine territory, including its continental margin and exclusive economic zones, among the LGUs.<br><br><b>The UNCLOS did not confer on LGUs their own continental shelf</b><br><br>Dean Pangalangan posited that since the Constitution has incorporated into Philippine law the concepts of the UNCLOS, including the concept of the continental shelf, Palawan's "area" could be construed as including its own continental shelf.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[301]</sup> The Province of Palawan and Arigo, et al. accordingly assert that Camago-Malampaya reservoir forms part of Palawan's continental shelf.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[302]</sup><br><br>The Court is unconvinced. The Republic was correct in arguing that the concept of continental shelf under the UNCLOS does not, by the doctrine of transformation, automatically apply to the LGUs. We quote with approval its disquisition on this issue:<br><blockquote>The Batasang Pambansa ratified the UNCLOS through Resolution No. 121 adopted on February 27, 1984. Through this process, the UNCLOS attained the force and effect of municipal law. But even if the UNCLOS were to be considered to have been transformed to be part of the municipal law, after its ratification by the Batasang Pambansa, the UNCLOS did not automatically amend the Local Government Code and the charters of the local government units. No such intent is manifest either in the UNCLOS or in Resolution No. 121. Instead, the UNCLOS, transformed into our municipal laws, should be applied as it is worded. <i>Verba legis.</i><br><br>x x x x<br><br>It must be stressed that the provisions under the UNCLOS are specific in declaring the rights and duties of a state, not a local government unit. The UNCLOS confirms the sovereign rights of the States over the continental shelf and the maritime zones. The UNCLOS did not confer any rights to the States' local government units. x x x x<br><br>At the risk of being repetitive, it is respectfully emphasized that the foregoing indubitably established that under the express terms of the UNCLOS, the rights and duties over the maritime zones and continental shelf pertain to the State. No provision was set forth to even suggest any reference to a local government unit. Simply put, the UNCLOS did not obligate the States to grant to, much less automatically vest upon, their respective local government units territorial jurisdiction over the different maritime zones and the continental shelf. Hence, contrary to the submission of Dean Pangalangan, no such application can be made.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[303]</sup><br></blockquote>Atty. Bensurto took a similar stand, declaring during the oral argument that:<br><blockquote>ATTY. HENRY BENSURTO: x x x x [T]here was an assertion earlier, Your Honor, that there was a reference in fact to the continental shelf, that there is an automatic application of the continental shelf with respect to the municipal territories. I submit, Your Honor that this should n9t be the case, why? Because <b>the United Nation Convention on the Law of the Sea which is the conventional law directly applicable in this case is an International Law. International Law by definition is a body of rules governing relations between sovereign States or other entities which are capable of having rights and obligations under International Law.</b> Therefore, it is the State that is the subject oflntemational Law, the only exception to this is with respect to individuals with respect to the issue of Humanitarian and Human Rights Law. From there, it flows the principal [sic] therefore that International Law affects only sovereign States. With respect to the relationship between the State and its Local Government Units this is reserved to the sovereign right of the sovereign State. It is a dangerous proposition for us to make that there is an automatic application because to do that would mean a violation of the sovereign right of a State and the State always reserves the right to promulgate laws governing its domestic jurisdiction. <b>Therefore, the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea affects only the right of the Philippines <i>vis a vis</i> another sovereign State.</b> And so, when we talk of the different maritime jurisdictions enumerated, illustrated and explained under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea <b>we are actually referring to inter state relations not intra state relations</b>. x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[304]</sup> (Emphasis ours)<br></blockquote>In fact, Arigo, et al. acknowledged during the oral argument that the UNCLOS applies to the coastal state and not to their provinces, and that Palawan, both under constitutional and international, has no distinct and separate continental shelf, thus:<br><blockquote>ASSOCIATE JUSTICE VELASCO: <b>You admit that under UNCLOS it is onlv the coastal states that are recognized not the provinces of the coastal state.</b><br><br>ATTY.

The waters around, between, and connecting the islands of the archipelago, regardless of their breadth and dimensions, form part of the internal waters of the Philippines.<br></blockquote>The regalian doctrine, in turn, is found in Section 2, Article XII of the 1987 Constitution which states:<br><blockquote>Section 2. All lands of the public domain, waters, minerals, coal, petroleum, and other mineral oils, all forces of potential energy, fisheries, forests or timber, wildlife, flora and fauna, and other natural resources are owned by the State. x x x<br></blockquote>It is at once evident that the foregoing doctrines find no application in this case which involves neither a question of what comprises the Philippine territory or the ownership of all natural resources found therein.<br><br>There is no debate that the natural resources in the Camago­-Malampaya reservoir belong to the State. Palawan's claim is anchored not on ownership of the reservoir but on a revenue-sharing scheme, under Section 7, Article X of the 1987 Constitution and Section 290 of the Local Government Code, that allows LGUs to share in the proceeds of the utilization of national wealth provided they are found within their respective areas. To deny the LGU's share on the basis of the State's ownership of all natural resources is to render Section 7 of Article X nugatory for in such case, it will not be possible for any LGU to benefit from the utilization of national wealth.<br><br>Accordingly, the Court cannot subscribe to Atty. Bensurto's opinion<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[306]</sup> that the Province of Palawan cannot claim the 40% LGU share from the proceeds of the Camago-Malampaya project because the National Government "remains to have full <i>dominium</i>" (or ownership rights) over the gas reservoir.<br><br>Atty. Bensurto's theory is ostensibly drawn from several U.S. cases, namely <i>U.S. v. California</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[307]</sup> <i>U.S. v. Louisiana</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[308]</sup> <i>U.S. v. Texas</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[309]</sup> and <i>U.S. v. Maine</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[310]</sup> which the Republic also cites in applying the federal paramountcy doctrine to the Province of Palawan's claim. To explain this doctrine, the Republic turns to the case of <i>Native Village of Eyak v. Trawler Diane Marie, Inc.</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[311]</sup> where the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in part, stated:<br><blockquote>The "federal paramountcy doctrine" is derived, in essence, from four Supreme Court cases in which the federal government and various coastal states disputed <b>ownership</b> and <b>control</b> of the territorial sea and the adjacent portions of the OCS.<br><br>The first of these cases was <b>United States v. California</b>, 332 U.S. 19, 67 S.Ct. 1658,91 L.Ed. 1889 (1947), in which the United States sued to enjoin the State of California from executing leases authorizing the taking of petroleum, gas, and other mineral deposits from the Pacific Ocean. x x x<br><br>x x x x<br><br>[T]hus, the Court declared, "California is not the <b>owner</b> of the three-mile marginal belt along its coast." Instead, "the Federal Government rather than the state has <b>paramount rights</b> in and power over that belt, an incident to which is <b>full dominion</b> over the resources of the soil under that water area, including oil."<br><br>Bolstered by the favorable outcome in California, the United States brought similar actions to confirm its title to the seabed adjacent to other coastal states. In <b>United States v. Louisiana</b>, 339 U.S. 699, 70 S.Ct. 914, 94 L.Ed. 1216 (1950), the United States brought suit against the State of Louisiana, which argued that it held title to the seabed under the waters extending twenty-seven miles into the Gulf of Mexico. x x x<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The Court found that the only difference between the argument raised by Louisiana and the one raised by California was that Louisiana's claimed boundary extended twenty-four miles beyond California's three­mile claim. This difference did not weigh in Louisiana's favor, however:<br><blockquote><b>If the three-mile belt is in the domain of the Nation rather than that of the separate States, it follows a fortiori that the ocean beyond that limit also is</b> the ocean seaward of the marginal belt is perhaps even more directly related to the national defense, the conduct of foreign affairs, and world commerce than is the marginal sea. Certainly it is not less so far as the issues presented here are concerned, Louisiana's enlargement of her boundary emphasizes the strength of the claim of the United States to this part of the ocean and the resources of the soil under that area, including oil.<br></blockquote>In the companion case to Louisiana, <b>United States v. Texas</b>, 339 U.S. 707, 70 S.Ct. 918, 94 L.Ed. 1221 (1950), the Supreme Court again reaffirmed its holding in California. The State of Texas had, by statute, extended its boundary first to a line twenty-four miles beyond the three­ mile limit, and thereafter to the outer edge of the continental shelf. Texas raised a somewhat different argument than had either California or Louisiana, one more analogous to that asserted by the Villages here. Texas argued that, because it was a separate republic prior to its entry into the United States, it had both dominium (ownership or proprietary rights) and imperium (governmental powers of regulation and control) with respect to the lands, minerals, and other products underlying the marginal sea. Upon entering the Union, Texas transferred to the federal government its powers of sovereignty-its imperium-over the marginal sea, but retained its dominium.<br><br>The Supreme Court was not persuaded. While the Republic of Texas may have had complete sovereignty and <b>ownership</b> over the marginal sea and all things of value derived therefrom, the State of Texas did not. x x x "When Texas came into the Union, she ceased to be an independent nation. The United States then took her place as respects foreign commerce, the waging of war, the making of treaties, defense of the shores, and the like." As an incident to the transfer of that sovereignty, <b>any "claim that Texas may have had to the marginal sea was relinquished to the United States." The Court recognized that "dominion and imperium are normally separable and separate"; however, in this instance, "property interests are so subordinated to the rights of sovereignty as to follow sovereignty."</b> x x x<br><br>x x x x<br><br>In the last of the paramountcy cases, <b>United States v. Maine</b>, 420 U.S. 515, 95 S.Ct. 1155, 43 L.Ed.2d 363 (1975), the United States brought an action against the thirteen Atlantic Coastal States asserting that the federal government was entitled to exercise sovereign rights over the seabed and subsoil underlying the Atlantic Ocean to the exclusion of the coastal states for the purpose of exploring the area and exploiting its natural resources. x x x<br><br>At the urging of the coastal states, the Supreme Court reexamined the decisions in California, Louisiana, and Texas. To the states' dismay, the Court concluded that these cases remained grounded on sound constitutional principles. Whatever interest the states may have held in the sea prior to statehood, the Court held, as a matter of "purely legal principle the Constitution allotted to the federal government jurisdiction over foreign commerce, foreign affairs, and national defense and it necessarily follows, as a matter of constitutional law, that <b>as attributes of these external sovereign powers the federal government has paramount rights in the marginal sea.</b>" x x x. (Emphasis ours and citations omitted)<br></blockquote>There are several reasons why the foregoing doctrine cannot be applied to this case. <i>First</i>, the U.S. does not appear to have an equitable sharing provision similar to Section 7, Article X of the 1987 Constitution. <i>Second</i>, the Philippines is not composed of states that were previously independent nations. <i>Third</i>, the resolution of these cases does not necessitate distinguishing between <i>dominium</i> and <i>imperium</i> since neither determines the LGU's entitlement to the equitable share under Section 7 of Article X. <i>Fourth</i>, the Court is not called upon to determine who between the Province of Palawan and the National Government has the paramount or dominant right to explore or exploit the natural resources in the marginal sea or beyond. <i>Fifth</i>, adjudication of these cases does not entail upholding the dominion of the National Government over a political subdivision since ownership of the natural resources is concededly vested in the State. <i>Sixth</i>, it is settled that dominion over national wealth belongs to the State under the regalian doctrine. Ownership of the subject reservoir, therefore, is a non­issue and what simply needs to be determined is whether said resource is located within the area or territorial jurisdiction of the Province of Palawan.<br><br>Justice De Castro's observation during the oral argument is thus <i>apropos</i>:<br><blockquote>JUSTICE DE CASTRO: <b>It is not a question of belonging to Palawan, it is a question of Palawan having a share because it is within the area of Palawan</b>, that is the question before the Court now, it is not, the right to govern is not in question, that is not the issue because we are very clear. The Philippines is not a Federal Government so as distinguished from a Federal Government where the sovereign authority came from the member State and granted to the Federal Government, here we have the reverse it is the central government giving to the local government certain powers and defining the limits of these powers. So, in this case there is no question about the right to govern, the local government have [sic] have only such powers granted to it by the Local Government Code. <b>Now, the question is whether the Province of Palawan should have a share in the proceeds in the development of the Camago-Malampaya because it is within its area.

Bensurto opined that under the existing law, the Province of Palawan is not entitled to the statutory 40% LGU share. He posited that it is only on equitable grounds that the Province of Palawan could participate in the proceeds of the utilization of the Camago-Malampaya reservoir. He concluded that from the perspective of the principle of equity, it may be appropriate for the Province of Palawan to be given some share in the operation of the Camago-Malampaya gas reservoir considering: (a) its proximity to the province which makes the latter environmentally vulnerable to any major accidents in the gas reservoir; and (b) the gas pipes that pass through the northern part of the province.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[313]</sup><br><br>The Court finds the submission untenable. Our courts are basically courts of law, not courts of equity.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[314]</sup> Furthermore, for all its conceded merits, equity is available only in the absence of law and not as its replacement.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[315]</sup> As explained in the old case of <i>Tupas v. Court of Appeals</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[316]</sup><br><blockquote>Equity is described as justice outside legality, which simply means that it crumot supplant although it may, as often happens, supplement the law. We said in an earlier case, and we repeat it now, that all abstract arguments based only on equity should yield to positive rules, which pre­ empt and prevail over such persuasions. Emotional appeals for justice, while they may wring the heart of the Court, cannot justify disregard of the mandate of the law as long as it remains in force. The applicable maxim, which goes back to the ancient days of the Roman jurists - and is now still reverently observed - is "<i>aequetas nunquam contravenit legis</i>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[317]</sup><br></blockquote>In this case, there are applicable laws found in Section 7, Article X of the 1987 Constitution and in Sections 289 and 290 of the Local Government Code. They limit the LGUs' share to the utilization of national wealth located within their respective areas or territorial jurisdiction. As herein before-discussed, however, existing laws do not include the Camago-­Malampaya reservoir within the area or territorial jurisdiction of the Province of Palawan.<br><br>The pertinent positive rules being present here, they should preempt and prevail over all abstract arguments based only on equity.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[318]</sup><br><br>The supposed presence of gas pipes through the northern part of Palawan cannot justify granting the province the 40% LGU share because both the Constitution and the Local Government Code refer to the LGU where the natural resource is situated. The 1986 Constitutional Commission referred to this area as "the locality, where God chose to locate his bounty," while the Senate deliberations on the proposed Local Government Code cited it as the area where the natural resource is "extracted." To hold otherwise, on the basis of equity, will run afoul of the letter and spirit of both constitutional and statutory law. It is settled that equity cannot supplant, overrule or transgress existing law.<br><br>Furthermore, as the Republic noted, any possible environmental damage to the province is addressed by the contractor's undertakings, under the ECC, to ensure minimal impact on the environment and to set up an Environmental Guarantee Fund that would cover expenses for environmental monitoring, as well as a replenishable fund that would compensate for any damage the project may cause.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[319]</sup> The ECC, in pertinent part, provides:<br><blockquote>This Certificate is being issued subject to the following conditions:<br><br>1.

Defining those boundaries is a legislative, not a judicial function.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[321]</sup> The Court cannot, on the basis of equity, engage in judicial legislation and alter the boundaries of the Province of Palawan to include the continental shelf where the subject natural resource lies.

The power to create still includes the power to destroy. The power to grant still includes the power to withhold or recall. True, there are certain notable innovations in the Constitution, like the direct conferment on the local government units of the power to tax (citing Art. X, Sec.

By and large, however, the national legislature is still the principal of the local government units, which cannot defy its will or modify or violate it.<br></blockquote>Ours is still a unitary form of government, not a federal state. Being so, <b>any form of autonomy granted to local governments will necessarily be limited and confined within the extent allowed by the central authority</b>.

Commission on Election</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> a case that was decided long before the passage of the present Local Government Code. In <i>Tan</i>, a petition was filed before this Court to halt the conduct of a plebiscite to pass a law creating the province ofNegros. A question was raised on whether the marginal sea within the three (3)-mile limit should be considered in determining a province's extent. This Court, in finding the argument unmeritorious, held:<br><blockquote>As so stated therein the "territory need not be contiguous if it comprises two or more islands." The use of the word territory in this particular provision of the Local Government Code and in the very last sentence thereof, clearly, reflects that "territory" as therein used, has reference only to the mass of land area and excludes the waters over which the political unit exercises control.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> (Emphasis omitted)<br></blockquote>This Court's wording is peculiar. It speaks of territory as a mass of land area, not waters, over which the political unit exercises control. In the same breath, <i>Tan</i> also establishes that political units may have control over the waters in their territory.<br><br>It can be presumed that when <i>Tan</i> discussed the metes and bounds of a local government unit's territory, it only meant to refer to its physical land area. It did not include a discussion on what may encompass a local government unit's <i>territorial jurisdiction</i>.<br><br>In any case, the creation of a local government unit is not solely dependent on land mass. Article 9(2) of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of the Local Government Code provides:<br><blockquote>Article 9. Provinces. - (a) Requisites for creation-A province shall not be created unless the following requisites on income and either population or land area are present:<br><br>....<br><br>(2) Population or land area - Population which shall not be less than two hundred fifty thousand (250,000) inhabitants, as certified by NSO; or land area which must be contiguous with an area of at least two thousand (2,000) square kilometers, as certified by LMB. The territory need not be contiguous if it comprises two (2) or more islands or is separated by a chartered city or cities which do not contribute to the income of the province. <i>The land area requirement shall not apply where the proposed province is composed of one (1) or more islands.</i> The territorial jurisdiction of a province sought to be created shall be properly identified by metes and bounds. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>In <i>Navarro v. Ermita</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> a controversy arose on the creation of the Province of Dinagat Islands considering that its total land mass was only 802.12 square kilometers, or below the 2,000 square kilometers required by law. Petitioners in that case, who were the former Vice Governor and members of the Provincial Board of the Province of Surigao del Norte, questioned the constitutionality of Article 9(2), arguing that the exemption to land area requirement was not explicitly provided for in the Local Government Code.<br><br>The majority initially declared Article 9(2) unconstitutional for being an extraneous provision not intended by the Local Government Code.<br><br>On reconsideration, however, the majority reversed its prior decision and upheld the constitutionality of the assailed provision.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> In particular, <i>Navarro</i> found:<br><blockquote>... [W]hen the local government unit to be created consists of one (1) or more islands, it is exempt from the land area requirement as expressly provided in Section 442 and Section 450 of the LGC if the local government unit to be created is a municipality or a component city, respectively. This exemption is absent in the enumeration of the requisites for the creation of a province under Section 461 of the LGC, although it is expressly stated under Article 9 (2) of the LGC-IRR.<br><br>There appears neither rhyme nor reason why this exemption should apply to cities and municipalities, but not to provinces. In fact, considering the physical configuration of the Philippine archipelago, there is a greater likelihood that islands or group of islands would form part of the land area of a newly-created province than in most cities or municipalities. It is, therefore, logical to infer that the genuine legislative policy decision was expressed in Section 442 (for municipalities) and Section 450 (for component cities) of the LGC, but was inadvertently omitted in Section 461 (for provinces). Thus, when the exemption was expressly provided in Article 9 (2) of the LGC-IRR, the inclusion was intended to correct the congressional oversight in Section 461 of the LGC - and to reflect the true legislative intent. It would, then, be in order for the Court to uphold the validity of Article 9 (2) of the LGC-IRR.<br><br>This interpretation finds merit when we consider the basic policy considerations underpinning the principle of local autonomy.<br><br>....<br><br>Consistent with the declared policy to provide local government units genuine and meaningful local autonomy, contiguity and minimum land area requirements for prospective local government units should be liberally construed in order to achieve the desired results. The strict interpretation adopted by the February 10, 2010 Decision could prove to be counter-productive, if not outright absurd, awkward, and impractical. Picture an intended province that consists of several municipalities and component cities which, in themselves, also consist of islands. The component cities and municipalities which consist of islands are exempt from the minimum land area requirement, pursuant to Sections 450 and 442, respectively, of the LGC. Yet, the province would be made to comply with the minimum land area criterion of 2,000 square kilometers, even if it consists of several islands. This would mean that Congress has opted to assign a distinctive preference to create a province with contiguous land area over one composed of islands - and negate the greater imperative of development of self-reliant communities, rural progress, and the delivery of basic services to the constituency. This preferential option would prove more difficult and burdensome if the 2,000-square-kilometer territory of a province is scattered because the islands are separated by bodies of water, as compared to one with a contiguous land mass.<br><br>Moreover, such a very restrictive construction could trench on the equal protection clause, as it actually defeats the purpose of local autonomy and decentralization as enshrined in the Constitution.
