She affirmed the truthfulness and correctness of the contents of her affidavit (Exh. A).<br><br>On cross-examination, she testified that she did not inform her mother about the first rape incident but on 12 September 2006, she informed her mother about the second rape incident that happened on 23 August 2006; her mother left their house in August 2006 because [appellant] was inflicting physical harm on her mother. She maintained that [appellant] was able to insert his sex organ into her private organ during the three rapes committed by [appellant] on her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br></blockquote>Dr. Legaspi was the Rural Health Physician of the Calapan City Health and Sanitation Department. She testified that she examined "AAA" on September 8, 2006 and that she found no external injuries on the body of AAA; however, she confirmed that "AAA" sustained "old healed complete hymenal lacerations at 1, 4, 6, 9 and 11 o'clock positions, [with] no hymenal nor vaginal bleeding at the time of examination."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Dr. Legaspi testified that these lacerations could have been caused by the insertion of a male sex organ into "AAA's" private organ and that it was possible that "AAA" had been sexually molested about three or more times.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>"BBB", "AAA's" younger brother, also testified. He confirmed the truthfulness of the contents of the affidavit he voluntarily executed in relation to the incident that happened on September 8, 2006.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> In this affidavit,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> "BBB" narrated that at around 7:00 a.m. of September 8, 2006, appellant asked him to buy a can of sardines at a nearby store; that when he returned to their house, he saw appellant half­ naked while lying on top of "AAA". Frightened, he went to the house of "EEE", their uncle on the maternal side, and reported the incident. "BBB" likewise testified that he was not compelled by the prosecution to testify against his father; he disclosed, however, that he went to court because he wanted to request the dismissal of the case against his father as per his agreement with "AAA".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> On cross-examination, "BBB" admitted that he was compelled to attend the case hearings by his mother's live-in partner as he was afraid of him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, the defense presented appellant as its lone witness. Appellant denied the accusations against him and claimed that they were fabricated by his brother-in-law, "EEE", who harbored a grudge against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> According to appellant, he was being suspected by "EEE" of having a relationship wi1h the latter's wife.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> When asked about the sworn statement of "BBB", appellant countered that what "BBB" actually saw was him putting on his work clothes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br><b><i>Ruling of the Regional Trial Court</i></b><br><br>On August 24, 2011, the RTC rendered a Joint Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> finding appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of three (3) counts of qualified rape. It held that appellant's bare denial and imputation of ill motives on "BEE" were insufficient to rebut the evidence of the prosecution. It further held that "AAA's" categorical and positive identification of appellant as her rapist prevailed over his denial.<br><br>The trial court, thus, ruled:<br><blockquote>In sum, after a judicious evaluation of the totality of evidence adduced by both the prosecution and the defense, this Court finds nothing which would destroy the moral certainty of the accused's guilt<br><br>In the case at bar, the accused [was] being charged of the crime of qualified rape considering that at the time the rape incidents took place, the private complainant was only fifteen (15) years of age and x x x the daughter of the accused. Records x x x clearly [showed] that both the private complainant's minority and her relationship with the accused as her father [were] both alleged in the informations and were proven beyond reasonable doubt by the prosecution during the trial. The prosecution was able to prove that the private complainant [AAA] was only fifteen (15) years old at the time the incidents of rape took place by presenting the private complainant's Certificate of Live Birth (Exhibits F, F-1 to F-4), issued by the Local Civil Registrar x x x wherein x x x it [was stated] that her father [was] the accused Benjamin Salaver y Luzon (Exhibit F-3).<br></blockquote>The RTC disposed of the case, as follows:<br><blockquote>ACCORDINGLY, finding herein accused Benjamin Salaver y Luzon x x x guilty beyond reasonable doubt of three (3) counts of rape, said accused is hereby sentenced to suffer the THREE (3) penalties of RECLUSION PERPETUA without eligibility for parole and with all the accessory penalties as provided for by law. The accused is hereby directed to indemnify the private complainant civil indemnity ex ­delicto in the amount of Seventy-Five Thousand Pesos (Php75,000.00) for each case x x x; moral damages in the amount of Seventy-Five Thousand Pesos (Php75,000.00) for each case x x x and exemplary damages of Twenty-Five Thousand Pesos (Php25,000.00) for each case x x x.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br></blockquote><b><i>Ruling of the Court of Appeals</i></b><br><br>In his Brief,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> appellant argued that the trial court failed to correctly appreciate "AAA's" as well as her witnesses' testimony. First, despite her claim of having been thrice raped, "AAA" appeared to have no apparent fear or disgust against appellant as she continued to stay at the same house with him, always obliged when invited to go inside his room, and even agreed with "BBB" to have the case dismissed. These acts, according to appellant, were contrary to human nature and experience. Second, "AAA's" testimony suffered from inconsistency in that on direct examination, she said that she told her mother about the first rape incident, but on cross-examination, she testified that she did not immediately report the incident to anyone. Third, the medical examination showed no signs of employment of force nor any physical injuries. Fourth, "AAA's" conduct after the alleged sexual assaults raised suspicion as to the truthfulness of the rape charges since she continued with her usual routine and did not report the matter to the authorities. Fifth, the testimonies of "AAA" and "BBB" indicated that the rape charges were filed through "EEE's" manipulation coupled with the dislike of the mother of "AAA" towards appellant. Lastly, there was an apparent lack of resistance or struggle to the assaults.<br><br>After review, the CA denied the appeal and found "AAA's" testimony clear, straightforward, and worthy of belief, and the alleged inconsistencies trivial. As to the other arguments raised by appellant, the CA noted that:<br><blockquote>Appellant's assertion that AAA - (a) continued to live with him in their house after the alleged first rape incident; (b) did not immediately report the rape to authorities; and [c] did not have any fresh hymenal lacerations and bruises on her body, give rise to doubt as to the veracity of the rape, deserves scant consideration. First, where did appellant expect AAA to go[?] She was a minor, only fifteen (15) years of age, when appellant raped her. Second, [it was] not uncommon for a rape victim to initially conceal the assault against her person for several reasons, including that of fear of threats posed by her assailant, specially when the assailant [was] her father. Third, well-settled is the rule that in rape cases, the absence of fresh lacerations in complainant's hymen does not prove that she was not raped. A freshly broken hymen is not an essential element of rape. Healed lacerations do not negate rape. Lastly, settled is the rule that in incestuous rape, the father's moral ascendancy and influence over his daughter substitutes for violence and intimidation. x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br></blockquote>The CA disposed of appellant's appeal, as follows:<br><blockquote>All told, appellant's denial and alibi cannot prevail over the positive testimony of AAA.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the Decision dated August 24, 2011 is AFFIRMED <i>in toto</i>.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br></blockquote>Appellant, thus, filed a Notice of Appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> On July 11, 2016, the Court required the parties to submit their respective supplemental briefs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> However, in separate Manifestations,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> both parties opted not to file the same.<br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b><br></center><br>After careful review of the records of the case, we find the appeal to be devoid of merit.<br><br>Article 266-A, paragraph (1) of the Revised Penal Code reads, as follows:<br><blockquote>Article 266-A. Rape: When And How Committed. - Rape is committed:<br><br>1) By a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:<br><br>a) Through force, threat, or intimidation;<br><br>b) When the offended party is deprived of reason or is otherwise unconscious;<br><br>c) By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority; and<br><br>d) When the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age or is demented, even though none of the circumstances mentioned above be present.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br></blockquote>Rape is qualified when "the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> The elements of qualified rape are: "(1) sexual congress; (2) with a woman; (3) done by force and without consent; (4) the victim is under [eighteen] years of age at the time of the rape; and (5) the offender is a parent (whether legitimate, illegitimate or adopted) of the victim."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>The prosecution satisfactorily established the elements of qualified rape. The Court, thus, finds no reason to reverse the CA in affirming the ruling of the RTC finding appellant guilty of three counts of qualified rape. "AAA's" testimony was a candid narration of her ordeal in the hands of appellant. Moreover, it was established by the evidence on record, specifically "AAA's" Birth Certificate, that "AAA" was a minor at the time she was raped by her father-assailant.<br><br>The Court gives great weight to the findings of the lower courts on the credibility of "AAA". "It is settled jurisprudence that testimonies of child victims are given full weight and credit, because when a woman, more so if she is a minor, says that she has been raped, she says in effect all that is necessary to show that rape was committed. Youth and immaturity are generally badges of truth and sincerity."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> As correctly held by the CA, "AAA's" recount of her horrific experience at the hands of her father was clear and straightforward. Appellant's defenses of improper motive and denial, which deserves no weight in law, cannot prevail over "AAA's" positive and categorical testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> The Court has ruled that "a young girl's revelation that she had been raped, coupled with her voluntary submission to medical examination and willingness to undergo public trial where she could be compelled to give out the details of an assault on her dignity, cannot be so easily dismissed as mere concoction."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> This legal dictum especially applies in cases where the assailant was her father.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>The inconsistency alluded to in "AAA's" testimony, with respect to whether or not she immediately reported the first rape incident to her mother, was trivial and should be liberally construed considering that it was not an essential element of the crime of rape. "What is decisive is that [appellant's] commission of the crime charged has been sufficiently proved."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> "Such inconsistencies on minor details are in fact badges of truth, candidness, and the fact that the witness is unrehearsed."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Appellant points out that "AAA's" actions after the rape incidents, such as her lack of fear and disgust towards him by continuing to stay in his house, as well as the delay in reporting the alleged rape, raised doubts as to the truth of her allegations. This assertion is unfounded. "AAA" explained that after the first rape incident, she never slept again in her father's house as advised by her mother, but only came back to get something from the house after her classes in school.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Further, she testified that right after the rape, she immediately conveyed the incident to her brother and mother.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> At any rate, it was not inconceivable that "AAA" resumed with her usual routine of going to school and returning back to the house of appellant despite the sexual molestations. "AAA's" actions were not unusual for victims who are minors. "Behavioral psychology teaches us that, even among adults, people react to similar situations differently, and there is no standard form of human behavioral response when one is confronted with a startling or frightful experience."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Moreover, the failure or delay in the reporting of rape incidents cannot be taken against rape victims as they are oftentimes overwhelmed with fear. This Court has recognized the moral ascendancy and influence the father has over his child.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> "[T]here can be no greater source of fear or intimidation than your own father, [the] one, who, generally, has exercised authority over your person since birth."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Appellant further maintains that Dr. Legaspi's medical finding that there were no evident signs of external injuries lends credence to his claim that no rape incident took place as it negates evidence of physical force. The contention, however, fails to persuade. "[W]e have ruled that it is not indispensable that marks of external bodily injuries should appear on [rape victims]."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Nonetheless, the completely healed lacerations at 1, 4, 6, 9 and 11 o'clock positions on "AAA's" hymen, as testified by Dr. Legaspi, corroborated the findings of rape. "[L]acerations, whether healed or fresh, are the best physical evidence of forcible defloration."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>Appellant then suggests that "AAA's" lack of strong resistance to the advances of her assailant rendered the charge of rape doubtful. Suffice it to say that this assertion does not affect the merits of the charge against him because resistance is not an element of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Nevertheless, in "AAA's "testimony before the trial court, she recalled and explained her failure to resist her father's sexual advances, to wit:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td colspan="2"><div align="justify">Pros.

In cases of qualified rape, moral ascendancy or influence supplants the element of violence or intimidation. Physical resistance need not be established when intimidation is brought to bear on the victim and the latter submits herself out of fear."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Appellant further attempts to discredit the testimony of "AAA" claiming that the filing of the charges was ill-motivated and was impelled by the manipulation of "AAA's" uncle, "EEE", coupled with dislike for him due to his treatment towards "AAA's" mother. We are not persuaded. "[W]e have reiterated time and time again that it is most unlikely for a young girl x x x, or even her family, to impute the crime of rape to no less than relatives and to face social humiliation, if not to vindicate her honor."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>All told, we therefore affirm the conviction of appellant for three counts of qualified rape.
