				<BR><STRONG>LEONEN, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The rules on competitive public bidding and those concerning the disbursement of public funds are imbued with public interest. Government officials whose work relates to these matters are expected to exercise greater responsibility in ensuring compliance with the pertinent rules and regulations. The doctrine allowing heads of offices to rely in good faith on the acts of their subordinates is inapplicable in a situation where there are circumstances that should have prompted the government officials to make further inquiries.<br><br>For this Court's resolution are three (3) consolidated Petitions for Review on Certiorari<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> concerning alleged anomalies in the implementation of infrastructure projects within the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM).

The assailed judgments declared Farouk B. Abubakar (Abubakar) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of 10 counts of violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019, and Ulama S. Baraguir (Baraguir) and Datukan M. Guiani (Guiani) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of 17 counts of violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Abubakar, Baraguir, and Guiani were public officials of the Department of Public Works and Highways in ARMM (DPWH-ARMM) when the offenses were allegedly committed. Abubakar held the position of Director III, Administrative, Finance Management Service. Baraguir was the Director of the Bureau of Construction, Materials and Equipment, and a member of the Pre-Qualification Bids and Awards Committee, while Guiani was the DPWH-ARMM Regional Secretary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br><i>Guiani v. Sandiganbayan</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> is the procedural antecedent of this case.<br><br>After the creation of ARMM, the national government earmarked P615,000,000.00 for the implementation of regional and provincial infrastructure projects. In 1991, the funds were transferred to the Office of the ARMM Regional Governor. Later, a portion of the funds was then transferred to DPWH-ARMM.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>During the incumbency of then President Fidel V. Ramos (President Ramos), the Office of the President received reports of irregularities attending the implementation of the DPWH-ARMM infrastructure projects. The Commission on Audit was directed to conduct an investigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Acting upon then President Ramos' instruction, the Commission on Audit created a special audit team headed by Heidi L. Mendoza (Mendoza) to look into the implementation of four (4) road concreting projects, namely: (1) the Cotabato-Lanao Road, Sections 1-13; (2) the Awang-Nuro Road; (3) the Highway Linek-Kusiong Road; and (4) the Highway Simuay Seashore Road.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Physical inspections were conducted on October 15, 1992 to validate the existence of the projects and the extent of their development.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>The audit team made the following findings:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>First, an overpayment amounting to P17,684,000.00 was incurred on nine (9) road sections. The audit team discovered the existence of bloated accomplishment reports that allowed contractors to prematurely claim on their progress billings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Second, advance payments totaling P14,400,000.00 were given to nine (9) contractors for the procurement of aggregate sub-base course in violation of Section 88(l) of Presidential Decree No. 1445.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Third, public bidding for the Cotabato-Lanao Road Project was done without a detailed engineering survey.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> The bidding was reportedly conducted on January 14, 1992. However, the engineering survey was only completed sometime in August 1992. The audit team also observed bidding irregularities in the Awang-Nuro Road Project and in six (6) road sections of the Cotabato-Lanao Road Project. Public bidding for the two (2) projects was reportedly conducted on January 14, 1992 but records disclose that the contractors already mobilized their equipment as early as January 4 to 7, 1992.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Lastly, the engineering survey for the centerline relocation and profiling of the Cotabato-Lanao Road, which cost P200,000.00, appeared to be unnecessary due to the existence of a previous engineering survey. Furthermore, advance payment was given to the contractor in excess of the limit provided under the implementing rules and regulations of Presidential Decree No. 1594.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Based on the report submitted by the Commission on Audit, the Office of the Ombudsman conducted a preliminary investigation and found probable cause to indict the regional officials of DPWH-ARMM for violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019 or the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act. On July 31, 1998, 21 separate Informations were filed against Abubakar, Baraguir, Guiani, and other officials of DPWH-ARMM. The consolidated cases were docketed as Criminal Case Nos. 24963-24983.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Charged in Criminal Case Nos. 24963 to 24969 were Guiani, Baraguir, and several other DPWH-ARMM officials for allegedly awarding projects to contractors without the required public bidding.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Abubakar, Guiani, Baraguir, and two (2) employees of DPWH-ARMM were charged in Criminal Case No. 24970 for allegedly awarding excessive mobilization fees to Arce Engineering Services.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Guiani was charged in Criminal Case No. 24971 for entering into an unnecessary contract with Arce Engineering Services for the conduct of another detailed engineering survey.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Abubakar, Baraguir, Guiani, and two (2) other officials of DPWH­-ARMM were charged in Criminal Case Nos. 24972, 24975 to 24980, and 24982 to 24983 for allegedly advancing P14,400,000.00 to several contractors for sub-base aggregates.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Lastly, Abubakar, Baraguir, Guiani, and several other DPWH-ARMM officials were charged in Criminal Case Nos. 24973, 24974, and 24981 for allegedly causing overpayment on several projects due to bloated accomplishment reports.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>All the Informations charged the accused with conspiracy except for Criminal Case No. 24971.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Upon arraignment, Abubakar, Baraguir, Guiani, and some of their co­-accused entered a plea of not guilty. Seven (7) of their co-accused remained at large while one (1) died prior to the scheduled arraignment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>During trial, the prosecution presented Leodivina A. De Leon (De Leon) and Mendoza to testify on the findings of the Commission on Audit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>De Leon testified on the alleged irregularities attending the bidding procedure. She explained that some contractors were allowed to mobilize their equipment even before the conduct of the bidding and the perfection of the contracts for six (6) road sections of the Cotabato-Lanao Road and the Awang-Nuro Road Projects.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Mendoza testified on the alleged irregular payment scheme for the procurement of sub-base aggregates. She stated that the concerned DPWH­-ARMM officials made it appear that they were requesting for the pre-payment of cement. However, the disbursement vouchers indicate that the payment was made for the procurement of sub-base aggregates. The words "sub-base aggregates" were superimposed on the disbursement vouchers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>After the prosecution rested its case, several of the accused filed their respective Motions for Leave to file Demurrer to Evidence. These Motions were denied by the Sandiganbayan in its March 18, 2008 Resolution. The defense then proceeded to the presentation of its evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Presented as witnesses for the defense were some of the accused: (1) Nelfa M. Suasin (Suasin), an accountant of DPWH-ARMM; (2) Guialoson A. Mamogkat (Mamogkat), the DPWH-ARMM Director for Operations; (3) Taungan S. Masadag (Masandag), the DPWH-ARMM Regional Assistant Secretary and the designated Chair of the Pre-Qualification Bids and Awards Committee; (4) Abubakar; and (5) Baraguir. Commission on Audit's Records Custodian Nenita V. Rama was also presented as a defense witness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Suasin testified that she consulted her superiors, particularly Abubakar, Baraguir, and Guiani, regarding the 30% mobilization fees awarded to Arce Engineering Services. They explained to her that the mobilization fee was increased as no other surveyor was willing to undertake the work due to the peace and order situation in the area. Suasin raised the same defense on the P14,400,000.00 advance payment. She claimed that she signed the disbursement vouchers after seeking approval from her superiors. She also testified that the item typewritten on the disbursement vouchers was "cement" and not "sub-base aggregates."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Mamogkat testified that DPWH-ARMM had to re-survey some areas of the Cotabato-Lanao Road Project because they could no longer locate the reference points marked in the original survey. He denied the charge that some contractors were overpaid, and attributed the discrepancy between the audit team's report and DPWH-ARMM's report on several factors. He pointed out, among others, that the physical inspection conducted by the DPWH-ARMM team was more extensive compared to the audit team's one (1)-day inspection.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Masandag insisted that the Pre-Qualification Bids and Awards Committee followed the bidding procedure laid down in Presidential Decree No. 1594. He denied knowledge and participation on the alleged early mobilization of contractors, and claimed that it was the Regional Secretary who authorized the issuance of the certificates of mobilization.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Abubakar claimed that he was only implicated due to the presence of his signature in the disbursement vouchers. He asserted that he examined the supporting documents and the certifications made by the technical experts before affixing his signature.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Last to testify for the defense was Baraguir. He claimed that some contractors took the risk of mobilizing their equipment before the conduct of public bidding on the expectation that the winning bidders would sub-lease their equipment. He also testified that construction immediately began on some projects after the engineering survey to fast track the implementation of the projects.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>On December 8, 2011, the Sandiganbayan rendered judgment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> finding Guiani, Baraguir, and Masandag guilty beyond reasonable doubt of seven (7) counts of violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019 in Criminal Case Nos. 24963 to 24969.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>The Sandiganbayan held that Guiani, Baraguir, and Masandag conspired with each other and gave unwarranted benefits, preference, and advantage to seven (7) contractors by allowing them to deploy their equipment before the scheduled public bidding. Records show that the public bidding for the Cotabato-Lanao Road and Awang-Nuro Road Projects was conducted after the issuance of the certificates of mobilization:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td width="20%"><div align="center"><strong>Project</strong></div></td><td width="20%"><div align="center"><strong>Contractor</strong></div></td><td width="20%"><div align="center"><strong>Date of Certification</strong></div></td><td width="20%"><div align="center"><strong>Date of Bidding</strong></div></td><td width="20%"><div align="center"><strong>Date of Contract</strong></div></td></tr><tr><td><div align="center">Awang-Nuro Road</div></td><td><div align="center">HMB Construction and Supply</div></td><td><div align="center">Jan. 7, 1992</div></td><td><div align="center">Jan. 14, 1992</div></td><td><div align="center">Jan. 16, 1992</div></td></tr><tr><td><div align="center">Cotabato-Lanao Road Section 8</div></td><td><div align="center">Kutawato Construction</div></td><td><div align="center">Jan. 5, 1992</div></td><td><div align="center">[Jan. 14, 1992]</div></td><td><div align="center">[Jan. 16, 1992]</div></td></tr><tr><td><div align="center">[Cotabato-Lanao Road] Section 7</div></td><td><div align="center">Al Mohandiz Construction</div></td><td><div align="center">Jan. 5, 1992</div></td><td><div align="center">[Jan. 14, 1992]</div></td><td><div align="center">[Jan. 16, 1992]</div></td></tr><tr><td><div align="center">[Cotabato-Lanao Road] Section 2</div></td><td><div align="center">JM Construction</div></td><td><div align="center">Jan. 7, 1992</div></td><td><div align="center">[Jan. 14, 1992]</div></td><td><div align="center">[Jan. 16, 1992]</div></td></tr><tr><td><div align="center">[Cotabato-Lanao Road] Section 5</div></td><td><div align="center">PMA Construction</div></td><td><div align="center">Jan. 6, 1992</div></td><td><div align="center">[Jan. 14, 1992]</div></td><td><div align="center">Jan. 20, 1992</div></td></tr><tr><td><div align="center">[Cotabato-Lanao Road] Section 3</div></td><td><div align="center">Al-Aziz-Engineering</div></td><td><div align="center">Jan. 4, 1992</div></td><td><div align="center">[Jan. 14, 1992]</div></td><td><div align="center">Jan. 8, 1992</div></td></tr><tr><td><div align="center">[Cotabato-Lanao Road] Section 1 </div></td><td><div align="center">MGL Construction</div></td><td><div align="center">Jan. 5, 1992</div></td><td><div align="center">[Jan. 14, 1992]</div></td><td><div align="center">Jan. 15, 1992<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>According to the Sandiganbayan, HMB Construction and Supply, Kutawato Construction, Al Mohandiz Construction, JM Construction, PMA Construction, Al-Aziz-Engineering, and MGL Construction were already identified as contractors for the abovementioned projects even before the scheduled public bidding. For instance, the certification issued to HMB Construction and Supply stated:<br><blockquote><center><u>CERTIFICATION</u><br></center><br>THIS IS TO CERTIFY that <u>HMB CONSTRUCTION AND SUPPLY</u>, <b>Contractor for the construction of <u>AWANG-NURO, UPI ROAD</u></b>, had already mobilized a minimum number of equipments (sic) necessary for the implementation of the said project.<br><br>This certification is being issued to <u>HMB CONSTRUCTION AND SUPPLY</u> in connection with his legal claim under P.D. 1594 as stated for the payment of fifteen (15) percent mobilization fee.<br><br>Issued this <u>7<sup>th</sup></u> day of <u>January</u>, 1992.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote>Similar certifications were issued to Kutawato Construction, Al Mohandiz Construction, JM Construction, PMA Construction, Al-Aziz­ Engineering, and MGL Construction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>The Sandiganbayan rejected the defense's justification regarding the early mobilization of these contractors, and underscored that no contractor would risk mobilizing its equipment without any assurance that the projects would be awarded to it. Although a public bidding was actually conducted, the Sandiganbayan believed that it was done as a mere formality.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Accused Guiani, Mamogkat, Abubakar, Baraguir, and Suasin were found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019 for causing the disbursement of30% of the mobilization fees or advance payment to Arce Engineering Services.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>Accused Guiani was acquitted in Criminal Case No. 24971 for his alleged act of entering into a second detailed engineering survey. The Sandiganbayan held that the second survey was indispensable because the reference points in the original survey could no longer be found. The prosecution failed to prove that accused Guiani exhibited manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence in hiring Arce Engineering Services.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>The Sandiganbayan convicted accused Guiani, Mamogkat, Abubakar, Baraguir, and Suasin of nine (9) counts of violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019 for facilitating the advance payment for the procurement of sub-base aggregates.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> It characterized the P14,400,000.00 disbursement as an advance payment and not as pre-payment for construction materials. First, the disbursement was given directly to the contractor and not to the suppliers. Second, there were no written requests from the contractors who wished to avail of the pre-payment facility. Third, under Department Order No. 42 of the Department of Public Works and Highways, only cement, reinforcing steel bars, and asphalt may be procured under a pre-payment scheme.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Thus, the P14,400,000.00 disbursement could not be considered as pre-payment for construction materials.<br><br>The Sandiganbayan concluded that the disbursement was an advance payment and declared it illegal because there were no documents to prove that the items were actually delivered. It cited Section 88(1) of Presidential Decree No. 1445 as legal basis.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>Guiani, Baraguir, Abubakar, and Mamogkat were acquitted in Criminal Case Nos. 24973, 24974, and 24981 for allegedly causing the overpayment on several projects due to bloated accomplishment reports. The Sandiganbayan gave more credence to DPWH-ARMM's accomplishment report over the audit team's report. First, the standards used by each team varied. Second, DPWH-ARMM's inspection was more extensive.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>The dispositive portion of the Sandiganbayan's December 8, 2011 Decision stated:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, IN LIGHT OF ALL THE FOREGOING, the Court hereby renders judgment as follows:<br><br>1.

Once engaged, a counsel holds "the implied authority to do all acts which are necessary or, at least, incidental to the prosecution and management of the suit."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> The acts of counsel are deemed acts of the client.<br><br>Thus, as a rule, parties are bound by the acts, omissions, and mistakes of their counsel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> To adopt a contrary principle may lead to unnecessary delays, indefinite court proceedings, and possibly no end to litigation for all that a defeated party would do is to claim .that his or her counsel acted negligently.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> An exception to this is when the gross and inexcusable negligence of counsel deprives the latter's client of his or her day in court. The allegation of gross and inexcusable negligence, however, must be substantiated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> In determining whether the case falls under the exception, courts should always be guided by the principle that parties must be "given the fullest opportunity to establish the merits of [their] action or defense."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup><br><br>The general rule on the binding effect of counsel's acts and omissions has been applied with respect to applications for a new trial. In <i>U.S. v. Umali</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup><br><blockquote>In criminal as well as in civil cases, it has frequently been held that the fact that blunders and mistakes may have been made in the conduct of the proceedings in the trial court, as a result of the ignorance, inexperience, or incompetence of counsel, does not furnish a ground for a new trial.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>So it has been held that <i>mistakes of attorneys as to the competency of a witness, the sufficiency, relevancy, materiality, or immateriality of certain evidence, the proper defense, or the burden of proof are not proper grounds for a new trial</i>; and in general the client is bound by the action of his counsel in the conduct of his case, and can not be heard to complain that the result of the litigation might have been different had counsel proceeded differently.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Liberality has been applied in criminal cases but under exceptional circumstances. Given that a person's liberty is at stake in a criminal case, <i>Umali</i> concedes that the strict application of the general rule may lead to a manifest miscarriage of justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> Thus, appropriate relief may be accorded to a defendant who has shown a meritorious defense and who has satisfied the court that acquittal would follow after the introduction of omitted evidence:<br><blockquote>It must be admitted, however, that courts of last resort have occasionally relaxed the strict application of this rule in criminal cases, where the defendants, having otherwise a good case, were able to satisfy the court that acquittal would in all probability have followed the introduction of certain testimony, which was not submitted at the trial under improper or injudicious advice of incompetent counsel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup><br></blockquote>In <i>De Guzman v. Sandiganbayan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> the accused was convicted based solely on the testimony of the prosecution's witness. The accused was unable to present any evidence due to his counsel's insistence in filing a demurrer to evidence despite the Sandiganbayan's denial of the motion for leave to file it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> This was considered by this Court as gross negligence:<br><blockquote>Petitioner's present dilemma is certainly not something reducible to pesos and centavos. No less than his liberty is at stake here. And he is just about to lose it simply because his former lawyers pursued a carelessly contrived procedural strategy of insisting on what has already become an imprudent remedy, as aforediscussed, which thus forbade petitioner from offering his evidence all the while available for presentation before the Sandiganbayan. Under the circumstances, higher interests of justice and equity demand that petitioner be not penalized for the costly importunings of his previous lawyers based on the same principles why this Court had, on many occasions where it granted new trial, excused parties from the negligence or mistakes of counsel. To cling to the general rule in this case is only to condone rather than rectify a serious injustice to petitioners whose only fault was to repose his faith and entrust his innocence to his previous lawyers. Consequently, the receipts and other documents constituting his evidence which he failed to present in the Sandiganbayan are entitled to be appreciated, however, by that forum and not this Court, for the general rule is that we are not triers of facts. Without prejudging the result of such appreciation, petitioner's documentary evidences <i>prima facie</i> appear strong when reckoned with the lone prosecution witness Angeles' testimony, indicating that official training programs were indeed actually conducted and that the P200,000.00 cash advance he received were spent entirely for those programs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> (Citation omitted)<br></blockquote>Similarly, in <i>Callangan v. People of the Philippines</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> the accused was unable to present any evidence. This Court, in granting new trial, characterized the "chronic inaction of [the accused's] counsel on important incidents and stages of the criminal proceedings" as a denial of due process:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup><br><blockquote>The omissions of petitioner's counsel amounted to an abandonment or total disregard of her case. They show conscious indifference to or utter disregard of the possible repercussions to his client. Thus, the chronic inaction of petitioner's counsel on important incidents and stages of the criminal proceedings constituted gross negligence.<br><br>The RTC itself found that petitioner never had the chance to present her defense because of the nonfeasance (malfeasance, even) of her counsel. It also concluded that, effectively, she was without counsel. Considering these findings, to deprive petitioner of her liberty without affording her the right to be assisted by counsel is to deny her due process.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup><br></blockquote>In one occasion, this Court allowed the presentation of additional evidence even if the accused initially adduced evidence during trial. This level ofliberality, however, is conditioned upon a finding that the introduction of omitted evidence would probably alter the result of the case.<br><br>In <i>Abrajano v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup> this Court remanded the case to the trial court for the conduct of new trial to allow the accused to present additional evidence. The same standard in <i>Umali</i> was applied:<br><blockquote>Nevertheless, courts of last resort have occasionally relaxed the strict application of the rule that the acts of counsel bind the client in criminal cases, where the defendants, having otherwise a good case were able to satisfy the Court that acquittal would in all probability have followed the introduction of certain testimonies, which were not submitted at the trial under improper or injudicious advi[c]e of incompetent counsel. While conceding that these cases are extremely rare, the Court, in <i>United States v. Umali</i>, allowed for the relaxation of the rule. Where there are very exceptional circumstances, and where a review of the whole record taken together with the evidence improvidently omitted would clearly justify the conclusion that the omission had resulted in the conviction of one innocent of the crime charged, a new trial may be granted.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>In the case at bar, the circumstance that petitioner allegedly used the name "Carmen" in her first marriage instead ofCarmelita, together with the affidavits she submitted, particularly those of Mrs. Priscila Alimagno, supposedly a witness to Carmen's marriage to Mauro Espinosa, and petitioner's sister Jocelyn Gilbuena, who attested that Carmen is indeed their half-sister, would in our mind probably alter the result of this case. A new trial is therefore necessary if justice is to be served.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Given this standard, this Court holds that petitioners Abubakar and Baraguir are not entitled to a new trial.<br><br>First, they failed to convince this Court that they have a meritorious defense and that the evidence they seek to introduce would probably lead to their acquittal.<br><br>The present case does not involve the same factual circumstances in <i>De Guzman</i> or in <i>Callangan</i> where the accused were absolutely denied the opportunity to present evidence due to the actuations of their counsels. In those cases, it was just and reasonable for this Court to take a much more liberal stance considering that there was a denial of due process. The same kind of liberality, however, cannot be applied here. Petitioners Abubakar and Baraguir, through counsel, presented their evidence and made out their case before the Sandiganbayan. Based on <i>Umali</i> and <i>Abrajano</i>, it is incumbent upon them to present a meritorious defense and to convince this Court that the evidence omitted by their former counsel would probably alter the results of the case. They cannot simply allege that they were deprived of due process or that their defense was not fully threshed out during trial.<br><br>Petitioners Abubakar and Baraguir failed to discharge this burden.<br><br>Petitioners seek to introduce as evidence their personnel data files, contracts of service, and appointment papers to prove that they were engaged in a temporary capacity. These documents would certainly not alter the results of the case. Regardless of the nature of their employment, petitioners are required to abide by the rules and regulations on public bidding and disbursement of public funds.<br><br>Testimony of handwriting experts, original copies of disbursement vouchers, and written requests of contractors who wished to avail of the pre­payment scheme under DPWH Department Order No. 42 would probably not change the finding on the irregularities pertaining to the P14,400,000.00 disbursement for sub-base aggregates.<br><br>The disbursement vouchers<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup> that petitioner Abubakar seeks to introduce would not exonerate him from liability in Criminal Case Nos. 24972, 24979, 24980, 24982, and 24983, where the disbursement vouchers are not relevant. The disbursement vouchers relate to the payment of the balance of mobilization fees to contractors. The criminal cases cited by Abubakar, on the other hand, pertain to the alleged advance payment for sub-base aggregates.<br><br>Likewise, the evidence cited by petitioner Baraguir would not affect the result of the case against him. There is no reason to introduce pieces of evidence to prove the publication of the invitation to bid and the conduct of actual bidding. The occurrence of these events was not disputed by the parties. Meanwhile, the Notices of Award and Notices to Commence, even if admitted, would not change the finding that certain contractors deployed their equipment ahead of public bidding. The pieces of evidence that petitioner Baraguir ought to have presented are those tending to prove that the contractors only mobilized after they won the bidding. This would have destroyed the prosecution's theory and the basis for the criminal charge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup><br><br>Second, petitioners Abubakar and Baraguir's former counsel was not grossly negligent. Their former counsel may have failed to present other pieces of evidence in addition to what their co-accused had presented. He may have also failed to incorporate other arguments in the record of the case. However, these cannot be considered as grossly negligent acts.<br><br>Assessments regarding the materiality or relevancy of evidence, competency of witnesses, and procedural technique generally fall within the expertise and control of counsel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup> This Court has held that for a claim of gross negligence to prosper, "nothing short of clear abandonment of the client's cause must be shown."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup><br><br>Litigants cannot always be assured that their expectations regarding their counsel's competence would be met. In <i>Ong Lay Hin v. Court of Appeals</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup><br><blockquote>The state does not guarantee to the client that they will receive the kind of service that they expect. Through this court, we set the standard on competence and integrity through the application requirements and our disciplinary powers. Whether counsel discharges his or her role to the satisfaction of the client is a matter that will ideally be necessarily monitored but, at present, is too impractical.<br><br>Besides, finding good counsel is also the responsibility of the client especially when he or she can afford to do so. Upholding client autonomy in these choices is infinitely a better policy choice than assuming that the state is omniscient. Some degree of error must, therefore, be borne by the client who does have the capacity to make choices.<br><br>This is one of the bases of the doctrine that the error of counsel visits the client. This court will cease to perform its social functions if it provides succor to all who are not satisfied with the services of their counsel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup><br></blockquote>Furthermore, in <i>Aguila v. Court of First Instance of Batangas</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup><br><blockquote>Persons are allowed to practice law only after they shall have passed the bar examinations, which merely determine if they have the minimum requirements to engage in the exercise of the legal profession. This is no guaranty, of course, that they will discharge their duties with full fidelity to their clients or with unfailing mastery or at least appreciation of the law. The law, to be fair, is not really all that simple; there are parts that are rather complicated and may challenge the skills of many lawyers. By and large, however, the practice of the law should not present much difficulty unless by some unfortunate quirk of fate, the lawyer has been allowed to enter the bar despite his lack of preparation, or, while familiar with the intricacies of his calling, is nevertheless neglectful of his duties and does not pay proper attention to his work.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup><br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b>II</b><br></div><br>The prosecution of offenses is generally addressed to the sound discretion of the fiscal.

The burden lies on the defendant to show discriminatory intent through extrinsic evidence.<br><br>In <i>People v.

She pointed out that a certain Jasmine Alejandro (Alejandro), the person who handed out application forms, was not indicted. She concluded that the prosecution discriminated against her based on "regional origins." She was a Cebuana while Alejandro was a Zamboangueña.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup><br><br>In rejecting the accused's argument, this Court held that the prosecution of one person to the exclusion of others who may be just as guilty does not automatically entail a violation of the equal protection clause.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup> There must be a showing of discriminatory intent or "clear and intentional discrimination," which can only be established through extrinsic evidence. In <i>Dela Piedra</i>:<br><blockquote>Where the official action purports to be in conformity to the statutory classification, an erroneous or mistaken performance of the statutory duty. although a violation of the statute, is not <i>without more</i> a denial of the equal protection of the laws. The unlawful administration by officers of a statute fair on its face, resulting in its unequal application to those who are entitled to be treated alike, is not a denial of equal protection unless there is shown to be present in it an element of <i>intentional</i> or <i>purposeful</i> discrimination. This may appear on the face of the action taken with respect to a particular class or person, or it may only be shown by extrinsic evidence showing a discriminatory <i>design</i> over another not to be inferred from the action itself. <i>But a discriminatory purpose is not presumed, there must be a showing of "clear and intentional discrimination."</i> Appellant has failed to show that, in charging appellant in court, that there was a "clear and intentional discrimination" on the part of the prosecuting officials.<br><br>The discretion of who to prosecute depends on the prosecution's sound assessment whether the evidence before it can justify a reasonable belief that a person has committed an offense. The presumption is that the prosecuting officers regularly performed their duties, and this presumption can be overcome only by proof to the contrary, not by mere speculation. Indeed, appellant has not presented any evidence to overcome this presumption. The mere allegation that appellant, a Cebuana, was charged with the commission of a crime, while a Zamboangueña, the guilty party in appellant's eyes, was not, is insufficient to support a conclusion that the prosecution officers denied appellant equal protection of the laws.<br><br>There is also common sense practicality in sustaining appellant's prosecution.<br><blockquote>While all persons accused of crime are to be treated on a basis of equality before the law, it does not follow that they are to be protected in the commission of crime. It would be unconscionable, for instance, to excuse a defendant guilty of murder because others have murdered with impunity. The remedy for unequal enforcement of the law in such instances does not lie in the exoneration of the guilty at the expense of society . . . Protection of the law will be extended to all persons equally in the pursuit of their lawful occupations, but no person has the right to demand protection of the law in the commission of a crime.<br><br>Likewise,<br><br>[i]f the failure of prosecutors to enforce the criminal laws as to some persons should be converted into a defense for others charged with crime, the result would be that the trial of the district attorney for nonfeasance would become an issue in the trial of many persons charged with heinous crimes and the enforcement of law would suffer a complete breakdown.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[124]</sup> (Emphasis in the original, citations omitted)<br></blockquote></blockquote>The principle established in <i>Dela Piedra</i> was reiterated and applied in <i>People v. Dumlao</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[125]</sup><br><blockquote>A discriminatory purpose is never presumed. It must be remembered that it was not solely respondent who was charged, but also five of the seven board members. If, indeed, there were discrimination, respondent Dumlao alone could have been charged. But this was not the case. Fmther, the fact that the dismissal of the case against his co-accused Canlas and Clave was not appealed is not sufficient to cry discrimination. This is likewise true for the non-inclusion of the two government officials who signed the Lease­Purchase Agreement and the other two board members. Mere speculation, unsupported by convincing evidence, cannot establish discrimination on the part of the prosecution and the denial to respondent of the equal protection of the laws.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[126]</sup><br></blockquote>The reason for the requirement of "clear and intentional discrimination" lies in the discretion given to fiscals in the prosecution of offenses. In <i>People v. Pineda</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[127]</sup> this Court held that the choice of who to prosecute is addressed to the sound discretion of the investigating prosecutor. He or she may not be compelled to charge persons when the evidence is insufficient to establish probable cause:<br><blockquote>A prosecuting attorney, by the nature of his office, is under no compulsion to file a particular criminal information where he is not convinced that he has evidence to prop up the averments thereof, or that the evidence at hand points to a different conclusion. This is not to discount the possibility of the commission of abuses on the part of the prosecutor. But we must have to recognize that a prosecuting attorney should not be unduly compelled to work against his conviction. In case of doubt, we should give him the benefit thereof.

These irregularities create a reasonable, if not conclusive, presumption that the concerned public officials had no intention of complying with the rules on public bidding and that the results were already predetermined.<br><br>Although petitiOner Baraguir concedes that contractors can only commence work after they receive a notice to proceed, he justifies the irregularity on an alleged "risk-taking strategy' employed by some contractors.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[152]</sup><br><br>This appears to be a flimsy excuse. There is no justifiable reason why contractors should be allowed to deploy their equipment in advance considering that it would defeat the very purpose of competitive public bidding. Benefits derived from this practice, if any, would certainly not redound to the government.<br><br>Aside from this, the alleged purpose of the contractors in mobilizing their equipment ahead of public bidding is speculative. Prospective contractors are required to possess the technical capability to execute the implementation of a given project. Section 3(b) of Presidential Decree No. 1594 lists as a condition for all bidders the "[a]vailability and commitment of the contractor's equipment to be used for the subject project."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[153]</sup> The Pre­Qualification Bids and Awards Committee is mandated under the implementing rules and regulations to look into the "suitability of [the contractor's] available construction equipment" in assessing technical capability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[154]</sup><br><br>The screening process ensures that bidders have the necessary equipment and personnel to carry out the implementation of a particular government project.

Assuming that prospective bidders would be permitted to sublease their equipment from other entities, the sublease agreement should already be finalized prior to the conduct of public bidding.<br><br>Clearly, petitioners Baraguir and Guiani gave seven (7) contractors unwarranted benefits and advantage through manifest partiality.

Petitioner Guiani was charged in Criminal Case No. 24971 for allegedly entering into an unnecessary engineering survey contract with Arce Engineering Services.

On the other hand, in Criminal Case No. 24970, petitioners Abubakar, Baraguir, and Guiani were charged for causing the payment of excessive mobilization fees to Arce Engineering Services. Therefore, the acquittal of petitioner Guiani in Criminal Case No. 24971 would have no effect on Criminal Case No. 24970.<br><br>The implementing rules and regulations of Presidential Decree No. 1594 allow contractors to obtain advance payment from the government during the contract's implementation stage.

In consenting to the 30% advance payment, petitioner Guiani, through evident bad faith, gave unwarranted benefits to Arce Engineering Services.

They cannot seek refuge in the argument that they relied in good faith on what was stated in the Contract for Survey Vork because the illegality was patent on the face of the contract.

A key tax declaration had a typewritten number instead of being machine numbered. The registration stampmark was antedated and the land [was] reclassified as residential instead of ricefield. But were the petitioners guilty of conspiracy in the falsification and the subsequent charge of causing undue injury and damage to the Government?<br><br>We can, in retrospect, argue that Arias should have probed records, inspected documents, received procedures, and questioned persons. It is doubtful if any auditor for a fairly sized office could personally do all these things in all vouchers presented for his signature. The Court would be asking for the impossible. <i>All heads of offices have to rely to a reasonable extent on their subordinates and on the good faith of those who prepare bids, purchase supplies, or enter into negotiations. If a department secretary entertains important visitors, the auditor is not ordinarily expected to call the restaurant about the amount of the bill, question each guest whether he was present at the luncheon, inquire whether the correct amount of food was served, and otherwise personally look into the reimbursement voucher's accuracy, propriety, and sufficiency. There has to be some added reason why he should examine each voucher in such detail.</i> Any executive head of even small government agencies or commissions can attest to the volume of papers that must be signed. There are hundreds of documents, letters, memoranda, vouchers, and supporting papers that routinely pass through his hands. The number in bigger offices or departments is even more appalling.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[177]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>The application of the doctrine is subject to the qualification that the public official has no foreknowledge of any facts or circumstances that would prompt him or her to investigate or exercise a greater degree of care.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[178]</sup> In a number of cases, this Court refused to apply the <i>Arias</i> doctrine considering that there were circumstances that should have prompted the government official to inquire further.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[179]</sup><br><br>In the present case, the <i>Arias</i> doctrine cannot exonerate petitioners Abubakar, Baraguir, or Guiani from criminal liability. There were circumstances that should have prompted them to make further inquiries on the transactions subject of this case.<br><br>In Criminal Case Nos. 24963-24969 on the early mobilization of contractors, the irregularity was already apparent on the face of the certificates of mobilization, which bore dates earlier than the scheduled public bidding. This should have already roused suspicion from petitioners Baraguir and Guiani, who were the last signatories and final approving authorities.<br><br>The same can be said for Criminal Case No. 24970. The Contract of Survey Work, which was used as the primary supporting document for the disbursement of the 30% mobilization fee to Arce Engineering Services, contained a patently illegal stipulation.
