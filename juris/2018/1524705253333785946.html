Subsequently, the government thru respondent Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) distributed and awarded the land to the tenant-beneficiaries of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP). Consequently, petitioners were virtually<em> deprived not only of the beneficial use and enjoyment of the property but also of the fruits and income thereof since the land was taken in 1999</em>. While payment had already been made as claimed by Land Bank of the Philippines and admitted by the movants ... [it] was nothing but only initial or preliminary in character ... </p> <p> This [c]ourt likewise takes judicial notice that payment of just compensation of properties acquired under CARP is not wholly payable in cash compared to other expropriation cases. In this case, petitioners are to be paid partly in cash and [in Landbank] bonds as provided for under Section 18 of [Republic Act No.] 6657[,] in the proportion of thirty[-]five percent (35%) cash and sixty[-]five percent (65%) bonds. The bond has a maturity period of ten (10) years which matures annually until the tenth (10th) year. </p> <p> A denial of [respondents'] Motion for Execution Pending Appeal is an infringement of their constitutional rights which in effect states that "no private property shall be taken for public use without payment of just compensation." As mentioned earlier, [the landowners'] properties were taken in 1999 or for almost four (4) years without having been justly compensated. They have since ceased to enjoy the land and its fruits considering that the tenant-beneficiaries to whom the land have been awarded are the ones enjoying their properties since 1999. </p> <p> Likewise, to disallow [respondents'] Motion for Execution Pending Appeal would be prejudicial and injurious to their interest. Payment of the just compensation, which the law entitles them, can simply be stalled by frivolous appeals and other dilatory tactics causing an unwarranted delay in the payment of the just compensation. That delay may take a decade or even more[,] knowing for a fact that sixty[-]five percent (65%) of the just compensation payment shall be paid by a 10-year bond. If we add up the time difference from the period of this judgment to the date when the issue of just compensation shall have been decided with finality by the appellate courts, the delay would probably take more than one decade or so before payment can be received by petitioners. Certainly, the monetary value of [respondents'] properties as fixed by this court will no longer be the same if they are to be paid several years from the date their properties have been taken. To afford [the landowners] the true meaning and full essence of justice[,] such foreseen delay should not be allowed to take its toll at their expense and prejudice.

The issue on whether portions of the subject land may be subject to coverage is a question of fact that this Court cannot entertain or answer, absent any compelling circumstance or reason to do so.

Thus, execution pending appeal should not be granted routinely but only in extraordinary circumstances. </p> <p> The Rules of Court does not enumerate the circumstances which would justify the execution of the judgment or decision pending appeal. However, we have held that "good reasons" consist of compelling or superior circumstances demanding urgency which will outweigh the injury or damages suffered should the losing party secure a reversal of the judgment or final order. The existence of good reasons is what confers discretionary power on a court to issue a writ of execution pending appeal. These reasons must be stated in the order granting the same. Unless they are divulged, it would be difficult to determine whether judicial discretion has been properly exercised.</p> <p> In this case, do good reasons exist to justify the grant by the [Special Agrarian Court] of the motion for execution pending appeal? The answer is a resounding YES.</p> <p> The expropriation of private property under R.A. 6657 is a revolutionary kind of expropriation, being a means to obtain social justice by distributing land to the farmers, envisioning freedom from the bondage to the land they actually till. As an exercise of police power, it puts the landowner, not the government, in a situation where the odds are practically against him. He cannot resist it. His only consolation is that he can negotiate for the amount of compensation to be paid for the property taken by the government. As expected, the landowner will exercise this right to the hilt, subject to the limitation that he can only be entitled to "just compensation". Clearly therefore, by rejecting and disputing the valuation of the [Department of Agrarian Reform], the landowner is merely exercising his right to seek just compensation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[169]</sup> (Citations omitted)</p> </blockquote> <p> Thus, this Court agrees with the Regional Trial Court that "[f]or reasons of equity, justice and fair play, [respondents] should be paid to enable them to cope up with the loss they sustained as a result of the taking and for their economic survival."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[170]</sup></p><p align="center"> <b>IV</b> </p><p> The Regional Trial Court June 27, 2003 Order, as affirmed by the Court of Appeals, correctly imposed the payment of legal interest on the just compensation award. </p><p> In <i>Land Bank of the Philippines v.

The Court has previously allowed the grant of legal interest in expropriation cases where there was delay in the payment of just compensation, deeming the same to be an effective forbearance on the part of the State. To clarify, this incremental interest is not granted on the computed just compensation; rather, it is a penalty imposed for damages incurred by the landowner due to the delay in its payment. </p> <p> Thus, legal interest shall be pegged at the rate of 12% [per annum] from the time of taking until June 30, 2013. Thereafter, or beginning July 1, 2013, until fully paid, just compensation shall earn interest at the new legal rate of 6% [per annum], conformably with the modification on the rules respecting interest rates introduced by Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Monetary Board Circular No. 799, Series of 2013.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[172]</sup> (Citations omitted) </p> </blockquote> <p> In <i>Land Bank of the Philippines v.

Without prompt payment, compensation cannot be considered "just" inasmuch as the property owner is made to suffer the consequences of being immediately deprived of his land while being made to wait for a decade or more before actually receiving the amount necessary to cope with his loss.</p> <p> Put differently, while prompt payment of just compensation requires the immediate deposit and release to the landowner of the provisional compensation as determined by the [Department of Agrarian Reform], it does not end there. Verily,<i> it also encompasses the payment in full of the just compensation to the landholders as finally determined by the courts</i>. Thus, it cannot be said that there is already prompt payment of just compensation when there is only a partial payment thereof, as in this case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[174]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted)</p> </blockquote> <p> In <i>Land Bank of the Philippines v.

Land Bank of the Philippines</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[177]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> The owner's loss, of course, is not only his property but also its income-generating potential. Thus, when property is taken, full compensation of its value must immediately be paid to achieve a fair exchange for the property and the potential income lost. The just compensation is made available to the property owner so that he may derive income from this compensation, in the same manner that he would have derived income from his expropriated property. <i>If full compensation is not paid for property taken, then the State must make up for the shortfall in the earning potential immediately lost due to the taking, and the absence of replacement property from which income can be derived; interest on the unpaid compensation becomes due as compliance with the constitutional mandate on eminent domain and as a basic measure of fairness</i>. </p> <p> In the context of this case, when the [Landbank] took the petitioners' landholdings without the corresponding full payment, it became liable to the petitioners for the income the landholdings would have earned had they not immediately been taken from the petitioners. What is interesting in this interplay, under the developments of this case, is that the [Landbank], by taking landholdings without full payment while holding on at the same time to the interest that it should have paid, effectively used or retained funds that should go to the landowners and thereby took advantage of these funds for its own account.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[178]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> In this case, the records show that petitioner already gave provisional compensation in the form of cash and bonds, based on an initial valuation of the properties.

In <i>Republic v.

Thus, <i>if property is taken for public use before compensation is deposited with the court having jurisdiction over the case, the final compensation must include interests on its just value to be computed from the time the property is taken to the time when compensation is actually paid or deposited with the court.</i> In fine, between the taking of the property and the actual payment, legal interests accrue in order to place the owner in a position as good as (but not better than) the position he was in before the taking occurred.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[185]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)</p> </blockquote> <p> Petitioner's delay<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[186]</sup> in payment makes it liable for legal interest by way of damages. The legal interest must be applied "on the unpaid balance of the compensation due."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[187]</sup> Therefore, the amount already received by respondents should be subtracted from the total judgment, and the rate of legal interest should be calculated from that amount. </p><p> In view of this Court's ruling in <i>Nacar v.
