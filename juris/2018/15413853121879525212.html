Thus, in its opinion, the PhilHealth officers and employees were deemed engaged in health-related works for purposes of entitlement to the longevity pay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>On August 1, 2011, former PhilHealth President and CEO Dr. Rey B.

Agustin (Supervising Auditor Agustin), also a respondent in this case, issued Audit Observation Memorandum (AOM) 2012-09 (11) dated April 30, 2012, which found lack of legal basis for the grant of longevity pay, thus recommended the discontinuance of the grant thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>On May 18, 2012, PhilHealth, through its then President and CEO Dr. Eduardo P. Banzon (Dr. Banzon) asserted that PhilHealth personnel were public health workers, as determined by the DOH in its February 20, 2000 Certification and opined by the OGCC in its Opinion 064, Series of 2001 dated April 26, 2001 and therefore entitled to the grant of longevity pay under RA No. 7305.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>However, Supervising Auditor Agustin found unsatisfactory the justifications for the grant of longevity pay, and thus issued ND No. H.O. 12-005 (11) dated July 23, 2012.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Philhealth received the ND No. H.O. 12-005 (11) on July 30, 2012, and after 179 days from receipt thereof or on January 25, 2013, Philhealth filed its appeal memorandum before the COA Corporate Government Sector.<br><br>The COA Corporate Government Sector upheld the ND No. H.O. 12-005 (11) in its Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> No. 2014-002 dated March 13, 2014. The COA ruled that PhilHealth personnel were not public health workers but merely engaged in paying and utilization of health services by its covered beneficiaries. The dispositive portion of the Decision No. 2014-002, provides:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant Appeal is <b>DENIED</b>. Accordingly, ND No. H.O. 12-005 (11) dated July 23, 2012 is hereby affirmed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br></blockquote>PhilHealth received the above decision on March 25, 2014. PhilHealth filed a motion for extension of time of thirty (30) days, from March 30, 2014 to April 30, 2014, to file the petition for review.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Thereafter, on April 30, 2014, PhilHealth filed its petition for review before the COA Commission Proper (CP).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>On April 1, 2015, the COA CP in a Decision No. 2015-094,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> dismissed the petition for being filed out of time. It ruled that under Section 48<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445, and Rule VII, Section 3 of the 2009 Revised Rules of Procedure of COA<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>, the reglementary period to appeal the decision of an auditor is six (6) months or 180 days from receipt of the Decision. The COA found that PhilHealth filed its motion for extension of time to file the petition for review only after the lapsed of the said period. The <i>fallo</i> of the COA Decision No. 2015-094, provides:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the instant petition for review is hereby <b>DISMISSED</b> for having been filed out of time. Accordingly, Commission on Audit Corporate Government Sector-6 Decision No. 2014-002 dated March 13, 2014, affirming Notice of Disallowance No. H.O. 12-005 (11) dated July 23, 2012, on the payment of longevity pay under the Magna Carta for Public Health Workers to the officers and employees of Philippine Health Insurance Corporation for the period January to September 2011 in the total amount of P5,575,294.70, is final and executory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br></blockquote>PhilHealth's motion for reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> was likewise denied in the November 9, 2015 Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>. It ruled that PhilHealth failed to show any valid reason to justify the delayed filing, and affirmed the ND No. H.O. 12-005 (11) dated July 23, 2012.<br><br>Aggrieved, PhilHealth filed the instant Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> with prayer for TRO and WPI before the Court raising the following issues:<br><blockquote>COA gravely abused its discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in failing to consider Philhealth's appeal and dismissing outright the same for being filed out of time despite the following arguments offered by Philhealth:<br><br>A. THE TERM "MONTH" IN THE SIX-MONTH REGLEMENTARY PERIOD TO FILE AN APPEAL, PURSUANT TO THE 2009 REVISED RULES OF PROCEDURE OF COA, SHOULD BE UNDERSTOOD TO MEAN THE 30-DAY MONTH.<br><br>B. PHILHEALTH PERSONNEL ARE "PUBLIC HEALTH WORKERS" WITHIN THE CONTEMPLATION OF SECTION 3 OF RA 7305 AS WELL AS SECTION 1 OF RULE III OF ITS RIRR.<br><br>C. PHILHEALTH PERSONNEL ARE NOT ENGAGED MERELY IN "PAYING" FOR THE UTILIZATION OF HEALTH SERVICES BY COVERED BENEFICIARIES, BUT ARE ENGAGED IN HEALTH AND HEALTH-RELATED WORK, AS CLEARLY SPELLED OUT IN THE PROVISIONS OF RA 7875, AS AMENDED.<br><br>D. PURSUANT TO HIS AUTHORITY UNDER RA 7305, FORMER HEALTH SECRETARY ALBERTO G. ROMUALDEZ, JR., CERTIFIED THAT PHILHEALTH OFFICIALS AND EMPLOYEES ARE PERFORMING HEALTH AND HEALTH-RELATED FUNCTIONS, AND, AS SUCH, ARE COVERED BY THE PROVISIONS OF THIS LAW.<br><br>E. UNTIL SET ASIDE BY THE COURT, THE RIRR OF RA 7305 IS ENTITLED TO THE PRESUMPTION OF LEGALITY. THIS IS A NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE OF THE WELL-ESTABLISHED PRACTICE OF ACCORDING THE FORCE AND EFFECT OF A LAW TO RULES AND REGULATIONS ISSUED BY THE AGENCY TASKED TO ENFORCE OR IMPLEMENT A LAW.<br><br>F. SECTION 1 (B) OF RULE III OF THE RIRR OF RA 7305 HAS NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY INTERPRETED BY THE COURT, AND, THUS, THE UNIFORM CONSTRUCTION PLACED THEREON BY THE DOH MUST BE ACCORDED WEIGHT AND CONSIDERATION.<br><br>G. THE PHILHEALTH BOARD UNANIMOUSLY CONFIRMED THE GRANT OF PUBLIC HEALTH WORKERS' BENEFITS, INCLUDING THE LONGEVITY PAY, TO PHILHEALTH OFFICIALS AND EMPLOYEES, UNDER ITS RESOLUTION 1584, S. 2012 OF 31 JANUARY 2012.<br><br>H. ARTICLE IV, SECTION 16 (N) OF RA 7875, AS AMENDED, EXPLICITLY BESTOWED PHILHEALTH WITH "FISCAL AUTONOMY" TO FIX THE COMPENSATION OF ITS PERSONNEL.<br><br>I. THE FISCAL AUTHORITY OF PHILHEALTH UNDER ARTICLE IV, SECTION 16 (N) OF RA 7875, AS AMENDED, HAD BEEN CONFIRMED TWICE BY FORMER PRESIDENT GLORIA M. ARROYO.<br><br>J. THE GRANT OF THE SUBJECT LONGEVITY PAY TO PHILHEALTH PERSONNEL MAY BE CONSIDERED A MINISTERIAL DUTY OR FUNCTION OF THE PHILHEALTH BOARD.<br><br>K. RA 7875, AS AMENDED, AND RA 7305 PREVAIL OVER RA 10147, THE FIRST TWO LAWS BEING SPECIAL LAWS, WHILE THE LATTER IS A GENERAL LAW.<br><br>J. PHILHEALTH OFFICIALS AND EMPLOYEES RECEIVED THE SUBJECT LONGEVITY PAY IN GOOD FAITH AND, THEREFORE, EVEN IF THE DISALLOWANCE IS SUSTAINED, THEY CANNOT BE REQUIRED TO REFUND THE DISALLOWED AMOUNT.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br></blockquote>Substantially the issues for Our resolution are as follows:<br><br>1. Whether COA gravely abused its discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in dismissing outright the PhilHealth's appeal.<br><br>2. Whether PhilHealth personnel are considered public health workers within the contemplation of Section 3 of RA No. 7305, as well as Section 1 of Rule III of its Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR).<br><br>3. Whether PhilHealth employees received the longevity pay in good faith and even if the disallowance is sustained, they cannot be required to refund the same.<br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b><br></center><b><i><br>The petition fails.</i></b><br><br><i>Procedural Aspect -</i><br><br><i>The COA did not commit grave abuse of discretion</i><br><br>An aggrieved party can assail the Decision of the COA through a petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 64, as ruled in the case of <i>Maritime Industry Authority vs. Commission on Audit</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><blockquote>A petition under Rule 64 may prosper only after a finding that the administrative agency committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. Not all errors of the Commission on Audit is reviewable by this court. Thus, a Rule 65 petition is a unique and special rule because it commands limited review of the question raised. As an <i>extraordinary remedy</i>, its purpose is simply to keep the public respondent within the bounds of its jurisdiction or to relieve the petitioner from the public respondent's arbitrary acts. In this review, the Court is confined <i>solely</i> to questions of jurisdiction whenever a tribunal, board or officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial function acts without jurisdiction or in excess of jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.<br><br>The limitation of the Court's power of review over COA rulings merely complements its nature as an <b><i>independent constitutional body</i></b> that is tasked to safeguard the proper use of the government and, ultimately, the people's property by vesting it with power to (i) determine whether the government entities comply with the law and the rules in disbursing public funds; and (ii) disallow legal disbursements of these funds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>This Court has consistently held that findings of administrative agencies are generally accorded not only respect but also finality, unless found to have been tainted with grave abuse of discretion. The same was aptly discussed in the case of <i>Maritime</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> citing <i>City of General Santos v. Commission on Audit</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>, to wit:<br><blockquote>It is the general policy of the Court to sustain the decisions of administrative authorities, especially one which is constitutionally-created not only on the basis of the doctrine of separation of powers but also for their presumed expertise in the laws that they are entrusted to enforce. Findings of administrative agencies are accorded not only respect but also finality when the decision and order are not tainted with unfairness or arbitrariness that would amount to grave abuse of discretion. It is only when the COA has acted without or in excess of jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, that this Court entertains a petition questioning its rulings. There is grave abuse of discretion when there is an evasion of a positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law or to act in contemplation of law as when the judgment rendered is not based on law and evidence but on caprice, whim and despotism.<br></blockquote>PhilHealth failed to point out the specific acts of COA which may constitute grave abuse of discretion in disallowing the grants of longevity pay.<br><br><i>PhilHealth failed to appeal within the reglementary period</i><br><br>The burden of proving the validity or legality of the grant of allowance or benefit is with the government agency or entity granting the allowance or benefit, or the employee claiming the same. After the Resident Auditor issues a notice of disallowance, the aggrieved party may appeal the disallowance to the Director within six (6) months from receipt of the decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>From the decision of the Director, any aggrieved party may appeal the same within the time remaining of the six (6) months period under Section 4 Rule V<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>, taking into account the suspension of the running thereof under Section 5<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> of the same Rule in case of appeals from the Director's decision. At this point, the government agency or employee has the chance to prove the validity of the grant of allowance or benefit. If the appeal is denied, a petition for review or a notice of appeal may be filed before the Commission on Audit Commission Proper (CACP) within the time remaining of the six (6) months period.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Finally, the aggrieved party may file a petition for certiorari before this court to assail the decision of the CACP.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Based on the records, PhilHealth received the ND No. H.O. 12-005 (11) on July 30, 2012, and after 179 days from receipt thereof or on January 25, 2013, PhilHealth filed its appeal memorandum before the COA Corporate Government Sector. The COA Corporate Government Sector upheld the ND No. H.O. 12-005 (11) and the same was received by PhilHealth on March 25, 2014. Hence, by that time, it only had a period of one (1) day, or until March 26, 2014, to file its petition for review before the CACP.<br><br>However, on March 31, 2014, after the lapse of five (5) days from March 26, 2014, PhilHealth filed a motion for extension of time of thirty (30) days, from March 30, 2014 to April 30, 2014 to file its petition for review.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Thereafter, on April 30, 2014 or after the lapse of 215 days after the Resident Auditor issued the ND, PhilHealth filed its petition before the CACP.<br><br>It is clear that PhilHealth filed its petition beyond the reglementary period to file an appeal which is within six (6) months or 180 days after the Resident Auditor issued a ND. Thus, the Decision No. 2014-002 dated March 13, 2014 of COA Corporate Government Sector which upheld the ND No. H.O. 12-005 (11) dated July 23, 2012 became final and executory pursuant to Section 51<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> of the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Based on the foregoing, it is clear that this petition is procedurally dismissible.<br><br>Nevertheless, even if We consider PhilHealth's contention based on the substantive issues, the dismissal of the petition remains.<br><br><i>Substantive Aspect -</i><br><br><i>PhilHealth personnel are not public health workers</i><br><br>The question then arises whether the PhilHealth personnel are performing functions which are health or health-related to include them within the coverage of RA No. 7305 and consider them as health workers.<br><br>In the case of <i>Kapisanan Ng Mga Manggagawa Sa Government Service Insurance System (KMG) v.

These functions are not similar to those of persons rendering health or health-related services, or those employees working in health-related establishments, as discussed above. Undoubtedly, the PhilHealth personnel cannot be considered public health workers under RA No. 7305.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>It is Our firm view that PhilHealth functions are not commensurate to the services rendered by those workers who actually and directly provide health care services. PhilHealth's objective as the National Health Insurance Program provider, is to help the people <b><i>pay</i></b> for health care services<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>; unlike workers or employees of the government and private hospitals, clinics, health centers and units, medical service institutions, clinical laboratories, treatment and rehabilitation centers, health-related establishments of government corporations, and the specific health service section, division, bureau or unit of a government agency, who are actually engaged in health work services.<br><br>It will also be absurd if the same benefits and treatment will be given to the PhilHealth personnel and to those employees who actually rendered health services. Health workers or employees are not similarly situated with the PhilHealth employees. Health workers have sets of skills, training, medical background, work quality and ethical considerations to patients, and risks in transmission, occupational and hazard exposures, diseases etc., in the performance of their functions, while in PhilHealth, as National Health Insurance Program provider, its policy is only to help the people subsidize; or <b><i>pay</i></b>, or finance for the health care services.<br><br>More so, if the policy of the State is to include PhilHealth personnel as health workers, the same treatment should be given to Social Security System (SSS)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup>, Government Service Insurance System (GSIS)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup>, the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>, and other institutions or agencies, who provide funds for health care services, health programs, medical assistance, against the hazards of disability, sickness, maternity, old age, death and other contingencies resulting in loss of income or financial burden, or funds for life insurance, retirement, disability and survivorship benefits.<br><br>But this Court once interpreted and ruled that the Social Insurance Group (SIG) personnel of the GSIS, who acted as administrator of funds for the pension and retirement of government employees, were obviously not a health or health-related establishment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>We also said that the SIG personnel who perform tasks for the processing of GSIS members' claims for life insurance, retirement, disability and survivorship benefits are not similar to those persons working in health-­related establishments such as clinics or medical departments of government corporations, medical corps and hospitals of the AFP, and the specific health service units of government agencies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Hence, they are not public health workers under RA No. 7305.<br><br>Thus, We maintain that PhilHealth personnel were not engaged in the delivery of health or health-related services, and therefore, not public health workers. The same conclusion is reached in the case of <i>Kapisanan</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup>, when the principle of <i>ejusdem generis</i> is used to ascertain the meaning of the term "public health worker" under R.A. No. 7305 and its Implementing Rules, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>Under the principle of <i>ejusdem generis</i>, where a statute describes things of a particular class or kind accompanied by words of a generic character, the generic word will usually be limited to things of a similar nature with those particularly enumerated, unless there be something in the context of the state which would repel such inference.<br><br>Applying the principle of <i>ejusdem generis</i>, the inescapable conclusion is that a mere incidental or slight connection between the employee's work and the delivery of health or health-related services is not sufficient to make a government employee a public health worker within the meaning of R.A. 7305. The employee must be principally engaged in the delivery of health or health-related services to be deemed a public health worker.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br></blockquote>Furthermore, the certification issued by the DOH Secretary Alberto G. Romualdez, which declared PhilHealth officers and employees as public health workers is not authoritative.<br><br>Although PhilHealth is an attached agency to the DOH, and the latter principally determines who are entitled to the benefits under RA No. 7305, its authority must be in accordance with the standards set forth in the law and the IRR. Moreover, other government agencies such as the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) and the COA, in the performance of their respective functions, are not precluded from reviewing the DOH's determinations. This Court aptly discussed the same in the case of <i>Kapisanan</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> (<i>penned by Justice Tinga</i>), to wit:<br><blockquote>There is likewise no merit in the KMGs contention that the COA gravely abused its discretion in disallowing the grant of hazard pay to the SIG personnel because it is the DOH which is mandated by law to make the determination as to who are entitled to the benefits under RA No. 7305.<br><br>The DOH is the unit of the executive branch of government tasked to administer all laws, rules and regulations in the field of health. In addition, it is the DOH which is specifically tasked under Section 35 of RA No. 7305 to consult the appropriate government agencies and professional and health workers organizations or unions, and thereafter, to formulate and prepare the implementing rules and regulations of RA No. 7305.<br><br><u>Although it is the DOH which principally determines who are specifically entitled to benefits under RA No. 7305, its authority to make such determination must be in accordance with the definition of terms and standards set in the law and its Implementing Rules. Moreover, there is nothing in the law which precludes review of the DOHs determinations by other government agencies such as the DBM and the COA in the performance of their respective functions. In fact, in accordance with Section 35 of RA 7305, the Secretary of Health collaborated with other government agencies and health workers organizations in drafting the Implementing Rules which lay down, among others, the guidelines and procedure for the grant of hazard pay to public health workers. Also, mindful of the objectives of RA No. 7305, the DBM had earlier requested for a moratorium on the DOHs approval of requests made by agencies for certifications that their personnel are covered by RA No. 7305 due to serious lapses in the issuance of such certifications.</u> (Emphasis supplied)<br><br>The DBM is mandated by law to assist the Chief Executive in the preparation, <i>execution and control of the national budget</i>. (Emphasis supplied) <u>It was therefore merely performing its duty to enforce and control the use of government funds when it evaluated the grant of hazard pay to the SIG personnel and discovered that such grant was not justified under RA No. 7305.</u> (Emphasis ours)<br></blockquote>The COA, on the other hand, is vested by the Constitution with the power and duty to examine, audit and settle all accounts pertaining to the revenue and receipts of, and expenditures or uses of funds or property owned or held in trust by, or pertaining to government owned and controlled corporations with original charters such as the GSIS, on a post­-audit basis.It is mandated to determine whether government entities comply with laws and regulations in disbursing government funds, and to disallow illegal or irregular disbursements of government funds.<br><br>Thus, the COA acted pursuant to its duty and within the bounds of its jurisdiction in reviewing the grant of hazard pay to the SIG personnel under RA No. 7305 and subsequently disallowing the same for being violative of the provisions thereof.<br><br>Considering all the foregoing and under any reasonable yardstick, no grave abuse of discretion can be ascribed to the COA in disallowing the grant of hazard pay benefits to the SIG personnel. Clearly, under RA No. 7305 the SIG personnel are not public health workers. Clearly also under the same law, they are not entitled to hazard pay in any case.<br><br><u>Furthermore, the <i>KMG</i> cannot invoke the previous determinations by the DOH that the SIG personnel are considered public health workers under RA No. 7305 to justify their entitlement to hazard pay under that law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup></u> (Emphasis Ours)<br><br>Hence, PhilHealth cannot rely on the previous determination of the DOH Secretary that PhilHealth officials and employees are performing health and/or health-related functions, and thus, considered public health workers. The said interpretation or certification is not binding against the COA.<br><br>In the case of <i>Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System v. Commission on Audit</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup>, the Court held that:<br><blockquote>The COA as a constitutional office is endowed with enough latitude to determine, prevent and disallow irregular, unnecessary, excessive, extravagant, or unconscionable expenditures of government funds. It has the power to ascertain whether public funds were utilized for the purpose for which they had been intended. The 1987 Constitution has expressly made COA the guardian of public funds, vesting it with broad powers over all accounts pertaining to government revenue and expenditures and the uses of public funds and property, including the exclusive authority to define the scope of its audit and examination, establish the techniques and methods for such review, and promulgate accounting and auditing rules and regulations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br></blockquote><i>Refund of the amounts received</i><br><br>With regard to the disallowance of salaries, emoluments, benefits, and allowances of government employees, prevailing jurisprudence provides that recipients or payees need not refund these disallowed amounts when they received these in good faith. Government officials and employees who received benefits or allowances, which were disallowed, may keep the amounts received if there is no finding of bad faith and the disbursement was made in good faith. On the other hand, officers who participated in the approval of the disallowed allowances or benefits were required to refund only the amounts received when they were found to be in bad faith or grossly negligent amounting to bad faith.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>In <i>Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA) v. Commission on Audit and Reynaldo A. Villar</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup>, this Court defined good faith relative to the requirement of refund of disallowed benefits or allowances.<br><blockquote>In common usage, the term "good faith" is ordinarily used to describe that state of mind denoting "honesty of intention, and <b>freedom from knowledge of circumstances which ought to put the holder upon inquiry</b>; an honest intention to abstain from taking any unconscientious advantage of another, even through technicalities of law, together <b>with absence of all information, notice, or benefit or belief of facts which render transaction unconscientious</b>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>The Court however, finds that the COA failed to show bad faith on the part of the approving officers in disbursing the disallowed longevity pay. Further, the PhilHealth officers and other employees were presumed to have acted in good faith when they allowed and/or received the longevity pay, in the honest belief that there was legal basis for such grant. The PhilHealth personnel in turn accepted the longevity pay benefits believing that they were entitled to such benefit.<br><br>Even though We find that the PhilHealth personnel who received the longevity pay acted in good faith under the honest belief that there was legal basis for such payment, the return of the received longevity pay in the ND No. H.O. 12-005 (11) dated July 23, 2012 is in Order. We reiterate that the ND No. H.O. 12-005 (11) dated July 23, 2012 already attained its finality for failure of PhilHealth to file an appeal within the reglementary period, which is six (6) months or 180 days after the Resident Auditor issued the disallowance. We can no longer reverse, much less modify the same without disregarding the doctrine of immutability of judgment.<br><br>While We are not insensitive to PhilHealth's suffering in view of the refund of the longevity benefits received by them, We are bound by laws and judicial precedents that must be applied to the present case. We discussed the rule on immutability of judgment in <i>Antonio Navarro v. Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> and said:<br><blockquote>No other procedural law principle is indeed more settled than that once a judgment becomes final, it is no longer subject to change, revision, amendment or reversal, except only for correction of clerical errors, or the making of <i>nunc pro tunc</i> entries which cause no prejudice to any party, or where the judgment itself is void. The underlying reason for the rule is two-fold: (1) to avoid delay in the administration of justice and thus make orderly the discharge of judicial business, and (2) to put judicial controversies to an end, at the risk of occasional errors, inasmuch as controversies cannot be allowed to drag on indefinitely and the rights and obligations of every litigant must not hang in suspense for an indefinite period of time. As the Court declared in <i>Yau v. Silverio</i>,<br><blockquote>Litigation must end and terminate sometime and somewhere, and it is essential to an effective and efficient administration of justice that, once a judgment has become final, the winning party be, not through a mere subterfuge, deprived of the fruits of the verdict. Courts must therefore guard against any scheme calculated to bring about that result. Constituted as they are to put an end to controversies, courts should frown upon any attempt to prolong them.<br></blockquote>Indeed, just as a losing party has the right to file an appeal within the prescribed period, the winning party also has the correlative right to enjoy the finality of the resolution of his case by the execution and satisfaction of the judgment. Any attempt to thwart this rigid rule and deny the prevailing litigant his right to savor the fruit of his victory must immediately be struck down. Thus, in <i>Heirs of Wenceslao Samper v. Reciproco-Noble</i>, we had occasion to emphasize the significance of this rule, to wit:<br><blockquote>It is an important fundamental principle in our Judicial system that every litigation must come to an end x x x Access to the courts is guaranteed. But there must be a limit thereto. Once a litigant's rights have been adjudicated in a valid final judgment of a competent court, he should not be granted an unbridled license to come back for another try. The prevailing party should not be harassed by subsequent suits. For, if endless litigations were to be encouraged, then unscrupulous litigants will multiply in number to the detriment of the administration ofjustice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br></blockquote></blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the instant petltwn is <b>DISMISSED</b>.

When the laws speak of years, months, days or nights, it shall be understood that years are of three hundred sixty-five days each; <b>months, of thirty days</b>; days, of twenty-four hours; and nights from sunset to sunrise.<br><br><b>If months are designated by their name, they shall be computed by the number of days which they respectively have.</b><br><br>In computing a period, the first day shall be excluded, and the last day included. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Section 31, Chapter VIII, Book I of the Administrative Code of 1987, in turn, states:<br><blockquote>SECTION 31. <i>Legal Periods</i>. - "Year" shall be understood to be twelve calendar months; <b>"month" of thirty days, unless it refers to a specific calendar month in which case it shall be computed according to the number of days the specific month contains</b>; "day" to a day of twenty-four hours; and "night" from sunset to sunrise. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>In <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Primetown Property Group, Inc.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> the Court found that there exists a manifest incompatibility in the manner of computing legal periods under the Civil Code and the Administrative Code of 1987, specifically as regards the computation of a <i>year</i>, thus, Section 31, Chapter VIII, Book I of the Administrative Code of 1987, being the more recent law, governs the computation of legal periods. <i>Lex posteriori derogat priori</i>.<br><br>The COA Revised Rules of Procedure does not explicitly provide the manner on how the period in contest shall be computed. Hence, applying Section 31, Chapter VIII, Book I of the Administrative Code of 1987, which now governs the computation of legal periods, the six (6) months period constitutes 180 days. Further, this Court in <i>Torres v. Commission on Audit</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> stated as follows: "<b><i>the 6-month or 180-day reglementary period</i></b> shall be reckoned from the petitioners' date of receipt of the Auditor's Notice of Disallowance on November 6, 2009."<br><br>With the foregoing, it is clear that the Petition for Review of PhilHealth before the COA Commission Proper was filed out of time. However, the Court, even as it has at times acknowledged that procedural rules should be treated with utmost respect and due regard, has likewise, from time to time, recognized exceptions based on the most compelling reasons where stubborn obedience to it would defeat rather than serve the ends of justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Indeed, where strong considerations of substantive justice are manifest in the petition, the Court is called upon to relax the strict application of the rules of procedure in the exercise of its legal jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Thus, despite the Petition for Review having been filed out of time, the Court should entertain it to finally put to rest the question of whether PhilHealth personnel are public health workers and whether they are entitled to the benefits granted to public health workers.<br><br><b><i>PhilHealth personnel are public health workers.</i></b><br><br>Section 3 of RA 7305 defines the term health workers as follows:<br><blockquote>x x x "health workers" shall mean all persons who are engaged in <b>health and health-related work</b>, and all persons employed in all hospitals, sanitaria, health infirmaries, health centers, rural health units, barangay health stations, clinics and other health-related establishments owned and operated by the Government or its political subdivisions with original charters and shall include medical, allied health professional, administrative and support personnel employed regardless of their employment status. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Rule III of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA 7305 further define public health workers as follows:<br><blockquote><ol><li>Public Health Workers (PWH) - Persons engaged in health and health-related works. These cover employees in any of the following:<br><ol type="a"><br><li>Any government entity whose primary function according to its legal mandate is the delivery of health services and the operation of hospitals, sanitaria, health infirmaries, health centers, rural health units, barangay health stations, clinics or other institutional forms which similarly perform health delivery functions, like clinical laboratories, treatment and rehabilitation centers, x-ray facilities and other similar activities involving the rendering of health services to the public; and<br><br></li><li><b>Offices attached to agencies whose primary function according to their legal mandates involves provision, financing or regulation of health services.</b><br></li></ol><br>Also covered are medical and allied health professionals, as well as administrative and support personnel, regardless of their employment status. (Emphasis supplied)<br></li></ol></blockquote>PhilHealth's mandate includes not only providing health insurance coverage, but also ensuring affordable, acceptable, available and accessible health care services for all citizens of the Philippines.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Moreover, the enumerated powers and functions of PhilHealth include the accreditation of health care providers, inspection of health care institutions, setting of standards and rules to ensure quality of health care and appropriate utilization of health services, contracting with health provider organizations for the provision of personal health services, enrollment of members and dependents, establishment of an efficient premium payment collection mechanism, registration of all government and private employers, administration of health benefit package and improvement of the system for its availment, performance monitoring of health care providers and supervision of health benefits, among others.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Further, Section 14, Article IV of RA 7875, as amended, provides that <b>PhilHealth is attached to the DOH</b> for coordination and guidance.<br><blockquote>SEC. 14. <i>Creation and Nature of the Corporation</i> - There is hereby created a Philippine Health Insurance Corporation, which shall have the status of a tax-exempt government corporation attached to the Department of Health for policy coordination and guidance.<br></blockquote>With the foregoing, the more reasonable interpretation is that PhilHealth personnel are engaged in health and health-related work and that they specifically fall under the definition provided in Rule III, 1(b) of the IRR of RA 7305 which pertains to those offices attached to agencies whose primary function according to their legal mandates involves provision, financing or regulation of health services.<br><br>Moreover, in <i>Philippine Health Insurance Corporation v.

The statement of the Court, quoted below, leads to the conclusion that the Court has acquiesced that PhilHealth personnel are public health workers. In fact, the issue decided by the Court was not so much on the propriety of the subsistence and laundry allowances in the form of the WESA, but that the Secretary of Health prescribed the rates thereof not in accordance with RA 7305.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> This very statement is a recognition by the Court that there was no dispute that PhilHealth personnel were covered by RA 7305 and are therefore public health workers, to wit:<br><blockquote>In a similar manner, the Court finds that the PHIC's grant of the WESA was aptly sanctioned not only by Section 12<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> of the [Salary Standardization Law] but also by statutory authority. PHIC Board Resolution No. 385, S. 2001 states that the WESA of P4,000.00 each shall be paid to public health workers under the <i>Magna Carta</i> of PHWs in lieu of the subsistence and laundry allowances. Respondent COA contested the same not so much on the propriety of the subsistence and laundry allowances in the form of the WESA, but that the Secretary of Health prescribed the rates thereof not in accordance with the <i>Magna Carta</i> of PHWs. x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br></blockquote>On the issue of whether PhilHealth officers and employees were in good faith when they allowed and/or received the longevity pay, I rule in the affirmative.
