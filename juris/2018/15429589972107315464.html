Meanwhile, aside from the abovementioned handwritten letter dated November 6, 2014, the respondent failed to file any pleadings, or to participate in the proceedings before the IBP-CBD. </p><p align="center"> <b>Report and Recommendation of the CBD</b> </p><p> In his Report and Recommendation<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> (<em>Report</em>) dated May 29, 2015, Commissioner Villamor found respondent to have violated the Lawyer's Oath and the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR), particularly Canon 16,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Rule 16.01,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> and thus, recommended that he be suspended from the practice of law for a period of one (1) year and that he should return all documents and money in his possession over and above his lawful and reasonable attorney's fee with a warning that a repetition of the same or similar offense shall be dealt with more severely.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> </p><p> In his <i>Report</i>, Commissioner Villamor considered the amount of P50,000.00 as reasonable attorney's fee for the time spent and the extent of the services rendered by respondent during the arraignment of the complainant's case, but respondent was to return the remaining amount of P150,000.00 to the complainant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> </p><p> Moreover, Commissioner Villamor found that the respondent abandoned the complainant, and his withdrawal as counsel was without good cause.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> He also noted that respondent failed, despite demand, to return the documents to the complainant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> </p><p align="center"> <b>Resolution of the Board of Governors of the IBP</b> </p><p> On June 20, 2015, the IBP Board of Governors issued Resolution No. XXI-2015-581,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> adopting and approving the above <em>Report</em>, but modified the same by ordering respondent to return the entire amount of Two Hundred Thousand Pesos (P200,000.00) to the complainant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> </p><p align="center"> <b>Court's Ruling</b> </p><p> As found by Commissioner Villamor, the respondent allegedly failed to return, despite demand, the complainant's documents after he withdrew as his counsel<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> in violation of Canon 16, Rule 16.01 which provides that a lawyer shall account for and hold in trust the money or property from the client. Moreover, despite respondent's legal services having been allegedly paid in the amount of Two Hundred Thousand Pesos (P200,000.00), which, as allegedly agreed upon, was to cover the acceptance fee, appearance fees, and other fees until the resolution of the cases, he allegedly abandoned his client when the latter was not able to give him the "pocket money" he had demanded. This is a serious charge which the respondent should have addressed and answered, as well as the other allegations, during the IBP proceedings. However, after requesting for a copy of the Affidavit Complaint in order to be able to prepare his Answer, respondent failed to participate in the IBP proceedings.</p><p> While we adopt the findings of Commissioner Villamor, we note that this is respondent's first offense, and we shall also take into consideration his advanced age (<em>i.e</em>., he stated that he was already 82 years old in his abovementioned handwritten letter dated November 6, 2014 addressed to Director Solis). We note that, in several cases,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> the Court, in determining or tempering the penalty to be imposed, has considered mitigating factors, such as the respondent's advanced age, health, humanitarian and equitable considerations, as well as whether the act complained of was respondent's first infraction. In the present case, in view of the respondent's advanced age and the fact that this is his first offense, respondent is hereby suspended from the practice of law for six (6) months and warned that a repetition of the same or similar acts shall be dealt with more severely. Respondent should also return the legal fees paid to him by the complainant in the amount of Two Hundred Thousand Pesos (P200,000.00), and the documents in respondent's possession which pertain to the case of the complainant. </p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, respondent Atty. Ramon Y. Gargantos, Sr., is hereby <b>SUSPENDED</b> from the practice of law for six (6) months effective immediately upon receipt of this Decision and warned that a repetition of the same or similar acts will be dealt with more severely. Respondent Atty. Gargantos, Sr. is ordered to <b>RETURN</b> to complainant Pelagio Vicencio Sorongon, Jr. the amount of Two Hundred Thousand Pesos (P200,000.00) within ninety (90) days from the receipt of this Decision, including the documents in respondent's possession which pertain to the case of the complainant. Failure to comply with the foregoing directive will warrant the imposition of a more severe penalty.</p><p> Let copies of this Decision be furnished the Office of the Bar Confidant, to be appended to respondent's personal record as attorney. Further, let copies of this Decision be furnished the Integrated Bar of the Philippines and the Office of the Court Administrator, which is directed to circulate them to all courts in the country for their information and guidance. </p><p><strong> SO ORDERED.</strong> </p><p> <em>Carpio (Chairperson), Peralta, Perlas-Bernabe</em>, and <em>A.
