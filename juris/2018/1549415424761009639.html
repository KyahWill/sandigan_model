TPC was not a party to this transaction; (<em>iv</em>) as to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Addendum's partial disbursement amounting to P5,000,000.00, ASPAI acknowledged the receipt of P4,900,000.00 of the loan proceeds, while TPC returned the balance of P100,000.00 to PITC; (<em>v</em>) ASPAI liquidated costs in relation fertilizer purchases and submitted receipts thereon to PITC; (<em>vi</em>) upon dishonor of its post-dated checks, PITC sent demand letters to ASPAI, not to TPC; (<em>vii</em>) due to the checks' dishonor, PITC filed criminal complaints for estafa and violation of Batas Pambansa Blg. 22 against ASPAI's officers; (<em>viii</em>) the IFA conditioned the release of loan proceeds upon, among others, TPC's submission of Noah's Ark Sugar Holdings (Noah's Ark)'s written conforme endorsing the assignment of ASPAI's quedans to PITC. However, PITC proceeded to make partial disbursements of the loan despite TPC's failure to submit Noah's Ark's endorsement; and (<em>ix</em>) the parties executed the IFA to facilitate the<em> importation</em> of urea fertilizer. However, pursuant to the two addendums, instead of importing fertilizers, ASPAI purchased them directly from local suppliers.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> </p><p> From these circumstances, the Court of Appeals concluded that TPC and Cuales were mere agents of ASPAI and should not be held liable for their principal's default in the loan payments.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> </p><p> PITC subsequent motion for reconsideration was denied; hence, the present petition.</p><p align="center"> <b><i>The Issues</i></b> </p><p> Petitioner PITC comes before the Court raising the following issues: </p><blockquote> <p align="center"> A. </p> <p>WHETHER OR NOT THE TRANSACTION WAS INDEED BETWEEN PITC AND TPC. </p> <p align="center">B. </p> <p>WHETHER OR NOT THE IMPORT FINANCING AGREEMENT THE PARTIES EXECUTED ON 5 JULY 1993 AND ITS ADDENDA ARE SIMULATED. </p> <p align="center">C.</p> <p> WHETHER OR NOT PITC IS ENTITLED TO ATTORNEY'S FEES.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Petitioner PITC mainly argues that "[i]f the terms of a contract are clear and leave no doubt upon the intention of the parties, the literal meaning of its stipulations shall control."
