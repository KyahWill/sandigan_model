When Tabulog replied that she could no longer remember such transaction, she was also cited in contempt and ordered detained.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></p><p> On the other hand, respondents aver that petitioners were evasive in answering questions and simply claimed not to remember the specifics of the subject transactions. According to respondents, petitioners requested to be confronted with the original documents to refresh their memories when they knew beforehand that the Commission on Audit (COA) to which the original vouchers were submitted could no longer find the same.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></p><p> <b><i>Proceedings before the CA</i></b></p><p> The next day, or on May 30, 2017, petitioners filed a Petition for <i>Habeas Corpus</i> against respondent House Sergeant-at-Arms Lieutenant General Detabali (Detabali) before the CA.

On June 9, 2017, the CA issued a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> denying Detabali's motion to dissolve the writ of <i>Habeas Corpus</i> and granting petitioners' Motion for Provisional Release upon posting of a bond. Accordingly, the CA issued an Order of Release Upon Bond.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Attempts to serve said Resolution and Order of Release Upon Bond to Detabali were made but to no avail.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></p><p> On June 20, 2017, the House of Representatives called a special session for the continuation of the legislative inquiry.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Thereat, a <i>subpoena ad testificandum</i> was issued to compel co-petitioner Marcos to appear at the scheduled July 25, 2017 hearing.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> </p><table width="40%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><b><i>The tension between the House of Representatives and the CA</i></b></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>During the June 20, 2017 hearing, House Committee unanimously voted to issue a Show Cause Order against the three Justices of the CA's Special Fourth Division,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> directing them to explain why they should not be cited in contempt by the House of Representatives.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> The House of Representatives was apparently dismayed over the CA's actions in the <i>Habeas Corpus</i> Petition, with House Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez quoted as calling the involved CA Justices "<i>mga gago</i>" and threatening to dissolve the CA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Disturbed by this turn of events, the involved CA Justices wrote a letter dated July 3, 2017 addressed to the Court <i>En Banc</i> deferring action on certain pending motions<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> and administratively referring the same to the Court for advice and/or appropriate action. </p><p> Meanwhile, in the <i>Habeas Corpus</i> Petition, Detabali moved for the inhibition of CA Justices Stephen Cruz and Nina Antonio-Valenzuela while CA Justice Edwin Sorongon voluntarily inhibited himself.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> </p><table width="40%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><b><i>Subsequent Release of Petitioners and Dismissal of the Habeas Corpus Petition by the CA</i></b> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>On July 13, 2017 and while the <i>Habeas Corpus</i> Petition was still pending before the CA, petitioners and co-petitioner Marcos filed the instant Omnibus Petition. </p><p> During the congressional hearing on July 25, 2017 which petitioners and co-petitioner Marcos attended, and while the present Omnibus Petition is pending final resolution by the Court, respondent House Committee lifted the contempt order and ordered the release of petitioners.

Respondents also argue that the Omnibus Petition is dismissible on the grounds of misjoinder of action and for failure to implead indispensable parties, <i>i.e.</i>, the CA in the petition to assume jurisdiction over the <i>Habeas Corpus</i> Petition and the Congress in the prohibition and <i>Amparo</i> petitions. Respondents also argue that petitioners committed forum shopping when they filed the present Omnibus Petition at a time when a motion for reconsideration before the CA was still pending resolution. </p><table width="40%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><b><i>For the issuance of a Writ of Prohibition</i></b> </td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>Co-petitioner Marcos assails the nature of the legislative inquiry as a fishing expedition in violation of petitioners' right to due process and is allegedly discriminatory to the Province of Ilocos Norte. </p><p> Respondents counter that a petition for prohibition is not the proper remedy to enjoin legislative actions. House Committee is not a tribunal, corporation, board or person exercising judicial or ministerial function but a separate and independent branch of government.

Further, respondents argue that the issuance of a writ of <i>Amparo</i> is limited only to cases of extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances which are not extant in the instant case. </p><p align="center"> <b>The Issues</b> </p><p> Encapsulated, the issues for resolution are: </p><p> 1. Whether or not the instant Omnibus Petition which seeks the release of petitioners from detention was rendered moot by their subsequent release from detention? </p><p> 2. Whether or not the Court can assume jurisdiction over the <i>Habeas Corpus</i> Petition then pending before the CA? </p><p> 3. Whether or not the subject legislative inquiry on House Resolution No. 882 may be enjoined by a writ of prohibition? </p><p> 4. Whether or not the instant Omnibus Petition sufficiently states a cause of action for the issuance of a writ of <i>Amparo</i>?<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup></p><p align="center"> <b>Ruling of the Court</b> </p><p> <i>We dismiss the Omnibus Petition.</i></p><p align="center"> <b>I. <br> The Petition to Assume Jurisdiction<br> over <em>Habeas Corpus</em> Petition</b> </p><table width="40%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><b><i>The release of persons in whose behalf the application for a Writ of Habeas Corpus was filed renders the petition for the issuance thereof moot and academic</i></b> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>The writ of <i>Habeas Corpus</i> or the "great writ of liberty"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> was devised as a "speedy and effectual remedy to relieve persons from unlawful restraint, and as the best and only sufficient defense of personal freedom."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> The primary purpose of the writ "is to inquire into all manner of involuntary restraint as distinguished from voluntary, and to relieve a person therefrom if such restraint is illegal."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> Under the Constitution, the privilege of the writ of <i>Habeas Corpus</i> cannot be suspended except in cases of invasion or rebellion when the public safety requires it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> </p><p> As to what kind of restraint against which the writ is effective, case law<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> deems any restraint which will preclude freedom of action as sufficient. Thus, as provided in the Rules of Court under Section 1, Rule 102 thereof, a writ of <i>Habeas Corpus</i> "shall extend to all cases of illegal confinement or detention by which any person is deprived of his liberty, or by which the rightful custody of any person is withheld from the person entitled thereto."</p><p> On the other hand, Section 4, Rule 102 spells the instances when the writ of <i>Habeas Corpus</i> is not allowed or when the discharge thereof is authorized: </p><blockquote> <p> Sec. 4. <i>When writ not allowed or discharge authorized</i>. – If it appears that the person alleged to be restrained of his liberty is in the custody of an officer under process issued by a court or judge or by virtue of a judgment or order of a court of record, and that the court or judge had jurisdiction to issue the process, render the judgment, or make the order, the writ shall not be allowed; or if the jurisdiction appears after the writ is allowed, the person shall not be discharged by reason of any informality or defect in the process, judgment, or order. Nor shall anything in this rule be held to authorize the discharge of a person charged with or convicted of an offense in the Philippines, or of a person suffering imprisonment under lawful judgment. </p> </blockquote> <p> Accordingly, a Writ of <em>Habeas Corpus</em> may no longer be issued if the person allegedly deprived of liberty is restrained under a lawful process or order of the court<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> because since then, the restraint has become legal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> In the illustrative case of <i>Ilagan v. Hon. Ponce Enrile</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> the Court dismissed the petition for <em>habeas corpus</em> on the ground of mootness considering the filing of an information before the court. The court pronounced that since the incarceration was now by virtue of a judicial order, the remedy of <em>habeas corpus</em> no longer lies. </p><p> Like so, in <i>Duque v. Capt. Vinarao</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> the Court held that a petition for <em>habeas corpus</em> can be dismissed upon voluntary withdrawal of the petitioner. Further, in <i>Pestaño v. Corvista</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> it was pronounced that where the subject person had already been released from the custody complained of, the petition for <em>habeas corpus</em> then still pending was considered already moot and academic and should be dismissed. This pronouncement was carried on in <i>Olaguer v. Military Commission No. 34</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> where the Court reiterated that the release of the persons in whose behalf the application for a writ of <em>habeas corpus</em> was filed is effected, the petition for the issuance of the writ becomes moot and academic.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> Thus, with the subsequent release of all the petitioners from detention, their petition for <em>habeas corpus</em> has been rendered moot. The rule is that courts of justice constituted to pass upon substantial rights will not consider questions where no actual interests are involved and thus, will not determine a moot question as the resolution thereof will be of no practical value.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> </p><p> Far compelling than the question of mootness is that the element of illegal deprivation of freedom of movement or illegal restraint is jurisdictional in petitions for <em>habeas corpus</em>. Consequently, in the absence of confinement and custody, the courts lack the power to act on the petition for <em>habeas corpus</em> and the issuance of a writ thereof must be refused. </p><p> Any lingering doubt as to the justiciability of the petition to assume jurisdiction over the <em>Habeas Corpus</em> Petition before the CA is ultimately precluded by the CA Resolution considering the petition closed and terminated. With the termination of the <em>Habeas Corpus</em> Petition before the CA, petitioners' plea that the same be transferred to this Court, or that the Court assume jurisdiction thereof must necessarily be denied. </p><table width="40%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><b><i>Nevertheless, the Court, in exceptional cases, decides moot questions </i></b></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p> Although as above-enunciated, the general rule is that mootness of the issue warrants a dismissal, the same admits of certain exceptions. </p><p> In <i>Prof. David v.

I even personally called up and sent a letter or a short note inviting him, but the good Minister unfortunately was enmeshed in a lot of official commitments. We wanted to hear him because the Solicitor General of his office, Sedfrey Ordofiez, appeared before us, and asked for the maintenance of the present arrangement wherein the supervision over lower courts is with the Supreme Court. But aside from that, although there were no resource persons, we did further studies on the feasibility of transferring the supervision over the lower courts to the Ministry of Justice.

However, a perusal of the minutes of legislative hearings so far conducted reveals that the same revolved around the use of the Province of Ilocos Norte's shares from the excise tax on locally manufactured virginia-type cigarettes through cash advances which co-petitioner Marcos herself admits<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup> to be the "usual practice" and was actually allowed by the Commission on Audit (COA).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup> In fact, the cause of petitioners' detention was not the perceived or gathered illegal use of such shares but the rather unusual inability of petitioners to recall the transactions despite the same having involved considerable sums of money.</p><p> Like so, co-petitioner Marcos' plea for the prevention of the legislative inquiry was anchored on her apprehension that she, too, will be arrested and detained by House Committee. However, such remains to be an apprehension which does not give cause for the issuance of the extraordinary remedy of prohibition. Consequently, co-petitioner Marcos' prayer for the ancillary remedy of a preliminary injunction cannot be granted, because her right thereto has not been proven to be clear and unmistakable.

In <i>Rev. Fr. Reyes v. Court of Appeals, et al</i>.,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[127]</sup> the Court had occasion to expound on the rights falling within the protective mantle of the writ of <em>Amparo</em>, thus: </p><blockquote> <p> The rights that fall within the protective mantle of the Writ of <em>Amparo</em> under Section 1 of the Rules thereon are the following: (1) right to life; (2) right to liberty; and (3) right to security.</p> <p> In <i>Secretary of National Defense et al. v. Manalo et al</i>., the Court explained the concept of <i>right to life</i> in this wise:</p> <blockquote> <p> While the right to life under Article III, Section 1 guarantees essentially the right to be alive- upon which the enjoyment of all other rights is preconditioned - the right to security of person is a guarantee of the secure quality of this life, <i>viz</i>: "The life to which each person has a right is not a life lived in fear that his person and property may be unreasonably violated by a powerful ruler. Rather, it is a life lived with the assurance that the government he established and consented to, will protect the security of his person and property. The ideal of security in life and property ... pervades the whole history of man. It touches every aspect of man's existence." In a broad sense, the right to security of person "emanates in a person's legal and uninterrupted enjoyment of his life, his limbs, his body, his health, and his reputation. It includes the right to exist, and the right to enjoyment of life while existing, and it is invaded not only by a deprivation of life but also of those things which are necessary to the enjoyment of life according to the nature, temperament, and lawful desires of the individual."</p> </blockquote> <p> The <i>right to liberty</i>, on the other hand, was defined in the <i>City of Manila, et al. v. Hon. Laguio, Jr</i>., in this manner:</p> <blockquote> <p> Liberty as guaranteed by the Constitution was defined by Justice Malcolm to include "the right to exist and the right to be free from arbitrary restraint or servitude. The term cannot be dwarfed into mere freedom from physical restraint of the person of the citizen, but is deemed to embrace the right of man to enjoy the facilities with which he has been endowed by his Creator, subject only to such restraint as are necessary for the common welfare." x x x </p> </blockquote> <p> <i>Secretary of National Defense et al. v. Manalo et al.</i>, thoroughly expounded on the import of the <i>right to security</i>, thus:</p> <blockquote> <p> A closer look at the right to security of person would yield various permutations of the exercise of this right. </p> <p> <b><i>First</i>, the right to security of person is "freedom from fear." </b>In its "whereas" clauses, the <b>Universal Declaration of Human Rights</b> (UDHR) enunciates that "a world in which human beings shall enjoy freedom of speech and belief and <b>freedom from fear</b> and want has been proclaimed as the highest aspiration of the common people." x x x Some scholars postulate that "freedom from fear" is not only an aspirational principle, but essentially an individual international human right. It is the "right to security of person" as the word "security" itself means "freedom from fear." Article 3 of the UDHR provides, viz: </p> <blockquote> <p> Everyone has the right to life, liberty and <b>security of person</b>. </p> <p> xxxx </p> </blockquote> <p> The Philippines is a signatory to both the UDHR and the ICCPR. </p> <p> In the context of Section 1 of the <i>Amparo</i> Rule, "freedom from fear" is the right and any <b>threat to the rights to life, liberty or security</b> is the <b>actionable wrong</b>. Fear is a state of mind, a reaction; <b>threat</b> is a stimulus, a <b>cause of action</b>. Fear caused by the same stimulus can range from being baseless to well-founded as people react differently. The degree of fear can vary from one person to another with the variation of the prolificacy of their imagination, strength of character or past experience with the stimulus. Thus, in the <em>Amparo</em> context, it is more correct to say that the "right to security" is actually the "<b>freedom from threat</b>." Viewed in this light, the "threatened with violation" Clause in the latter part of Section 1 of the <em>Amparo</em> Rule is a form of violation of the right to security mentioned in the earlier part of the provision.</p> <p><b><i>Second</i>, the right to security of person is a guarantee of bodily and psychological integrity or security.</b> Article III, Section II of the 1987 Constitution guarantees that, as a general rule, ones body cannot be searched or invaded without a search warrant. Physical injuries inflicted in the context of extralegal killings and enforced disappearances constitute more than a search or invasion of the body. It may constitute dismemberment, physical disabilities, and painful physical intrusion. As the degree of physical injury increases, the danger to life itself escalates. Notably, in criminal law, physical injuries constitute a crime against persons because they are an affront to the bodily integrity or security of a person. </p> <p> x x x x </p> <p> <b><i>Third</i>, the right to security of person is a guarantee of protection of ones rights by the government. </b>In the context of the writ of <em>Amparo</em>, this right is <b>built into the guarantees of the right to life and liberty</b> under Article III, Section 1 of the 1987 Constitution <b>and the right to security of person</b> (as freedom from threat and guarantee of bodily and psychological integrity) under Article III, Section 2. The right to security of person in this third sense is a corollary of the policy that the State guarantees full respect for human rights under Article II, Section 11 of the 1987 Constitution. As the government is the chief guarantor of order and security, the Constitutional guarantee of the rights to life, liberty and security of person is rendered ineffective if government does not afford protection to these rights especially when they are under threat. Protection includes conducting effective investigations, organization of the government apparatus to extend protection to victims of extralegal killings or enforced disappearances (or threats thereof) and/or their families, and bringing offenders to the bar of justice. x x x.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[128]</sup> (Citations omitted and emphasis and italics in the original)</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> Nevertheless, and by way of caution, the rule is that a writ of <em>Amparo</em> shall not issue on amorphous and uncertain grounds. Consequently, every petition for the issuance of a writ of <em>Amparo</em> should be supported by justifying allegations of fact, which the Court in <i>Tapuz</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[129]</sup> laid down as follows: </p><blockquote> <p> "(a) The personal circumstances of the petitioner; </p> <p> (b) The name and personal circumstances of the respondent responsible for the threat, act or omission, or, if the name is unknown or uncertain, the respondent may be described by an assumed appellation; </p> <p> <i>(c) The right to life, liberty and security of the aggrieved party violated or threatened with violation by an unlawful act or omission of the respondent, and how such threat or violation is committed with the attendant circumstances detailed in supporting affidavits;</i></p> <p> <i>(d) The investigation conducted, if any, specifying the names, personal circumstances, and addresses of the investigating authority or individuals, as well as the manner and conduct of the investigation, together with any report;</i></p> <p> (e) The actions and recourses taken by the petitioner to determine the fate or whereabouts of the aggrieved party and the identity of the person responsible for the threat, act or omission; and</p> <p> (f) The relief prayed for.</p> <p> The petition may include a general prayer for other just and equitable reliefs."</p> <p> The writ shall issue if the Court is preliminarily satisfied with the <i>prima facie </i>existence of the ultimate facts determinable from the supporting affidavits that detail the circumstances of how and to what extent a threat to or violation of the rights to life, liberty and security of the aggrieved party was or is being committed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[130]</sup> (Citations omitted and italics in the original)</p> </blockquote> <p> Even more telling is the rule that the writ of <em>Amparo</em> cannot be issued in cases where the alleged threat has ceased and is no longer imminent or continuing.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[131]</sup> </p><p> In this case, the alleged unlawful restraint on petitioners' liberty has effectively ceased upon their subsequent release from detention. On the other hand, the apprehension of co-petitioner Marcos that she will be detained is, at best, merely speculative. In other words, co-petitioner Marcos has failed to show any clear threat to her right to liberty actionable through a petition for a writ of <em>Amparo</em>. </p><p> In <i>Mayor William N. Mamba, et al. v. Leomar Bueno</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[132]</sup> the Court held that: </p><blockquote> <p> Neither did petitioners and co-petitioner successfully establish the existence of a threat to or violation of their right to security. In an <em>Amparo</em> action, the parties must establish their respective claims by substantial evidence. Substantial evidence is that amount of evidence which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. It is more than a mere imputation of wrongdoing or violation that would warrant a finding of liability against the person charged.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[133]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Here, it appears that petitioners and co-petitioner Marcos even attended and participated in the subsequent hearings on House Resolution No. 882 without any untoward incident. Petitioners and co-petitioner Marcos thus failed to establish that their attendance at and participation in the legislative inquiry as resource persons have seriously violated their right to liberty and security, for which no other legal recourse or remedy is available. Perforce, the petition for the issuance of a writ of <em>Amparo</em> must be dismissed. </p><p align="center"> <b>IV. <br> Congress' Power to Cite in Contempt<br> and to Compel Attendance of Court Justices</b> </p><p> It has not escaped the attention of the Court that the events surrounding the filing of the present Omnibus Petition bear the unsavory impression that a display of force between the CA and the Congress is impending. Truth be told, the letter of the CA Justices to the Court <i>En Banc</i> betrays the struggle these CA Justices encountered in view of the Congressional power to cite in contempt and consequently, to arrest and detain. These Congressional powers are indeed awesome. Yet, such could not be used to deprive the Court of its Constitutional duty to supervise judges of lower courts in the performance of their official duties. The fact remains that the CA Justices are non-impeachable officers. As such, authority over them primarily belongs to this Court and to no other.</p><p> To echo the Court's ruling in <i>Maceda v. Ombudsman Vasquez</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[134]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> [T]he Supreme Court [has] administrative supervision over all courts and court personnel, from the Presiding Justice of the Court of Appeals down to the lowest municipal trial court clerk. By virtue of this power, it is only the Supreme Court that can oversee the judges' and court personnel's compliance with all laws, and take the proper administrative action against them if they commit any violation thereof. No other branch of government may intrude into this power, without running afoul of the doctrine of separation of powers.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[135]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> It is this very principle of the doctrine of separation of powers as enshrined under the Constitution that urges the Court to carefully tread on areas falling under the sole discretion of the legislative branch of the government. In point is the power of legislative investigation which the Congress exercises as a Constitutional prerogative.</p><p> Concomitantly, the principle of separation of powers also serves as one of the basic postulates for exempting the Justices, officials and employees of the Judiciary and for excluding the Judiciary's privileged and confidential documents and information from <i>any</i> compulsory processes which very well includes the Congress' power of inquiry in aid of legislation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[136]</sup> Such exemption has been jurisprudentially referred to as judicial privilege as implied from the exercise of judicial power expressly vested in one Supreme Court and lower courts created by law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[137]</sup></p><p> However, as in all privileges, the exercise thereof is not without limitations. The invocation of the Court's judicial privilege is understood to be limited to matters that are part of the internal deliberations and actions of the Court in the exercise of the Members' adjudicatory functions and duties. For the guidance of the bench, the Court herein reiterates its <i>Per Curiam</i> Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[138]</sup> dated February 14, 2012 on the production of court records and attendance of court officials and employees as witnesses in the then impeachment complaint against former Chief Justice Renato C. Corona, insofar as it summarized the documents or communications considered as privileged as follows: </p><blockquote> <p> (1) Court actions such as the result of the raffle of cases and the actions taken by the Court on each case included in the agenda of the Court's session on acts done material to pending cases, except where a party litigant requests information on the result of the raffle of the case, pursuant to Rule 7, Section 3 of the Internal Rules of the Supreme Court (IRSC);<br> (2) Court deliberations or the deliberations of the Members in court sessions on cases and matters pending before the Court;<br> (3) Court records which are "predecisional" and "deliberative" in nature, in particular, documents and other communications which are part of or related to the deliberative process,<i> i.e</i>, notes, drafts, research papers, internal discussions, internal memoranda, records of internal deliberations, and similar papers;<br> (4) Confidential information secured by justices, judges, court officials and employees in the course of their official functions, mentioned in (2) and (3) above, are privileged even after their term of office.<br> (5) Records of cases that are still pending for decision are privileged materials that cannot be disclosed, except only for pleadings, orders and resolutions that have been made available by the court to the general public. </p> <p> x x x x </p> </blockquote> <p> By way of qualification, judicial privilege is unavailing on matters external to the Judiciary's deliberative adjudicatory functions and duties. Justice Antonio T. Carpio discussed in his Separate Opinion to the <i>Per Curiam</i> Resolution, by way of example, the non-confidential matters as including those "information relating to the commission of crimes or misconduct, or violations of the Code of Judicial Conduct, or any violation of a law or regulation," and those outside the Justices' adjudicatory functions such as "financial, budgetary, personnel and administrative matters relating to the operations of the Judiciary." </p><p> As a guiding principle, the purpose of judicial privilege, as a child of judicial power, is principally for the effective discharge of such judicial power. If the matter upon which Members of the Court, court officials and employees privy to the Court's deliberations, are called to appear and testify do not relate to and will not impair the Court's deliberative adjudicatory judicial power, then judicial privilege may not be successfully invoked. </p><p> The Court had occasion to illustrate the application of the rule on judicial privilege and its qualifications to impeachment proceedings as follows: </p><blockquote> <p> [W]here the ground cited in an impeachment complaint is bribery, a Justice may be called as a witness in the impeachment of another Justice, as bribery is a matter external to or is not connected with the adjudicatory functions and duties of a magistrate. A Justice, however, may not be called to testify on the arguments the accused Justice presented in the internal debates as these constitute details of the deliberative process.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[139]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> Nevertheless, the traditional application of judicial privilege cannot be invoked to defeat a positive Constitutional duty. Impeachment proceedings, being <i>sui generis</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[140]</sup> is a Constitutional process designed to ensure accountability of impeachable officers, the seriousness and exceptional importance of which outweighs the claim of judicial privilege. </p><p> To be certain, the Court, in giving utmost importance to impeachment proceedings even as against its own Members, recognizes not the superiority of the power of the House of Representatives to initiate impeachment cases and the power of the Senate to try and decide the same, but the superiority of the impeachment proceedings as a Constitutional process intended to safeguard public office from culpable abuses. In the words of Chief Justice Maria Lourdes P. A. Sereneo in her Concurring and Dissenting Opinion to the <i>Per Curiam</i> Resolution, the matter of impeachment is of such paramount societal importance that overrides the generalized claim of judicial privilege and as such, the Court should extend respect to the Senate acting as an Impeachment Court and give it wide latitude in favor of its function of exacting accountability as required by the Constitution.</p><p> With the foregoing disquisition, the Court finds it unnecessary to discuss the other issues raised in the Omnibus Petition.</p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Omnibus Petition is <b>DISMISSED</b>. </p><p><b>SO ORDERED.</b> </p><p> <em>Carpio</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[*]</sup> <em>Velasco, Jr., Leonardo-De Castro, Bersamin, Del Castillo, Perlas-Bernabe, Leonen, Jardeleza, Caguioa, Martires</em>, and <em>Gesmundo, JJ</em>., concur. <br> <em>Peralta</em> and <em>Reyes, Jr., JJ</em>., no part. <br><br></p><p> </p><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="noshade" align="LEFT"> <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[*]</sup> Senior Associate Justice (Per Section 12, Republic Act No. 296, The Judiciary Act of 1948, As Amended) <p> <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <em>Rollo</em>, pp. 3-74. </p><p><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Petitioner Pedro S.
