Clete] testified: that on September 16, 2000 she was inside their house while the commotion happened; that as she was about to check what the commotion was all about, she was met by one Roosevelt Agamosa, who informed her that her husband Genelito Clete was stabbed; that when she reached the place of the incident, she saw the lifeless and bloodied body of her husband slumped on the ground; that [s]he saw accused Oscar Gimpaya on top of her husband as the former was strangling her husband; that the witness tried to help as she came to the assistance of her husband, but accused Oscar Gimpaya shoved her away; that thereafter, the Barangay authorities arrived; that her husband Genelito Clete was brought to [the] University of Perpetual Help Hospital, and died thereat.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p>The prosecution also presented Dr. Erwin M. Escal, the Medico-Legal officer who examined the body of the victim Genelito Clete (Genelito) and prepared the Medico-Legal Report<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> and Death Certificate<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> which both indicated the cause of death as "stab wound." Abelardo Potenciano Almarinez, the employer of the victim, also testified as to the earnings of the victim at the time of his death.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></p> <p> <i>Version of the Defense</i></p><p> The defense presented the accused-appellant Oscar and his wife, Lea Gimpaya. Their testimonies, as summarized by the RTC, are as follows: </p><blockquote> <p> The witness [Lea Gimpaya] testified: that when the incident happened, she was present; that the aggression came from the deceased himself Genelito Clete y Gabuyo; that one (1) of the accused herein was attacked by Genelito Clete and the other accused merely pacified him; that she is the wife of accused Oscar Gimpaya; that the other accused who remains to be at-large up to the present, named Roel Gimpaya is the cousin of her husband; that around 7:20 in the evening, upon her husband's arrival at home, she had coffee with him; the victim, Gene[l]ito Clete called on her husband, Oscar Gimpaya, and so the latter went outside their house; that Genelito Clete hit her husband Oscar Gimpaya with a long object which appears to be an umbrella; that Oscar Gimpaya fell down, thereafter, Genelito Clete went over him and continuously boxed him; that the witness shouted out for help and so Roel Gimpaya arrived at the scene; that when Roel Gimpaya approached Genelito Clete, Roel stabbed Genelito at his back and that her husband even tried to join the group that brought Genelito in going to [the] hospital, but he was already arrested by the Barangay Officials.</p> <p> x x x x</p> <p> [Accused-appellant Oscar] testified: that he denies the allegation in the Criminal Information pertaining to the incident that happened on September 16, 2000; that he had been detained at the Provincial Jail of Santa Cruz, Laguna for nine (9) years and four (4) months at the time that he took the witness stand and that his co-accused Roel Gimpaya is his cousin.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> <i>Ruling of the RTC</i></p><p> The RTC held Oscar and Roel guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Murder, qualified by treachery, and sentenced them to <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> In arriving at its Decision, the trial court ruled: </p><blockquote> <p> Based on the totality of the circumstances this Court is led to the inevitable conclusion that both the accused are guilty of the crime imputed against them. This Court have (sic) consistently ruled that there is treachery when the offender/s commits any of the crimes against persons, employing means, methods or forms in the execution thereof which tend directly and specially to insure its execution without risk to himself arising from the defense which the offended party might make. x x x</p> <p> In the case at bar, this Court appreciates the element of treachery, which as defined indicates that it is subjective in character. It was deliberately sought by the two (2) accused and consciously adopted the same as their mode of attack. The victim was rendered helpless and defenseless, as when he was hugged by accused Oscar Gimpaya while being stabbed to death by co-accused Roel Gimpaya, both accused acted in concert towards a common criminal goal.</p> <p> Indeed, the essence of treachery is the swift and unexpected attack on an unarmed victim even with provocation on his part.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Oscar was further ordered to pay the heirs of the victim Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) as indemnity and the aggregate amount of One Hundred Thousand (P100,000.00) as actual, moral, and exemplary damages. An alias warrant of arrest without expiration was issued against Roel.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></p><p> Oscar appealed to the CA via Notice of Appeal<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> dated February 3, 2014. Oscar then filed his Brief<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> dated February 26, 2015, while the plaintiff-appellee, through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), filed its Brief<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> dated July 1, 2015. Thereafter, the appeal was submitted for decision.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></p><p> <i>Ruling of the CA</i></p><p> The CA affirmed the RTC Decision with modification only as to the award of damages.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></p><p> The appellate court held that the prosecution was able to prove all the elements of Murder qualified by treachery. The witness Roosevelt had positively identified accused-appellant Oscar as the person who embraced and locked the victim while being stabbed by Roel. In so doing, the victim was completely deprived of the chance to defend himself. Such method employed by both the accused insured the execution of their plan to kill the victim. Thus, treachery clearly attended the killing of the victim.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></p><p> The CA then modified the award of damages accordingly: Seventy-Five Thousand Pesos (P75,000.00) as civil indemnity; Seventy-Five Thousand Pesos (P75,000.00) as moral damages; and Thirty Thousand Pesos (P30,000.00) as exemplary damages.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></p><p> On October 8, 2015, Oscar brought the instant case before this Court via Notice of Appeal.</p><p> In lieu of supplemental briefs, Oscar and plaintiff-appellee filed separate manifestations respectively dated February 10, 2017<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> and February 9, 2017,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> foregoing their right to file the same.</p><p align="center"> <i>Issue</i> </p><p> Whether or not Oscar's guilt for the crime of Murder was proven beyond reasonable doubt.</p><p align="center"> <i>The Court's Ruling </i> </p><p>The Appeal is meritorious.</p><p> As a general rule, factual findings of the trial court are accorded great weight and respect especially when they are affirmed by the appellate court. However, as with every rule, there are exceptions. In the case of <i>Quidet v. People</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> the Court held: </p><blockquote> <p> x x x where the trial court overlooked, misunderstood or misapplied some facts or circumstances of weight and substance which can affect the result of the case, this Court is duty-bound to correct this palpable error for the right to liberty, which stands second only to life in the hierarchy of constitutional rights, cannot be lightly taken away. x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> In the instant case, the Court finds that the prosecution failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt the existence of conspiracy between accused appellant Oscar and his co-accused Roel in the killing of Genelito.</p><p> Conspiracy exists when two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> The essence of conspiracy is the unity of action and purpose. Conspiracy requires the same degree of proof required to establish the crime — proof beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></p><p> The RTC did not discuss its finding of conspiracy; it merely held that "both accused acted in concert towards a common criminal goal."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Conspiracy was not also discussed by the CA. On the subject, the appellate court only said that "[the] [a]ccused-[a]ppellant [Oscar] and [a]ccused Roel Gimpaya acted in concert in killing the victim."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> These pronouncements do not sufficiently establish that there was a conspiracy between Oscar and Roel in the stabbing of the victim.</p><p> The records are also wanting of any indication of conspiracy. To determine if Oscar conspired with Roel, the Court must examine the overt acts of accused-appellant before, during, and after the stabbing incident and the totality of the circumstances. The inception and location of the stabbing incident must also be considered. These can be gleaned from the testimony of prosecution witness Roosevelt: </p><blockquote> <p> <b>[Cross-examination of Roosevelt by Atty.

The house of Oscar and Genelito are on separate sides of the Almarinez Compound while the house of Roel is beside the house of Oscar. </p> <p> Thereafter, Oscar and Genelito had a quarrel which escalated into a physical altercation.

According to prosecution witness Roosevelt, Oscar was hugging Genelito. Meanwhile, defense witness Lea testified that Oscar had fallen down after being struck by Genelito. The common thread in their testimony however, is that <strong>it was Roel who stabbed Genelito in the back and not Oscar.</strong></p> <p> As it was not Oscar who delivered the fatal blow (or any blows, at all) it was incumbent upon the prosecution to establish the existence of conspiracy. It must be borne in mind that the evidence required to prove conspiracy is of the same weight of evidence needed to establish the crime itself—proof beyond reasonable doubt.</p><p> Even if the prosecution's version were to be believed, to the mind of the Court, the act of Oscar in merely hugging the victim does not establish conspiracy in the intent to kill. It was not proven that he acted in concert with Roel or that he even knew of Roel's intention to stab Genelito. It was not established that Oscar was hugging Genelito deliberately to enable Roel to stab him as he had no knowledge of Roel's intention. The RTC's finding that this constituted conspiracy<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> is thus a mere conjecture.</p><p> In <i>People v. Jesalva</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> the Court ruled: </p><blockquote> <p> Direct proof is not essential to prove conspiracy for it may be deduced from the acts of the accused before, during and after the commission of the crime charged, from which it may be indicated that there is a common purpose to commit the crime. <b>It is not sufficient, however, that the attack be joint and simultaneous for simultaneousness does not of itself demonstrate the concurrence of will or unity of action and purpose which are the bases of the responsibility of the assailants. It is necessary that the assailants be animated by one and the same purpose.</b> x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> The necessity of community of criminal intent in conspiracy was also iterated in the case of <i>People v. Tilos</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>: </p><blockquote> <p> The essence of conspiracy is community of criminal intent. It exists when two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and perform overt acts to commit it. The overt act may consist of active participation in the actual commission of the criminal act, or it may be in the form of moral assistance such as the exertion of moral ascendancy over the other co-conspirators by moving them to implement the conspiracy. Conspiracy may be proven by direct evidence, or deduced from the manner in which the offense was committed, as when the accused acted in concert to achieve the same objective. x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Furthermore, after the stabbing incident, Oscar did not flee and abandon the supposed victim, unlike Roel who immediately escaped and remains at-large. While non-flight is not necessarily an indication of innocence, this Court has recognized that taken together with other circumstances, it may bolster the innocence of the accused. In the case of <i>Buenaventura v. People</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> the Court held: </p><blockquote> <p> xxx Non-flight may not necessarily indicate innocence, but under the circumstances obtaining in the present case,<b> the Court recognizes the fact that while the guilty flees even as no one pursues him, the innocent remains as brave and steadfast as a lion</b>. x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> Even prosecution witness Roosevelt testified that Oscar went voluntarily with the barangay authorities after the incident: </p><blockquote> <p> <b>[Cross-examination of Roosevelt by Atty.

The cooperation that the law punishes is the assistance knowingly or intentionally rendered that cannot exist without previous cognizance of the criminal act intended to be executed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> As discussed above, there is nothing on record which indicates that Oscar knew that Roel was going to stab Genelito. Notably, it was not Oscar, but his wife Lea, who called for help as she witnessed the altercation between Genelito and her husband. In addition, the stabbing incident was done in the heat of the moment, it was not premeditated or planned.</p> <p> The testimony of the victim's wife, Roselyn Clete, cannot be given any credence as she did not witness the stabbing incident. She arrived only thereafter as shown by her testimony: </p><blockquote> <p> <b>[Direct examination of Roselyn Clete by Prosecutor Gatbonton]</b></p> <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify">Q</div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="justify">While you were inside your house, do you remember of any unusual incident that happened during that day?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">There was a commotion going on outside our house, sir, and when I went outside the house, I met in my way Roosevelt Agamoza, sir. </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q</div></td> <td><div align="justify">What happened when you met in your way Roosevelt Agamoza? </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">He told me that my husband was stabbed. </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify">Q</div></td> <td><div align="justify">What did you do if any when you learned that your husband was stabbed?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">I sent (sic) to the place of the incident, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q</div></td> <td><div align="justify">And were you able to reach the place of the crime?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Yes, sir. </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify">Q</div></td> <td><div align="justify"><b>And what happened when you reached the place?</b></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A</div></td> <td><div align="justify"><b>I saw the lifeless body of my husband bloodied slumped on the floor, sir.</b></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Who else if you remember have y[o]u seen in that particular place?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">I saw Oscar Gimpaya on top of my husband.

Furthermore, her testimony that she saw Oscar strangling her husband is not supported by the Medico-Legal Report and Death Certificate which both declare the cause of death as "stab wound" and not strangulation. There were also no findings of abrasions or bruising in the neck and jaw area in the said documents to indicate strangulation.</p> <p> Absent any evidence to create the moral certainty required to convict accused-appellant Oscar, the Court cannot uphold the RTC and CA's finding of guilt.
