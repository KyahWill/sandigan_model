The trial court explained in this wise:<br><br><blockquote>In the case at bar, defendant Ramos children failed to adduce a single evidence to show that they have been validly authorized by the Board of Directors of EMRASON to enter into a Contract to Sell with ALI thereby rendering the aforesaid contract void and unenforceable. Defendant Ramos children failed to present even a single witness to identify board resolutions, secretary's certificates or any written document for the purpose of proving that EMRASON validly conferred authority upon them to sell the subject property. Notably, not a single signatory to the Contract to Sell was presented by defendant Ramos children to identify the same and to testify as to the execution thereof.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Upon the other hand, defendant ALI claims that it transacted with the Ramos children in good faith. On the contrary, evidence show that ALI knew and has in fact acknowledged the authority of Emerito Ramos, Sr to enter into contracts for and in behalf of EMRASON before ALI entered into the contract with defendant Ramos children. In almost all of defendant ALI's correspondence with EMRASON, defendant ALI specifically addressed the same to Emerilo Ramos, Sr., referring to him either as Chairman or President. In acknowledging the position of Emerito Ramos, Sr. in EMRASON, defendant ALI even requested Emerito Ramos, Sr. to meet its Chairman Jaime Zobel de Ayala, President Francisco H. Licuanan, Vice-President Fernando Zobel and Assistant Vice-President Victor H. Manarang for a luncheon meeting. More importantly, defendant ALI, though its representatives/realtors namely Mr. Geronimo J. Manzano and Oscar P. Garcia, wrote Emerito Ramos Sr. a letter dated 22 April 1994 regarding the draft formal offer of ALI to develop the subject property. In addition, ALI's letter dated 11 May 1994 clearly shows that it acted in bad faith. A perusal of the said letter which was described to be its "best and final offer", would readily show that the same [was] solely addressed to Emerito Ramos, Sr., seeking his acceptance and approval. If defendant ALI honestly believe[d] that Emerito Ramos, Jr. and Antonio Ramos [were] fully authorized by EMRASON to execute the Contract to Sell surely defendant ALI would not have bothered to seek the acceptance and approval of Emerito. Ramos. Sr. Notably the alleged authorized agents of EMRASON, Emerito Ramos. Jr. and Antonio Ramos, were merely furnished a copy of the said letter proposal and were not even included as signatories for the approval of the same. x x x<br><br>x x x x<br><br>It is an established rule that persons dealing with an assumed agent, whether the assumed agency be a general or special one, are bound at their peril, if they would hold the principal liable, to ascertain not only the fact of agency but also the nature and extent of authority, and in case either is controverted, the burden of proof is upon them to establish it.<br><br>In this connection, the Court observes numerous formal defects in the Contract to Sell[,] which would further support the fact that defendant ALI knew the absence of authority of defendant Ramos children to execute the same. Oddly, the first page of the contract failed to include the names of the duly authorized representative/s of EMRASON as the space specifically provided therefor was left in blank. In contrast, the duly appointed [a]ttorneys-in-fact of ALI are clearly named therein and designated as such. Similarly, page eighteen (18) of the said contract merely provided blank spaces to be filled up by the signatories of EMRASON vis-a-vis that of defendant ALI where the names of the [a]ttorneys-in-[f]act of defendant ALI are typewritten. Even in the acknowledgment page, only the names of the representatives of ALI were included. Interestingly, the acknowledgment failed to mention the names of signatories of EMRASON and their respective Community Tax Certificate Numbers. Considering that the subject contract involves a multi-million [peso] transaction, the Court finds it absolutely incredible that the parties thereto would fail to include the names of the signatories, their respective positions and/or authorities to enter into the said contract.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> (Citations omitted )</blockquote><br><br>In consequence of the nullification of the Contract to Sell, the RTC ruled that the annotations on the TCTs covered by the said Contract to Sell must likewise be cancelled.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>In addition, the RTC declared valid the Letter-Agreement deeding the Dasmariñas Property to ASBRC.

Nothing more, nothing less. To construe the letter as a virtual <i> carte blanche </i> for the Ramos children to enter into a Contract to Sell regarding the Dasmariñas Property would be unduly stretching one's imagination.

In the absence of a charter or bylaw provision to the contrary. the president is presumed to have the authority to act within the domain of the general objectives of its business and within the scope of his or her usual duties.<br><br>Hence, it has been held in other jurisdictions that the president of a corporation possesses the power to enter into a contract for the corporation, when the 'conduct on the part of both the president and the corporation [shows] that he had been in the habit of acting in similar matters on behalf of the company and that the company had authorized him so to act and had recognized, approved and ratified his former and similar actions.' Furthermore, a party dealing with the president of a corporation is entitled to assume that he has the authority to enter, on behalf of the corporation, into contracts that are within the scope of the powers of said corporation and that do not violate any statute or rule on public policy.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[61]</sup></font> (Citations omitted)</blockquote><br><br>Here, Ramos, Sr.'s authority to execute and enter into the Letter-Agreement with ASBRC was clearly proven. We quote with approval the RTC's finding thereon, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Emerito Ramos, Sr. testified that on 17 May 1994[,] a special Board meeting was called to discuss various proposals regarding the Dasmariñas Property. In attendance were Emerita Ramos, Sr., Rogerio Escobal and Arturo de Leon. After some discussion, the Board resolved to accept the proposal of ASB Realty being the most advantageous and beneficial to EMRASON. In the said meeting, the Board [of] Directors also agreed, <i> viz</i>[.]<i>: </i> that Emerito Ramos, Sr. shall be authorized to accept the cash advance from ASB in his personal capacity; and that Emerito Ramos, Sr and Antonio Ramos shall be authorized to execute a Real Estate Mortgage in favor of ASB. Then, he identified the Minutes of the aforesaid Board Meeting and the signatures of the members of the board appearing thereon. He further alleged that at 4:00 in the afternoon of 17 May 1994 a Stockholders['] Meeting was subsequently held. He alleged that there was a quorum during the said meeting considering that he was present and the fact that he owns 2/3 of the subscribed capital of EMRASON.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup></blockquote><br><br>ALI's argument that "respondents failed to establish that [Ramos], Sr. had been in the habit of executing contracts on behalf of EMRASON"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> is negated by the fact that correspondences between ALI and EMRASON had always been addressed to Ramos, Sr.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> In fact, ALI must be deemed to have acknowledged the authority of Ramos, Sr. to act on behalf of EMRASON when ALI relied on the August 3, 1993 letter of Ramos, Sr. In any case, this Court clarified in <i> People's Aircargo</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> that "[i]t is <b> not </b> the quantity of similar acts which establishes apparent authority, but the vesting of a corporate officer with the power to bind the corporation."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup>&nbsp; Together with this Court's pronouncement that "a party dealing with the president of a corporation is entitled to assume that he has the authority to enter, on behalf of the corporation, into contracts that are within the scope of the powers of said corporation and that do not violate any statute or rule on public policy,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> the inevitable conclusion is that Ramos, Sr. was properly authorized to, and validly executed with ASBRC, the said Letter-Agreement.<br><br>Petitioner contends, nonetheless, that Ramos, Sr. could not have possibly been at the stockholders' meeting due to his presence at the time at the Wack -Wack Golf and Country Club.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup>&nbsp; This argument undoubtedly raises a factual issue, and on this score alone, this Court can give it short shrift. Nonetheless, even shunting aside for a moment this legal infirmity, and allowing a re-evaluation of the evidence on record, petitioner's stance is still untenable, because the record shows that another stockholders' meeting was in fact subsequently held on March 6, 1995; and in this March 6, 1995 stockholders' meeting, the stockholders unanimously approved to confirm and ratify the Letter- Agreement.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>More than these, this Court cannot gloss over the formal defects in the Contract to Sell, which further shows that ALI did entertain doubts as to the Ramos children's authority to enter into the said contract. Consider the following pronouncement of the RTC, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>In this connection, the Court observes numerous formal defects in the Contract to Sell which would further support the fact that defendant ALI knew the <b>absence</b> of authority of defendant Ramos children to execute the same. Oddly, the first page of the contract failed to include the names of the duly authorized representative/s of EMRASON as the space specifically provided therefor was left in blank. In contrast, the duly appointed [a]ttorneys-in-fact of ALI are clearly named therein and designated as such. Similarly, page eighteen (18) of the said contract merely provided blank spaces to be filled up by the signatories of EMRASON vis-a-vis that of defendant ALI where the names of the [a]ttorney's-in-[f]act of defendant ALI are typewritten. Even in the acknowledgment page, only the names of the representatives of ALI were included. Interestingly, the acknowledgment failed to mention the names of signatories of EMRASON and their respective Community Tax Certificate Numbers. Considering that the subject contract involves a multi-million transaction, the Court finds it absolutely incredible that the parties thereto would fail to include the names of the signatories, their respective positions and/or authorities to enter into the said contract.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup>&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><br>Against this backdrop, this Court must uphold, as it hereby upholds, the validity of the Letter-Agreement entered into by and between EMRASON and ASBRC. Under the same parity of reasoning, this Court must affirm, as it hereby affirms, the RTC and CA's declaration of the invalidity or nullity of the Contract to Sell entered into by and between ALI and the Ramos children.<br><br><b> WHEREFORE, </b> the instant Petition is <b> DENIED. </b> The April 30, 2013 Decision and November 7, 2013 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
