SP No. 119495.<br><br>The facts as borne by the records are as follows:<br><br>Lockheed Detective and Watchman Agency, Inc. (Lockheed) was the security services contractor for Philippine Ports Authority's Port District Office-Luzon. When the time came to bid for a new security provider, Lockheed applied for accreditation to bid for the security services contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Officers from the Port Police Department reviewed Lockheed's performance and gave it a rating of 78.30 or "fair." Lockheed's fair rating effectively disqualified it from being accredited to bid for the new security services contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Philippine Ports Authority Assistant General Manager for Operations Benjamin Cecilio (Cecilio) referred Lockheed's rating to Port District Office-Luzon for its review and comments. Port District Office-Luzon Security Staff Officer Captain Geronimo R. Grospe (Grospe), in tum, directed Lockheed to comment on its rating from the Port Police Department.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Lockheed submitted its comment, and Grospe, finding merit in its arguments for reconsideration, recommended the reconsideration of its rating and the issuance of its Certificate of Accreditation to bid for the new security services contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Port District Office-Luzon Port District Manager Hector Miole (Miole) also recommended the recomputation of Lockheed's rating and the issuance of its Certificate of Accreditation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Cecilio directed Port District Office-Luzon Superintendent Loving F. Fetalvero, Jr. (Fetalvero) to review Grospe's and Miole's recommendations against the guidelines and to draft a reply.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Port Management Office-Puerto Princesa, Palawan Station Commander Aquilino Peregrina (Peregrina) submitted Lockheed's reÂ­evaluation performance to Miole.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Cecilio eventually adapted Grospe's and Miele's recommendations and issued Lockheed a Certificate of Final Rating, with a readjusted rating of 83.97, or satisfactory, from the original rating of 78.30, or fair, making Lockheed eligible for the accreditation to bid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Port Police Department Division Manager Maximo Aguirre (Aguirre) filed a complaint-affidavit against Cecilio, Fetalvero, Miele, Grospe, and Peregrine for Grave Misconduct and Dishonesty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Aguirre claimed that Cecilio issued Lockheed's Certificate of Final Rating without going through the prescribed procedure under the Philippine Ports Authority Memorandum Circular No. 18-2000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Aguirre also averred that the Port Police Officers who gave Lockheed its original rating did not participate in its reevaluation, contrary to the claims of Peregrine that they did. Furthermore, the Port Police Officers who rated Lockheed denied reevaluating Lockheed and changing its rating. Thus, Aguirre asserted that Cecilio committed deceit, misrepresentation, and deception because the reassessment was without basis and was done to favor Lockheed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>On May 21, 2003, Graft Investigation and Prosecution Officer I Moreno F.

Furthermore, Peregrine and Grospe had no personal knowledge of Lockheed's performance; hence, they had no basis for their reevaluation of the original rating. It also emphasized that the readjustment was done whimsically and capriciously since there were no documents or computations submitted to support the readjustment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>The <i>fallo</i> of the Review Resolution read:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, it is recommended that respondents Benjamin Cecilio, Loving Fetalvero, Jr., Hector Miole, Geronimo Gorospe (sic) and Aquilino Peregrino be held guilty of Grave Misconduct and Dishonesty and are meted the penalty of Dismissal from the service.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br></blockquote>The recommendation was approved by Orlando C.

Thus, the readjustment by persons without personal knowledge of the behavior and performance of Lockheed's guards was improper and highly irregular.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>The Review Order also brought up that Cecilio's and the other officers' acts showed a "common intent ... to cover up [Lockheed's] below satisfactory rating" so that it could qualify for the bidding of Philippine Port Authority's security services.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>The recommendation of the Review Order read:<br><blockquote>The undersigned respectfully recommends for the affirmation of the Review Resolution of Special Prosecutor III Agagon holding respondents, <b>BENJAMIN B.

It claims that the reassessment and eventual readjustment of Lockheed's rating to 83.97 from the original 78.30 were without basis and were clearly meant to favor Lockheed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>Petitioner fails to convince.<br><br>As the Assistant General Manager for Operations, Cecilio exercised control and supervision over the Port Police Department. His authority over it is evident in Philippine Ports Authority Memorandum Circular No. 18-2000, or the Revised Port Security Services Procurement and Contract Administration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> which provides:<br><blockquote>23.4.1 The security agency/guards shall be rated on their performance and compliance to the Security Services Contract by Port Management Office (PMO) Port Police Division monthly and/or <i>by the Office of the [Assistant General Manager for Operations] through the Port Police Department -</i> Head Office, at least once every six months during the effectivity of the contract to ensure that the desired quality of service is rendered.<br><br>....<br><br>23.4.4. The Office of the [Assistant General Manager for Operations] shall issue a Certificate of Final Rating, based on the average rating of the Agency/Security Guards. Monthly Performance Ratings in the [Port Management Offices] within a certain [Port District Office] from the effectivity of the contract, and <i>the average of the [Assistant General Manager for Operations], through the Port Police Department - Head Office</i> rating on inspections conducted, pursuant to 23.4 hereof (with the last rating conducted at least one month before expiration of the contract) divided by two (for incumbent contractor).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>The power of supervision involves oversight of a subordinate to ensure that the rules are followed. On the other hand, the power of control is broader as it involves laying down the actual rules to be followed. If the rules are not followed, the power of control allows the controlling officer to order that the act be done or undone, or even to supplant the subordinate's act with his or her own act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br><i>Mondano v. Silvosa</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> expounded on the difference between supervision and control:<br><blockquote>In administrative law[,] supervision means overseeing or the power or authority of an officer to see that subordinate officers perform their duties. If the latter fail or neglect to fulfill them[,] the former may take such action or step as prescribed by law to make them perform their duties. Control, on the other hand, means the power of an officer to alter or modify or nullify or set aside what a subordinate officer had done in the performance of his duties and to substitute the judgment of the former for that of the latter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioner faults Cecilio for readjusting Lockheed's original rating from the Port Police Department, thereby leading to Lockheed's eligibility to participate in the bidding for a security service contract. However, as the controlling officer over the Port Police Department, Cecilio precisely had the authority to supplant its rating with a new one as long as the new rating was backed by the necessary evidence and he did not gravely abuse his authority to do so.<br><br>In petitioner's June 7, 2006 Order, Officer Fangon found sufficient basis for the readjustment of Lockheed's rating:<br><blockquote>Needless to state, the ensuing review of the recommended ratings resulted in the re-adjustment of the ratings of [Lockheed] from Fair to Satisfactory (or from 78.3[0] to 83.97). The records of the case will reveal that <i>the re-adjusted ratings were based on documents culled by the officials who conducted the review of the ratings consisting of Summary Reports and Monthly Performance Ratings</i>. From these documents, it appears that there was sufficient basis to recommend the increase of the ratings of [Lockheed].<br><br>It becomes clear from the foregoing, that <i>the re-adjustment of the ratings was based on reliable proof which was contained in the records of the [Philippine Ports Authority]</i>, and which can not be said of the initial ratings given to [Lockheed].<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Even petitioner admitted that the readjustment was not altogether devoid of evidentiary basis:<br><blockquote>Moreover, if there be any re-adjustments made, it must have the accompanying documents/computations, not just re-adjusted whimsically and capriciously. The <i>submissions of only the portion of the computation or comment in the logbook</i> is not sufficient.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>As for respondent, petitioner claims that he was guilty of dishonesty and misconduct because of the undue preference that he purportedly extended to Lockheed.<br><br>Petitioner again fails to convince.<br><br>In its Statement of Facts, petitioner puts forth that it was Grospe and Miole who recommended to Cecilio the reconsideration and readjustment of Lockheed's rating, while respondent, upon Cecilio's instructions, reviewed their recommendations vis-a-vis the guidelines.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>Nowhere was it alleged that respondent likewise recommended the reconsideration or readjustment of Lockheed's original rating. This supports respondent's assertion that he performed the ministerial task of creating a report by collating and computing the ratings transmitted to him by Miole.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>In the May 21, 2003 Decision, Officer Generoso likewise found that respondent was not guilty of dishonesty and grave misconduct since his participation was limited to the mechanical act of computing the raw data provided to him:<br><blockquote>Similarly, the allegations against respondent Fetalvero deserves scant consideration considering that the Memorandum dated May 2, 2001 which he submitted together with the draft Certificate of Final Rating preÂ­dated April 25, 2001 and the computation of ratings of [Lockheed] was regular.<br><br>We likewise, do not find any irregularity on the Re-evaluated Performance of [Lockheed] <i>since he (Fetalvero) only conducted the numerical computation pursuant to [Philippine Ports Authority Memorandum Circular No.] 18-2000</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Petitioner attempts to pin liability on respondent by insisting that the Certificate of Final Rating issued by Cecilio was "loosely based"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> on the reply that petitioner drafted. However, as respondent's reply is a compilation of Lockheed's ratings, it is inevitable that it will be referred to for the issuance of Certificate of Final Rating in Lockheed's favor. This cannot be interpreted as respondent's positive act to recompute or adjust Lockheed's rating to give it undue preference.<br><br>Dishonesty is defined as the "disposition to lie, cheat, deceive, or defraud; untrustworthiness, lack of integrity."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> It involves intentionally making a false statement to deceive or commit a fraud.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, misconduct is more than just mere error of judgment as it involves a wrongful intention from the public officer involved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> It is also defined as "a transgression of some established and definite rule of action, more particularly, unlawful behavior or gross negligence by the public officer."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>As the complainant, petitioner has the burden of proving that respondent deliberately committed falsehood or transgressed established rules to give Lockheed undue preference during the bidding process of the contract for services.<br><br>Petitioner fails to discharge its burden.<br><br>What petitioner only managed to prove was that respondent, upon orders of his superior, collated the ratings and recommendations submitted by the other officers and then summarized them into a report. By no stretch of mind can respondent's submission of a report, an act which was done within the confines of his function as the Superintendent of the Port District Office-Luzon, be seen as an unlawful act.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, this Court resolves to <b>DENY</b> the Petition and<b> AFFIRM</b> the Court of Appeals April 15, 2013 Decision and February 20, 2014 Resolution in CA-G.R.
