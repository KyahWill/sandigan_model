Ombudsman</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup>&nbsp; elaborated on the import of the <i> Fabian</i> ruling as follows:<br><blockquote>In <i> Fabian, </i> the Court held that appeals from decisions of the Office of the Ombudsman in administrative disciplinary cases should be taken to the Court of Appeals under Rule 43 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.<br><br>In so holding, the Court <i> en Banc, </i> through Mr. Justice Florenz D. Regalado, declared unconstitutional Section 27 of Republic Act 6770 or the Ombudsman Act of 1989, which provided that decisions of the Office of the Ombudsman may be appealed to the Supreme Court by way of a petition for review on <i> certiorari </i> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. Such provision was held violative of Section 30, Article VI of the Constitution, as it expanded the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court without its advice and consent.<br><br>The Court also took note of the regulatory philosophy adopted in appeals from quasi-judicial agencies in the 1997 Revised Rules of Civil Procedure. Thus, it held that "[u]nder the present Rule 45, appeals may be brought through a petition for review on <i> certiorari, </i> but only from judgments and final orders of the <i> courts </i> enumerated in Section 1 thereof. Appeals from judgments and final orders of <i> quasi judicial agencies </i> are now required to be brought to the Court of Appeals on a verified petition for review, under the requirements and conditions in Rule 43 which was precisely formulated and adopted to provide for a uniform rule of appellate procedure for quasi-judicial agencies." The Office of the Ombudsman is a <i> quasi-judicial agency </i> falling under Rule 43. As the Court succinctly stated:<br><blockquote>"It is suggested, however, that the provisions of Rule 43 should apply only to 'ordinary quasi-judicial agencies,' but not to the Office of the Ombudsman which is a 'high constitutional body.' <i>We see no reason for this distinction for, if hierarchical rank should be a criterion, that proposition thereby disregards the fact that Rule 43 even</i><i> includes the Office of the President and the Civil Service Commission, although the latter is even an independent constitutional commission, unlike the Office of the Ombudsman, which is a constitutionally-mandated but statutorily-created body.</i>"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> (Emphasis supplied )</blockquote></blockquote>Thus, as a quasi-judicial agency, decisions of the Office of the Ombudsman in administrative disciplinary cases may only be appealed to the Court of Appeals through a Rule 43 petition.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>While Republic Act No. 6770 may have been silent on the remedy available to a party aggrieved with the Office of the Ombudsman's finding of probable cause in a criminal case, <i>Tirol, Jr. v. Del Rosario</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> clarified that the remedy in this instance is not an appeal, but a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court before this Court:<br><blockquote>True, the law is silent on the remedy of an aggrieved party in case the Ombudsman found sufficient cause to indict him in criminal or non-administrative cases. We cannot supply such deficiency if none has been provided in the law. We have held that the right to appeal is a mere statutory privilege and may be exercised only in the manner prescribed by, and in accordance with, the provisions of law. Hence, there must be a law expressly granting such privilege. The Ombudsman Act specifically deals with the remedy of an aggrieved party from orders, directives and decisions of the Ombudsman in administrative disciplinary cases. As we ruled in <i>Fabian, </i>the aggrieved party is given the right to appeal to the Court of Appeals. Such right of appeal is not granted to parties aggrieved by orders and decisions of the Ombudsman in criminal cases, like finding probable cause to indict accused persons.<br><br>However, an aggrieved party is not without recourse where the finding of the Ombudsman as to the existence of probable cause is tainted with grave abuse of discretion, amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. An aggrieved party may file a petition for <i>certiorari </i>under Rule 65 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> (Citation omitted )</blockquote>This Court has repeatedly pronounced<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> that the Office of the Ombudsman's orders and decisions in criminal cases may be elevated to this Court in a Rule 65 petition, while its orders and decisions in administrative disciplinary cases may be raised on appeal to the Court of Appeals. Hence, the Court of Appeals did not err in denying the petition questioning public respondent's finding of probable cause for lack of jurisdiction. Thus, petitioners' failure to avail of the correct procedure with respect to the criminal case renders public respondent's decision final. Furthermore, the present case fails even on its merits.<br><br><div align="CENTER"><b>II</b></div><br><i> Dichaves v. Office of the Ombudsman</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> explained that this Court generally does not interfere with the Office of the Ombudsman's finding of probable cause out of respect for its investigatory and prosecutory powers granted by the Constitution. <i>Dichaves </i>pointed out that the Office of the Ombudsman's power to determine probable cause is executive in nature, and with its power to investigate, it is in a better position than this Court to assess the evidence on hand to substantiate a finding of probable cause or lack of it. Thus, for their petition to prosper, petitioners would have to prove that public respondent "conducted the preliminary investigation in such a way that amounted to a virtual refusal to perform a duty under the law."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>Probable cause is:<br><blockquote>[T]he existence of such facts and circumstances as would lead a person of ordinary caution and prudence to entertain an honest and strong suspicion that the person charged is guilty of the crime subject of the investigation. Being based merely on opinion and reasonable belief, it does not import absolute certainty. Probable cause need not be based on clear and convincing evidence of guilt, as the investigating officer acts upon reasonable belief. Probable cause implies probability of guilt and requires more than bare suspicion but less than evidence which would justify a conviction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote>Public respondent found probable cause against petitioners for violating Section 3, paragraphs (e) and (g) of Republic Act No. 3019, and Article 177 of the Revised Penal Code. Section 3, paragraphs (e) and (g) of Republic Act No. 3019 provide:<br><blockquote>Section 3. Corrupt practices of public officers. - In addition to acts or omissions of public officers already penalized by existing law, the following shall constitute corrupt practices of any public officer and are hereby declared to be unlawful:<br><br>. . . .<br><br>(e) Causing any undue injury to any party, including the Government, or giving any private party any unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference in the discharge of his official administrative or judicial functions through manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence. This provision shall apply to officers and employees of offices or government corporations charged with the grant of licenses or permits or other concessions.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>(g) Entering, on behalf of the Government, into any contract or transaction manifestly and grossly disadvantageous to the same, whether or not the public officer profited or will profit thereby.</blockquote>Based on opinion, reasonable belief, and the evidence submitted by the parties, public respondent found that all the elements of the crime punishable under Section 3, paragraphs (e) and (g) of Republic Act No. 3019 existed. Petitioners did not deny being public officers when the acts complained of were committed. Furthermore, clear preference was given to Amellar Solutions with the direct contracting mode of procurement, bypassing the usual mode of public bidding and leading to a gross disadvantage to the government:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><blockquote>The law on public bidding is not an empty formality. The purpose of subjecting all government procurements to competitive bidding is to encourage transparency and ensure that the government acquires the most advantageous contract at the least price. There is no question that the respondent's failure to submit the computerization project to competitive bidding resulted in injury to the government. Considering the amount involved and considering further that no funds were appropriated for said purpose, the Municipality of Lemery was induced to obtain a loan to acquire the contract from Amellar Solutions. Moreover, the Municipality of Lemery had to increase its loan from PhP7.5 Million to Ph P8.193 Million, which not only caused injury to the Municipality as it was forced to incur a substantial financial obligation, but also gave Amellar Solutions unwarranted benefits as the contract was awarded to it without compliance with the requirements of the Procurement Law. Needless to state, the contract was manifestly and grossly disadvantageous to the Municipal Government of Lemery, Batangas.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> (Citation omitted)</blockquote>In the same manner, public respondent properly performed its duty when it found probable cause to charge petitioners with violation of Article 177<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> of the Revised Penal Code, or usurpation of authority or official functions.<br><br>Again based on opinion, reasonable belief, and the evidence submitted by the parties, public respondent found that by authorizing Bendaña to enter into a direct contracting procedure with Amellar Solutions, petitioners usurped the authority of the Bids and Awards Committee, which had the sole authority to recommend the method of procurement.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> Public respondent established that:<br><blockquote>By passing the afore-said Resolution, the respondents, in effect, conferred upon themselves functions which, under R.A.
