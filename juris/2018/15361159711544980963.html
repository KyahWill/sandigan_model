No. 9165.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> <b><i>Version of the Prosecution</i></b></p><p> During the trial, the prosecution presented the testimonies of Police Senior Inspector (PSI) Charity Peralta Caceres (PSI Caceres), SPO3<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Allan Payla (SPO3 Payla), SPO1 Roy Sabaldana (SPO1 Sabaldana), and Police Inspector Rogelio Labor (PI Labor).</p><p> The version of the prosecution as summarized by the CA is as follows: </p><blockquote> <p> On September 27, 2010, SPO3 Payla received a report from a civilian informant (CI) that a person [appellant] was selling shabu at Vamenta Subdivision, Barra, Opol, Misamis Oriental. SPO3 Payla relayed the information to his superior, PI Labor, who immediately instructed him to conduct surveillance. Thereafter, SPO3 Payla and the CI proceeded to the area. There, they were able to confirm that [appellant] was selling drugs in his house.</p> <p> At about 1 o'clock in the afternoon of the following day, PI Labor, in coordination with the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA), formed a buy-bust team, composed of SPO3 Payla, SPO1 Sabaldana, PO3 Eva Española and the CI. They prepared four (4) 50-peso bills dusted with ultraviolet fluorescent powder as buy-bust money and then, on board two vehicles, the team proceeded to Vamenta Subdivision. </p> <p> When the team arrived at the target area, SPO3 Payla gave the buy-bust money to the CI and instructed him to give a signal should the transaction be positive. The rest of the team remained inside the vehicles which were parked just about five (5) to six (6) meters from [appellant's] house. The CI alighted from the vehicle and headed towards the house. Upon reaching his destination, the CI waved at [appellant], then, the two had a conversation outside the house. Later, [appellant] went inside the house, came out again and delivered a transparent plastic sachet containing a white crystalline substance to the CI in exchange of the buy-bust money. Immediately after the transaction, the CI gave the pre-arranged signal. SPO3 Payla and SPO1 Sabaldana then came out of the vehicle and arrested [appellant]. The CI handed the plastic sachet to SPO3 Payla while SPO1 Sabaldana frisked [appellant] and found another transparent plastic sachet in his pocket. SPO1 Sabaldana recovered the buy-bust money and the other plastic sachet from [appellant] and turned over the same to SPO3 Payla. </p> <p> At the police station, SPO3 Payla marked the sachet received from the CI as ASP-1, and the sachet received from SPO1 Sabaldana as ASP-2. Then, SPO3 Payla requested for the laboratory examination of the seized items and personally delivered the same to the PNP Crime Laboratory. An examination, conducted by Forensic Chemist Charity Caceres, tested the seized items positive for methamphetamine hydrochloride or shabu. Likewise, [appellant] tested positive for the presence of green ultraviolet fluorescent powder on the dorsal and palmar aspects of both his left and right hands.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> <b><i>Version of the Appellant</i></b></p><p> Appellant, on the other hand, testified that while he was inside the house watching a movie with his wife and Ibrahim Sultan (Sultan), six men barged inside, identifying themselves as police officers.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> They claimed that they were able to purchase <em>shabu</em> from him and conducted a search of the house but found nothing.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> He and Sultan were then brought to the police station.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Sultan, however, was later released.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Appellant, on the other hand, was asked to give P100,000.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> But since he did not have that amount of money, he was arrested and brought to the Crime Laboratory, where he was made to hold four pieces of P50.00 bills.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> To corroborate his testimony, appellant presented Sultan as witness. </p><p> <b><i>Ruling of the Regional Trial Court</i></b></p><p> On September 26, 2012, the RTC rendered a Judgment finding the appellant guilty of violating Section 5, Article II of RA 9165, the <i>fallo</i> of which reads: </p><blockquote> <p> WHEREFORE, premises considered, this Court hereby finds the [appellant] RASHID BINASING y DISALUNGAN GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT of the offense defined and penalized under Section 5, Article II of R.A. 9165 as charged in the Information, and hereby sentences him to suffer the penalty of LIFE IMPRISONMENT, and to pay the Fine of One Million Pesos [P1,000,000.00].</p> <p> Let the penalty imposed on the accused be a lesson and an example to all who have the same criminal propensity and proclivity to commit the same forbidden act, that crime does not pay, and that the pecuniary gain and benefit which one can enjoy from selling or manufacturing or trading drugs, or other illegal substance, or from committing any other acts penalized under Republic Act 9165, cannot compensate for the penalty which one will suffer if ever he is prosecuted, convicted, and penalized to the full extent of the law. </p> <p> SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> <b><i>Ruling of the Court of Appeals</i></b></p><p> Appellant appealed the case to the CA. </p><p> On June 30, 2015, the CA rendered the assailed Decision, denying the appeal and thus, affirming the Judgment <em>in toto</em>. </p><p> Hence, appellant filed the instant appeal. </p><p> The Court required both parties to file their respective supplementary briefs; however, they opted not to file the same. </p><p align="center"> <b>The Court's Ruling</b> </p><p> In assailing his conviction, appellant puts in issue the failure of the apprehending team to comply with the procedural safeguards laid down in Section 21, Article II of RA 9165 as well as the conflicting testimonies of the prosecution's witnesses.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> </p><p> The appeal is meritorious. </p><table width="50%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><b><i>The apprehending team failed to comply with Section 21, Article II of RA 9165.</i></b> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>Section 21, Article II of RA 9165, as amended by RA 10640,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> reads: </p><blockquote> <p> Section 21. <i>Custody and Disposition of Confiscated, Seized. and/or Surrendered Dangerous Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous Drugs, Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, Instruments/Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment</i>. — The PDEA shall take charge and have custody of all dangerous drugs, x x x so confiscated, seized and/or surrendered, for proper disposition in the following manner: </p> <p> (1) The apprehending team having initial custody and control of the dangerous drugs, x x x shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, conduct a physical inventory of the seized items and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the persons from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, with an elected public official and a representative of the National Prosecution Service or the media who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof; <i>Provided</i>, That the physical inventory and photograph shall be conducted at the place where the search warrant is served; or at the nearest police station or at the nearest office of the apprehending officer/team, whichever is practicable, in case of warrantless seizures: <i>Provided, finally</i>, That noncompliance of these requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and invalid such seizures and custody over said items.</p> <p> (2) Within twenty-four (24) hours upon confiscation/seizure of dangerous drugs, x x x the same shall be submitted to the PDEA Forensic Laboratory for a qualitative and quantitative examination; </p> <p> (3) A certification of the forensic laboratory examination results x x x shall be issued immediately upon the receipt of the subject item/s: <i>Provided</i>, That when the volume of dangerous drugs, x x x does not allow the completion of testing within the time frame, a partial laboratory examination report shall be provisionally issued stating therein the quantities of dangerous drugs still to be examined by the forensic laboratory: Provided, however, That a final certification shall be issued immediately upon completion of the said examination and certification;</p> </blockquote> <p> The said provision clearly requires the apprehending team to mark and conduct a physical inventory of the seized items and to photograph the same immediately after seizure and confiscation in the presence of the accused or his representative or counsel and the insulating witnesses, namely, any elected public official and a representative of the National Prosecution Service or the media. The law mandates that the insulating witnesses be present during the marking, the actual inventory, and the taking of photographs of the seized items to deter [possible planting of] evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Failure to strictly comply with this rule, however, does not <i>ipso facto</i> invalidate or render void the seizure and custody over the items as long as the prosecution is able to show that "(a) there is justifiable ground for non­ compliance; and (b) the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> However, in case of non-compliance, the prosecution must be able to "explain the reasons behind the procedural lapses, and that the integrity and value of the seized evidence had nonetheless been preserved x x x because the Court cannot presume what these grounds are or that they even exist."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></p><p> In this case, the marking and physical inventory, as well as the taking of the photograph of the seized items were not done in the presence of the insulating witnesses. And since no explanation was offered to justify the non-compliance, the Court finds that the prosecution failed to show that the seized substance from the accused were the same substances offered in court. Thus, the integrity of the <i>corpus delicti</i> was not properly established. </p><p> In addition, although the Seizure Receipt<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> bore the signature of the accused, his presence during the marking and the physical inventory of the seized items was likewise not established as the prosecution's witnesses failed to categorically state that the marking and the physical inventory were done in the presence of the accused or his representative or counsel.
