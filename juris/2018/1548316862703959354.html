The following requisites must first be complied with before the Court may exercise its power of judicial review, namely: (<em>1</em>) there is an actual case or controversy calling for the exercise of judicial power; (<em>2</em>) the petitioner has standing to question the validity of the subject act or issuance,<em> i.e</em>., he has a personal and substantial interest in the case that he has sustained, or will sustain, direct injury as a result of the enforcement of the act or issuance; (<em>3</em>) the question of constitutionality is raised at the earliest opportunity; and (4) the constitutional question is the very<em> lis mota</em> of the case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup> Of these four, the most important are the first two requisites, and thus will be the focus of the following discussion. </p><p> <i>Actual case or controversy</i></p><p> An actual case or controversy is one which involves a conflict of legal rights, an assertion of opposite legal claims, susceptible of judicial resolution as distinguished from a hypothetical or abstract difference or dispute since the courts will decline to pass upon constitutional issues through advisory opinions, bereft as they are of authority to resolve hypothetical or moot questions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup> Related to the requirement of an actual case or controversy is the requirement of "ripeness," and a question is ripe when the act being challenged has a direct effect on the individual challenging it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup> For a case to be considered ripe for adjudication, it is a prerequisite that an act had been accomplished or performed by either branch of government before a court may interfere, and the petitioner must allege the existence of an immediate or threatened injury to himself as a result of the challenged action.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup></p><p> Relevantly, in <i>Sps.

Petitioners in G.R. Nos. 217752 and 218045 are suing as citizens, taxpayers and in their personal capacities as parents whose children would be directly affected by the law in question. Petitioners in G.R.

And, considering that the instant cases involve issues on education, which under the Constitution the State is mandated to promote and protect, the stringent requirement of direct and substantial interest may be dispensed with, and the mere fact that petitioners are concerned citizens asserting a public right, sufficiently clothes them with legal standing to initiate the instant petition.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[124]</sup></p><p align="center"> <b><u>Substantive Issues</u></b> </p><p align="center"> <b>I.</b> </p><p> <b><i>K to 12 Law was duly enacted</i></b></p><p> Petitioners question the validity of the enactment of the <i>K to 12 Law</i> claiming that: (<em>1</em>) sectors which would be directly affected by the K to 12 Basic Education Program were deprived of their right, under Section 16, Article XIII of the 1987 Constitution, to be consulted or participate in matters which involved their interest prior to the passage of the law;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[125]</sup> (<em>2</em>) the enrolled bill which the President signed into law varies significantly from the reconciled version of the bill as approved by Congress and reported in the Senate Journal on January 30, 2013,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[126]</sup> and that the Court, pursuant to its ruling in <i>Astorga v.

The <i>K to 12 Law</i> was passed by the Senate and House of Representatives on January 20, 2013, approved by the President on May 15, 2013, and, after publication, took effect on June 8, 2013. Thus, there is no doubt as to the formal validity of the <i>K to 12 Law</i>. </p><p> <i>Third</i>, there is no undue delegation of legislative power in the enactment of the <i>K to 12 Law</i>. </p><p> In determining whether or not a statute constitutes an undue delegation of legislative power, the Court has adopted two tests: the completeness test and the sufficient standard test. Under the first test, the law must be complete in all its terms and conditions when it leaves the legislature such that when it reaches the delegate, the only thing he will have to do is to enforce it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[148]</sup> The policy to be executed, carried out or implemented by the delegate must be set forth therein.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[149]</sup> The sufficient standard test, on the other hand, mandates adequate guidelines or limitations in the law to determine the boundaries of the delegate's authority and prevent the delegation from running riot.

The strategies may cover changes in physical infrastructure, manpower, organizational and structural concerns, bridging models linking grade 10 competencies and the entry requirements of new tertiary curricula, and partnerships between the government and other entities. Modeling for senior high school may be implemented in selected schools to simulate the transition process and provide concrete data for the transition plan.</p> <p> To manage the initial implementation of the enhanced basic education program and mitigate the expected multi-year low enrolment turnout for HEIs and Technical Vocational Institutions (TVIs) starting School Year 2016-2017, the DepED shall engage in partnerships with HEIs and TVIs for the utilization of the latter's human and physical resources. Moreover, the DepED, the CHED, the TESDA, the TVIs and the HEIs shall coordinate closely with one another to implement strategies that ensure the academic, physical, financial, and human resource capabilities of HEIs and TVIs to provide educational and training services for graduates of the enhanced basic education program to ensure that they are not adversely affected. The faculty of HEIs and TVIs allowed to teach students of secondary education under Section 8 hereof, shall be given priority in hiring for the duration of the transition period.

The fact that the <i>K to 12 Law</i> did not have any provision on labor does not make said law incomplete. The purpose of permissible delegation to administrative agencies is for the latter to "implement the broad policies laid down in a statute by 'filling in' the details which the Congress may not have the opportunity or competence to provide."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[152]</sup> With the proliferation of specialized activities and their attendant peculiar problems, the legislature has found it necessary to entrust to administrative agencies, who are supposed to be experts in the particular fields assigned to them, the authority to provide direct and efficacious solutions to these problems.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[153]</sup> This is effected by the promulgation of supplementary regulations, such as the <i>K to 12 IRR</i> jointly issued by the DepEd, CHED and TESDA and the Joint Guidelines issued in coordination with DOLE, to address in detail labor and management rights relevant to implementation of the <i>K to 12 Law</i>.</p><p> <b><i>DO No. 31 is valid and enforceable</i></b> </p><p> Petitioners also claim that DO No. 31 is a usurpation of legislative authority as it creates a law without delegation of power.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[154]</sup> According to petitioners, DO No. 31, which changed the curriculum and added two (2) more years to basic education, has no statutory basis.

This all-comprehensive definition provides ample room for the State to meet the exigencies of the times depending on the conditions and circumstances. As the Court eruditely explained in <i>Basco v. Philippine Amusements and Gaming Corp</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[164]</sup> (<i>Basco</i>): </p><blockquote> <p> The concept of police power is well-established in this jurisdiction. It has been defined as the "state authority to enact legislation that may interfere with personal liberty or property in order to promote the general welfare." (Edu v. Ericta, 35 SCRA 481, 487) As defined, it consists of (1) an imposition or restraint upon liberty or property, (2) in order to foster the common good. It is not capable of an exact definition but has been, purposely, veiled in general terms to underscore its all-comprehensive embrace. (Philippine Association of Service Exporters, Inc. v. Drilon, 163 SCRA 386). </p> <p> Its scope, ever-expanding to meet the exigencies of the times, even to anticipate the future where it could be done, provides enough room for an efficient and flexible response to conditions and circumstances thus assuming the greatest benefits. (Edu v. Ericta, <em>supra</em>).</p> <p> It finds no specific Constitutional grant for the plain reason that it does not owe its origin to the charter. Along with the taxing power and eminent domain, it is inborn in the very fact of statehood and sovereignty. It is a fundamental attribute of government that has enabled it to perform the most vital functions of governance. Marshall, to whom the expression has been credited, refers to it succinctly as the plenary power of the state "to govern its citizens". (Tribe, American Constitutional Law, 323, 1978). The police power of the State is a power co-extensive with self-protection and is most aptly termed the "law of overwhelming necessity." (Rubi v.

The State has an interest in prescribing regulations to promote the education and the general welfare of the people. In <em>Wisconsin v.

Yoder</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[173]</sup> where the question was the validity of a statute criminalizing the failure of parents to allow their children to attend compulsory high school education, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that although the State's interest in universal education is highly ranked in terms of State functions, this does not free this exercise of State function from the balancing process when it impinges on fundamental rights and interests, specifically the Free Exercise Clause, thus: </p><blockquote> <p> There is no doubt as to the power of a State, having a high responsibility for education of its citizens, to impose reasonable regulations for the control and duration of basic education. See, e.g., Pierce v Society of Sisters, 268 US 510, 534, 69 L Ed 1070, 1077, 45 S Ct 571, 39 ALR 468 (1925). Providing public schools ranks at the very apex of the function of a State. Yet even this paramount responsibility was, in Pierce, made to yield to the right of parents to provide an equivalent education in a privately operated system. There the Court held that Oregon's statute compelling attendance in a public school from age eight to age 16 unreasonably interfered with the interest of parents in directing the rearing of their offspring, including their education in church-operated schools. As that case suggests, the values of parental direction of the religious upbringing and education of their children in their early and formative years have a high place in our society. See also Ginsberg v New York, 390 US 629, 639 20 L Ed 2d 195, 203, 88 S Ct 1274 (1968); Meyer v Nebraska, 262 US 390, 67 L Ed 1042, 43 S Ct 625, 29 ALR 1446 (1923); cf.

DE CASTRO. Just a matter of clarification. On the first sentence, we use Filipino as an official medium of communication in all branches of government. Is that correct? </p> <p>MR. VILLACORTA. Yes. </p> <p>MR. DE CASTRO. And when we speak of Filipino, can it be a combination of Tagalog and the local dialect, and, therefore, can be "Taglish"? Is that right? </p> <p>MR. VILLACORTA. Not really "Taglish," Madam President. </p> <p>MR. BENNAGEN. It can be standard. </p> <p>MR. DE CASTRO. Or the combination of the local language and Tagalog? </p> <p>MR. VILLACORTA. As it naturally evolves. </p> <p>MR. DE CASTRO. Suppose I am a Muslim official from Sulu and I will use Filipino in my communication. So I will write: "Di makadiari ang iniisip mo." It is a combination of Tausog — "di makadiari" and Tagalog — "ang iniisip mo." The one receiving in the main office may not understand the whole thing. I am just clarifying because when we use Filipino as a medium of official communication, there is a possibility that the message may not be understood when it reaches the central office or when it goes to another area. </p> <p> MR. VILLACORTA. That is why the wording is, "The government shall take steps to initiate and sustain the use of Filipino." And in Section 1, it says: "as it evolves, it shall be further developed and enriched," the implication being that it will be standardized as a national language. </p> <p> MR. DE CASTRO. Yes, but then in Section 2, we come out with Filipino as a medium of official communication. I am just giving an example that as an official communication, it may not be understood by the one at the receiving end, especially if one comes from the South and whose message is received in the North or in the center. As I said, "Di makadiari ang iniisip mo," is half Tausog and half Tagalog. </p> <p> MR. VILLACORTA. Commissioner Bennagen, who is an expert on culture and minorities, will answer the question of the Gentleman.</p> <p> MR. BENNAGEN.

DE CASTRO. In short? </p> <p>MR. BENNAGEN. The work will codify this national <em>lingua franca</em> as it is taking place and will be subjected to other developmental activities. </p> <p>MR. OPLE.

I just wanted to point out that when the words "official communication'' is used, this must satisfy the standards of accuracy, precision and, perhaps, clarity or lack of ambiguity; otherwise, it will not be communication. One can lose a war through imprecise communication in government and, therefore, I think the word "communication" should be understood in its correct light — that when one writes from Sulu, as in the example given by Commissioner de Castro, he has to consider the following: Is his communication clear? Is it unambiguous? Is it precise? I just want to point out that when we speak of official communication, these normal standards of good communication ought to be recognized as controlling, otherwise, the interest of public administration will be vitally affected. </p> <p> Thank you, Madam President. </p> <p>THE PRESIDENT. Shall we vote now on the first sentence? </p> <p>MR. RODRIGO. I think it should be on the first two sentences. </p> <p>THE PRESIDENT. There was a suggestion, and that was accepted by the committee, to vote on the first sentence. </p> <p>MR. RODRIGO. Only on the first sentence? But there are two sentences.</p> <p> THE PRESIDENT. No, that was already approved. </p> <p>MR. VILLACORTA. Madam President, may I ask for a vote now because this has been extensively discussed. </p> <p>THE PRESIDENT. Will the chairman read what is to be voted upon? </p> <p>MR. VILLACORTA.

National Labor Relations Commission</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[192]</sup> (<em>Agabon</em>) as not self-executory. Reiterating <em>Agabon</em>, the Court explained in <em>Serrano v. Gallant Maritime Services, Inc</em>.,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[193]</sup> that Section 3, Article XIII, does not automatically confer judicially demandable and enforceable rights and cannot, on its own, be a basis for a declaration of unconstitutionality, to wit: </p><blockquote> <p> While all the provisions of the 1987 Constitution are presumed self-executing, there are some which this Court has declared not <b><i>judicially enforceable</i></b>, Article XIII being one, particularly Section 3 thereof, the nature of which, this Court, in Agabon v. National Labor Relations Commission, has described to be not self-actuating: </p> <blockquote> <p> Thus, the constitutional mandates of protection to labor and security of tenure may be deemed as self-executing in the sense that these are automatically acknowledged and observed without need for any enabling legislation. However, to declare that the constitutional provisions are enough to guarantee the full exercise of the rights embodied therein, and the realization of ideals therein expressed, would be impractical, if not unrealistic. The espousal of such view presents the dangerous tendency of being overbroad and exaggerated. The guarantees of "full protection to labor" and "security of tenure", when examined in isolation, are facially unqualified, and the broadest interpretation possible suggests a blanket shield in favor of labor against any form of removal regardless of circumstance. This interpretation implies an unimpeachable right to continued employment — a utopian notion, doubtless — but still hardly within the contemplation of the framers. Subsequent legislation is still needed to define the parameters of these guaranteed rights to ensure the protection and promotion, not only the rights of the labor sector, but of the employers' as well. Without specific and pertinent legislation, judicial bodies will be at a loss, formulating their own conclusion to approximate at least the aims of the Constitution. </p> <p> <b><i>Ultimately, therefore, Section 3 of Article XIII cannot, on its own, be a source of a positive enforceable right</i></b> to stave off the dismissal of an employee for just cause owing to the failure to serve proper notice or hearing. As manifested by several framers of the 1987 Constitution, the provisions on social justice require legislative enactments for their enforceability. (Emphasis added) </p> </blockquote> <p> Thus, Section 3, Article XIII cannot be treated as a principal source of direct enforceable rights, for the violation of which the questioned clause may be declared unconstitutional. It may unwittingly risk opening the floodgates of litigation to every worker or union over every conceivable violation of so broad a concept as social justice for labor. </p> <p> It must be stressed that Section 3, Article XIII does not directly bestow on the working class any actual enforceable right, but merely clothes it with the status of a sector for whom the Constitution urges protection through executive or legislative action and <b><i>judicial recognition</i></b>. Its utility is best limited to being an impetus not just for the executive and legislative departments, but for the judiciary as well, to protect the welfare of the working class. And it was in fact consistent with that constitutional agenda that the Court in <em>Central Bank (now Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas) Employee Association, Inc. v. Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas</em>, penned by then Associate Justice now Chief Justice Reynato S. Puno, formulated the judicial precept that when the challenge to a statute is premised on the perpetuation of prejudice against persons favored by the Constitution with special protection — such as the working class or a section thereof — the Court may recognize the existence of a suspect classification and subject the same to strict judicial scrutiny.</p> <p> The view that the concepts of suspect classification and strict judicial scrutiny formulated in <em>Central Bank Employee Association</em> exaggerate the significance of Section 3, Article XIII is a groundless apprehension. <em>Central Bank</em> applied Article XIII in conjunction with the equal protection clause. Article XIII, by itself, without the application of the equal protection clause, has no life or force of its own as elucidated in <em>Agabon</em>. <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[194]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Here, apart from bare allegations that the <i>K to 12 Law</i> does not provide mechanisms to protect labor, which, as discussed, have no legal bases, petitioners have not proffered other bases in claiming that the right to protect labor and/or security of tenure was violated with the implementation of the <i>K to 12 Law</i>.

In BP Blg. 232, the elementary and secondary education were considered to be the stage where basic education is provided.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[204]</sup> Subsequently, in RA No. 9155, the inclusion of elementary and high school education as part of basic education was affirmed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[205]</sup></p><p> The legislature, through the <em>Kindergarten Education Act</em>, further amended the definition of basic education to include kindergarten. Thereafter, the legislature expanded basic education to include an additional two (2) years of senior high school. Thus, by then, basic education comprised of thirteen (13) years, divided into one (1) year of kindergarten, six (6) years of elementary education, and six (6) years of secondary education — which was divided into four (4) years of junior high school and two (2) years of senior high school. </p><p> The Constitution did not curtail the legislature's power to determine the extent of basic education.

(Emphasis and underscoring supplied) </li></ol> <p> There is absolutely nothing in Article 26 that would show that the State is prohibited from making kindergarten and high school compulsory. The UDHR provided a minimum standard for States to follow. Congress complied with this minimum standard; as, in fact, it went beyond the minimum by making kindergarten and high school compulsory. This action of Congress is, in turn, consistent with Article 41 of the CRC which provides that "[n]othing in the present Convention shall affect any provisions which are more conducive to the realization of the rights of the child and which may be contained in: (a) [t]he law of a State party; or (b) [i]nternational law in force for that State.''</p><p> The enactment of the <i>K to 12 Law</i> was the manner by which the Congress sought to realize the right to education of its citizens. It is indeed laudable that Congress went beyond the minimum standards and provided mechanisms so that its citizens are able to obtain not just elementary education but also kindergarten and high school. Absent any showing of a violation of any Constitutional self-executing right or any international law, the Court cannot question the desirability, wisdom, or utility of the <i>K to 12 Law</i> as this is best addressed by the wisdom of Congress. As the Court held in <em>Tablarin v. Gutierrez</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[207]</sup>: </p><blockquote> <p>x x x The petitioners also urge that the NMAT prescribed in MECS Order No. 52, s. 1985, is an "unfair, unreasonable and inequitable requirement," which results in a denial of due process. Again, petitioners have failed to specify just what factors or features of the NMAT render it "unfair" and "unreasonable" or "inequitable." They appear to suggest that passing the NMAT is an unnecessary requirement when added on top of the admission requirements set out in Section 7 of the Medical Act of 1959, and other admission requirements established by internal regulations of the various medical schools, public or private. Petitioners' arguments thus appear to relate to utility and wisdom or desirability of the NMAT requirement. But constitutionality is essentially a question of power or authority: this Court has neither commission nor competence to pass upon questions of the desirability or wisdom or utility of legislation or administrative regulation. Those questions must be addressed to the political departments of the government not to the courts.</p> <p> There is another reason why the petitioners' arguments must fail: the legislative and administrative provisions impugned by them constitute, to the mind of the Court, a valid exercise of the police power of the state. The police power, it is commonplace learning, is the pervasive and non-waivable power and authority of the sovereign to secure and promote all the important interests and needs — in a word, the public order — of the general community. An important component of that public order is the health and physical safety and well being of the population, the securing of which no one can deny is a legitimate objective of governmental effort and regulation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[208]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Petitioners also claim that the K to 12 basic education and the two (2) additional years in high school should not have been applied retroactively in violation of Article 4 of the Civil Code.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[209]</sup> Petitioners assert that students who had already began schooling prior to 2013 or upon the passage of the <i>K to 12 Law</i> already acquired a "vested right" to graduate after the completion of four (4) years of high school, pursuant to Sections 9(2) and 20 of BP Blg. 232; thus, the K to 12 BEC cannot be applied to them.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[210]</sup></p><p> Again, petitioners' contentions are without merit.</p><p> The K to 12 Basic Education Program is not being retroactively applied because only those currently enrolled at the time the <i>K to 12 Law</i> took effect and future students will be subject to the K to 12 BEC and the additional two (2) years of senior high school. Students who already graduated from high school under the old curriculum are not required by the <i>K to 12 Law</i> to complete the additional two (2) years of senior high school. </p><p> More importantly, BP Blg. 232 does not confer any vested right to four (4) years of high school education.

The right must be absolute, complete, and unconditional, independent of a contingency, and a mere expectancy of future benefit, or a contingent interest in property founded on anticipated continuance of existing laws, does not constitute a vested right.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[211]</sup> Contrary to petitioners' assertion, the rights of students under Section 9 of BP Blg. 232 are not absolute. These are subject to limitations prescribed by law and regulations. In fact, while Section 9(2) of BP Blg. 232 states that students have the right to continue their course up to graduation, Section 20 of the same law does not restrict elementary and high school education to only six (6) and four (4) years. Even RA No. 9155 or the <em>Governance of Basic Education Act of 2001</em>, which was enacted under the 1987 Philippine Constitution, does not specify the number of years in elementary and high school. In other words, BP Blg. 232 or RA No. 9155 does not preclude any amendment or repeal on the duration of elementary and high school education. In adding two (2) years of secondary education to students who have not yet graduated from high school, Congress was merely exercising its police power and legislative wisdom in imposing reasonable regulations for the control and duration of basic education, in compliance with its constitutional duty to promote quality education for all. </p><p><u>Right to select a profession or course of study</u> </p><p> Petitioners in G.R. No. 218123 insist that the implementation of the <i>K to 12 Law</i> is a limitation on the right of senior high school students to choose their professions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[212]</sup> For petitioners, a number of prospective senior high school students will be unable to choose their profession or vocation because of the limit on what senior high schools can offer and the availability of the different strands. This lacks basis.</p><p> There is no conflict between the <i>K to 12 Law</i> and its IRR and the right of the senior high school students to choose their profession or course of study. The senior high school curriculum is designed in such a way that students have core subjects and thereafter, they may choose among four strands: 1) Accountancy, Business and Management (ABM) Strand; 2) Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) Strand; 3) Humanities and Social Sciences (HUMSS) Strand; and 4) General Academic (GA) Strand.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[213]</sup></p><p> Petitioners have failed to show that the State has imposed unfair and inequitable conditions for senior high schools to enroll in their chosen path. The K to 12 Program is precisely designed in such a way that students may choose to enroll in public or private senior high schools which offer the strands of their choice. For eligible students, the voucher program also allows indigent senior high school students to enroll in private institutions that offer the strands of their choice.</p><p> <u>Mother Tongue as medium of instruction</u></p><p> Petitioners argue that the use of the MT or the regional or native language as primary medium of instruction for kindergarten and the first three (3) years of elementary education contravenes Section 7, Article XIV of the 1987 Philippine Constitution, which expressly limits and constrains regional languages simply as auxiliary media of instruction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[214]</sup> This is an argument of first blush. A closer look at the pertinent provisions of the Constitution and the deliberations of the Constitutional Commission reveal the contrary. In fine, there is no conflict between the use of the MT as a primary medium of instruction and Section 7, Article XIV of the 1987 Philippine Constitution.</p><p> Sections 6 and 7, Article XIV of the 1987 Philippine Constitution provides: </p><blockquote> <p> SEC. 6. The national language of the Philippines is Filipino. As it evolves, it shall be further developed and enriched on the basis of existing Philippine and other languages. </p> <p> Subject to provisions of law and as the Congress may deem appropriate, the Government shall take steps to initiate and sustain the use of Filipino as a medium of official communication and as language of instruction in the educational system. </p> <p> SEC. 7. For purposes of communication and instruction, the official languages of the Philippines are Filipino and, until otherwise provided by law, English. </p> <p> The regional languages are the auxiliary official languages in the regions and shall serve as auxiliary media of instruction therein. </p> </blockquote> <p> The deliberations of the Constitutional Commission also confirm that MT or regional languages may be used as a medium of instruction: </p><blockquote> <p> MR. SUAREZ. Thank you, Madam President. When the Commissioner speaks of auxiliary official languages in their respective regions, what exactly does he have in mind? </p> <p>MR. BENNAGEN. <b><u>In addition to Filipino and English, they can be accepted also as official languages, even</u></b> in government and <b><u>in education.</u></b> </p> <p>MR. SUAREZ. <b><u>So that not only will they be a medium of instruction or communication but they can be considered also as official languages.</u></b></p> <p> MR. BENNAGEN.

May I be enlightened on some of the aspects of this proposed substitute amendment? The first is, does it follow from the wording that the regional languages shall serve as an auxiliary media of instruction and no law can prohibit their use as such? This means that subject to provisions of law and as Congress may deem appropriate, it would refer only to what are included in the first sentence. It will not apply to the second sentence relating to regional languages as auxiliary media of instruction.</p> <p> MR. TREÑAS. That is correct. Precisely, there is a period after "educational system" and that is a new sentence. </p> <p>MR. DAVIDE. <b><u>As an auxiliary medium of instruction, it can actually be the primary medium, until Congress shall provide otherwise.</u></b> </p> <p>MR. TREÑAS. It shall be auxiliary. </p> <p>MR. DAVIDE. But in the meantime that Congress shall not have deemed appropriate or that there is no provision of law relating to the use of Filipino as the medium of instruction, <b><u>it can itself be the primary medium of instruction in the regions.</u></b> </p> <p>MR. TREÑAS. That is correct because of the provision of the first sentence. </p> <p>MR. DAVIDE. On the supposition that there is already a law that Congress had deemed it appropriate, the regional language shall go hand in hand with Filipino as a medium of instruction. It cannot be supplanted in any way by Filipino as the only medium of instruction in the regional level. </p> <p> x x x x </p> </blockquote> <p align="center">VOTING </p><blockquote> <p> x x x x </p> <p>MR.

Section 2 of the committee report states: </p> <blockquote> <p>The official languages of the Philippines are Filipino and English, until otherwise provided by law.

I believe we should consider the first sentence of Section 2 and then say: "THE REGIONAL LANGUAGES SHALL SERVE AS AUXILIARY MEDIA OF INSTRUCTION IN THE RESPECTIVE REGIONS." That is my proposal.</p> <p> THE PRESIDENT. In other words, the Commissioner's point is that this particular second sentence here should be transposed to Section 2 of the other committee report.</p> <p> MR. PADILLA. Yes, Madam President.</p> <p> THE PRESIDENT. What does the committee say? </p> <p>REV. RIGOS. Madam President, perhaps if we approve the second sentence, we can delete the second sentence in Section 2. Is that the idea? </p> <p>MR. PADILLA. That is correct. </p> <p>REV. RIGOS. Since we are talking about medium of instruction here, we would rather retain it in the first section. </p> <p>MR. PADILLA. Madam President, but if no mention is made of English, it might be the impression contrary to what has already been agreed upon — that English may not be used as a medium of instruction. <b><u>And it shall be clear that the first preference is Filipino, the national language, without prejudice to the use of English and also the regional languages.</u></b> </p> <p>REV. RIGOS. Madam President, do we understand the Commissioner correctly that he would rather delete that in the first section and amend the second sentence in Section 2? </p> <p>MR. PADILLA. Yes, Madam President. That is the reason I suggested that the proposal be divided into two sentences. We approved the first sentence. The second sentence should be corrected to Section 2 of the committee report.</p> <p> MR. VILLACORTA. Madam President, the committee is divided; therefore, we would like the floor to decide on this matter.</p> <p> MR. PADILLA. <b><u>The only reason I am saying this is to make clear in the Constitution that the medium of communication and the language of instruction are not only Filipino as a national language, and that the medium of instruction is the regional languages, otherwise, there would be no mention of English.

It is evident that Congress has the power to enact a law that designates Filipino as the primary medium of instruction even in the regions but, in the absence of such law, the regional languages may be used as primary media of instruction. The Congress, however, opted not to enact such law. On the contrary, the Congress, in the exercise of its wisdom, provided that the regional languages shall be the primary media of instruction in the early stages of schooling. Verily, this act of Congress was not only Constitutionally permissible, but was likewise an exercise of an exclusive prerogative to which the Court cannot interfere with.</p><p> Petitioners further contend that the MTB-MLE is counter-productive, anti-developmental and does not serve the people's right to quality of education, which the State, under the Constitution, is mandated to promote.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[217]</sup> Moreover, in contrast to the benefits of the MTB-MLE that respondents assert, petitioners claim that comparative international and domestic data have shown MT monolingualism to be inferior; while high literacy and proficiency in English indicates human development, makes people more globally competitive and relatively happier.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[218]</sup></p><p> Petitioners' arguments are again misplaced. While the Constitution indeed mandates the State to provide quality education, the determination of what constitutes quality education is best left with the political departments who have the necessary knowledge, expertise, and resources to determine the same. The deliberations of the Constitutional Commission again are very instructive: </p><blockquote> <p> Now, Madam President, <strong>we have added the word "quality" before "education" to send appropriate signals to the government </strong>that, in the exercise of its supervisory and regulatory powers, it <strong>should first set satisfactory minimum requirements in all areas: curriculum</strong>, faculty, internal administration, library, laboratory class and other facilities, et cetera, and it should see to it that satisfactory minimum requirements are met by all educational institutions, both public and private.</p> <p> <b>When we speak of quality education we have in mind such matters, among others, as curriculum development</b>, development of learning resources and instructional materials, upgrading of library and laboratory facilities, innovations in educational technology and teaching methodologies, improvement of research quality, and others. Here and in many other provisions on education, the principal focus of attention and concern is the students. I would like to say that in my view there is a slogan when we speak of quality of education that I feel we should be aware of, which is, "Better than ever is not enough." In other words, even if the quality of education is good now, we should attempt to keep on improving it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[219]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> Clearly, when the government, through the <i>K to 12 Law</i> and the DepEd issuances, determined that the use of MT as primary medium of instruction until Grade 3 constitutes a better curriculum, it was working towards discharging its constitutional duty to provide its citizens with quality education. The Court, even in the exercise of its jurisdiction to check if another branch of the government committed grave abuse of discretion, will not supplant such determination as it pertains to the wisdom of the policy. </p><p> Petitioners in G.R. No. 218045 also claim that the provision on the use of MT violates the natural and primary right and duty of parents in the rearing of the youth, recognized under Section 12, Article II of the 1987 Philippine Constitution. Petitioners aver that by using the MT in teaching the students, it compels parents to do something utterly redundant, inefficient, and wasteful, as the students are presumably already fluent in speaking their MT.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[220]</sup> In other words, they no longer need to be taught their native language.</p><p> Petitioners are once again incorrect as there is no conflict between the use of MT as a primary medium of instruction and the right of parents in rearing their children.</p><p> While Section 12, Article II grants parents the primary right to rear and educate their children, the State, as <em>parens patriae</em>, has the inherent right and duty to support parents in the exercise of this constitutional right. In other words, parents' authority and the State's duty are not mutually exclusive but complement each other.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[221]</sup> In the matter of education, a parent is always the first teacher. The language first learned by the child or his "mother tongue", which the child understands best and hence, an effective tool for further learning, is first and foremost taught by the parent. The inclusion in the K to 12 Program of the MT as a medium of instruction and a subject in the early years of learning is, therefore, not intended to curtail the parents' right but to complement and enhance the same. </p><p> Moreover, despite the provision on the use of MT as primary medium of instruction for kindergarten and Grades 1 to 3, Filipino and English remain as subjects in the curriculum during the earlier stages of schooling and will later on be used as primary medium of instruction from Grade 4 onwards. In other words, in addition to the MT, the basics of Filipino and English will still be taught at the early stages of formal schooling; and should the parents, in the exercise of their primary right and duty to rear their children, so desire to give additional Filipino and English lessons to their children, they have the absolute right to do so. Nothing in the <i>K to 12 Law</i> prohibits the parents from doing so.</p><p> <u>Academic freedom</u></p><p> Petitioners in G.R. No. 216930 also allege that faculty from HEI stand to lose their academic freedom when they are transferred to senior high school level as provided in the <i>K to 12 Law</i>, the <i>K to 12 Law</i><em> IRR </em>and the Joint Guidelines.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[222]</sup> </p><p> Without question, petitioners, who are faculty members in HEIs, indeed possess the academic freedom granted by Constitution. This Court, in its previous decisions, has defined academic freedom for the individual member of the academe as "the right of a faculty member to pursue his studies in his particular specialty and thereafter to make known or publish the result of his endeavors without fear that retribution would be visited on him in the event that his conclusions are found distasteful or objectionable to the powers that be, whether in the political, economic, or academic establishments."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[223]</sup> </p><p> However, the Court does not agree with petitioners that their transfer to the secondary level, as provided by the <i>K to 12 Law</i> and the assailed issuances, constitutes a violation of their academic freedom. While the Court agrees, in principle, that security of tenure is an important aspect of academic freedom — that the freedom is only meaningful if the faculty members are assured that they are free to pursue their academic endeavors without fear of reprisals — it is likewise equally true that convergence of security of tenure and academic freedom does not preclude the termination of a faculty member for a valid cause.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[224]</sup> Civil servants, like petitioners, may be removed from service for a valid cause, such as when there is a <em>bona fide</em> reorganization, or a position has been abolished or rendered redundant, or there is a need to merge, divide, or consolidate positions in order to meet the exigencies of the service.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[225]</sup> Hence, petitioners' contention that the law is unconstitutional based on this ground is specious. </p><table width="40%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><u>Free public education in the elementary and high school levels</u> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>Petitioners claim that making kindergarten compulsory limits access to education;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[226]</sup> that 400,000 to 500,000 Grade 11 students will be forced to enroll in private schools, pushed by government towards a more expensive, not free education;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[227]</sup> and that there will be a <i>de facto</i> privatization of senior high school education (through the voucher system) and that this is a violation of the constitutional provision mandating free high school education.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[228]</sup> </p><p> The OSG counters that the Senior High School Voucher program (subsidy given to those who will enroll in non-DepEd schools) does not force students to enroll in private SHS. It simply offers a viable alternative to both student and government — to the student, a subsidized private education; and to the government, decongested public schools.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[229]</sup></p><p> The Court fully agrees with the OSG. </p><p> Petitioners' argument that the establishment of the voucher system will result in the <em>de facto</em> privatization of senior high school is not only speculative, it is also without any basis. The voucher system is one of the mechanisms established by the State through RA No. 6728, otherwise known as the <em>Government Assistance to Students and Teachers in Private Education Act.</em> In <em>Mariño, Jr. v. Gamilla</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[230]</sup> the Court recognized that RA No. 6728 was enacted in view of the declared policy of the State, in conformity with the mandate of the Constitution, to promote and make quality education accessible to all Filipino citizens, as well as the recognition of the State of the complementary roles of public and private educational institutions in the educational system and the invaluable contribution that the private schools have made and will make to education."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[231]</sup> Through the law, the State provided "the mechanisms to improve quality in private education by maximizing the use of existing resources of private education x x x."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[232]</sup> One of these is the voucher system where underprivileged high school students become eligible for full or partial scholarship for degree or vocational/technical courses. </p><p> The program was later expanded through RA No. 8545. In the <i>K to 12 Law</i>, the benefits under RA No. 8545, including the voucher system, were made applicable to qualified students under the enhanced basic education, specifically to the qualified students enrolled in senior high school.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[233]</sup></p><p> The establishment and expansion of the voucher system is the State's way of tapping the resources of the private educational system in order to give Filipinos equal access to quality education. The Court finds that this manner of implementing the grant of equal access to education is not constitutionally infirm. </p><p> <b><i>CMO No. 20 is constitutional</i></b></p><p> Petitioners assert that CMO No. 20 is violative of the Constitution because the study of Filipino, <em>Panitikan</em> and the Philippine Constitution are not included as core subjects. </p><p> The Court disagrees.</p><p> <em>First</em>, the constitutional provisions alleged by petitioners to be violated are non-self-executing provisions. As discussed above, the framers of the Constitution, in discussing Section 6 of Article XIV, explained that the use of Filipino as a medium of official communication is still subject to provisions of law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[234]</sup> </p><p> In <i>Knights of Rizal v. DMCI Homes, Inc.</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[235]</sup> the Court held that Section 15 on arts and culture of Article XIV is not self-executory because Congress passed laws dealing with the preservation and conservation of our cultural heritage.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[236]</sup> The Court was of the view that all sections in Article XIV pertaining to arts and culture are all non-self-executing, which includes Section 14 on Filipino national culture and Section 18 on access to cultural opportunities. The Court in <em>Basco</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[237]</sup> also ruled that Section 17, Article II on giving priority to education, science and technology, arts, culture, and sports, and Section 2, Article XIV on educational values, are non-self-executing. </p><p> Thus, the Court reiterates that these constitutional provisions are only policies that may be "used by the judiciary as aids or as guides in the exercise of its power of judicial review, and by the legislature in its enactment of laws."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[238]</sup> The Court reiterates that they do not embody judicially enforceable constitutional rights.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[239]</sup></p><p> <i>Second</i>, it is misleading for petitioners to allege that there is a violation of the constitutional provisions for the simple reason that the study of Filipino, <em>Panitikan</em> and the Constitution are actually found in the basic education curriculum from Grade 1 to 10 and senior high school. To be sure, the changes in the GE curriculum were implemented to ensure that there would be no duplication of subjects in Grade 1 to 10, senior high school and college. Thus, the allegation of petitioners that CMO No. 20 "removed" the study of Filipino, <em>Panitikan</em> and the Constitution in the GE curriculum is incorrect. </p><p> As regards Section 3(1), Article XIV on the requirement that all educational institutions shall include the study of the Constitution as part of the curricula, the deliberations of the Constitutional Commission confirm that the intention was for it to be constitutionally mandated. The Court agrees that there is indeed a constitutional mandate that the study of the Constitution should be part of the curriculum of educational institutions. However, the mandate was general and did not specify the educational level in which it must be taught. Hence, the inclusion of the study of the Constitution in the basic education curriculum satisfies the constitutional requirement.</p><p> In this regard, it must be emphasized that CMO No. 20 only provides for the <b><u>minimum standards</u></b> for the GE component of all degree programs. Under Section 13 of RA No. 7722 or the <em>Higher Education Act of 1994</em>, the CHED is authorized to determine the (<em>a</em>) minimum unit requirements for specific academic programs; (<em>b</em>) <strong>general education distribution requirements as may be determined by the Commission</strong>; and (<em>c</em>) specific professional subjects as may be stipulated by the various licensing entities. The provision further provides that this authority shall not be construed as limiting the academic freedom of universities and colleges. Therefore, HEIs are given the freedom to require additional Filipino or <em>Panitikan</em> courses to these minimum requirements if they wish to. </p><p> <em>Third</em>, petitioners aver that non-inclusion of these subjects in the GE curriculum will result to job displacement of teachers and professors, which contravenes the constitutional provisions on protection of labor and security of tenure. Once more, Section 3, Article XIII and Section 18, Article II do not automatically confer judicially demandable and enforceable rights and cannot, on their own, be a basis for a declaration of unconstitutionality. Further, the Court finds that, in fact, teachers and professors were given the opportunity to participate in the various consultations and decision-making processes affecting their rights as workers.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[240]</sup> </p><table width="40%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><b><i>CMO No. 20 does not contravene any other laws</i></b> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>As claimed by petitioners, CMO No. 20 violated Section 14 of RA No. 7104 or the <em>Commission on the Filipino Language Act</em> because it interfered with the authority of the Commission on the Filipino Language (CFL) on matters of language. Petitioners reiterate that it is the CFL who has the authority to <em>formulate policies, plans and programs to ensure the further development, enrichment, propagation and preservation of Filipino and other Philippine language</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[241]</sup> and thus, CMO No. 20 should have retained the nine (9) units of Filipino in the GE curriculum, as proposed by the CFL. </p><p> Petitioners also aver that CMO No. 20 violates RA No. 7356 or the <em>Law Creating the National Commission for Culture and the Arts</em> because the non-inclusion of Filipino and <em>Panitikan</em> as subjects in the GE curriculum is a violation of our "duty x x x to preserve and conserve the Filipino historical and cultural heritage and resources."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[242]</sup> </p><p> Lastly, petitioners allege that CMO No. 20 violates BP Blg. 232 or the <em>Education Act of 1982</em>, specifically, Section 3 on the role of the educational community to promote the social and economic status of all school personnel and Section 23 on the objectives of tertiary education which includes a general education program that will promote national identity and cultural consciousness. </p><p> Again, the Court disagrees.</p><p> It must be noted that nothing in these laws requires that <em>Filipino</em> and <em>Panitikan</em> must be included as subjects in the tertiary level. Further, as already established, it is within the authority of the CHED to determine the GE distribution requirements. The Court also reiterates that the study of <em>Filipino</em> and <em>Panitikan</em> can easily be included as courses in the tertiary level, if the HEIs wish to. Thus, petitioners' arguments that CMO No. 20 violates the aforementioned laws must fail. </p><p align="center"> <b>III.</b> </p><table width="40%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><b><i>The <i>K to 12 Law</i> does not violate substantive due process and equal protection of the laws.</i></b> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>Petitioners also assert that the <i>K to 12 Law</i> is unconstitutional for violating the due process clause, as the means employed is allegedly not proportional to the end to be achieved, and that there is supposedly an alternative and less intrusive way of accomplishing the avowed objectives of the law. They point to studies which showed that lengthening the time did not necessarily lead to better student performance. They further assert that "[g]iven adequate instruction, armed with sufficient books, and a conducive learning environment, the Filipino student does not need at all two (2) additional years of senior high school" and hence the imposition of additional years in senior high school is "unduly oppressive an unwarranted intrusion into the right to education of all Filipino students, thus violating their right to substantive due process."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[243]</sup> In addition, they claim that the assailed law is violative of the due process clause because, allegedly, the law served the interests of only a select few.

There is no conflict between the <i>K to 12 Law</i> and right of due process of the students.</p><p> It is established that due process is comprised of two components, namely, substantive due process which requires the intrinsic validity of the law in interfering with the rights of the person to his life, liberty, or property, and procedural due process which consists of the two basic rights of notice and hearing, as well as the guarantee of being heard by an impartial and competent tribunal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[245]</sup></p><p> Substantive due process, the aspect of due process invoked in this case, requires an inquiry on the intrinsic validity of the law in interfering with the rights of the person to his property.

(Emphasis supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> All students are intended to benefit from the law. Without ruling on the effectiveness of the revised curriculum, it is erroneous to view the <i>K to 12 Law</i> and the DepEd Orders in question extending basic education by two (2) years simply to comply with international standards; rather, the basic education curriculum was restructured according to what the political departments believed is the best approach to learning, or what they call as the "spiral approach." This approach, according to respondent, will yield the following benefits for all students: (<em>1</em>) it is decongested and offers a more balanced approach to learning; (<em>2</em>) it would help in freeing parents of the burden of having to spend for college just to make their children employable; (<em>3</em>) it would prepare students with life skills that they learn while schooling; (<em>4</em>) it is seamless; (<em>5</em>) it is relevant and responsive, age-appropriate, and focused on making learners succeed in the 21st century; and (<em>6</em>) it is enriched and learner-centered.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[249]</sup> Thus, contrary to the claims of petitioners, the assailed law caters to the interest of the public in general, as opposed to only a particular group of people. </p><p> Furthermore, the means employed by the assailed law are commensurate with its objectives. Again, the restructuring of the curriculum with the corresponding additional years in senior high school were meant to improve the quality of basic education and to make the country's graduates more competitive in the international arena.</p><p> Respondents proffer, and petitioners concede, that the Philippines is the last country to adopt a 12-year basic education curriculum. However, petitioners submit that adding two (2) years in the basic education curriculum is not the answer to achieve these objectives, and that there is supposedly a less intrusive way to achieve these goals, namely, to increase the salaries of the teachers, invest in better and more resource materials, and building of more classrooms to achieve the goal of improving the quality of education in the Philippines. Petitioners ought to be reminded, however, that the objectives of the law are two-pronged. It was meant not only to (<em>1</em>) improve the basic education in the country, but also to (<em>2</em>) make it at par with international standards. It is in this second purpose that the means employed by the assailed law is justified. Thus, having established that the interest of the public in general is at the heart of the law, and that the means employed are commensurate to its objectives, the Court holds that the <i>K to 12 Law</i> is not violative of the due process clause. </p><p> The students of Manila Science High School (MSHS), petitioners in G.R. No. 218465, aver, in particular, that the decongestion of the originally existing basic education curriculum and the lengthening of the basic education cycle do not, and should not, be made to apply to them as their curriculum is supposedly congested on purpose.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[250]</sup> It supposedly should not apply to them because "[they] are gifted and thus are advanced for their age, with the capability to learn better and faster compared to other high school students. Because of their higher mental capabilities, they neither need decongesting nor a longer period of time or any spiral approach, for them to in fact master their heavier in scope and more advanced math and science subjects."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[251]</sup> They are supposedly "not being trained for immediate employment after high school but for them to pursue tertiary education, particularly career paths either as mathematicians, scientists or engineers, which the country needs most for its development."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[252]</sup> This, these petitioners asseverate, makes the means employed by the <i>K to 12 Law</i> not reasonably necessary for the accomplishment of its intended purpose. Thus, as applied to MSHS students, the <i>K to 12 Law</i> is arbitrary, unfair, oppressive, discriminatory and unreasonable and thus violative of their substantive due process. <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[253]</sup> They further allege that the law is violative of the equal protection clause for treating them in the same way as all other high school students when they are supposed to be treated differently for not being similarly situated with the rest.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[254]</sup></p><p> In essence, what these petitioners are saying is that the <i>K to 12 Law</i> did not make a substantial distinction between MSHS students and the rest of the high school students in the country when it, in fact, should have done so.</p><p> This contention is without merit. </p><p> To assure that the general welfare is promoted, which is the end of the law, a regulatory measure may cut into the rights to liberty and property.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[255]</sup> Those adversely affected may invoke the equal protection clause only if they can show that the governmental act assailed, far from being inspired by the attainment of the common goal, was prompted by the spirit of hostility, or at the very least, discrimination that finds no support in reason.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[256]</sup> This, petitioners' failed to sufficiently show. For this reason, the Court holds that the <i>K to 12 Law</i> did not violate petitioners' right to due process nor did it violate the equal protection clause. In <em>JMM Promotion and Management, Inc. v. Court of Appeals</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[257]</sup> the Court explained the object and purpose of the equal protection clause in this wise: </p><blockquote> <p> <b>The equal protection clause is directed principally against undue favor and individual or class privilege.</b> It is not intended to prohibit legislation which is limited to the object to which it is directed or by the territory in which it is to operate. It does not require absolute equality, but merely that <strong>all persons be treated alike under like conditions both as to privileges conferred and liabilities imposed</strong>. We have held, time and again, that the equal protection clause of the Constitution does not forbid classification for so long as such classification is based on real and substantial differences having a reasonable relation to the subject of the particular legislation. If classification is germane to the purpose of the law, concerns all members of the class, and applies equally to present and future conditions, the classification does not violate the equal protection guarantee.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[258]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> To emphasize, valid classifications require<em> real</em> and <em>substantial</em> differences to justify the variance of treatment between the classes. The MSHS students did not offer any substantial basis for the Court to create a valid classification between them and the rest of the high school students in the Philippines. Otherwise stated, the equal protection clause would, in fact, be violated if the assailed law treated the MSHS students differently from the rest of the high school students in the country. </p><p> To be clear, the Court is not saying that petitioners are not gifted, contrary to their claims. The Court is merely saying that the <i>K to 12 Law</i> was not infirm in treating all high school students equally. The MSHS students are, after all, high school students just like all the other students who are, and will be, subjected to the revised curriculum.</p><p> The Court agrees with these petitioners to the extent of their claim that they have the right granted by Article 3(3) and (6) of Presidential Decree No. 603, or the <em>Child and Youth Welfare Code</em>, to education commensurate with their abilities.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[259]</sup> However, the Court disagrees that the said right granted by the <em>Child and Youth Welfare Code </em>was violated when the revised curriculum under the <i>K to 12 Law</i> was applied to them. It bears repeating that the law is being merely applied to the whole segment of the population to which petitioners belong. Further, the basic education under the K to 12 was intended to meet the basic learning needs of the students and it is broad enough to cover alternative learning systems for out-of-school learners and those with special needs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[260]</sup> </p><p> This is not to say that they shall be continually subjected strictly to the K to 12 curriculum which they describe as "inferior," "diluted," and "anemic."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[261]</sup> The <i>K to 12 Law</i> explicitly recognized the right of schools to modify their curricula subject, of course, to the minimum subjects prescribed by the DepEd:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[262]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> SEC. 5. <i>Curriculum Development.</i> — The DepED shall formulate the design and details of the enhanced basic education curriculum. It shall work with the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) to craft harmonized basic and tertiary curricula for the global competitiveness of Filipino graduates. To ensure college readiness and to avoid remedial and duplication of basic education subjects, the DepED shall coordinate with the CHED and the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA).</p> <p> To achieve an effective enhanced basic education curriculum, the DepED shall undertake consultations with other national government agencies and other stakeholders including, but not limited to, the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE), the Professional Regulation Commission (PRC), the private and public schools associations, the national student organizations, the national teacher organizations, the parents-teachers associations and the chambers of commerce on matters affecting the concerned stakeholders.</p> <p> The DepED shall adhere to the following standards and principles in developing the enhanced basic education curriculum:</p> <p> (a) The curriculum shall be learner-centered, inclusive and developmentally appropriate; </p> <p>(b) The curriculum shall be relevant, responsive and research-based; </p> <p>(c) The curriculum shall be culture-sensitive;</p> <p> (d) The curriculum shall be contextualized and global;</p> <p> (e) The curriculum shall use pedagogical approaches that are constructivist, inquiry-based, reflective, collaborative and integrative; </p> <p>(f) The curriculum shall adhere to the principles and framework of Mother Tongue-Based Multilingual Education (MTB-MLE) which starts from where the learners are and from what they already knew proceeding from the known to the unknown; instructional materials and capable teachers to implement the MTB-MLE curriculum shall be available;</p> <p> (g) The curriculum shall use the spiral progression approach to ensure mastery of knowledge and skills after each level; and</p> <p> (h) <b>The curriculum shall be flexible enough to enable and allow schools to</b> localize, indigenize and <b>enhance the same based on their respective educational and social contexts.</b> The production and development of locally produced teaching materials shall be encouraged and approval of these materials shall devolve to the regional and division education units. (Emphasis supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> In fact, the <i>K to 12 IRR</i> confirms the inclusiveness of the design of the Enhanced Basic Education in mandating that the enhanced basic education programs should be able to address the physical, intellectual, psychosocial, and cultural needs of learners.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[263]</sup> The IRR mandates that the Basic Education Program should include programs for the gifted and talented, those with disabilities, the Madrasah Program for Muslim learners, Indigenous Peoples Programs, and Programs for Learners under Difficult Circumstances.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[264]</sup> The <i>K to 12 IRR</i> also allows the acceleration of learners in public and private educational institutions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[265]</sup> Therefore, the remedy of petitioner students is with MSHS and/or DepEd, and not with this Court.</p><p> Petitioners in G.R. No. 218045 also challenge the <i>K to 12 Law</i> on the ground of violation of the equal protection clause by arguing that private schools are allowed to offer extra and optional curriculum subjects in addition to those required by the <i>K to 12 Law</i> and DepEd Orders, and thus, rich families will tend to enroll their children in private schools while poor families will be constrained to enroll their children in English starved public schools.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[266]</sup></p><p> The argument is untenable.</p><p> The Court, no matter how vast its powers are, cannot trample on the previously discussed right of schools to enhance their curricula and the primary right of parents to rear their children, which includes the right to determine which schools are best suited for their children's needs. Even before the passage of the <i>K to 12 Law</i>, private educational institutions had already been allowed to enhance the prescribed curriculum, considering the State's recognition of the complementary roles of public and private institutions in the educational system.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[267]</sup> Hence, the Court cannot sustain petitioners' submission that the assailed law is invalid based on this ground. </p><table width="40%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><b><i>Other arguments against the constitutionality of the K to 12 Law</i></b> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>Petitioners in G.R.

The State shall: </p> <p> (1) Establish, maintain, and support a complete, adequate, and integrated system of education relevant to the needs of the people and society[.]</p> </blockquote> <p> As previously discussed, however, Section 2, Article XIV of the 1987 Philippine Constitution is a non-self-executing provision of the Constitution. Again, as the Court already held in <i>Basco</i>, "Section 2 (Educational Values) of Article XIV of the 1987 [Philippine] Constitution x x x are merely statements of principles and policies. As such, they are basically not self-executing, meaning a law should be passed by Congress to clearly define and effectuate such principles."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[269]</sup> The <i>K to 12 Law</i> is one such law passed by the Legislature to bring the said guiding principle to life. The question of what is 'relevant to the needs of the people and society' is, in turn, within the sole purview of legislative wisdom in which the Court cannot intervene.</p><p> Another assertion against the constitutionality of the <i>K to 12 Law</i> is that it allegedly violates the constitutional State duty to exercise reasonable supervision and regulation of educational institutions mandated by Section 4, Article XIV of the 1987 Constitution. Petitioners in G.R. No. 218123 allege that DepEd's Basic Education Sector Transformation Program (BEST) is supported by Australian Aid and managed by CardNo, a foreign corporation listed in the Australian Securities Exchange. CardNo allegedly hires specialists for the implementation of the K to 12 curriculum.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[270]</sup> This partnership between CardNo and DepEd is allegedly violative of the above Constitutional provision, which reads: </p><blockquote> <p> SEC. 4. (1) The State recognizes the complementary roles of public and private institutions in the educational system and <b>shall exercise reasonable supervision and regulation of all educational institutions.</b> </p> <p> (2) Educational institutions, other than those established by religious groups and mission boards, shall be owned solely by citizens of the Philippines or corporations or associations at least sixty per centum of the capital of which is owned by such citizens.

Upon the dissolution or cessation of the corporate existence of such institutions, their assets shall be disposed of in the manner provided by law. </p> <p> Proprietary educational institutions, including those cooperatively owned, may likewise be entitled to such exemptions subject to the limitations provided by law including restrictions on dividends and provisions for reinvestment. </p> <p> (4) Subject to conditions prescribed by law, all grants, endowments, donations, or contributions used actually, directly, and exclusively for educational purposes shall be exempt from tax. (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> Petitioners point to Section 4(1) and Section 4(2), paragraph 2, as legal basis for the supposed unconstitutionality of the partnership between DepEd and CardNo in the implementation of the K to 12 curriculum. </p><p> Petitioners' reading of the above Constitutional provisions is erroneous. Sections 4(1) and 4(2) deal with two separate matters that the Framers of the Constitution sought to address. Section 4(1) was a provision added by the Framers to crystallize the State's recognition of the importance of the role that the private sector plays in the quality of the Philippine education system. Despite this recognition, the Framers added the second portion of Section 4(2) to emphasize that the State, in the exercise of its police power, still possesses the power of supervision over private schools. The Framers were explicit, however, that this supervision refers to <i>external governance</i>, as opposed to <i>internal governance</i> which was reserved to the respective school boards, thus: </p><blockquote> <p> Madam President, Section 2(b) introduces four changes: one, the addition of the word "reasonable" before the phrase "supervision and regulation"; two, the addition of the word "quality" before the word "education"; three, the change of the wordings in the 1973 Constitution referring to a system of education, requiring the same to be relevant to the goals of national development, to the present expression of "relevant to the needs of the people and society"; and four, the explanation of the meaning of the expression "integrated system of education" by defining the same as the <b>recognition and strengthening of the complementary roles of public and private educational institutions as separate but integral parts of the total Philippine educational system.</b> </p> <p> <b>When we speak of State supervision and regulation, we refer to the external governance of educational institutions</b>, particularly private educational institutions as distinguished from the internal governance by their respective boards of directors or trustees and their administrative officials. Even without a provision on external governance, the State would still have the inherent right to regulate educational institutions through the exercise of its police power. We have thought it advisable to restate the supervisory and regulatory functions of the State provided in the 1935 and 1973 Constitutions with the addition of the word "reasonable." We found it necessary to add the word "reasonable" because of an <em>obiter dictum</em> of our Supreme Court in a decision in the case of <em>Philippine Association of Colleges and Universities vs. The Secretary of Education and the Board of Textbooks</em> in 1955. In that case, the court said, and I quote: </p> <blockquote> <p> It is enough to point out that local educators and writers think the Constitution provides for control of education by the State. </p> <p> The Solicitor General cites many authorities to show that the power to regulate means power to control, and quotes from the proceedings of the Constitutional Convention to prove that State control of private education was intended by organic law. </p> </blockquote> <p> <b>The addition, therefore, of the word "reasonable" is meant to underscore the sense of the committee, that when the Constitution speaks of State supervision and regulation, it does not in any way mean control. We refer only to the power of the State to provide regulations and to see to it that these regulations are duly followed and implemented.</b> It does not include the right to manage, dictate, overrule and prohibit. Therefore, it does not include the right to dominate.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[271]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> In stark contrast, Section 4(2), Article XIV, which was copied from the 1973 Philippine Constitution, refers to <i>ownership</i> and <i>administration</i> of individual schools. This interpretation is clear both from a plain reading of the provision itself, and from the deliberations of the Framers of the Constitution: </p><blockquote> <p> MR. GUINGONA. The committee refers to both ownership and administration. If I may be allowed to continue, may I refer the Commissioner to the same section that I have specified in the 1973 Constitution. The Commissioner will notice that this particular provision does not only refer to administration because it speaks also of educational institution which should be owned solely by citizens or corporations of the Philippines. </p> <p> MR. REGALADO. Yes. </p> <p>MR. GUINGONA. In other words, even in the 1973 Constitution, the contemplation or the intention of the fundamental law was to include both ownership and administration. </p> <p>MR. REGALADO. They are not merely these, because otherwise there is an error of language in the Constitution then. Paragraph 7 of Section 8 states: "Educational institutions, other than those established by religious orders, mission boards, or charitable organizations." </p> <p>MR. GUINGONA. Yes.</p> <p> MR. REGALADO. In other words, with the exception of educational institutions established by religious orders, mission boards, or charitable organizations, then all educational institutions shall be owned solely by citizens of the Philippines and at the time, of course, by corporations or associations 60 <em>per centum</em> of the capital of which is owned by citizens. In other words, educational institutions of religious orders were exempted from that requirement by the very constitutional provision which was further implemented and ramified with clarity in P.D. No. 176.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[272]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Thus, petitioners are mistaken in applying Section 4(2), Article XIV to Section 4(1), Article XIV as they deal with completely different matters. The restrictions expressed in Section 4(2), Article XIV only refer to <em>ownership, control</em>, and <em>administration</em> of individual schools, and these do not apply to the State's exercise of reasonable supervision and regulation of educational institutions under Section 4(1), Article XIV. Hence, there is nothing under the provisions of the Constitution which prohibits the State to forge a partnership with a foreign entity, like CardNo, in the exercise of this supervision and regulation of educational institutions. </p><p> Further, it is asserted that the <i>K to 12 Law</i> violates the constitutional duty of the State to provide adult citizens, the disabled, and out-of-school youth with training in civics, vocational efficiency, and other skills as commanded by Section 2, Article XIV of the 1987 Philippine Constitution. Petitioners decry the supposed lack of mechanisms in the <i>K to 12 Law</i> to accommodate groups with special needs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[273]</sup> As previously discussed, Section 2, Article XIV of the 1987 Philippine Constitution is not a self-executing provision. Furthermore, petitioners' argument has no factual basis because DepEd has already put in place programs to address the needs of indigenous peoples, Muslim children, adult learners, PWDs, out of school youth and other sectors of society in keeping with the aforesaid constitutional provisions, in line with the <i>K to 12 Law</i>. The Court agrees with the following discussion by the OSG in its Comment on this point: </p><blockquote> <p> The petitioners' argument has no factual basis because the DepEd has already put in place programs to address the needs of the indigenous peoples, Muslim schoolchildren, adult learners, and persons with disabilities (PWDs) in line with the K-12 program. DepEd Order No. 103, s. 2011 directed the creation of the Indigenous Peoples Education Office (IPsEO), which is a mechanism for the mobilization, implementation, and coordination of all the programs and projects of DepEd pertaining to IPs education, pursuant to "The Indigenous Peoples Rights Act of 1997." This law mandates all government agencies to recognize and promote the rights of Indigenous Cultural Communities and Indigenous Peoples within the framework of national unity and development.</p> <p> Dep[E]d Order No. 62, s. 2011 entitled "The National Indigenous Peoples Education Policy Framework," was issued to serve as an instrument in promoting shared accountability, continuous dialogue, engagement, and partnership among governments, IPs communities, civil society, and other education stakeholders in upholding the IPs Learners' education rights. In support of DepEd's commitment to strengthen its policy on Indigenous Peoples Education (IPEd), DepEd Order No. 26, s. 2013 promulgated the Implementing Guidelines on the Allocation and Utilization of the Indigenous Peoples Education (IPEd) Program Support Fund.</p> <p> Likewise, DepEd Order No. 46, s. 2013, entitled "Guidelines on the Madrasah Education Program and Utilization of the Support Fund," was issued to engage Muslim learners with relevant educational opportunities and processes. </p> <p> On the other hand, DepEd Order No. 39, s. 2013 was issued in support of DepEd's Special Education Program for learners with special needs and disabilities, including those who are gifted and talented. DepEd Memorandum No. 108, s. 2013 entitled "2013 Alternative Learning System Accreditation and Equivalency (ALS &amp; ALE) Test Registration and Administration" was promulgated to facilitate the ALS &amp; ALE Test, designed to measure the competencies of those who have neither attended nor finished the elementary or secondary education in the formal school system. Passers of this test are given a certificate/diploma (which bears the seal and the signature of the Secretary of the Department of Education) certifying their competencies as comparable to graduates of the formal school system. Hence, they are qualified to enroll in the secondary and post secondary schools. </p> <p> DepEd Order No. 17, s. 2014 was also issued to provide the guidelines on the <em>Abot-Alam</em> Program, a convergence program that is being undertaken by a consortium of various national government agencies, non government organizations, the National Youth Commission, and institutions under the leadership of DepEd to locate the out-of-school youth (OSY) nationwide who are 15-30 years old and who have not completed basic/higher education or who are unemployed, and to mobilize and harmonize programs which will address the OSY's needs and aspirations. </p> <p> DepEd Order No. 77, s. 2011 organized the Advisory Council for the Education of Children and Youth with Disabilities (ACECYD) to formulate an agenda for action and the framework for collaboration between the DepEd and the disability sector and other stakeholders in providing education to children and youth with disabilities. </p> <p> DepEd Order No. 64, s. 2011 directed all Schools Division and City Superintendents (SDSs) and District Supervisors to strictly implement relevant policies and best practices on the promotion and compensation of all Alternative Learning System (ALS) mobile teachers and implementers to ensure equal opportunities and standard implementation on the promotion and compensation of the ALS implementers. </p> <p> Likewise, DepEd Order No. 22, s. 2010, entitled "Mainstreaming and Institutionalizing Madrasah Education Program by Transferring Its Developed Components to the Bureau of Elementary Education, Regional and Division Offices, and the Establishment of Madrasah Education Unit," was promulgated with the ultimate objective of peace building, national unity and understanding. Under this scheme, DepEd shall develop the Standard Madrasah Curriculum (SMC) for Pre-elementary and Secondary levels, along with the development of instructional and learning materials, to complete the cycle of basic education Madrasah. </p> <p> These inclusion programs are continuously being implemented to respond to the needs of the education sector during the transition period. They show the resolve of the DepEd to harness the necessary systems and structures to respond to the needs of the indigenous peoples, Muslim schoolchildren, adult learners, PWDs, OSYs, and the other sectors of society, in keeping with the constitutional provisions on the rights of indigenous peoples to preserve and develop their cultures, and to provide training in civics, vocational efficiency, and other skills to adult, disabled, and out-of-school youth.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[274]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> In fine, the contentions of petitioners are therefore without any factual basis and utterly devoid of merit. </p><p align="center"> <b>IV. </b> </p><p> <b><i>Policy issues</i></b></p><p> In an attempt to bolster their case against the <i>K to 12 Law</i>, petitioners also raised the following policy issues: </p><blockquote> <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="3%"><div align="justify">a)</div></td> <td width="97%"> <div align="justify">K to 12 only increases the resource gap by creating more need for resources.

When the validity of a statute is challenged on constitutional grounds, the sole function of the court is to determine whether it transcends constitutional limitations or the limits of legislative power.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[283]</sup> In the case of <em>Tañada v. Cuenco</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[284]</sup> the Court, quoting American authorities, held:</p> <blockquote> <p> "Elsewhere in this treatise the well-known and well-established principle is considered that it is not within the province of the courts to pass judgment upon the <em>policy</em> of legislative or executive action. Where, therefore, <em>discretionary</em> powers are granted by the Constitution or by statute, the <em>manner</em> in which those powers are exercised is not subject to judicial review. The courts, therefore, concern themselves only with the question as to the <em>existence and extent of these discretionary powers</em>. </p> <p> "As distinguished from the judicial, the legislative and executive departments are spoken of as the <em>political</em> departments of government because in very many cases their action is necessarily dictated by considerations of public or political policy. <em>These considerations of public or political policy of course will not permit the legislature to violate constitutional provisions, or the executive to exercise authority not granted him</em> <em>by</em> the Constitution <em>or by statute</em>, but, <em>within these limits</em>, they do permit the departments, separately or together, to<em> recognize that a certain set of facts exists or that a given status exists</em>, and these determinations, together with the consequences that flow therefrom, may not be traversed in the courts."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[285]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)</p> </blockquote> <p> Similarly, in <em>Department of Environment and Natural Resources v. DENR Region 12 Employees</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[286]</sup> the Court held that: </p><blockquote> <p>x x x. However, these concern issues addressed to the wisdom of the transfer rather than to its legality. It is basic in our form of government that the judiciary cannot inquire into the wisdom or expediency of the acts of the executive or the legislative department, for each department is supreme and independent of the others, and each is devoid of authority not only to encroach upon the powers or field of action assigned to any of the other department, but also to inquire into or pass upon the advisability or wisdom of the acts performed, measures taken or decisions made by the other departments. </p> <p> <b>The Supreme Court should not be thought of as having been tasked with the awesome responsibility of overseeing the entire bureaucracy.</b> Unless there is a clear showing of constitutional infirmity or grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, <b>the Court's exercise of the judicial power, pervasive and limitless it may seem to be, still must succumb to the paramount doctrine of separation of powers.</b> After a careful review of the records of the case, we find that this jurisprudential element of abuse of discretion has not been shown to exist.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[287]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> Further, the courts accord the presumption of constitutionality to legislative enactments, not only because the legislature is presumed to abide by the Constitution, but also because the judiciary, in the determination of actual cases and controversies, must reflect the wisdom and justice of the people as expressed through their representatives in the executive and legislative departments of the government.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[288]</sup> The Court, despite its vast powers, will not review the wisdom, merits, or propriety of governmental policies, but will strike them down only on either of two grounds: (<em>1</em>) unconstitutionality or illegality and/or (<em>2</em>) grave abuse of discretion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[289]</sup> For having failed to show any of the above in the passage of the assailed law and the department issuances, the petitioners' remedy thus lies not with the Court, but with the executive and legislative branches of the government.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[290]</sup> </p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the consolidated petitions are hereby <strong>DENIED</strong>.

[C]ourts do not sit to adjudicate mere academic questions to satisfy scholarly interest, however intellectually challenging." The controversy must be justiciable — definite and concrete, touching on the legal relations of parties having adverse legal interests. In other words, the pleadings must show <em>an active antagonistic assertion of a legal right, on the one hand, and a denial thereof on the other</em>; that is, it must concern a real and not a merely theoretical question or issue. There ought to be an <em>actual and substantial controversy admitting of specific relief through a decree conclusive in nature</em>, as distinguished from an opinion advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> (Citations omitted)</p> </blockquote> <p> Thus, allegations of abuse or violations of constitutional or legal rights must be anchored on<em> real</em> acts, as opposed to possible, hypothetical, conjectural ones. There must first be an act<em> against another</em>, which the latter claims is violative of a particular right or is injurious to it, while the other claims that the act is done within the limitations of the law. If an act is not yet performed, there is no actual case or controversy. In <em>Lozano v. Nograles</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> this Court explained: </p><blockquote> <p> An aspect of the "case-or-controversy" requirement is the requisite of "<b>ripeness</b>". In the United States, courts are centrally concerned with whether a case involves uncertain contingent future events that may not occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all. Another approach is the evaluation of the <b>twofold</b> aspect of ripeness: first, the fitness of the issues for judicial decision; and second, the hardship to the parties entailed by withholding court consideration. In our jurisdiction, the issue of ripeness is generally treated in terms of<em> actual injury </em>to the plaintiff. Hence, a question is ripe for adjudication when the act being challenged has had a <em>direct adverse effect</em> on the individual challenging it. An alternative road to review similarly taken would be to determine whether an <em>action has already been accomplished or performed by a branch of government before the courts may step in</em>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)</p> </blockquote> <p> The rationale for requiring an actual case or controversy is partly to respect the principle of separation of powers. The courts must avoid delving into the wisdom, justice, or expediency of executive acts and legislative enactment. In<em> Angara v. Electoral Commission</em>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> [T]his power of judicial review is limited to actual cases and controversies to be exercised after full opportunity of argument by the parties, and limited further to the constitutional question raised or the very <i>lis mota</i> presented. Any attempt at abstraction could only lead to dialectics and barren legal questions and to sterile conclusions unrelated to actualities. Narrowed as its function is in this manner, the judiciary does not pass upon questions of wisdom, justice or expediency of legislation. More than that, courts accord the presumption of constitutionality to legislative enactments, not only because the legislature is presumed to abide by the Constitution but also because the judiciary in the determination of actual cases and controversies must reflect the wisdom and justice of the people as expressed through their representatives in the executive and legislative departments of the governments.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> In <i>Garcia v. Executive Secretary</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> this Court ruled that the Judiciary must avoid ruling on questions of policy or wisdom. </p><blockquote> <p> The petition fails to satisfy the very first of these requirements — the existence of an actual case or controversy calling for the exercise of judicial power. An actual case or controversy is one that involves a conflict of legal rights, an assertion of opposite legal claims <em>susceptible of judicial resolution</em>; <b><i>the case must not be</i></b> moot or academic or <em>based on extra-legal or other similar considerations not cognizable by a court of justice</em>. Stated otherwise, it is not the mere existence of a conflict or controversy that will authorize the exercise by the courts of its power of review; more importantly, the issue involved must be susceptible of judicial determination. Excluded from these are questions of policy or wisdom, otherwise referred to as political questions:</p> <blockquote> <p> As <i>Tañada v. Cuenco</i> puts it, political questions refer "to those questions which, under the Constitution, are to be decided by the people in their sovereign capacity, or in regard to which<em> full discretionary authority has been delegated to the legislative or executive branch of government</em>." Thus,<em> if an issue is clearly identified by the text of the Constitution as matters for discretionary action by a particular branch of government or to the people themselves then it is held to be a political question</em>. In the classic formulation of Justice Brennan in <em>Baker v. Carr</em>, "[p]rominent on the surface of any case held to involve a political question is found a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department; or <em>a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it; or the impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for non-judicial discretion</em>; or the impossibility of a court's undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government; or an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made; or the potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on the one question."</p> </blockquote> <p>. . . .</p> <p> Stripped to its core, what petitioner Garcia raises as an issue is the propriety of immediately and fully deregulating the oil industry. Such determination essentially dwells on the soundness or wisdom of the timing and manner of the deregulation Congress wants to implement through R.A. No. 8497. Quite clearly, the issue is not for us to resolve; we cannot rule on when and to what extent deregulation should take place without passing upon the wisdom of the policy of deregulation that Congress has decided upon. To use the words of <em>Baker v. Carr</em>, the ruling that petitioner Garcia asks requires "<em>an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for non-judicial discretion</em>"; the branch of government that was given by the people the full discretionary authority to formulate the policy is the legislative department. </p> <p>. . . . </p> <p> Petitioner Garcia's thesis readily reveals the political, hence, non-justiciable, nature of his petition; the choice of undertaking full or partial deregulation is not for this Court to make.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> (Emphasis in the original citations omitted)</p> </blockquote> <p> The other rationale for requiring an actual case or controversy is to avoid rendering merely advisory opinions on legislative or executive acts. Article 8 of the Civil Code states that judicial decisions interpreting the laws and the Constitution are part of the legal system. It is the courts' duty "to make a final and binding construction of law."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Absent an actual case or controversy, courts merely answer legal questions with no actual effect on any person, place, or thing affecting the import of its issuances. In my concurring opinion in <i>Belgica, et al. v. Ochoa</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> Basic in litigation raising constitutional issues is the requirement that there must be an actual case or controversy. This Court cannot render an advisory opinion. We assume that the Constitution binds all other constitutional departments, instrumentalities, and organs. We are aware that in the exercise of their various powers, they do interpret the text of the Constitution in the light of contemporary needs that they should address. A policy that reduces this Court to an adviser for official acts by the other departments that have not yet been done would unnecessarily tax our resources. It is inconsistent with our role as final arbiter and adjudicator and weakens the entire system of the Rule of Law. Our power of judicial review is a duty to make a final and binding construction of law. This power should generally be reserved when the departments have exhausted any and all acts that would remedy any perceived violation of right. The rationale that defines the extent of our doctrines laying down exceptions to our rules on justiciability are clear: Not only should the pleadings show a convincing violation of a right, but the impact should be shown to be so grave, imminent, and irreparable that any delayed exercise of judicial review or deference would undermine fundamental principles that should be enjoyed by the party complaining or the constituents that they legitimately represent.</p> <p> The requirement of an "actual case," thus, means that the case before this Court "involves a conflict of legal rights, an assertion of opposite legal claims susceptible of judicial resolution; the case must not be moot or academic based on extra-legal or other similar considerations not cognizable by a court of justice." Furthermore, "the controversy needs to be definite and concrete, bearing upon the legal relations of parties who are pitted against each other due to their adverse legal interests." Thus, the adverse position of the parties must be sufficient enough for the case to be pleaded and for this Court to be able to provide the parties the proper relief/s prayed for.</p> <p> The requirement of an 'actual case' will ensure that this Court will not issue advisory opinions. It prevents us from using the immense power of judicial review absent a party that can sufficiently argue from a standpoint with real and substantial interests.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> (Citations omitted)</p> </blockquote> <p> Moreover, should the courts be asked to provide answers to hypothetical or conjectural situations, their discretion and scope may be unrestricted and done without any consideration of arguments of actual affected parties. If they rule on these hypothetical situations, future parties who could argue differently would not be able to present their claims on the law being interpreted. They will simply be limited by the Court's rulings on the hypothetical cases.</p><p> In <em>The Provincial Bus Operators Association of the Philippines v. Department of Labor and Employment</em>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> An advisory opinion is one where the factual setting is conjectural or hypothetical. In such cases, the conflict will not have sufficient concreteness or adversariness so as to constrain the discretion of this Court. After all, legal arguments from concretely lived facts are chosen narrowly by the parties. Those who bring theoretical cases will have no such limits. They can argue up to the level of absurdity. They will bind the future parties who may have more motives to choose specific legal arguments. In other words, for there to be a real conflict between the parties, <em>there must exist actual facts from which courts can properly determine whether there has been a breach of constitutional text</em>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)</p> </blockquote> <p> Similarly in <em>Spouses Imbong v. Ochoa, Jr.</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> I had the opportunity to point out: </p><blockquote> <p>The term justiciability refers to the dual limitation of only considering in an adversarial context the questions presented before courts, and in the process, the courts' duty to respect its co-equal branches of government's powers and prerogatives under the doctrine of separation of powers. </p> <p> There is a case or controversy when there is a real conflict of rights or duties <em><strong>arising from actual facts</strong></em>. These facts, properly established in court through evidence or judicial notice, provide the natural limitations upon judicial interpretation of the statute. When it is claimed that a statute is inconsistent with a provision of the Constitution, the meaning of a constitutional provision will be narrowly drawn. </p> <p> Without the necessary findings of facts, this court is left to speculate leaving justices to grapple within the limitations of their own life experiences. This provides too much leeway for the imposition of political standpoints or personal predilections of the majority of this court. This is not what the Constitution contemplates. Rigor in determining whether controversies brought before us are justiciable avoids the counter majoritarian difficulties attributed to the judiciary. </p> <p> Without the existence and proper proof of actual facts, any review of the statute or its implementing rules will be theoretical and abstract. Courts are not structured to predict facts, acts or events that will still happen. Unlike the legislature, we do not determine policy. We read law only when we are convinced that there is enough proof of the real acts or events that raise conflicts of legal rights or duties. Unlike the executive, our participation comes in after the law has been implemented. Verily, we also do not determine how laws are to be implemented. </p> <p> The existence of a law or its implementing orders or a budget for its implementation is far from the requirement that there are acts or events where concrete rights or duties arise. The existence of rules do not substitute for real facts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> (Emphasis in the original, citation omitted)</p> </blockquote> <p> This Court has consistently ruled that an actual case or controversy is necessary even in cases where the constitutionality of a law is being questioned. It is not enough that the statute has been passed. There must still be a real act. The law must have been implemented, and the party filing the case must have been affected by the act of implementation. </p><p> In <i>Southern Hemisphere Engagement Network, Inc. v. Anti-Terrorism Council</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> this Court refused to take cognizance of a petition questioning the constitutionality of Republic Act No. 9372, finding that the possibility of abuse in its implementation is not enough, thus: </p><blockquote> <p> The Court is not unaware that a reasonable certainty of the occurrence of a <em>perceived threat </em>to any constitutional interest suffices to provide a basis for mounting a constitutional challenge. This, however, is qualified by the requirement that there must be <b><u>sufficient facts</u></b> to enable the Court to intelligently adjudicate the issues.</p> <p> [H]owever, herein petitioners have failed to show that the challenged provisions of RA 9372 forbid <b>constitutionally protected</b> <em>conduct</em> or<em> activity </em>that they seek to do. No demonstrable threat has been established, much less a real and existing one. </p> <p> <b>Petitioners' obscure allegations of sporadic "surveillance" and supposedly being tagged as "communist fronts" in no way approximate a <i>credible threat of prosecution</i>. </b>From these allegations, the Court is being lured to render an <i>advisory opinion</i>, which is not its function. </p> <p> Without any justiciable controversy, the petitions have become pleas for declaratory relief, over which the Court has no original jurisdiction. Then again, declaratory actions characterized by "double contingency," where both the activity the petitioners intend to undertake and the anticipated reaction to it of a public official are <b><u>merely theorized</u></b>, lie beyond judicial review for lack of ripeness.</p> <p> The possibility of abuse in the implementation of RA 9372 does not avail to take the present petitions out of the realm of the surreal and merely imagined. Such possibility is not peculiar to RA 9372 since the exercise of any power granted by law may be abused. Allegations of abuse must be anchored on real events before courts may step in to settle <b><u>actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable</u></b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> (Emphasis in the original, citations omitted)</p> </blockquote> <p> Similarly, in <i>Republic of the Philippines v. Herminio Harry Roque, et al.</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> this Court said that there is no actual case or controversy absent a showing that the government action was taken toward implementing the questioned statute against the filing party. </p><blockquote> <p> A perusal of private respondents' petition for declaratory relief would show that they have failed to demonstrate how they are left to sustain or are in immediate danger to sustain some direct injury as a result of the enforcement of the assailed provisions of RA 9372. Not far removed from the factual milieu in the <em>Southern Hemisphere cases</em>, private respondents only assert general interests as citizens, and taxpayers and infractions which the government could prospectively commit if the enforcement of the said law would remain untrammelled. As their petition would disclose, <em>private respondents' fear of prosecution was solely based on remarks of certain government officials which were addressed to the general public. They, however, failed to show how these remarks tended towards any prosecutorial or governmental action geared towards the implementation of RA 9372 against them</em>. In other words, there was no particular, real or imminent threat to any of them.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted)</p> </blockquote> <p> In <i>The Provincial Bus Operators Association of the Philippines v. Department of Labor and Employment</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> petitioners in that case questioned the constitutionality of Department Order No. 118-12 and Memorandum Circular No. 2012-001, alleging that their implementation "may result in the diminution of the income of bus drivers and conductors,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> and that the payment scheme provided in the questioned issuances is "unfit to the nature of operation of public transport system or business."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> </p><p> This Court dismissed the petition finding that no actual case or controversy existed, considering that the allegations were based on speculation. There was no showing either of how the regulations would result in lower income for bus drivers and conductors, or of how the new payment scheme is unfit to the nature of the business of public bus operators.</p><p> In <i>Philippine Press Institute, Inc. v. Commission on Elections</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> this Court ruled that there is no actual case or controversy as Philippine Press Institute, Inc. failed to allege a specific act against it committed by the Commission on Elections in enforcing or implementing the questioned law such that it sustained an actual or imminent injury, thus: </p><blockquote> <p> At all events, the Court is bound to note that PPI has failed to allege any specific affirmative action on the part of Comelec designed to enforce or implement Section 8. PPI has not claimed that it or any of its members has sustained actual or imminent injury by reason of Comelec action under Section 8. Put a little differently, the Court considers that the precise constitutional issue here sought to be raised . . . is not ripe for judicial review for lack of an actual case or controversy involving, as the very<em> lis mota</em> thereof, the constitutionality of Section 8.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> The same rule applies even though there is an allegation of grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. Again, in <i>Spouses Imbong v. Ochoa, Jr</i>.,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> I underscored: </p><blockquote> <p> It is true that the present Constitution grants this court with the exercise of judicial review when the case involves the determination of "grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government." This new feature of the 1987 Constitution affects our political question doctrine. It does not do away with the requirement of an actual case. The requirement of an actual case is fundamental to the nature of the judiciary.</p> <p> No less than Justice Vicente V. Mendoza implied that the rigorous requirement of an actual case or controversy is determinative of the nature of the judiciary. Thus:</p> <blockquote> <p> [i]nsistence on the existence of a case or controversy before the judiciary undertakes a review of legislation gives it the opportunity, denied to the legislature, of seeing the actual operation of the statute as it is applied to actual facts and thus enables to it to reach sounder judgment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> (Citations omitted)</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> Thus, in the case at bar, I am of the view that the same standard should be used in determining the existence of an actual case or controversy.</p><p> Several petitioners in this case have shown that the questioned laws and issuances have been enforced against them. Petitioners students, teachers, and parents have shown that they have been affected by the implementation of Republic Act No. 10533. There is likewise no denying that the questioned laws and issuances have already been enforced and implemented in schools across the Philippines. Schools have adjusted their curriculums so that they are compliant with the K-12 Program. The employments of several teachers have been affected. Parents have been paying tuition fees for the additional two (2) years of senior high school.</p><p> For the petitioners who are filing their Petitions not simply on the basis of the laws' enactment but on these laws' implementation and the alleged injuries that they incurred as a result, there is an actual case or controversy in the instant cases. </p><p align="center"><b>II</b> </p><p> The second requisite for this Court to exercise its power of judicial review is that the party filing must have <em>locus standi</em> or legal standing to file the suit. In <em>The Provincial Bus Operators Association of the Philippines</em>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> Legal standing or <em>locus standi</em> is the "right of appearance in a court of justice on a given question." To possess legal standing, parties must show "a personal and substantial interest in the case such that they have sustained or will sustain direct injury as a result of the governmental act that is being challenged." The requirement of direct injury guarantees that the party who brings suit has such personal stake in the outcome of the controversy and, in effect, assures "that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court depends for illumination of difficult constitutional questions."</p> <p> . . . .</p> <p> Whether a suit is public or private, the parties must have "a present substantial interest," not a "mere expectancy or a future, contingent, subordinate, or consequential interest." Those who bring the suit must possess their own right to the relief sought.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> (Citations omitted)</p> </blockquote> <p> Generally, to be considered to have standing, the petitioner must be directly affected by the governmental act. However, this Court has taken cognizance of petitions even though the petitioners do not have the required personal or substantial interest because they raised "constitutional issue[s] of critical significance."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup></p><p> Thus, this Court has taken cognizance of cases filed by taxpayers where there is a claim of an unconstitutional tax measure or illegal disbursement of public funds. It has allowed the review of cases filed by voters who have obvious interest in the validity of the questioned election law. The petitions of concerned citizens raising issues of transcendental importance have been heard by this Court. Likewise, legislators may file petitions if their prerogative as legislators has been infringed upon.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> </p><p> In Rule 3, Section 12 of the Rules of Court, a class suit may be filed for numerous parties: </p><blockquote> <p> Section 12. Class suit. — When the subject matter of the controversy is one of common or general interest to many persons so numerous that it is impracticable to join all as parties, a number of them which the court finds to be sufficiently numerous and representative as to fully protect the interests of all concerned may sue or defend for the benefit of all. Any party in interest shall have the right to intervene to protect his individual interest.</p> </blockquote> <p> In my concurring opinion in <i>Segovia v. Climate Change Commission</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> I stated: </p><blockquote> <p> A class suit is a specie of a representative suit insofar as the persons who institute it represent the entire class of persons who have the same interest or who suffered the same injury. However, unlike representative suits, the persons instituting a class suit are themselves real parties in interest and are not suing merely as representatives. A class suit can prosper only: </p> <blockquote> <p> (a) when the subject matter of the controversy is of common or general interest to many persons;</p> <p> (b) when such persons are so numerous that it is impracticable to join them all as parties; and</p> <p> (c) when such persons are sufficiently numerous as to represent and protect fully the interests of all concerned.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> </p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> Thus, a class suit may be filed subject to these requisites. </p><p> This Court also allows third-party suits—cases where a party files a petition on behalf of another. However, the following requisites must be present: first, </p><blockquote> <p> [T]he litigant must have suffered an 'injury-in-fact,' thus giving him or her a 'sufficiently concrete interest' in the outcome of the issue in dispute; [second,] the litigant must have a close relation to the third party; and [third,] there must exist some hindrance to the third party's ability to protect his or her own interests.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> This Court first allowed third-party standing in <em>White Light Corp. et al. v. City of Manila</em>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> </p><p> In <em>White Light</em>, hotel and motel operators filed a case to stop the implementation of a Manila City Ordinance which, for the purpose of protecting morality, prohibited hotels, motels, inns, and other similar establishments in the City of Manila from allowing "short-time admission."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> They argued that their clients' rights to privacy, freedom of movement, and equal protection of the laws were violated.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> </p> <p>This Court allowed them to sue on behalf of their clients on the basis of third-party standing, finding that all the requisites for third-party standing are present. It noted that if the Ordinance were enforced, their business interests as hotel and motel operators would be injured considering that they "rely on the patronage of their customers for their continued viability."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> It also found that there was a hindrance for the clients to bring the suit because constitutional litigation was then silent on special interest groups that could bring those cases. </p> <p> This Court has also allowed associations to file petitions on behalf of its members. In <i>Pharmaceutical and Health Care Association of the Philippines v. Secretary of Health</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> the Pharmaceutical and Health Care Association of the Philippines filed a case on behalf of its members who were manufacturers of breastmilk substitutes to question the constitutionality of the rules implementing the Milk Code. This Court found that "an association has the legal personality to represent its members because the results of the case will affect their vital interests."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> It further noted that the amended articles of incorporation of the association stated that it was "to represent directly or through approved representatives the pharmaceutical and health care industry before the Philippine Government and any of its agencies, the medical professions and the general public."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> Thus: </p><blockquote> <p> This [modern] view fuses the legal identity of an association with that of its members. An association has standing to file suit for its workers despite its lack of direct interest if its members are affected by the action. An organization has standing to assert the concerns of its constituents. </p> <p> . . . .</p> <p> . . . We note that, under its Articles of Incorporation, the respondent was organized . . . to act as the representative of any individual, company, entity or association on matters related to the manpower recruitment industry, and to perform other acts and activities necessary to accomplish the purposes embodied therein. The respondent is, thus, the appropriate party to assert the rights of its members, because it and its members are in every practical sense identical . . . The respondent [association] is but the medium through which its individual members seek to make more effective the expression of their voices and the redress of their grievances.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> (Citation omitted)</p> </blockquote> <p> In <i>Executive Secretary v. The Hon. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> Asian Recruitment Council Philippine Chapter, Inc. filed a petition for declaratory relief on behalf of its member recruitment agencies for this Court to declare certain provisions of Republic Act No. 8042 unconstitutional. This Court recognized the standing of the association, noting that it proved that its individual members authorized it to sue on their behalf through board resolutions. It held that Asian Recruitment Council Philippine Chapter, Inc. was able to show that it was the medium used by its members to effectively communicate their grievances. </p> <p> However, not all associations are allowed to file a suit with third-party standing. This is still always subject to the requisites laid down in jurisprudence. In <em>The Provincial Bus Operators Association of the Philippines v. Department of Labor and Employment,</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> this Court did not allow the association to represent its members because it failed to establish who their members were and if their members allowed them to sue on their behalf. There was no evidence of board resolutions or articles of incorporation. This Court noted that some of the petitioners in that case even had their certificates of incorporation revoked by the Securities and Exchange Commission. It was not enough that they alleged that they were an association that represented members who would be directly injured by the implementation of a law, thus: </p><blockquote> <p> The liberality of this Court to grant standing for associations or corporations whose members are those who suffer direct and substantial injury depends on a few factors. </p> <p> In all these cases, there must be an actual controversy. Furthermore, there should also be a clear and convincing demonstration of special reasons why the truly injured parties may not be able to sue. </p> <p> Alternatively, there must be a similarly clear and convincing demonstration that the representation of the association is more efficient for the petitioners to bring. They must further show that it is more efficient for this Court to hear only one voice from the association. In other words, the association should show special reasons for bringing the action themselves rather than as a class suit, allowed when the subject matter of the controversy is one of common or general interest to many persons. In a class suit, a number of the members of the class are permitted to sue and to defend for the benefit of all the members so long as they are sufficiently numerous and representative of the class to which they belong. </p> <p> In some circumstances similar to those in <em>White Light</em>, the third parties represented by the petitioner would have special and legitimate reasons why they may not bring the action themselves. Understandably, the cost to patrons in the <em>White Light</em> case to bring the action themselves—i.e., the amount they would pay for the lease of the motels—will be too small compared with the cost of the suit. But viewed in another way, whoever among the patrons files the case even for its transcendental interest endows benefits on a substantial number of interested parties without recovering their costs. This is the free rider problem in economics. It is a negative externality which operates as a disincentive to sue and assert a transcendental right.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> (Citation omitted)</p> </blockquote> <p> Thus, associations are allowed to sue on behalf of their members if it is sufficiently established who their members are, that their members authorized them to sue on their behalf, and that they would be directly injured by the challenged governmental acts. </p><p> In the present Petitions, petitioners' legal standing should be determined by considering the enumerated requisites. </p><p> Petitioners associations and organizations should prove that they were authorized by their members to file the present cases through board resolutions or through their articles of incorporation. They should explain their own injury that is caused or will be caused by the questioned laws and issuances. They should state why their members are prevented from protecting their own interests. </p><p> Alleging the transcendental importance of issues is not enough. In <i>The Provincial Bus Operators Association of the Philippines</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> In addition to an actual controversy, special reasons to represent, and disincentives for the injured party to bring the suit themselves, there must be a showing of the transcendent nature of the right involved. </p> <p> Only constitutional rights shared by many and requiring a grounded level of urgency can be transcendent. For instance, in<em> The Association of Small Landowners in the Philippines, Inc. v. Secretary of Agrarian Reform</em>, the association was allowed to file on behalf of its members considering the importance of the issue involved, i.e., the constitutionality of agrarian reform measures, specifically, of then newly enacted Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law. </p> <p> This Court is not a forum to appeal political and policy choices made by the Executive, Legislative, and other constitutional agencies and organs. This Court dilutes its role in a democracy if it is asked to substitute its political wisdom for the wisdom of accountable and representative bodies where there is no unmistakable democratic deficit. It cannot lose this place in the constitutional order. Petitioners' invocation of our jurisdiction and the justiciability of their claims must be presented with rigor. Transcendental interest is not a talisman to blur the lines of authority drawn by our most fundamental law. <br> . . . .</p> <p> Again, the reasons cited—the "far-reaching consequences" and "wide area of coverage and extent of effect" of Department Order No. 118-12 and Memorandum Circular No. 2012-001—are reasons not transcendent considering that most administrative issuances of the national government are of wide coverage. These reasons are not special reasons for this Court to brush aside the requirement of legal standing.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> (Citations omitted)</p> </blockquote> <p> The following are the factors that determine if an issue is of transcendental importance. </p><blockquote> <p> (1) the character of the funds or other assets involved in the case; (2) the presence of a clear case of disregard of a constitutional or statutory prohibition by the public respondent agency or instrumentality of the government; and (3) the lack of any other party with a more direct and specific interest in raising the questions being raised.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> (Citation omitted) </p> </blockquote> <p> Moreover, there must also be a showing of a "clear or imminent threat to fundamental rights" and of "proper parties suffering real, actual or more imminent injury."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> </p><p> Several of the petitioners in these cases are organizations representing faculty and staff of colleges and universities in the Philippines. </p><p>Thus, petitioners' legal standing should be determined by considering the abovementioned requisites. </p><p>I note that petitioners organizations and associations in G.R. No. 216930 argue that they did not violate the rule on third-party standing because they are challenging Republic Act No. 10533 and House Bill No. 5493 <em>on its face</em> for being overbroad and vague.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> </p><p>However, in my Dissenting Opinion in <i>Spouses Imbong v. Ochoa, Jr</i>.,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> I discussed: </p><blockquote> <p> The prevailing doctrine today is that:</p> <blockquote> <p> a facial challenge only applies to cases where the free speech and its cognates are asserted before the court. While as a general rule penal statutes cannot be subjected to facial attacks, a provision in a statute can be struck down as unconstitutional when there is a clear showing that there is an imminent possibility that its broad language will allow ordinary law enforcement to cause prior restraints of speech and the value of that speech is such that its absence will be socially irreparable. </p> </blockquote> <p> Broken down into its elements, a facial review should only be allowed when: </p> <blockquote> <p> First, the ground for the challenge of the provision in the statute is that it violates freedom of expression or any of its cognates; </p> <p> Second, the language in the statute is impermissibly vague; </p> <p>Third, the vagueness in the text of the statute in question allows for an interpretation that will allow prior restraints; </p> <p> Fourth, the "chilling effect" is not simply because the provision is found in a penal statute but because there can be a clear showing that there are special circumstances which show the imminence that the provision will be invoked by law enforcers;</p> <p> Fifth, the application of the provision in question will entail prior restraints; and </p> <p>Sixth, the value of the speech that will be restrained is such that its absence will be socially irreparable. This will necessarily mean balancing between the state interests protected by the regulation and the value of the speech excluded from society. </p> </blockquote> <p> Facial challenges can only be raised on the basis of overbreadth and not on vagueness. <i>Southern Hemisphere</i> demonstrated how vagueness relates to violations of due process rights, whereas facial challenges are raised on the basis of overbreadth and limited to the realm of freedom of expression.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> I find that these present Petitions do not justify a facial review of the assailed laws. Petitioners organizations and associations should have complied with the requirements of third-party standing. </p><p align="center"> <b>III</b> </p><p> Finally, I note that several issues raised in these Petitions pertain to different constitutional matters: education, language, and labor. Several petitioners are invoking the right of citizens to quality education. Some are alleging a violation of the constitutional provisions on language. Others are raising labor issues as a result of the implementation of the assailed laws. </p><p> While these Petitions involve one (1) particular act of legislation, petitioners raise different constitutional issues, the rulings of which involve different resolutions. Petitioners raise questions on justiciability, equal protection, police power, non-self-executing provisions, and state policies on labor, education, and language. The practice of this Court of consolidating the issues under the same law results in cases being tackled based on the subject matter, instead of based on the issues involved. This leads to a shotgun approach in addressing constitutional issues which actually warrant a more in-depth discussion by this Court so as not to compromise the interpretation of principles laid out in laws and jurisprudence. </p><p> Hence, I am of the opinion that the consolidation of Petitions should only be done in case the matter involves the same constitutional issues. Defining constitutional issues must be more narrowly tailored so that the decisions of this Court are not to be a catch-all ruling on the validity of the law, but rather an in-depth ruling on the validity of the provisions of the law. This is likewise consistent with the presumption of constitutionality of acts of legislation. </p><p align="center"> <b>IV</b> </p><p> I note that the ponencia cites the Constitutional Commission's deliberations on Article XIV, Section 6 on the use of the Filipino language as a medium of instruction as one of its bases for denying the Petitions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> It discusses that based on the deliberations, the framers did not intend to limit the primary media of instruction to only Filipino and English.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> </p><p> It further notes the deliberations of the Constitutional Commission on Article XIV, Sections 3(1),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> 4(1), <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> and 4(2).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> </p><p> It finds that the framers intended that the study of the Constitution in all educational institutions be constitutionally mandated.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup> It also considers the framers' discussions on the State's power of supervision over private schools.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup></p><p> While I concur in the result, I maintain that the discussions of the Constitutional Commission should not be considered in determining the rights and reliefs of the parties.</p><p> In <i>David v. Senate Electoral Tribunal,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup> this Court discussed that looking into the intent of the framers of the Constitution allows for great inaccuracy: </p><blockquote> <p> In the hierarchy of the means for constitutional interpretation, inferring meaning from the supposed intent of the framers or fathoming the original understanding of the individuals who adopted the basic document is the weakest approach. </p> <p> These methods leave the greatest room for subjective interpretation. Moreover, they allow for the greatest errors. The alleged intent of the framers is not necessarily encompassed or exhaustively articulated in the records of deliberations. Those that have been otherwise silent and have not actively engaged in interpellation and debate may have voted for or against a proposition for reasons entirely their own and not necessarily in complete agreement with those articulated by the more vocal. It is even possible that the beliefs that motivated them were based on entirely erroneous premises. Fathoming original understanding can also misrepresent history as it compels a comprehension of actions made within specific historical episodes through detached, and not necessarily better-guided, modern lenses. </p> <p> Moreover, the original intent of the framers of the Constitution is not always uniform with the original understanding of the People who ratified it. In <em>Civil Liberties Union:</em> </p> <blockquote> <p> While it is permissible in this jurisdiction to consult the debates and proceedings of the constitutional convention in order to arrive at the reason and purpose of the resulting Constitution, resort thereto may be had only when other guides fail as said proceedings are powerless to vary the terms of the Constitution when the meaning is clear. Debates in the constitutional convention "are of value as showing the views of the individual members, and as indicating the reasons for their votes, but they give us no light as to the views of the large majority who did not talk, much less of the mass of our fellow citizens whose votes at the polls gave the instrument the force of fundamental law. We think it safer to construe the constitution from what appears upon its face. <i>The proper interpretation therefore depends more on how it was understood by the people adopting it than in the framer's understanding thereof</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup> (Emphasis in the original, citation omitted)</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> The recorded deliberations may not have covered all opinions and intents of all framers at that time. It only reveals those opinions or intents that have been vocalized. Therefore, basing decisions on what has been recorded in the deliberations may allow for misinterpretations of the constitutional text. </p><p> I find that it is best to presume that the intent of the framers has been expressed in the text of the Constitution itself. Had the framers intended to include in the Constitution what has been expressed in the deliberations, they would have expressly provided for it in the Constitution itself. </p><p> In any case, the deliberations do not necessarily reflect the views of all citizens who approved the Constitution. Hence, it is better to construe its text in the context of how it is understood by those who adopted it. </p><p> In my opinion in <i>Spouses Imbong v. Ochoa, Jr</i>.,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup> I expressed: </p><blockquote> <p> <b><i>The meaning of constitutional provisions should be determined from a contemporary reading of the text in relation to the other provisions of the entire document. We must assume that the authors intended the words to be read by generations who will have to live with the consequences of the provisions. The authors were not only the members of the Constitutional Commission but all those who participated in its ratification. Definitely, the ideas and opinions exchanged by a few of its commissioners should not be presumed to be the opinions of all of them. The result of the deliberations of the Commission resulted in a specific text, and it is that specific text — and only that text — which we must read and construe.</i></b></p> <p> The preamble establishes that the "sovereign Filipino people" continue to "ordain and promulgate" the Constitution. The principle that "sovereignty resides in the people and all government authority emanates from them" is not hollow. Sovereign authority cannot be undermined by the ideas of a few Constitutional Commissioners participating in a forum in 1986 as against the realities that our people have to face in the present.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup> (Emphasis in the original, citation omitted)</p> </blockquote> <p> Furthermore, the Constitutional Commissioners' factual assertions are not always correct. This was shown in their discussions on the right to life when they were formulating Article II, Section 12 of the Constitution. Not only were their opinions and theories different, but new discoveries in science, varying studies in the field of medicine, and theories of different religions have contradicted several key points made during the deliberations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup> </p><p> Resorting to the deliberations should be done as a last option, only when other methods to interpret the constitutional text have failed. </p><p> In the present cases, I find that the constitutional text is clear in its meaning, and consulting the deliberations of the Constitutional Commission was not necessary to rule on the Petitions. </p><p align="center"> <b>V</b> </p><p> I further note that the ponencia identifies several provisions of the Constitution as non-self-executing, namely: (i) Article XIV, Sections 1<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup> and 2<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup> on the right of all citizens to quality education, relevant to the needs of the people; (ii) Article XIV, Section 6<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup> on the use of the Filipino language as a medium of instruction; and (iii) Article XIII, Section 3<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup> on the protection of labor and security of tenure.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup></p><p> The ponencia suggests that these are not self-executory provisions, and therefore, petitioners in these cases cannot use them as bases for claiming that Republic Act No. 10533 violated their rights. It maintains that these provisions are not a source of rights or obligations, and are mere policies which may be used as aids in the exercise of judicial review or in the enactment of laws.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup></p><p> I reiterate my opinion in <i>Knights of Rizal v. DMCI Homes, Inc</i>. <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup> and maintain that all provisions of the Constitution are self-executing: </p><blockquote> <p> It is argued that Sections 15 and 16, Article XIV of the Constitution are not self-executing provisions and, therefore, cannot be made basis to stop the construction of Torre de Manila. The dissenting opinion considers that Sections 15 and 16 "do not create any judicially enforceable right and obligation for the preservation, protection or conservation of the "prominence, dominance, vista points, vista corridors, sightlines and setting of the Rizal Park and the Rizal Monument." It adds that Sections 15 and 16 are "mere statements of principles and policy" and that "[t]he constitutional exhortation to 'conserve, promote, and popularize the nation's historical and cultural heritage and resources' lacks 'specific, operable norms and standards' by which to guide its enforcement." </p> <p>. . . . </p> <p> I do not agree, however, in making distinctions between self-executing and non-self-executing provisions. </p> <p>A self-executing provision of the Constitution is one "complete in itself and becomes operative without the aid of supplementary or enabling legislation." It "supplies [a] sufficient rule by means of which the right it grants may be enjoyed or protected." "[I]f the nature and extent of the right conferred and the liability imposed are fixed by the constitution itself, so that they can be determined by an examination and construction of its terms, and there is no language indicating that the subject is referred to the legislature for action," the provision is self-executing. </p> <p> On the other hand, if the provision "lays down a general principle," or an enabling legislation is needed to implement the provision, it is not self-executing. </p> <p> To my mind, the distinction creates false second-order constitutional provisions. It gives the impression that only self-executing provisions are imperative. </p> <p> All constitutional provisions, even those providing general standards, must be followed. Statements of general principles and policies in the Constitution are frameworks within which branches of the government are to operate. The key is to examine if the provision contains a prestation and to which branch of the government it is directed. If addressed either to the legislature or the executive, the obligation is not for this Court to fulfill. </p> </blockquote> <p align="center"> <b>V</b> </p><blockquote> <p> There are no second-order provisions in the Constitution. We create this category when we classify the provisions as "self-executing" and "non-self executing." Rather, the value of each provision is implicit in their normative content. <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup> (Citations omitted) </p> </blockquote> <p> All constitutional provisions are self-executory, imperative, and must be complied with. While statements of policies and principles are frameworks for the appropriate government branches to follow, they do not affect their fundamentality and authority as a constitutional provision. I find that the distinction between self-executing provisions and non-self-executing provisions of the Constitution should be abandoned. </p><p> In any case, I agree that these provisions are not sufficient legal bases for finding the questioned laws and issuances unconstitutional. There is nothing in the text of the questioned laws or of the related issuances that contravene the said provisions. Likewise, these provisions cover a scope of standards that are too general such that courts cannot grant a specific relief to petitioners. To attempt to grant a relief based on the provisions would encroach on the policy-making powers of the legislative and executive branches. </p><p> <b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, I concur with the ponencia. <br><br></p><p> </p><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="noshade" align="LEFT"> <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Rep.
