Three (3) of the petitioners asserted that they were dismissed without any just or authorized cause and without affording them due process; while five (5) of them claimed that they were constructively dismissed when their work schedule was unjustifiably reduced from six (6) to three (3) working days a week, resulting in a substantial reduction of their income. Furthermore, petitioners also accused respondents of not paying them their entitled benefits, such as holiday pay, overtime pay, service incentive leave pay, and their share from the service charge.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Thus, petitioners, along with several others, filed several complaints<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> for,<em> inter alia</em>, illegal dismissal against respondents. </p><p> For their part, respondents maintained that they did not hire petitioners as regular employees, but merely as seasonal employees. They explained that during the lean seasons, <em>i.e.</em>, rainy seasons, they either reduce their workers' duties to just thrice a week, or even do not require them to report for work, in which case, they are allowed to find employment elsewhere. Further, respondents posited that their engagement to their staff is akin to an "independent contractorship" in that they neither have the power to dismiss nor control the performance of their staff, and that they are free to perform their assigned tasks as long as they accomplish them within the time that they were contracted for work.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> </p><p align="center"> <b>The LA Ruling</b> </p><p> In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> dated March 14, 2014, the LA dismissed petitioners' complaints.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> The LA concluded that there was no employer-employee relationship between petitioners and respondents given that the former failed to prove that the latter: (<em>a</em>) had the power to control petitioners' work performances; and (<em>b</em>) were interested in the means and methods on how to perform their respective jobs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> </p><p> Dissatisfied, petitioners appealed<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> to the NLRC.</p><p align="center"> <b>The NLRC Ruling</b> </p><p> In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> dated May 30, 2014, the NLRC set aside the LA ruling, and accordingly entered a new one: (<em>a</em>) dismissing the complaint for illegal dismissal; and (<em>b</em>) ordering respondents to pay petitioners the aggregate amount of P1,076,833.50, representing their salary differentials, holiday pay, service incentive leave pay, and 13<sup>th</sup> month pay.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> </p><p> The NLRC deemed petitioners as regular employees of respondents, considering that: (<em>a</em>) petitioners were issued company identification cards, signifying that they were bona fide employees of respondents; (<em>b</em>) respondents issued various certifications explicitly stating that petitioners were their employees; and (<em>c</em>) the nature of petitioners' work for respondents were necessarily and desirable to the latter's business.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> This notwithstanding, the NLRC ruled that three (3) of the petitioners failed to establish the fact of their actual dismissal; while the reduction of working days of the five (5) other petitioners did not constitute constructive dismissal as there was a valid ground for such reduction,<i> i.e.</i>, onset of the rainy season.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Finally, the NLRC held that petitioners were entitled to their money claims as respondents failed to show any proof that the same had already been paid.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> </p><p> Respondents partially moved for reconsideration,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> but the same was denied in a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> dated July 7, 2014.

In this regard, Section 11, Rule 13 of the Rules of Court reads: </p><blockquote> <p> Section 11. <i>Priorities in modes of service and filing</i>. â€“ Whenever practicable, the service and filing of pleadings and other papers shall be done personally. Except with respect to papers emanating from the court, a resort to other modes must be accompanied by a written explanation why the service or filing was not done personally. A violation of this Rule may be cause to consider the paper as not filed. </p> </blockquote> <p> There is a preference of personal filing and/or service over other modes as it expedites action or resolution on a pleading, motion, or other paper, and conversely, minimizes, if not eliminates, delays likely to be incurred if service or filing is done by mail.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> This notwithstanding, case law instructs that the rule is not so rigid so as to exclude any exception from its application, and that the only condition for the exception to apply is that the pleading served or filed should be accompanied by a written explanation as to why personal service was not practicable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> "Thus, personal service is the general rule, and resort to other modes of service is the exception, so that where personal service is practicable, in the light of the circumstances of time, place, and person, personal service is mandatory. Only when personal service is not practicable may resort to other modes be had, which must then be accompanied by a written explanation as to why personal service or filing was not practicable to begin with."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> "At this stage, the judge exercises proper discretion but only upon the explanation given. In adjudging the plausibility of an explanation, the court shall consider not only the circumstances, the time and the place but also the importance of the subject matter of the case or the issues involved therein, and the <i>prima facie</i> merit of the pleading involved."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> </p><p> Should a party, however, fail to so attach this written explanation, Section 11, Rule 13 of the Rules of Court authorizes the courts (or in this case, the tribunal) to exercise their discretion to consider a pleading or paper as not filed. This notwithstanding, jurisprudence emphasizes that such discretionary power must be exercised properly and reasonably, taking into consideration, again, the practicability of personal service, the importance of the subject matter of the case or the issues involved therein, and the <em>prima facie </em>merit of the pleading sought to be expunged for violation of the aforesaid rule.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> </p><p> In the determination of the plausibility of the written explanation (if there is one) or in the exercise of discretion as to whether a pleading should be expunged (in the absence thereof), the court/tribunal ought to be guided by the principle that substantial justice far outweighs rules of procedure.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> </p><p> In this case, the CA correctly pointed out that an examination of petitioners' Notice of Appeal with Appeal Memorandum<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> reveals that it did not contain any written explanation as to why their counsel, the PAO, filed such pleading via registered mail instead of personal filing, especially considering that the PAO Office in San Pablo City, Laguna is just a stone's throw away from the NLRC-Sub-Regional Arbitration Branch IV located also in San Pablo, Laguna. Nonetheless, the Court believes that the filing via registered mail <i>sans</i> any written explanation may be excused, considering that the NLRC, the tribunal where the appeal was filed, allowed the admission of the same. More importantly, such appeal is ostensibly meritorious, as evidenced by the NLRC's May 30, 2014 Decision which modified the LA's March 14, 2014 Decision, at least insofar as the existence of employer-employee relationship between petitioners and respondents, and the former's entitlement to their money claims are concerned. Under these circumstances, the Court finds enough justification to relax technical rules of procedure in order to afford the litigants the amplest opportunity to properly and justly determine their rights and obligations to one another. In <i>PeÃ±oso v. Dona</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> the Court held: </p><blockquote> <p> Thus, dismissal of appeals purely on technical grounds is frowned upon where the policy of the court is to encourage hearings of appeals on their merits and the rules of procedure ought not to be applied in a very rigid, technical sense; rules of procedure are used only to help secure, not override substantial justice. It is a far better and more prudent course of action for the court to excuse a technical lapse and afford the parties a review of the case on appeal to attain the ends of justice rather than dispose of the case on technicality and cause a grave injustice to the parties, giving a false impression of speedy disposal of cases while actually resulting in more delay, if not a miscarriage of justice.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> </p> <p align="center"><b>II.</b> </p> </blockquote> <p> Section 3, Rule 13 of the Rules of Court provides that where pleadings are filed by registered mail, the date of mailing as shown by the post office stamp on the envelope or the registry receipt shall be considered as the date of filing. Based on this provision, the date of filing is determinable from two (2) sources: (1) from the post office stamp on the envelope or (2) from the registry receipt, either of which may suffice to prove the timeliness of the filing of the pleadings. "The Court previously ruled that if the date stamped on one is earlier than the other, the former may be accepted as the date of filing. This presupposes, however, that the envelope or registry receipt and the dates appearing thereon are duly authenticated before the tribunal where they are presented. When the photocopy of a registry receipt bears an earlier date but is not authenticated, the Court held that the later date stamped on the envelope shall be considered as the date of filing."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> </p><p> In this case, and as aptly pointed out by the NLRC in its September 30, 2014 Resolution,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> the envelope<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> that contained petitioners' Notice of Appeal with Appeal Memorandum bears the post office stamp with the date of March 31, 2014. This is further supported by a Certification<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> dated September 24, 2014, signed by Postmaster Gemma C. Medallon, stating that "Registered Letter No. 4297 <b><i><u>posted on March 31, 2014</u></i></b> from [PAO], San Pablo City addressed to [NLRC], San Pablo City has been delivered to and received by Grace Espaldon on April 2, 2014."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> From the foregoing, it may be gleaned the petitioners' counsel indeed filed their appeal to the NLRC via registered mail on March 31, 2014, or exactly on the tenth (10<sup>th</sup>) day after they received a copy of the LA Decision on March 21, 2014. As such, their appeal before the NLRC was filed on time, in accordance with Section 1, Rule VI<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> of the 2011 NLRC Rules of Procedure. </p><p> In sum, the CA erred in setting aside the NLRC rulings and affirming the LA ruling purely on technical grounds, <i>i.e.</i>, that petitioners improperly availed of filing their appeal via registered mail and/or failed to file their appeal on time. However, since the appellate court did not tackle the substantial issues of this case, the Court deems it proper to remand the same to the CA for a resolution on the merits. </p><p> <strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the petition is <strong>GRANTED</strong>.
