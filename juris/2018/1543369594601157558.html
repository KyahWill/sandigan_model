She is the only girl in the brood of three. Her mother is a manicurist while the accused is a pedicab driver. She recounted that on four different occasions, her father ravished her, inside their residence located at xxx, Valenzuela City.<br><br>It was in 2004 when she was still fourteen (14) years old that her very own father, the accused did the first horrid act of ravishing her. It was her narration that she arrived home from school and her mother and two brothers were not around. Her father went inside her room and began to undress her and made her lie down. He was naked and he went on top of her, inserted his penis to her vagina, caressed her thigh and made a pumping motion. She accounted that her father was then holding a knife and told her that if she would report what he did to her, he would kill her mother. She felt not only pain. She was afraid and angry at the same time. She felt so afraid that she was not able to fight back or even to shout for help.<br><br>The same bestial act of the accused towards her was repeated for the second time in 2005 at around 10:00 o'clock in the evening. Her father came home drunk. She was then left alone in their house watching TV. He instructed her to turn off the TV. He undressed himself and told her to remover hers too. He was at that time holding a knife compelling her to succumb to his desire out of fear. He told her to lie down. He initially sat beside her, caressed her thighs, then, went on top of her, and inserted his penis to her vagina while doing a pumping motion. He stopped when he heard someone knocking at the door.<br><br>About four (4) months had lapsed and she recalled that it was "holy week" in 2005 that she suffered the same fate in the hands of her father, the accused, once more. Her mother and siblings went to a birthday party that fateful night. She was sick then and was not able to come along in the said birthday party. Her father just drove her mother and siblings and went back home drunk. He again went near her. She began to cry. But her father told her not to be noisy as he would do something to her and pulled a knife from his back pocket. He removed her blanket and while showing a knife began to undress her. He removed his clothing too. He told her to lie face down. He caressed her buttocks and thighs and inserted his penis to (<i>sic</i>) her vagina from behind. He did a pumping motion and when he stopped she was able to touch a sticky white substance slathered on her thighs.<br><br>On May 18, 2010, the accused repeated the same horrid act to her. Her father had a drinking session with his friend, a fellow pedicab driver. He came home very drunk and sent her cousin and brother to do an errand. She assisted her father in going to bed and gave him a sponge bath. After she had given him a sponge bath, he stood up and got a knife in a small box and started caressing her. With the use of the knife he tore down the shirt she was wearing, pulled down her shorts. For himself, he removed his underwear and stayed on top of her, inserted his penis, pumped for a while and left her alone.<br><br>She attested that it took her a while before she was able to muster enough courage to reveal to others her ordeal in the hands of her own father. She kept in silence for a long time, not revealing to anyone [what her] father had been doing to her, afraid that if she would tell anyone, her father would make good his threat to kill her mother and her family would be saddled with problems.<br><br>It was in 2010 that she decided not to go home anymore. She opted to stay in the house of a friend, "CCC". After a week and she was no longer coming back home with her family, her friend, "CCC" began to probe her, why she was not going home anymore. It was then that she disclosed to "CCC" what she had been through in the hands of her father. Her friend encouraged and helped her in filing a formal complaint against her father. They went to the police authorities at Polo Police Station. She was referred to the Women's Protection Desk. It was there that her Sworn Statement was taken. After, which she was subjected to medical examinations.<br><br>xxxx<br><br><i>THE VERSION OF THE DEFENSE</i><br><br>[XXX] testified to belie the imputation against him made by his own daughter, [BBB]. He flatly denied the truth in the asseveration of facts labeled against him by his daughter, [BBB]. He claimed that there is no truth in the charges against him stating that his daughter is "isip bata" and was influenced by this friend of hers with whom she is currently living with. He further claims that [BBB] visited him in jail and asked for his forgiveness for falsely accusing him of raping her. Such confession of [BBB] was witnessed by his son and overheard by the "mayor" of the jail where he is presently detained.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br></blockquote><i>Ruling of the RTC</i><br><br>In the RTC Decision, XXX was found guilty on all four (4) counts of rape and was sentenced to suffer the penalty of <i><i>reclusion perpetua</i></i> for each charge:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in the light of the foregoing, this court finds accused [XXX]:<br><br><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(1) </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">GUILTY for Criminal Case No. 671-V-10 and sentenced (<em>sic</em>) him to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(2)</div></td><td><div align="justify"> GUILTY for Criminal Case No. 672-V-10 and sentenced (<em>sic</em>) him to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(3) </div></td><td><div align="justify">GUILTY for Criminal Case No. 673-V-10 and sentenced (<em>sic</em>) him to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(4) </div></td><td><div align="justify">GUILTY for Criminal Case No. 674-V-10 and sentenced (<em>sic</em>) him to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(5) </div></td><td><div align="justify">To indemnify [BBB] the amount of P75,000 as civil indemnity;

The CA summarized in detail the elements that were established by the testimony of BBB, as follows:<br><blockquote>Anent the first rape, it was established by sufficient evidence that appellant committed the offense charged in the information in Criminal Case No. 671-V-10. As testified to by "BBB", appellant:<br><blockquote><ol><li>Forcibly undressed her and made her lie down;<br></li><li>He went on top of her and inserted his penis inside her vagina and made a pumping motion causing her to feel severe pain;<br></li><li>He kissed her with his left hand caressing her thigh and his right hand holding a knife;<br></li><li>He threatened her that he would kill her mother if she would report what he did to her; and<br></li><li>She went to the bathroom and saw blood in her underwear.<br></li></ol></blockquote>In the second rape incident, the prosecution, likewise, was able to prove that appellant was able to rape "BBB" using force and intimidation. Thus:<br><blockquote><ol><li>Appellant, who was drunk, told her to lie down on the bed;<br></li><li>He undressed himself and while holding a fan knife, he told her to undress also;<br></li><li>He caressed her thighs and went on top of her;<br></li><li>He inserted his penis and did a pumping motion for minutes causing "BBB" to feel severe pain; and<br></li><li>He stopped pumping after he heard something.<br></li></ol></blockquote>With regard to the third rape incident, it was clearly shown by competent evidence that, using force and intimidation:<br><blockquote><ol><li>Appellant, who was drunk, pulled a knife from his back pocket and told "BBB" to undress herself;<br></li><li>He undress (<i>sic</i>) himself and told her to lie face down;<br></li><li>He caressed her buttocks and while threatening "BBB" with a knife, inserted his penis into her vagina and made pumping motion and threatened her not to tell anyone what he did to her;<br></li><li>She felt pain because appellant knelt on her thigh; and<br></li><li>When he stopped pumping, she felt something sticky in her thigh.<br></li></ol></blockquote>As regards the fourth rape incident, it was also clearly shown by competent evidence that, using force and intimidation:<br><blockquote><ol><li>Appellant, who was drunk, told her to give him a towel;<br></li><li>With the towel he undress (<i>sic</i>) himself and told her to lie face down;<br></li><li>He caressed her buttocks and while threatening "BBB" with a knife, inserted his penis into her vagina and made pumping motion and threatened her not to tell anyone what he did to her;<br></li><li>She felt pain because appellant knelt and pinned down her thigh.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote></blockquote>Significantly, BBB's narration of events was corroborated by the physical evidence, as contained in the medico-legal report, to wit:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">Q: </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">And considering the brief history in the Sexual Crime Protocol and the Manifestation of Consent, after you conducted the physical and genital examination of the victim in this case, what is (<i>sic</i>) your findings for your Final Medico-Legal Report and the Initial Medico-Legal Report, doctor?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A: </div></td><td><div align="justify">All the part that was indicated in my report revealed essentially normal except for the hymen which has a deep healed laceration at 5 o' clock position, sir.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td colspan="2"><div align="justify">xxxx</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q:</div></td><td> <div align="justify">And in your conclusion doctor, in your Final Report, what was the cause?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A:</div></td><td><div align="justify"><strong>My conclusion is that medical evaluation shows clear evidence of application of blunt trauma to the hymen, sir.</strong></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q: </div></td><td><div align="justify">And considering the brief history in the Sexual Crime Protocol written by the minor victim herself, what can you say about your findings?

Based on BBB's testimony, in all the incidents of rape, XXX was armed with a deadly weapon and he would, in several occasions, threaten BBB not to tell anyone of his acts. Thus, considering that XXX is the father of BBB, his moral ascendancy was certainly more than enough to silence her, not to mention the normal tendency of rape victims to conceal their humiliation and shame resulting from the irrevocable violation of their honor. On this score, the case of <i>People v. Mingming</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> instructs:<br><blockquote>[W]e do not believe that delay in reporting a rape should directly and immediately translate to the conclusion that the reported rape did not take place; there can be no hard and fast rule to determine when a delay in reporting a rape can have the effect of affecting the victim's credibility. The heavy psychological and social toll alone that a rape accusation exacts on the rape victim already speaks against the view that a delay puts the veracity of a charge of rape in doubt. The effects of threats and the fear that they induce must also be factored in. At least one study shows that the decisive factor for non-reporting and the failure to prosecute a rape is the lack of support - familial, institutional and societal - for the rape victim, given the unfavorable socio-cultural and policy environment. All these, to our mind, speak for themselves in negating the conclusion that a delay in reporting a rape is per se sufficient basis to disbelieve an allegation of rape. The more reasonable approach is to take the delay into account but to disregard it if there are justifiable explanations for the victim's prolonged silence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br></blockquote>On a related matter, that BBB continued to stay at their home despite the rape incidents is of no consequence. While XXX argues that such circumstance mitigates the multiple charges of rape against him, the Court finds no merit in his claim. As succinctly held in the questioned Decision:<br><blockquote>It should be emphasized that when the first incident of rape was committed against "BBB", she was only fourteen (14) years old. A natural reluctant Filipina woman, who is fourteen (14) years old, would not have thought of leaving the house much less finding solace in [a] government institution that renders psychological and social services for [a] rape victim. It could hardly be expected that such a child of tender age would know what to do and where to go under the circumstances. Indeed, it is not proper to cast judgment on the actions of children who have undergone traumatic experiences by the norms of behavior expected under the circumstances from mature persons.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br></blockquote><i>XXX's defense of alibi and denial failed to overcome the prosecution's evidence</i><br><br>The defenses of alibi and denial are generally viewed with disfavor by the courts due to their inherent weakness. Hence, to be given evidentiary value, such defenses must be supported by strong evidence of innocence independent of the accused's self-serving statements. Moreover, for the defense of alibi to be considered, the accused must prove not only that he was somewhere else when the crime was committed but that it was also physically impossible for him to have been at the crime scene or its immediate vicinity at the approximate time of its commission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Here, XXX flatly denied all the accusations against him, imputing instead ill motive on the part of BBB for being "isip bata."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> XXX further claimed that BBB allegedly visited him in jail to ask for his forgiveness in falsely accusing of raping her and that the same was witnessed by his son and overheard by the "mayor" of the jail.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>Significantly, XXX's various claims were left uncorroborated during trial. XXX never presented any documentary evidence nor did he present any of the alleged witness to lend truth to his allegations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> As observed by the RTC, that XXX's wife and two (2) sons chose to keep silent only adds credence to the truthfulness of BBB's imputations against her father.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>Meanwhile, as regards the May 18, 2010 incident in Criminal Case No. 671-V-10, XXX claimed that he was out of the house the entire day as he was working as a pedicab driver then.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> However, the records are bereft of any evidence, other than XXX's bare testimony, that it was physically impossible for him to be at the <i>locus criminis</i> at the time the act complained of transpired. XXX's defense of alibi must therefore be rejected.<br><br>All told, the Court is fully convinced that the evidence, taken in its entirety, unmistakably convicts XXX for the heinous deeds committed against BBB.<br><br>As to the penalty, the Court accordingly modifies the award of damages to conform to prevailing jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br><i>Criminal Case No. 671-V-10</i><br><br>As charged in the Information, the penalty imposable under Section 11 of Republic Act (R.A.)

No. 9346, "An Act Prohibiting the Imposition of Death Penalty in the Philippines," the Court can only mete out the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>. Parenthetically, the Court cannot take cognizance of the fact of BBB's minority as an attendant circumstance as the same was not properly alleged in the Information. While such fact was established during the trial itself, the same cannot be considered without infringing upon XXX's constitutional right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>In this regard, to conform with prevailing jurisprudence, the Court hereby awards the amounts of Seventy-Five Thousand Pesos (P75,000.00) as civil indemnity, Seventy-Five Thousand Pesos (P75,000.00) as moral damages, and Seventy-Five Thousand Pesos (P75,000.00) as exemplary damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br><i>Criminal Case Nos. 672-V-10, 673-V-10, and 674-V-10</i><br><br>With respect to these three (3) Informations, the crimes charged therein are punishable by death under R.A.
