"Pare" [(Otico)] was engaged in the sale of illegal drugs or <em>shabu</em> in Barangay Looc, Oslob, Cebu. The Chief of Police of Oslob Police Station then called the attention of Police Officer 1 (PO1) Alan Villasurda, Police Officer 3 (PO3) Nelson Saquibal, and a civilian poseur-buyer to conduct a briefing for an entrapment operation.</p> <p> During the said operational briefing, P03 Saquibal was designated as the team leader, a civilian agent was assigned as the poseur-buyer, and PO1 Villasurda, as the immediate back-up. The poseur-buyer was given one (1) five hundred peso bill (Php 500.00) with serial number QD628746. PO3 Saquibal marked the bill with the suspect's initials, "MO," on both sides. Before proceeding with their planned buy-bust operation, the team coordinated with the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) through IO1 Melisa Montesa <em>via </em>telephone call. The latter then issued a coordination control number. As soon [as] the briefing was done, a pre-operation report was prepared and faxed to PDEA and a coordination form was also prepared by PNP Oslob.</p> <p> Around 8:00 o'clock in the morning on 22 April 2011, the team proceeded to the target area. The poseur-buyer went ahead while P03 Saquibal and PO1 Villasurda followed on board their own motorcycle. They arrived at the area around 10:10 in the morning that same day and positioned themselves in a strategic location near a store. They stood about ten (10) meters away from the poseur-buyer, who was texting near the house of [Otico].</p> <p> Around 10:30 in the morning, [Otico] arrived and approached the poseur-buyer. PO1 Villasurda saw the poseur-buyer give the money to [Otico], who, in exchange, handed to the latter a plastic sachet. Upon receiving the plastic sachet from [Otico], the poseur-buyer executed the pre-arranged signal by scratching his head, indicating that the transaction was completed.</p> <p> When the signal was given, PO3 Saquibal immediately held [Otico] and announced his authority as a police officer while PO1 Villasurda took the plastic sachet from the poseur-buyer. [Otico] tried to evade arrest upon hearing that the two (2) were police officers, but to no avail.</p> <p> As soon as [Otico] was subdued, and after verifying that the plastic sachet contained <em>shabu</em>, PO3 Saquibal arrested him for violation of Section 5, Article II of R.A. No. 9165, and informed him of his constitutional rights. PO3 Saquibal took from [Otico's] possession the buy-bust money and a cellphone. Subsequently, the buy-bust team proceeded to the PNP Oslob Police Station together with [Otico].</p> <p> At the police station, PO1 Villasurda conducted an inventory of the seized items in the presence of [Otico] and Municipal Councilor Guillermo Zamora. The items were photographed by PO2 Nelson Mendaros and then marked by PO1 Villasurda. The seized plastic sachet was marked "MMO-1" and the marked money, "MMO-2," the initials referring to [Otico's] complete name, Marvin Madrona Otico. PO3 Saquibal then prepared the Certificate of Inventory, a spot report and a letter-request for laboratory examination. PO1 Villasurda personally delivered the request and the specimen to the PNP Crime Laboratory for laboratory examination.</p> <p> The letter-request and the specimen were received by PO1 Pangatungan, who personally delivered the same to Police Senior Inspector Ryan Ace Mabilen Sala, the PNP Forensic Chemist of the PNP Crime Laboratory.</p> <p> P/S Insp. Sala conducted a [qualitative] examination on the specimen, which gave positive result to the test for Methamphetamine Hydrochloride, a dangerous drug under R.A. No. 9165. His findings and conclusion were indicated in his submitted Chemistry Report No. D-466-2011. The Chemistry Report, specimen and the letter request were all forwarded to PO2 Joseph Bocayan, the evidence custodian of the PNP Crime Laboratory.</p> <p> In support of the case x x x, PO3 Saquibal and PO1 Villasurda executed a Joint Affidavit of Apprehension in connection with the arrest of [Otico].<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> <b><i>Version of the Defense</i></b></p><p> The CA Decision summarizes Otico's version, to wit: </p><blockquote> <p> In his testimony, [Otico] recounted that at around 10:30 in the morning on 22 April 2011, he was just buying a cellphone load at the store located near his house when he was apprehended by the police officers. When he inquired for the reason for his arrest, however, the police officers merely told him that he ask his questions at the police station. He was handcuffed and brought to the police station.</p> <p> [Otico] testified that when they arrived at the police station, he saw PO3 Saquibal enter another office and was already holding one (1) plastic sachet when he came out. Allegedly, PO3 Saquibal subsequently entered another room and had with him one (1) Five Hundred Peso bill when he emerged therefrom.</p> <p> [Otico] further averred that since he did not admit ownership of the items which were brought and presented on the table by PO3 Saquibal, the latter yelled and told him not to lie.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> <b><i>The RTC Ruling</i></b></p><p> After trial, the RTC rendered a Decision dated August 27, 2015, the dispositive portion of which reads: </p><blockquote> <p> <strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, premises considered, the court finds accused Marvin Otico GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the offense of Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drug in violation of Section 5, Article II of R.A. 9165 and imposes upon him the penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of Five Hundred Thousand Pesos (P500,000.00).</p> <p> His period of preventive imprisonment shall be credited in his favor. </p> <p> LET a <em>mittimus</em> issue committing him to Leyte Regional Prisons in Abuyog, Leyte.</p> <p> The subject shabu shall be confiscated in accordance with the rules governing the same.</p> <p> Costs against the accused.</p> <p> SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Aggrieved, Otico filed a Notice of Appeal<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> dated August 28, 2015.</p><p> <b><i>The CA Ruling</i></b></p><p> The CA denied Otico's appeal in a Decision dated October 26, 2016, the dispositive portion of which states: </p><blockquote> <p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appeal is <b>DENIED</b>.

In the Court's Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> dated July 5, 2017, the parties were required to file their respective supplemental briefs. The People, through the Office of the Solicitor General, filed a "Manifestation &amp; Motion"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> dated September 27, 2017, wherein it was manifested that the People would no longer file a supplemental brief and, in lieu thereof, the Brief filed before the CA would be considered in the resolution of the present appeal. Otico, through the Public Attorney's Office-Regional Special and Appealed Cases Unit-Cebu, filed a "Manifestation (In Lieu of Supplemental Brief)"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> dated October 25, 2017.</p><p align="center"> <b><i>Issue</i></b> </p><p> The issue is whether the CA erred in affirming the conviction of Otico for the offense of illegal sale of dangerous drug in violation of Section 5, RA 9165.</p><p align="center"> <b><i>The Court's Ruling</i></b> </p><p> Basic is the rule that, for a conviction of the crime of illegal sale of dangerous drugs to stand, the prosecution should have proven the following elements beyond reasonable doubt: (1) the identity of the buyer and seller, the object, and the consideration; and (2) the delivery of the thing sold and its payment. The prosecution has the onus to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the transaction actually took place, coupled with the presentation before the court of the prohibited or regulated drug or the <i>corpus delicti</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></p><p> This onus can be discharged by the prosecution only by clearly and adequately showing the details of the purported transaction, starting from the initial contact between the poseur-buyer and the pusher, the offer to purchase, the promise or payment of the consideration until the consummation of the sale by the delivery of the illegal drug subject of the sale.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Thus, the manner by which the initial contact was made, whether or not through an informant, the offer to purchase the drug, the payment of the buy-bust money, and the delivery of the illegal drug, whether to the informant alone or the police officer, must be the subject of strict scrutiny by courts to insure that law-abiding citizens are not unlawfully induced to commit an offense<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> or the constitutional rights of every citizen — to be presumed innocent and to be secure in their persons against unreasonable searches and seizures — are not unduly curtailed.</p><p> In this case, the prosecution's proof that the "transaction actually took place" consists of the "eyewitness" accounts of police officers PO1 Alan Villasurda (PO1 Villasurda) and PO3 Nelson Saquibal (PO3 Saquibal), neither of whom was the poseur-buyer, and who were admittedly 10 meters away from where the poseur-buyer allegedly transacted with Otico.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> The civilian agent, who was assigned as the poseur-buyer,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> was never presented as a witness.</p><p> While informants are usually not presented in court because of the need to hide their identity and preserve their invaluable service to the police,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> and the non-presentation of the confidential informant is not fatal to the prosecution,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> as where the testimony of the informant will merely be corroborative of the apprehending officers' eyewitness testimonies<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> so that there is no need to present the informant in court where the sale was actually witnessed and adequately proved by prosecution witnesses,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> their presentation is necessary, if not indispensable, when the accused vehemently denies selling prohibited drugs and there are material inconsistencies in the testimonies of the arresting officers,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> or there are reasons to believe that the arresting officers had motives to testify falsely against the accused,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> or when the informant was the poseur-buyer and the only one who actually witnessed the entire transaction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> </p><p> Indeed, while the assistance of confidential informants or civilian agents is acknowledged to be invaluable, the Court is nevertheless aware of the pitfalls of the confidential informant system. The Court's observations in <em>People v. Doria</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> are reiterated, <em>viz</em>.: </p><blockquote> <p> Though considered essential by the police in enforcing vice legislation,<strong> the confidential informant system breeds abominable abuse</strong>. Frequently, a person who accepts payment from the police in the apprehension of drug peddlers and gamblers also accept payment from these persons who deceive the police. The informant himself may be a drug addict, pickpocket, pimp, or other petty criminal. For whatever noble purpose it serves, the spectacle that government is secretly mated with the underworld and uses underworld characters to help maintain law and order is not an inspiring one.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Equally odious is the bitter reality of dealing with unscrupulous, corrupt and exploitative law enforcers. <b>Like the informant, unscrupulous law enforcers' motivations are legion – harassment, extortion, vengeance, blackmail, or a desire to report an accomplishment to their superiors. </b>This Court has taken judicial notice of this ugly reality in a number of cases<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> where we observed that it is a common <i>modus operandi</i> of corrupt law enforcers to prey on weak and hapless persons, particularly unsuspecting provincial hicks.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> <b>The use of shady underworld characters as informants, the relative ease with which illegal drugs may be planted in the hands or property of trusting and ignorant persons, and the imposed secrecy that inevitably shrouds all drug deals have compelled this Court to be extra-vigilant in deciding drug cases.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Criminal activity is such that stealth and strategy, although necessary weapons in the arsenal of the police officer, become as objectionable police methods as the coerced confession and the unlawful search. x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> To determine whether "the transaction actually took place," the "eyewitness" accounts of the two police officers have to be strictly scrutinized.</p><p> PO1 Villasurda, the designated immediate back-up,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> testified: </p><blockquote> <p>FISCAL MA.

PO1 Villasurda saw them "exchanging something" with the poseur-buyer handing "first the money" and "the subject also hand[ing] something to the poseur buyer."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> PO3 Saquibal saw that the "poseur buyer handed [to] x x x Otico the Five Hundred Peso bill buy-bust money" and "[i]n exchanged (sic), x x x Otico gave the plastic sachet containing white crystalline substance to [the] poseur buyer."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></p><p> The version of PO3 Saquibal is incredible. Given the distance of 10 meters, it is unbelievable that a very small or tiny plastic sachet<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> can be seen being handed from one person to another. To be able to see the "white crystalline substance" with a weight of 0.02 gram inside such tiny plastic sachet is utterly impossible, unless one has "bionic eyes" or x-ray vision. Also, PO3 Saquibal's testimony wherein he was able to identify from 10 meters that the P500-bill, which the civilian asset allegedly handed to Otico, was the same one previously marked at the police station means that he was able to either read the serial number of the bill or see the marking "MO" thereon. Of course, that is again impossible.</p><p> PO1 Villasurda's version that he saw the handing of "money" from the civilian asset to Otico is too tentative given the fact that he used "something" as his initial description. Also, the use of the word "something" in describing what Otico handed to the civilian agent creates reasonable doubt because the description is equivocal.</p><p> The acquittal of Otico is warranted on the ground that the evidence presented by the prosecution to prove that the illegal sale of dangerous drug really took place falls terribly short of the quantum of proof beyond reasonable doubt.</p><p> In addition, the identity of the dangerous drug that Otico allegedly sold to the civilian agent is uncertain. </p><p> Nowhere is the weight of the plastic sachet containing the <em>shabu</em>, which was the object of the illegal sale, mentioned in the testimonies of police officers PO1 Villasurda and PO3 Saquibal.

The Certificate of Inventory reflects PO3 Saquibal as the Team Leader and the one who prepared the same.</p> <p> In fine, the following flaws or defects in the strict observance by the police officers of Section 21 of RA 9165 and its IRR are apparent: </p><p>1. The inventory and photograph taking were <b><u>not</u></b> done immediately after seizure and confiscation in the place of operation. </p><p>2. Except for the elected official, the required witnesses were <b><u>not</u></b> present during the inventory and photograph taking. Only one of the three third-party witnesses was present. </p><p>3. The police officers did <b><u>not</u></b> present justifiable grounds for their non-compliance with the required procedure and proof that the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items were properly preserved by them. </p><p> In <i>People v. Umipang</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> the Court stressed that: </p><blockquote> <p> x x x the step-by-step procedure outlined under R.A. 9165 is a matter of substantive law, which cannot be simply brushed aside as a simple procedural technicality. The provisions were crafted by Congress as safety precautions to address potential police abuses, especially considering that the penalty imposed may be life imprisonment. In <i>People v. Coreche</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> we explained thus: </p> <blockquote> <p> The concern with <b>narrowing the window of opportunity for tampering with evidence</b> found legislative expression in Section 21 (1) of RA 9165 on the inventory of seized dangerous drugs and paraphernalia by putting in place a <b>three-tiered requirement on the <i>time, witnesses</i>, and <i>proof</i> of inventory</b> by imposing on the apprehending team having initial custody and control of the drugs the <b>duty to "immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof."</b> (Emphasis supplied.) </p> </blockquote> <p> Consequently, in a line of cases,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> we have lain emphasis on the importance of complying with the prescribed procedure. Stringent compliance is justified under the rule that penal laws shall be construed strictly against the government and liberally in favor of the accused.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> Otherwise, "the procedure set out in the law will be mere lip service."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup></p> <p> x x x x </p> <p> Minor deviations from the procedures under R.A. 9165 would not automatically exonerate an accused from the crimes of which he or she was convicted.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> This is especially true when the lapses in procedure were "recognized and explained in terms of [] justifiable grounds."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> There must also be a showing "that the police officers intended to comply with the procedure but were thwarted by some justifiable consideration/reason."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> However, when there is gross disregard of the procedural safeguards prescribed in the substantive law (R.A. 9165), serious uncertainty is generated about the identity of the seized items that the prosecution presented in evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> This uncertainty cannot be remedied by simply invoking the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties, for a gross, systematic, or deliberate disregard of the procedural safeguards effectively produces an irregularity in the performance of official duties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> As a result, the prosecution is deemed to have failed to fully establish the elements of the crimes charged, creating reasonable doubt on the criminal liability of the accused.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> As the Court explained in <i>People v. Mendoza</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> the deliberate taking of the identifying steps, which include marking, physical inventory and photographing of the contraband, immediately upon seizure by the police officer concerned, or, if that is not possible, as close to the time and place of the seizure as practicable under the obtaining circumstances before the insulating presence of the three third-party witnesses is aimed at preserving an unbroken chain of custody and obviating the evils of switching, "planting" or contamination of the evidence that had tainted the buy-busts conducted under the regime of RA 6425 (Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> <b><u>The failure to do so will negate the integrity and credibility of the seizure and confiscation of the dangerous drug that is evidence of the <i>corpus delicti</i>, and adversely affected the trustworthiness of the incrimination of the accused.</u></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup></p><p> In this case, the lapses noted above are far from being minor.

The presumption of innocence in favor of Otico stands.</p><p> As a reminder, the Court exhorts the prosecutors to diligently discharge their onus to prove compliance with the provisions of Section 21 of RA 9165, as amended, and its IRR, which is fundamental in preserving the integrity and evidentiary value of the <i>corpus delicti</i>. <b>To the mind of the Court, the procedure outlined in Section 21 is straightforward and easy to comply with.</b> In the presentation of evidence to prove compliance herewith, the prosecutors are enjoined to recognize any deviation from the prescribed procedure and provide the explanation therefor as dictated by available evidence. Compliance with Section 21 being integral to every conviction, the appellate court, this Court included, is at liberty to review the records of the case to satisfy itself that the required proof has been adduced by the prosecution whether the accused has raised, before the trial or appellate court, any issue of non-compliance.

No. 9165</i>),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> respectively. I agree that the prosecution failed to prove appellant's guilt beyond reasonable doubt, because the "eyewitness" accounts of the two police officers, who were admittedly ten (10) meters away from the place where the civilian agent/poseur-buyer and the appellant traded the 0.02 gram of suspected shabu and the P500.00 buy-bust money, are incredible. Moreover, the prosecution failed to provide justifiable grounds for the police officers' non-observance of the three-witness rule under Section 21<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of R.A. No. 9165, <i>i.e</i>., except for the elected public official, the representatives from the media and the Department of Justice were not present during the inventory photograph taking of the seized items. At any rate, I would like to emphasize on important matters relative to Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165, as amended. </p><p> To properly guide law enforcement agents as to the proper handling of confiscated drugs, Section 21 (a), Article II of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (<i>IRR</i>) of R.A. No. 9165 filled in the details as to where the inventory and photographing of seized items had to be done, and added a saving clause in case the procedure is not followed:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> (a) The apprehending officer/team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof: <i>Provided</i>, that the physical inventory and photograph shall be conducted at the place where the search warrant is served; or at the nearest police station or at the nearest office of the apprehending officer/team, whichever is practicable, in case of warrantless seizures; <b><i>Provided, further</i>, that non­ compliance with these requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and invalid such seizures of and custody over said items.</b> </p> </blockquote> <p> It bears emphasis that R.A. No. 10640,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> which amended Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165, now only requires <b>two (2) witnesses</b> to be present during the conduct of the physical inventory and taking of photograph of the seized items, namely: (a) an elected public official; <b><u>and</u></b> (b) either a representative from the National Prosecution Service <b><u>or</u></b> the media.</p><p> In her Sponsorship Speech on Senate Bill No. 2273, which eventually became R.A. No. 10640, Senator Grace Poe conceded that "while Section 21 was enshrined in the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act to safeguard the integrity of the evidence acquired and prevent planting of evidence, the application of said Section resulted in the ineffectiveness of the government's campaign to stop the increasing drug addiction and also, in the conflicting decisions of the courts."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Senator Poe stressed the necessity for the amendment of Section 21 based on the public hearing that the Senate Committee on Public Order and Dangerous Drugs had conducted, which revealed that "compliance with the rule on witnesses during the physical inventory is difficult. For one, media representatives are not always available in all comers of the Philippines, especially in the remote areas. For another there were instances where elected <i>barangay</i> officials themselves were involved in the punishable acts apprehended and thus, it is difficult to get the most grassroot-elected public official to be a witness as required by law."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> </p><p> In his Co-sponsorship speech, Senator Vicente C. Sotto III said that in view of a substantial number of acquittals in drug-related cases due to the varying interpretations of prosecutors and judges on Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165, there is a need for "certain adjustments so that we can plug the loopholes in our existing law" and ensure [its] standard implementation."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Senator Sotto explained why the said provision should be amended: </p><blockquote> <p> Numerous drug trafficking activities can be traced to operations of highly organized and powerful local and international syndicates. The presence of such syndicates that have the resources and the capability to mount a counter-assault to apprehending law enforcers makes the requirement of Section 21(a) impracticable for law enforcers to comply with. It makes the place of seizure extremely unsafe for the proper inventory and photograph of the seized illegal drugs.</p> <p> x x x x</p> <p> Section 21(a) of RA 9165 need to be amended to address the foregoing situation. We did not realize this in 2002 where the safety of the law enforcers and other persons required to be present in the inventory and photography of seized illegal drugs and the preservation of the very existence of seized illegal drugs itself are threatened by an immediate retaliatory action of drug syndicates at the place of seizure. The place where the seized drugs may be inventoried and photographed has to include a location where the seized drugs as well as the persons who are required to be present during the inventory and photograph are safe and secure from extreme danger. </p> <p> It is proposed that the physical inventory and taking of photographs of seized illegal drugs be allowed to be conducted either in the place of seizure of illegal drugs or at the nearest police station or office of the apprehending law enforcers. The proposal will provide effective measures to ensure the integrity of seized illegal drugs since a safe location makes it more probable for an inventory and photograph of seized illegal drugs to be properly conducted, thereby reducing the incidents of dismissal of drug cases due to technicalities. </p> <p> Non-observance of the prescribed procedures should not automatically mean that the seizure or confiscation is invalid or illegal, as long as the law enforcement officers could justify the same and could prove that the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are not tainted. This is the effect of the inclusion in the proposal to amend the phrase "justifiable grounds." There are instances where there are no media people or representatives from the DOJ available and the absence of these witnesses should not automatically invalidate the drug operation conducted. Even the presence of a public local elected official also is sometimes impossible especially if the elected official is afraid or scared.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> However, under the original provision of Section 21 and its IRR, which is applicable at the time the appellant committed the crime charged, the apprehending team was required to immediately conduct a physical inventory and photograph the drugs after their seizure and confiscation in the presence of no less than <b>three (3) witnesses</b>, namely: (a) a representative from the media, <b><u>and</u></b> (b) the DOJ, <b><u>and</u></b>; (c) any elected public official who shall be required to sign copies of the inventory and be given copy thereof. The presence of the three witnesses was intended as a guarantee against planting of evidence and frame up, as they were "necessary to insulate the apprehension and incrimination proceedings from any taint of illegitimacy or irregularity."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> </p><p> The prosecution bears the burden of proving a valid cause for non­ compliance with the procedure laid down in Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165, as amended. It has the positive duty to demonstrate observance thereto in such a way that during the trial proceedings, it must initiate in acknowledging and justifying any perceived deviations from the requirements of law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Its failure to follow the mandated procedure must be adequately explained, and must be proven as a fact in accordance with the rules on evidence. It should take note that the rules require that the apprehending officers do not simply mention a justifiable ground, but also clearly state this ground in their sworn affidavit, coupled with a statement on the steps they took to preserve the integrity of the seized items.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Strict adherence to Section 21 is required where the quantity of illegal drugs seized is minuscule, since it is highly susceptible to planting, tampering or alteration of evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></p><p> In this case, the prosecution never alleged and proved that the presence of all the required witnesses was not obtained for any of the following reasons, such as: (1) <b>their attendance was impossible because the place of arrest was a remote area</b>; (2) <b>their safety during the inventory and photograph of the seized drugs were threatened by an immediate retaliatory action of the accused or any person/s acting for and in his/her behalf</b>; (3)<b> the elected official themselves were involved in the punishable acts sought to be apprehended</b>; (4) <b>earnest efforts to secure the presence of a DOJ or media representative and an elected public official within the period required under Article 125</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> <b>of the Revised Penal Code prove futile through no fault of the arresting officers, who face the threat of being charged with arbitrary detention</b>; or (5) <b>time constraints and urgency of the anti-drug operations, which often rely on tips of confidential assets, prevented the law enforcers from obtaining the presence of the required witnesses even before the offenders could escape</b>.</p><p> Invocation of the disputable presumptions that the police officers regularly performed their official duty and that the integrity of the evidence is presumed to be preserved, will not suffice to uphold appellant's conviction. Judicial reliance on the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty despite the lapses in the procedures undertaken by the agents of the law is fundamentally flawed because the lapses themselves are affirmative proofs of irregularity.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> The presumption may only arise when there is a showing that the apprehending officer/team followed the requirements of Section 21 or when the saving clause found in the IRR is successfully triggered. In this case, the presumption of regularity had been contradicted and overcome by evidence of non-compliance with the law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></p><p> At this point, it is not amiss to express my position regarding the issue of which between the Congress and the Judiciary has jurisdiction to determine sufficiency of compliance with the rule on chain of custody, which essentially boils down to the application of procedural rules on admissibility of evidence. In this regard, I agree with the view of Hon. Associate Justice Teresita J. Leonardo-De Castro in <i>People v. Teng Moner y Adam</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> that "if the evidence of illegal drugs was not handled precisely in the manner prescribed by the chain of custody rule, the consequence relates not to inadmissibility that would automatically destroy the prosecution's case but rather to the weight of evidence presented for each particular case." As aptly pointed out by Justice Leonardo-De Castro, the Court's power to promulgate judicial rules, including rules of evidence, is no longer shared by the Court with Congress.</p><p> I subscribe to the view of Justice Leonardo-De Castro that the chain of custody rule is a matter of evidence and a rule of procedure, and that the Court has the last say regarding the appreciation of evidence. Evidentiary matters are indeed well within the powers of courts to appreciate and rule upon, and so, when the courts find appropriate, substantial compliance with the chain of custody rule as long as the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items have been preserved may warrant the conviction of the accused.</p><p> I further submit that <b>the requirements of marking the seized items, conduct of inventory and taking photograph in the presence of a representative from the media or the DOJ and a local elective official, are police investigation procedures which call for administrative sanctions in case of non-compliance. Violation of such procedure may even merit penalty under R.A. No. 9165</b>, to wit: </p><blockquote> <p> <b>Section 29.</b> <i>Criminal Liability for Planting of Evidence. </i>- Any person who is found guilty of "planting" any dangerous drug and/or controlled precursor and essential chemical, regardless of quantity and purity, shall suffer the penalty of death. </p> <p><b>Section 32.</b><em> Liability to a Person Violating Any Regulation Issued by the Board</em>. - The penalty of imprisonment ranging from six (6) months and one (1) day to four (4) years and a fine ranging from Ten thousand pesos (P10,000.00) to Fifty thousand pesos (P50,000.00) shall be imposed upon any person found violating any regulation duly issued by the Board pursuant to this Act, in addition to the administrative sanctions imposed by the Board. </p> </blockquote> <p> However, non-observance of such police administrative procedures should not affect the validity of the seizure of the evidence, because the issue of chain of custody is ultimately anchored on the admissibility of evidence, which is exclusively within the prerogative of the courts to decide in accordance with the rules on evidence.<br><br></p><p> </p><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="noshade" align="LEFT"> <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> "AN ACT INSTITUTING THE COMPREHENSIVE DANGEROUS DRUGS ACT OF 2002, REPEALING REPUBLIC ACT NO. 6425, OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE DANGEROUS DRUGS ACT OF 1972, AS AMENDED, PROVIDING FUNDS THEREFOR.
