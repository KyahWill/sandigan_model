The Equipment Lease Agreement provided that the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office, as lessee, will lease the lottery equipment and accessories of the Philippine Gaming and Management Corporation, as lessor, for the operation of its on­line lottery in Luzon. The term of the Equipment Lease Agreement was eight (8) years or until 2003.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>On November 14, 1997, the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office and the Philippine Gaming and Management Corporation amended the Equipment Lease Agreement "to reduce the original number of required terminals from 2,000 to 1,250 terminals."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Several cases were filed in court causing the 8-year term of the Equipment Lease Agreement to commence in 1999.

Since the Philippine Gaming and Management Corporation declined to reduce the rental rate of 10% of the gross lotto sales, the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office allowed Pacific Online to provide lottery equipment for the on-line lottery operations in Luzon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>On June 8, 2012, while the Amendments to Equipment Lease Agreement was still in effect, the Philippine Gaming and Management Corporation filed a Petition for Indirect Contempt with Temporary Restraining Order and/or Writ of Preliminary Injunction before the Regional Trial Court of Makati City.

This case was docketed as G.R. Nos. 236577 and 236597.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br>Petitioner alleges that respondent Judge De Leon committed grave abuse of discretion:<br><blockquote><ol type="A"><li>Judge De Leon gravely abused his discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction when he issued the assailed injunctive writ because it is an interference to the arbitral panel's jurisdiction in [International Chamber of Commerce] Case 20105CYK pending before the [International Chamber of Commerce] International Court of Arbitration.<br><br></li><li>. . . when he assumed jurisdiction over the application for relief.<br><br></li><li>. . . when he ruled that [the Philippine Gaming and Management Corporation] has a right that must be protected pursuant to Section 2 of the Interim Settlement.<br><br></li><li>. . . when he relied on the pendency of the arbitral proceeding as basis in granting the injunctive relief application.<br><br></li><li>. . . when he ruled that [the Philippine Gaming and Management Corporation]'s action in immediately applying for [Temporary Restraining Order]/Injunctive relief is an indicia that it has a right to be violated.<br><br></li><li>. . . in finding that [the Philippine Gaming and Management Corporation] will suffer grave and irreparable injury if [the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office] pursues the [Nationwide On-line Lottery System] bidding and that no extreme urgency exists.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote>Petitioner argues that respondent Judge De Leon should have denied or deferred action on respondent Philippine Gaming and Management Corporation's application for Temporary Restraining Order/Writ of Preliminary Injunction considering that the latter already instituted a similar application before the International Chamber of Commerce, International Court of Arbitration. In granting the application, respondent Judge De Leon violated Section 28(l) of the International Chamber of Commerce Rules and Rule 5.15 of the Special Rules of Court on Alternative Dispute Resolution. Petitioner also notes that the Philippine Gaming and Management Corporation's application was filed without a verified petition, in violation of Rule 5.5 of the Supreme Court Administrative Matter No. 07-11-08 or the Special Rules of Court on Alternative Dispute Resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><br>Petitioner claims that despite respondent Judge De Leon's declaration that he did not rule on the contractual rights between petitioner and respondent Philippine Gaming and Management Corporation, the August 3, 2017 Resolution stated otherwise.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> In respondent Judge De Leon's Resolution, he "practically made a preliminary finding on the contractual right of [the Philippine Gaming and Management Corporation] on the [Interim Settlement] which is strictly prohibited in an indirect contempt proceeding like the present case."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br><br>Petitioner avers that contrary to respondent Judge De Leon's findings, respondent Philippine Gaming and Management Corporation "has no right to be protected by the writ."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> Respondent Judge De Leon ruled that the Interim Settlement is the source of the Philippine Gaming and Management Corporation's right, which needed to be protected. However, he also held that the Supplemental and Status Quo Agreement already supplemented the Interim Settlement. This was also admitted by respondent Philippine Gaming and Management Corporation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup><br><br>Petitioner contends that respondent Judge De Leon erred when he used the pending arbitral proceeding as basis in issuing the Writ of Preliminary Injunction. It points out that the only issue before the International Chamber of Commerce, International Court of Arbitration is the alleged exclusive right of respondent Philippine Gaming and Management Corporation with respect to the Equipment Lease Agreement and the Amendments to Equipment Lease Agreement, which was extended until August 22, 2018. On the other hand, the writ applied for by respondent Philippine Gaming and Management Corporation is on the Nationwide On­line Lottery System bidding covering the period of five (5) years starting on August 23, 2018. Thus, the pending arbitration proceeding is irrelevant to the application of the writ and should not have been relied upon by respondent Judge De Leon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br><br>Petitioner maintains that respondent Philippine Gaming and Management Corporation failed to show "any positive, clear and unmistakable right to be protected, much less, the right to be the Lessor for on-line lottery equipment after 22 August 2018 and 5 years thereafter or until 2023."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> Without any legal right to be protected, respondent Philippine Gaming and Management Corporation cannot claim to suffer irreparable injury.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> Absent respondent Philippine Gaming and Management Corporation's legal right and proof of irreparable injury, respondent Judge De Leon should not have issued the injunctive writ.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br><br>Petitioner likewise notes that "[t]here was no extreme urgency for the issuance of an injunctive writ."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> It asserts:<br><blockquote>[I]f the [Nationwide On-line Lottery System] project is awarded to a winning bidder following the opening of bids on 27 July 2017, a 10-month period is still necessary to conduct a test-run to ensure that the lottery system is workable and acceptable to [the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office] by the time [the Philippine Gaming and Management Corporation]'s extended [Equipment Lease Agreement] expires in August 2018.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup><br></blockquote>Finally, petitioner alleges that respondent Judge De Leon violated its freedom to contract.
