				<H3>DANILO A. LIHAYLIHAY, PETITIONER, VS. THE TREASURER OF THE PHILIPPINES ROBERTO C. TAN, SECRETARY OF FINANCE MARGARITO B. TEVES, SECRETARY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES, AND THE GOVERNOR OF BANGKO SENTRAL NG PILIPINAS (BSP), RESPONDENTS.<br><br>DECISION</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>LEONEN, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The grant of an informer's reward for the discovery, conviction, and punishment of tax offenses is a discretionary quasi-judicial matter that cannot be the subject of a writ of mandamus. It is not a legally mandated ministerial duty. This reward cannot be given to a person who only makes sweeping averments about undisclosed wealth, rather than specific tax offenses, and who fails to show that the information which he or she supplied was the undiscovered pivotal cause for the revelation of a tax offense, the conviction and/or punishment of the persons liable, and an actual recovery made by the State. Indiscriminate, expendable information negates a clear legal right and further impugns the propriety of issuing a writ of mandamus.<br><br>A writ of mandamus will not issue unless it is shown that there is no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. While this Court exercises original jurisdiction over petitions for mandamus, it will not exercise jurisdiction over those filed without exhausting administrative remedies, in violation of the doctrine of primary jurisdiction and the principle of hierarchy of courts, and when their filing amounts to an act of forum shopping.<br><br>This resolves a Petition for Mandamus and Damages, with a Prayer for a Writ of Garnishment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> praying that former Treasurer of the Philippines Roberto C.

Petition for mandamus. - When any tribunal, corporation, board, officer or person unlawfully neglects the performance of an act which the law specifically enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust, or station, or unlawfully excludes another from the use and enjoyment of a right or office to which such other is entitled, and there is no other plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, the person aggrieved thereby may file a verified petition in the proper court, alleging the facts with certainty and praying that judgment be rendered commanding the respondent, immediately or at some other time to be specified by the court, to do the act required to be done to protect the rights of the petitioner, and to pay the damages sustained by the petitioner by reason of the wrongful acts of the respondent.<br><br>The petition shall also contain a sworn certification of non-forum shopping as provided in the third paragraph of section 3, Rule 46.<br></blockquote>A writ of mandamus may issue in either of two (2) situations: first, "when any tribunal, corporation, board, officer or person unlawfully neglects the performance of an act which the law specifically enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust, or station"; second, "when any tribunal, corporation, board, officer or person . . . unlawfully excludes another from the use and enjoyment of a right or office to which such other is entitled."<br><br>The first situation demands a concurrence between a clear legal right accruing to petitioner and a correlative duty incumbent upon respondents to perform an act, this duty being imposed upon them by law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Petitioner's legal right must have already been clearly established. It cannot be a prospective entitlement that is yet to be settled. In <i>Lim Tay v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> this Court emphasized that "[m]andamus will not issue to establish a right, but only to enforce one that is already established."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> In <i>Pefianco v. Moral</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> this Court underscored that a writ of mandamus "never issues in doubtful cases."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Respondents must also be shown to have <i>actually</i> neglected to perform the act mandated by law. Clear in the text of Rule 65, Section 3 is the requirement that respondents "unlawfully <i>neglect</i>" the performance of a duty. The mere existence of a legally mandated duty or the pendency of its performance does not suffice.<br><br>The duty subject of mandamus must be ministerial rather than discretionary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> A court cannot subvert legally vested authority for a body or officer to exercise discretion. In <i>Sy Ha v. Galang</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><blockquote>[M]andamus will not issue to control the exercise of discretion of a public officer where the law imposes upon him the duty to exercise his judgment in reference to any matter in which he is required to act, because it is his judgment that is to be exercised and not that of the court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br></blockquote>This Court distinguished discretionary functions from ministerial duties, and related the exercise of discretion to judicial and quasi-judicial powers. In <i>Sanson v. Barrios</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><blockquote>Discretion, when applied to public functionaries, means a power or right conferred upon them by law of acting officially, under certain circumstances, according to the dictates of their own judgments and consciences, uncontrolled by the judgments or consciences of others. A purely ministerial act or duty, in contradistinction to a discretional act, is one which an officer or tribunal performs in a given state of facts, in a prescribed manner, in obedience to the mandate of legal authority, without regard to or the exercise of his own judgment, upon the propriety or impropriety of the act done. If the law imposes a duty upon a public officer, and gives him the right to decide how or when the duty shall be performed, such duty is discretionary and not ministerial. The duty is ministerial only when the discharge of the same requires neither the exercise of official discretion nor judgment. . . . Mandamus will not lie to control the exercise of discretion of an inferior tribunal. . ., when the act complained of is either judicial or quasi-judicial. . . . It is the proper remedy when the case presented is outside of the exercise of judicial discretion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Mandamus, too, will not issue unless it, is shown that "there is no other plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> This is a requirement basic to all remedies under Rule 65, i.e., certiorari, prohibition, and mandamus.<br><br><center><b>II</b><br></center><br>The most basic obstacle to petitioner's claim for an informer's reward under Section 1 of Republic Act No. 2338 is that Republic Act No. 2338 is no longer in effect.<br><br>Section 1 of Republic Act No. 2338 provides:<br><blockquote>Section 1.

The same amount of reward shall also be given to informer or informers where the violator has offered to compromise the violation of law committed by him and his offer has been accepted by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue or the Commissioner of Customs, as the case may be, and in such a case the twenty-five per centum reward fixed herein shall be based on the amount agreed in the compromise and collected from the violator: Provided, That should no revenue surcharges or fees be actually recovered or collected, such persons should not be entitled to a reward: Provided, further, That the information required herein shall not refer to a case already pending or previously investigated or examined by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue or the Commissioner of Customs, or any of their deputies, agents or examiners, as the case may be, or the Secretary of Finance or any of his deputies or agents: Provided, finally, That the reward provided herein shall be paid under regulations issued jointly by the Commissioners of Internal Revenue and Customs with the approval of the Secretary of Finance, and that the determination of the degree of relationship between the Internal Revenue or Customs official or employee and the informer shall be left not only to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue or the Commissioner of Customs, as the case may be, but should be jointly made by such official and the Solicitor General.<br><br>The reward herein authorized shall be paid out of revenues, surcharges, compromises, and penalties established by law, collected and accounted for as a result of the information furnished by the informer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br></blockquote>To effect Republic Act No. 2338, the Department of Finance issued its Department Order No. 46-66.

As a matter of form and procedure, that information must be voluntarily given, definite, and sworn to. Qualitatively, that information must be novel and, subsequently, prove itself effective.<br><br>Information is novel when it is "not yet in the possession of the Bureau of Internal Revenue" and "not refer[ring] to a case already pending or previously investigated or examined." Information has shown itself to be effective not only when it leads "to the discovery of frauds upon the internal revenue laws or violations of any of [its] provisions," but also when that discovery in turn enables "the recovery of revenues, surcharges and fees and/or the conviction of the guilty party and/or the imposition of any of the fine or penalty." In lieu of enabling the conviction of the guilty party and the imposition of fines or penalties, information is also effective when the discovery of tax offenses leads the offender to offer "to compromise the violation." A mere offer, however, is not enough; it must have actually been accepted and collected. Regardless of whether a compromise or conviction ensues, actual recovery is indispensable: "should no revenue, surcharges or fees be actually recovered or collected, such person shall not be entitled to a reward."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br><center><b>III</b><br></center><br>Petitioner's entitlement to an informer's reward is not a ministerial matter. Quite the contrary, its determination requires a review of evidentiary matters and an application of statutory principles and administrative guidelines. Its determination is a discretionary, quasi-judicial function, demanding an exercise of independent judgment on the part of certain public officers.<br><br>Whether from Section 1 of Republic Act No. 2338, Presidential Decree No. 707, Section 331 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1977, Section 35 of Presidential Decree No. 1773, or Section 282 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended, it is clear that the grant of an informer's reward is not a readily demandable entitlement. It is not a legally mandated duty in which every incident is prescribed with a preordained outcome.<br><br>The mere consideration of a claim is contingent on several factual findings. Making these findings demands proof the appraisal of which is to be done by certain public officers. Hence, it demands the exercise of discretion. The information supplied must be new or not yet known to the Bureau of Internal Revenue. It must not pertain to a pending or previously investigated case, and must have actually led to or was the actual cause for discovering frauds upon tax laws. Acting on the information, the government's response must have actually led to the recovery of sums relating to the fraud, as well as the conviction and/or punishment of the liable persons.<br><br>Therefore, the grant of an informer's reward depends on the consideration of evidence. In addition, it must be in keeping with rules and regulations issued by appropriate officers: Department Order No. 46-66, in the case of Republic Act No. 2338; and, at present, Revenue Regulations No. 016-10, in the case of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended.<br><br>The grant of an informer's reward for the discovery of tax offenses is effectively a quasi-judicial function, which "determine[s] <i>questions of fact</i> to which the legislative policy is to apply and . . . [is] decide[d] in accordance with the standards laid down by the law itself in enforcing and administering the same law."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> None of the respondents deviated from legally mandated norms and neglected to consummate a ministerial, legally-mandated duty, thereby enabling the issuance of a writ of mandamus.<br><br><center><b>IV</b><br></center><br>Petitioner, too, has not shown that he has a clear legal right to an informer's reward.<br><br>Indeed, the very claims that petitioner lodged before former Internal Revenue Commissioner Bu単ag and former Secretary Teves could have led to a determination of his entitlement to an informer's reward. However, he undercut this process himself by not having the composure to await Secretary Teves' final official action and by proceeding directly with the present Petition before this Court instead.<br><br>The impetus for mandamus cannot be a mere conjectured entitlement which has yet to be settled by the body or officer authorized to ascertain its propriety. Petitioner put the proverbial cart ahead of the horse by filing the present Petition ahead of Secretary Teves' resolution of his claims.<br><br>It is not proper for petitioner to plead before this Court the actual merits of his claims. The very nature of his action forbids it. "Mandamus will not issue to establish a right, but only to enforce one that is already established."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> It is not for this Court to go ahead of the Secretary of Finance and decide for itself the issues that a statute has ordained the latter to settle. "Mandamus will not lie to control the exercise of discretion of an inferior [body or officer]."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>In any case, petitioner's own recollection of antecedents and recital of factual and legal bases demonstrate the utter inadequacy of his position vis足-a-vis the basic requisites for his claim to prosper. Even if this Court were to overlook the procedural restrictions against its own consideration of the merits of petitioner's claims, petitioner still has not shown a clear legal right worthy of a writ of mandamus.<br><br>First and most glaringly, the objects of petitioner's attempts at obtaining an informer's reward are not even tax cases.<br><br>It is obvious from the evolved statutory provisions-from Section 1 of Republic Act No. 2338 to Section 282 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended-that an informer's reward under their auspices is proper only in cases of "frauds upon the internal revenue or customs laws, or violations of any of the provisions thereof."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Contrary to this basic requirement, petitioner's March 11, 1987 letters to Atty. Pitargue of the Bureau of Internal Revenue-Presidential Commission on Good Government Task Force make broad claims about the Marcos family's ill-gotten wealth, and impress the need for the government to recover them. However, he makes no specific averments about specific acts of tax fraud, violations of internal revenue and customs laws, and/or smuggling.<br><br>Petitioner himself recalls filing a Manifestation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> in Civil Case No. 0002 entitled <i>Republic of the Philippines v. Ferdinand Marcos, et al.</i>, then pending before the Sandiganbayan. Here, he again beseeched the government to recover the Marcos family's ill-gotten wealth and prayed for the delivery to him of a 25% informer's reward. Yet, Civil Case No. 0002 was not a case pertaining to violations of tax laws. Rather, it was a case for "Reversion, Reconveyance, Restitution, Accounting and Damages."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Petitioner, too, filed a Notice of Informer's Charging Lien in Civil Case No. 0013<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> entitled <i>Republic of the Philippines v. Herminia T.

Plaintiff Republic of the Philippines filed a Comment/Opposition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> rebuffing petitioner's claims precisely because it was out of order, having nothing to do with the substance of Civil Case No. 0013.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>Petitioner's subsequent letters to Commissioner Bu単ag, President Macapagal-Arroyo, Secretary Teves, and Treasurer Tan are of the same tenor. Rather than disclose specific instances of tax fraud or violations of internal revenue and customs laws, he employed a figurative shotgun approach. From his 1987 letters to the present Petition, his bases for rewards swelled from the Swiss bank deposits, gold bars, and diamonds mentioned in his original letters to Atty. Pitargue to virtually all forms of the Marcos family's ill-gotten wealth. He would not even stop there. He also turned his attention to President Marcos' cronies such as Roberto Benedicto, Lucio Tan, Fabian Ver, Herminio Disini, and Jose Campos.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Rather than animate the State's efforts with direct and reliable information, he has embarked on a fishing expedition, casting his lot on a progressively widening net.<br><br>It may be true that the many cases brought against the Marcos family and their cronies tangentially involve violations of tax laws. This, however, does not suffice. The statutory provisions governing informer's rewards demand specificity because confused indiscriminate averments would be of no real help in either securing convictions for tax offenses or recovering proceeds that should have otherwise been paid to the government as taxes.<br><br>Second, petitioner failed to demonstrate that his supplied information was the principal, if not exclusive, impetus for the State's efforts at prosecuting the Marcoses and their cronies for possible tax offenses and recovering from them their ill-gotten wealth. He thereby failed to show that his information did "not refer to a case already pending or previously investigated or examined."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> On the contrary, his March 11, 1987 letters acknowledge ongoing efforts by the Bureau of Internal Revenue and the Presidential Commission on Good Government to prosecute the Marcoses and recover their ill-gotten wealth. Likewise, his Manifestation in Civil Case No. 0002 and Notice in Civil Case No. 0013 demonstrate his attempts to merely interlope in proceedings that were already well under way.<br><br>Third, petitioner failed to prove that he was the sole and exclusive source of information leading to the discovery of fraud and violations of tax laws, which specifically resulted in the recovery of sums from the Marcos family and/or their conviction and punishment for violations of tax laws. His claims about President Marcos' Swiss accounts were hardly novel. For instance, Primitivo Mijares' book <i>The Conjugal Dictatorship of Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos</i>, which was first published in 1976 well ahead of petitioner's letters to Atty. Pitargue, already made intimations about these accounts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> There have also been other more comprehensive and officially recorded, albeit conflicting, testimonies and recollections of President Marcos' alleged gold bars.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br><center><b>V</b><br></center><br>A writ of mandamus is equally unavailing because there is evidently another "plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> This, of course, is the processing of his claims by the Bureau of Internal Revenue and the Department of Finance, and their final resolution by the Secretary of Finance.<br><br>Petitioner's own recollection of antecedents reveals his initial attempt at complying with the prescribed procedure with the Bureau of Internal Revenue, but also his own impatience for these pending proceedings. This Court cannot indulge his impetuosity for proceedings in progress. It cannot legitimize a manifest attempt at infringing statutorily institutionalized processes.<br><br>The availability of a more basic recourse ahead of a Petition for Mandamus before this Court similarly demonstrates that petitioner failed to exhaust administrative remedies. Apart from his non-compliance with the specific requirements of Rule 65, Section 3, petitioner's failure to exhaust administrative remedies represents a distinct ground for dismissing the present Petition as it effectively lacks a cause of action:<br><blockquote>Under the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies, recourse through court action cannot prosper until after all such administrative remedies have first been exhausted. If remedy is available within the administrative machinery, this should be resorted to before resort can be made to courts. It is settled that non-observance of the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies results in lack of cause of action, which is one of the grounds in the Rules of Court justifying the dismissal of the complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>The need for petitioner to have previously exhausted administrative remedies is congruous with the Bureau of Internal Revenue's and the Finance Secretary's preeminent competence to consider the merits of his claims. Indeed, between this Court on the one hand, and the Bureau of Internal Revenue and the Department of Finance on the other, the latter are in a better position to ascertain whether or not the information supplied by an informer has actually been pivotal to the discovery of tax offenses, and the conviction and punishment of offenders. Having direct access to their own records, they are in the best position to know if the information supplied to them is novel, not having been previously within their knowledge or not otherwise having been the subject of previous proceedings. Petitioner's direct recourse to this Court is an invitation for it to run afoul with the doctrine of primary jurisdiction:<br><blockquote>In cases involving specialized disputes, the practice has been to refer the same to an administrative agency of special competence in observance of the doctrine of primary jurisdiction. The Court has ratiocinated that it cannot or will not determine a controversy involving a question which is within the jurisdiction of the administrative tribunal prior to the resolution of that question by the administrative tribunal, where the question demands the exercise of sound administrative discretion requiring the special knowledge, experience and services of the administrative tribunal to determine technical and intricate matters of fact, and a uniformity of ruling is essential to comply with the premises of the regulatory statute administered. The objective of the doctrine of primary jurisdiction is to guide a court in determining whether it should refrain from exercising its jurisdiction until after an administrative agency has determined some question or some aspect of some question arising in the proceeding before the court. It applies where claim is originally cognizable in the courts and comes into play whenever enforcement of the claim requires the resolution of issues which, under a regulatory scheme, has been placed within the special competence of an administrative body; in such case, the judicial process is suspended pending referral of such issues to the administrative body for its view.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b>VI</b><br></div><br>This Court's competence to issue writs of mandamus does not also mean that petitioner was free to come to this Court and ignore the concurrent jurisdiction of inferior courts equally competent to entertain petitions for mandamus. It is basic that "[a]lthough th[is] Court, [the] Court of Appeals and the Regional Trial Courts have concurrent jurisdiction to issue writs of certiorari, prohibition, mandamus, quo warranto, habeas corpus and injunction, such concurrence does not give the petitioner unrestricted freedom of choice of court forum":<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><blockquote>The Supreme Court is a court of last resort, and must so remain if it is to satisfactorily perform the functions assigned to it by the fundamental charter and immemorial tradition. It cannot and should not be burdened with the task of dealing with causes in the first instance. Its original jurisdiction to issue the so-called extraordinary writs should be exercised only where absolutely necessary or where serious and important reasons exist therefor. Hence, that jurisdiction should generally be exercised relative to actions or proceedings before the Court of Appeals, or before constitutional or other tribunals, bodies or agencies whose acts for some reason or another, are not controllable by the Court of Appeals. Where the issuance of an extraordinary writ is also within the competence of the Court of Appeals or a Regional Trial Court, it is in either of these courts that the specific action for the writ's procurement must be presented. This is and should continue to be the policy in this regard, a policy that courts and lawyers must strictly observe.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b>VII</b><br></div><br>Finally, petitioner's own pleadings and annexes, a prior resolution of this Court, and newspaper accounts reveal that the present Petition is but one of petitioner's many applications for informer's rewards owing to the recovery of the Marcos family's and their cronies' ill-gotten wealth.<br><br>It is incorrect to say that the present Petition is merely the latest development in the linear and logical progression of the claims that petitioner initially asserted in his March 11, 1987 letters to Atty. Pitargue. For one, petitioner admits that the present Petition was filed while the claims he lodged before former Secretary Teves and former Treasurer Tan were still pending resolution. Ahead of his claims before them, as well as those before President Macapagal-Arroyo and Commissioner Bu単ag, petitioner interjected himself in at least two (2) cases being tried in the Sandiganbayan. A review of this Court's own resolutions also reveals that he had filed before this Court another petition for mandamus, docketed as G.R. No. 202556, which this Court dismissed in its September 12, 2012 Resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Similarly, a cursory search for past news reports reveals that the Commission on Audit has denied petitioner's claim for an informer's reward.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>Clearly then, petitioner has engaged in willful and deliberate forum足-shopping. Consistent with Rule 7, Section 5 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> this is another reason for dismissing the present Petition.<br><br>While this Court appreciates active citizen participation in addressing the iniquities of public officials, it must underscore the need to comply with procedural and substantive standards set by law for the grant of remedies. The availability of reliefs is not a matter of personal preference, but of order and judicial economy, and due process.<br><br>The present Petition could have been dismissed outright for its readily discernible flaws. This Court has, nevertheless, gone out of its way to painstakingly explain the plethora of grounds for dismissal. Its indulgence of petitioner through this extended opinion is made with the hope that an example is set for the public and for members of the legal profession to be more judicious in availing of reliefs and that a message is sent to tribunals, administrative officers, and courts to be more circumspect in their consideration of cases.<br><br>This Decision is rendered with a stem warning for petitioner not to trifle with court actions. Frivolous litigation translates to injudicious delays, hampers the resolution of more meritorious cases, and compels courts and tribunals to unnecessarily expend themselves. Its ultimate result is a weakening of the courts' and tribunals' capacity to effectively and timely dispense justice.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition is <b>DISMISSED</b> for lack of merit.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Velasco, Jr., (Chairperson), Bersamin, Martires</i>, and <i>Tijam, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><br><hr width="60%" align="center" noshade="noshade" size="1"><br><div style="text-align: right;">August 1, 2018<br></div><br><center><b>NOTICE OF JUDGMENT</b><br></center><br>Sirs / Mesdames:<br><br>Please take notice that on <u><b>July 23, 2018</b></u> a Decision, copy attached hereto, was rendered by the Supreme Court in the above-entitled case, the original of which was received by this Office on August 1, 2018 at 10:40 a.m.<br><br><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr> <td width="75%"> <br></td><td width="25%"><div align="center">Very truly yours, </div></td> </tr><tr><td></td> <td><div align="center"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td><div align="center"><strong>(SGD)</strong></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td><div align="center"><strong>WILFREDO V.
