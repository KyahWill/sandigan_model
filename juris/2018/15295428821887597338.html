The trial court gave credence to the testimony of lone prosecution witness Sario, stating that he testified in a straightforward manner and categorically identified Hesson. Likewise, there is nothing that indicates any improper motive on Sario's part to falsely impute an offense as grave as murder to Hesson. The dispositive portion of the Judgment reads:<br><blockquote><i>WHEREFORE</i>, premises considered, the court finds accused HESSON CALLAO guilty beyond reasonable doubt as principal for the crime of Murder as defined and penalized under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code and is accordingly sentenced to <i>Reclusion Perpetua</i> and to pay the cost.<br><br>Accused is also ordered to pay the amount of P15,000.00 as funeral expenses; P50,000.00 for loss of life and P50,000.00 [as] moral damages.<br><br>Considering that accused JUNELLO AMAD has remained at large[,] send this case as to him to the ARCHIVES and let there be issued an Alias Warrant of Arrest addressed to the Chief of Police, PNP, Tayasan, Negros Oriental; Provincial Director, PNP, Agan-an, Sibulan, Negros Oriental and to the Chief, NBI of Dumaguete, Bacolod, Cebu and Manila for the arrest of the said JUNELLO AMAD in the event he is sighted.<br><br>SO PROMULGATED in open Court this 26<sup>th</sup> day of January 2015 at Bais City, Philippines.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> (Italics in the original)<br></blockquote>Hesson appealed to the CA <i>via Notice of Appeal</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Hesson filed his <i>Brief</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> dated August 26, 2015, while the People, through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), filed its <i>Brief</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> dated January 22, 2016. In a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> dated June 15, 2016, the CA considered Hesson to have waived his right to file a Reply Brief.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br><i>Ruling of the CA</i><br><br>In the assailed Decision, the CA affirmed the trial court's conviction with modification only as to the damages awarded, to wit:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the instant appeal is <b>DENIED</b>. The assailed Judgment dated January 26, 2015 of Branch 45 of the Regional Trial Court of Bais City in Crim. Case No. 07-25-T is hereby <b>AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION</b>. Civil indemnity and moral damages awarded to the heirs of Fernando Adlawan are <b>INCREASED</b> to P75,000.00 each. Exemplary damages are also <b>AWARDED</b> in the amount of P30,000.00. The grant of funeral expenses in the amount of P15,000.00 is <b>RETAINED</b>.

The issues, being interrelated, shall be jointly discussed below.<br><br><i>The evidence sufficiently establishes Hesson's guilt beyond reasonable doubt for the crime of Murder.</i><br><br>The prosecution was able to adequately establish the guilt of Hesson of the crime charged.<br><br><i>First</i>, the testimony of Sario, the lone witness for the prosecution, suffices to establish the culpability of Hesson for Murder qualified by treachery. Sario clearly narrated the details of the incident and positively identified Hesson as one of the assailants. In a simple, spontaneous and straightforward manner, Sario recounted the disturbing manner by which the victim was killed and his body violated, thus:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td colspan="2"><div align="justify">[Pros.

Hesson's own testimony points to the absence of such ill-motive, thus:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">Q </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">What about you and Sario, are you friends or acquaintance? </div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A </div></td><td><div align="justify">We are not friends.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q </div></td><td><div align="justify">Before July 15, 2006 do you have any quarrel or misunderstanding with Sario Joaquin?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A </div></td><td><div align="justify">No.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q </div></td><td><div align="justify">What about your family and the family of Sario?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A </div></td><td><div align="justify">None.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>In the absence of proof to the contrary, the presumption is that the witness was not moved by ill-will and was untainted by bias, and thus worthy of belief and credence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br><i>Fourth</i>, Hesson's immediate departure from the scene of the crime and successful effort to elude arrest until his apprehension almost two (2) years after is hardly consistent with his claim of innocence. Flight from the scene of the crime and failure to immediately surrender militate against Hesson's contention of innocence "since an innocent person will not hesitate to take prompt and necessary action to exonerate himself of the crime imputed to him."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br><i>Fifth</i>, the Court finds no reason to disturb the findings of the trial court on the credibility of the witnesses, which findings were likewise affirmed by the CA. Indeed, there is no showing that said findings are tainted with arbitrariness or oversight of some fact or circumstance of weight and influence. When it comes to credibility, the trial court's assessment deserves great weight, and may even be conclusive and binding, as it is in the best position to make such determination, being the one who has personally heard the accused and the witnesses. In <i>People v. Gabrino</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> the Court ruled:<br><blockquote>We have held time and again that "<b>the trial court's assessment of the credibility of a witness is entitled to great weight, sometimes even with finality</b>." As We have reiterated in the recent <i>People v. Combate</i>, <b>where there is no showing that the trial court overlooked or misinterpreted some material facts or that it gravely abused its discretion, then We do not disturb and interfere with its assessment of the facts and the credibility of the witnesses. This is clearly because the judge in the trial court was the one who personally heard the accused and the witnesses, and observed their demeanor as well as the manner in which they testified during trial</b>. Accordingly, the trial court, or more particularly, the RTC in this case, is in a better position to assess and weigh the evidence presented during trial.<br><br>xxx To reiterate this time-honored doctrine and well-entrenched principle, We quote from <i>People v. Robert Dinglasan</i>, thus:<br><br>In the matter of credibility of witnesses, we reiterate the familiar and well-entrenched rule that the factual findings of the trial court should be respected. <b>The judge <i>a quo</i> was in a better position to pass judgment on the credibility of witnesses, having personally heard them when they testified and observed their deportment and manner of testifying.</b> It is doctrinally settled that the evaluation of the testimony of the witnesses by the trial court is received on appeal with the highest respect, <b>because it had the direct opportunity to observe the witnesses on the stand and detect if they were telling the truth. This assessment is binding upon the appellate court in the absence of a clear showing that it was reached arbitrarily or that the trial court had plainly overlooked certain facts of substance or value that if considered might affect the result of the case</b>. (Emphasis Ours)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> (Additional emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><i>Sixth</i>, Hesson's defense of denial cannot prevail over Sario's positive identification of Hesson as one of the assailants. To be believed, denial must be buttressed by strong evidence of non-culpability. Otherwise, it is purely self-serving and without merit. Greater weight is given to the categorical identification of the accused by the prosecution witness than to the accused's plain denial of participation in the commission of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> In the instant case, Hesson failed to adduce evidence to support his denial and overcome the testimony of the prosecution witness. Denial, unsubstantiated by any credible evidence, deserves no weight in law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>In sum, the prosecution more than sufficiently established the participation of Hesson in the crime charged.<br><br><i>Hesson is liable for Murder, not for an impossible crime.</i><br><br>Without admitting his guilt, Hesson argues that he should only be convicted of committing an impossible crime. Allegedly, he cannot be held liable for Murder because it was legally impossible for him to kill Fernando as the latter was already dead when Hesson stabbed him.<br><br>The Court is not convinced.<br><br>Impossible crime is defined and penalized under paragraph 2, Article 4 in relation to Article 59, both of the RPC to wit:<br><blockquote>ART. 4. <i>Criminal liability</i>. - Criminal liability shall be incurred:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>2. By any person performing an act which would be an offense against persons or property, were it not for the <b>inherent impossibility of its accomplishment</b> or on account of the employment of inadequate to ineffectual means.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>ART. 59. <i>Penalty to be imposed in case of failure to commit the crime because the means employed or the aims sought are impossible</i>. - When the person intending to commit an offense has already performed the acts for the execution of the same but nevertheless the crime was not produced by reason of the fact that the act intended was by its nature one of impossible accomplishment or because the means employed by such person are essentially inadequate to produce the result desired by him, the court, having in mind the social danger and the degree of criminality shown by the offender, shall impose upon him the penalty of <i>arresto mayor</i> or a fine from 200 to 500 pesos. (Emphasis supplied; italics in the original)<br></blockquote>Thus, the requisites of an impossible crime are: (1) that the act performed would be an offense against persons or property; (2) that the act was done with evil intent; and <b>(3) that its accomplishment was inherently impossible, or the means employed was either inadequate or ineffectual</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>The third element, inherent impossibility of accomplishing the crime, was explained more clearly by the Court in the case of <i>Intod v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> in this wise:<br><blockquote>Under this article, the act performed by the offender cannot produce an offense against persons or property because: (1) the commission of the offense is inherently impossible of accomplishment; or (2) the means employed is either (a) inadequate or (b) ineffectual.<br><br>That the offense cannot be produced because the commission of the offense is inherently impossible of accomplishment is the focus of this petition. To be impossible under this clause, the act intended by the offender must be by its nature one impossible of accomplishment. There must be either (1) legal impossibility, or (2) physical impossibility of accomplishing the intended act in order to qualify the act as an impossible crime.<br><br><b>Legal impossibility occurs where the intended acts, even if completed, would not amount to a crime.</b> xxx<br><br>x x x x<br><br><b>The impossibility of killing a person already dead falls in this category.</b><br><br>On the other hand, factual impossibility occurs when extraneous circumstances unknown to the actor or beyond his control prevent the consummation of the intended crime. xxx<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>To support his theory that what was committed was an impossible crime, Hesson cites the following testimony of Sario:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">Q</div></td><td width="95%"> <div align="justify">And it was followed by the stab using a bolo?<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A </div></td><td><div align="justify">Yes.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q</div></td><td> <div align="justify">And he was hit at the side of the body?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q </div></td><td><div align="justify">Yes.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q </div></td><td><div align="justify">And you saw Fernando did not move anymore with that blow?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A </div></td><td><div align="justify">Not anymore.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q </div></td><td><div align="justify">And you think that he is already dead?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A</div></td><td> <div align="justify">Yes.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q </div></td><td><div align="justify">About how many minutes when Hesson delivered the stabbing blow?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A </div></td><td><div align="justify">About five (5) minutes.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q </div></td><td><div align="justify">So five minutes after he is motionless.

While Sario testified that he thought Fernando was already dead after he was hacked by Junello because the former was already lying on the ground motionless, this statement cannot sufficiently support the conclusion that, indeed, Fernando was already dead when Hesson stabbed him. Sario's opinion of Femando's death was arrived at by merely looking at the latter's body. No other act was done to ascertain this, such as checking of Fernando's pulse, heartbeat or breathing.<br><br>Likewise, considering that Sario was in the middle of a surely stressful and frightful event, he cannot be expected to have focused enough and be fit to determine if Fernando was indeed dead when Sario thought he was. In other words, Sario's opinion of Femando's death at that point in time could have easily been just an erroneous estimation coming from a very flustered witness.<br><br>More importantly, even assuming that it was Junello who killed Fernando and that the latter was already dead when he was stabbed by Hesson, Hesson is still liable for murder because of the clear presence of conspiracy between Hesson and Junello. As such, Junello's acts are likewise, legally, Hesson's acts.<br><br>Hesson, however, challenges the trial court's finding of conspiracy, arguing that the elements of the same were not established with proof beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>The argument is untenable.<br><br>Conspiracy exists when two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it. Its elements, like the physical acts constituting the crime itself, must be proved beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> The essence of conspiracy is the unity of action and purpose.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> Direct proof is not essential to prove conspiracy for it may be deduced from the acts of the accused before, during and after the commission of the crime charged, from which it may be indicated that there is common purpose to commit the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>In this case, conspiracy is evident from the series of acts of accused Hesson and Junello, which, when taken together, reveal a commonality and unity of criminal design. The Court quotes, in agreement, the brief narration of events by the CA which clearly shows unity of criminal action and purpose between the two accused:<br><blockquote>xxx First, Amad and Callao hatched the plan to kill Fernando in the flea market; thereafter, they went to Fernando's house in Colasisi. Amad pretended to borrow a lighter from Fernando who, after handing out a lighter, was unknowingly struck on the nape. Then, Amad hacked Fernando. After Fernando fell on the ground, Callao jumped in and stabbed Fernando's chest with a knife. Thereafter, Callao sliced open Fernando's chest and took out his heart. Amad then took his turn and sliced up Fernando's body to take out his liver. All these acts clearly reveal conspiracy. Amad and Callao committed what they agreed to do - to kill Fernando.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br></blockquote>With conspiracy attending, collective liability attaches to the conspirators Hesson and Junello and the Court shall not speculate on the extent of their individual participation in the Murder. Hesson's defense of impossible crime is thus completely unavailing. As extensively explained by the Court in the landmark case of <i>People v. Peralta</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup>:<br><blockquote><b>Once an express or implied conspiracy is proved, all of the conspirators are liable as co-principals regardless of the extent and character of their respective active participation in the commission of the crime or crimes perpetrated in furtherance of the conspiracy because in contemplation of <i>law the act of one is the act of all</i>.</b> The foregoing rule is anchored on the sound principle that "when two or more persons unite to accomplish a criminal object, whether through the physical volition of one, or all, proceeding severally or collectively, each individual whose evil will actively contributes to the wrong-doing is in law responsible for the whole, the same as though performed by himself alone." Although it is axiomatic that no one is liable for acts other than his own, "when two or more persons agree or conspire to commit a crime, each is responsible for all the acts of the others, done in furtherance of the agreement or conspiracy." The imposition of collective liability upon the conspirators is clearly explained in one case where this Court held that<br><blockquote>". . . it is impossible to graduate the separate liability of each (conspirator) without taking into consideration the close and inseparable relation of each of them with the criminal act, for the commission of which they all acted by common agreement. . . The crime must therefore in view of the solidarity of the act and intent which existed between the . . . accused, be regarded as the act of the band or party created by them, and they are all equally responsible. . ."<br></blockquote><b>Verily, the moment it is established that the malefactors conspired and confederated in the commission of the felony proved, collective liability of the accused conspirators attaches by reason of the conspiracy, and the court shall not speculate nor even investigate as to the actual degree of participation of each of the perpetrators present at the scene of the crime.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> (Emphasis supplied; italics in the original)<br></blockquote>The Court, therefore, sustains the findings of the trial court, as affirmed by the CA, that Hesson is guilty beyond reasonable doubt for the killing of Fernando. Treachery was proven by the prosecution and the same qualifies the killing to Murder under Article 248<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> of the RPC, the elements of which are: (1) that a person was killed; (2) that the accused killed him; (3) that the killing was attended by any of the qualifying circumstances mentioned in Article 248; and (4) the killing is not parricide or infanticide.<br><br>On the qualifying circumstance of treachery, the same was established. The essence of treachery is a swift and unexpected attack on an unarmed victim without the slightest provocation on the part of the victim. It is deemed present in the commission of the crime, when two conditions concur, namely, that the means, methods, and forms of execution employed gave the person attacked no opportunity to defend himself or to retaliate; and that such means, methods, and forms of execution were deliberately and consciously adopted by the accused without danger to his person.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> In this case, Fernando was unarmed and totally unaware of the imminent danger to his life. Junello asked for a lighter deliberately to catch Fernando off guard. When Fernando handed the lighter, he was suddenly hacked and thereafter stabbed to death. Fernando had no foreboding of any danger, threat or harm upon his life at the time and occasion that he was attacked. Treachery was attendant not only because of the suddenness of the attack but likewise due to the absence of opportunity to repel the same.<br><br>Thus, considering all the foregoing, Hesson's conviction of the crime of murder must stand.<br><br>Under Article 248 of the RPC, the penalty for the crime of Murder qualified by treachery is <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death. As there were no aggravating or mitigating circumstances that attended the commission of the crime, the Court affirms the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> imposed by the trial court and affirmed by the CA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br><br>Finally, with respect to the award of damages, the Court affirms and finds correct and in accordance with prevailing jurisprudence,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> the amounts adjudged by the CA, to wit: (1) civil indemnity at Seventy Five Thousand Pesos (P75,000.00); (2) moral damages at Seventy Five Thousand Pesos (P75,000.00); (3) exemplary damages at Thirty Thousand Pesos (P30,000.00); and funeral expenses at the parties' stipulated amount of Fifteen Thousand Pesos (P15,000.00).
