Appellant then engaged PO1 Tan in a short conversation about his name and other personal circumstances before offering to sell a sachet of marijuana worth P200.00. PO1 Tan readily agreed to appellant's offer and accepted the sachet of suspected marijuana. In return, he handed to appellant two pieces of marked P100.00 bills. Once the exchange was completed, PO1 Tan placed his hands on his waist which served as the pre-arranged signal that the transaction had already been consummated.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>The other members of the buy-bust team immediately rushed to the scene. PO1 Tan arrested appellant and introduced himself as a police officer.

The evidence of the prosecution clearly shows that the sale of the dangerous drugs actually took place and that the marijuana subject of the charge was bought from the accused and the same marijuana was later identified in Court. x x x The delivery of the illicit drug to the poseur-buyer and the receipt by the seller of the marked money successfully consummated the buy-bust transaction. x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>x x x x<br><br>Moreover, the result of the laboratory examination confirmed the presence of marijuana on the plastic sachet sold by the accused and those recovered from his possession after his arrest.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></blockquote><br><br>The RTC also ruled that "the chain of custody of the seized drugs was continuous and unbroken,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> since "[t]he key persons who came in direct contact with the [marijuana] we represented in court and corroborated each other's testimony on how the seized drugs changed hands establishing an unbroken chain of custody."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Accordingly, the RTC sentenced appellant to suffer the penalties of: a) life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000.00 for violation of Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 in Criminal Case No. 75-2010; and b) imprisonment from twelve (12) years and one (1) day to fourteen (14) years and eight (8) months and a fine of P300,000.00 for violation of Section 11, Article II of RA 9165 in Criminal Case No. 76-2010.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Appellant thereafter appealed the RTC Decision before the CA.<br><br><b><i> Ruling of the Court of Appeals</i></b><br><br>In its Decision dated March 23, 2015, the CA affirmed the assailed RTC Decision <i> in toto.</i> It upheld the RTC's findings that the prosecution was able to sufficiently establish all the elements of the crimes charged.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>The CA noted, too, that the chain of custody over the seized marijuana was sufficiently established by the prosecution, <i> viz.:</i><br><br><blockquote>Certainly, the links in the case at bar were duly established. <i> <b>First,</b> </i> PO1 Tan seized the marijuana from appellant. <i> <b>Second,</b> </i> PO1 Tan and PO1 Mateo testified that they personally marked the plastic sachets of marijuana they confiscated before handing the same to their lead investigator, SPO2 delos Reyes. <i> <b>Third</b></i><b>,</b> SPO[2] delos Reyes rendered his testimony to establish the third link in the chain of custody when he testified that he prepared a request for laboratory examination. <i> <b>Fourth,</b> </i> Forensic Chemist, Arlyn Dascil, testified that she is the forensic chemist assigned to the PNP Crime Laboratory, Olongapo City. She examined the specimens subject of the instant case which yielded positive result for marijuana and x x x that upon request of the Office of the Prosecutor, the specimens subject of the instant case were handed by the evidence custodian of the PNP Crime Laboratory, Olongapo City to the Office of the Prosecutor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></blockquote><br><br>Aggrieved, appellant filed the present appeal.<br><br><div align="CENTER"><b>The Issues</b></div><br><br>Appellant raises the following issues for the Court's resolution:<br><br><i> First</i>, whether the CA committed an error when it disregarded the inconsistency in the testimonies of the prosecution's witnesses as to the place of marking of the seized items;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br><i> Second, </i> whether the integrity and evidentiary value of the confiscated drugs had been preserved, considering the arresting officers' failure to mark the seized items immediately at the place of arrest;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>And <i> third, </i> whether the chain of custody over the seized items was sufficiently established, given the prosecution's failure to present a detailed account as regards the handling of said items from the time they were confiscated up to their presentation in court during the trial.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br><div align="CENTER"><b>The Court's Ruling</b></div><br><br>For prosecutions involving dangerous drugs, we have consistently held that "the dangerous drug itself constitutes the <i> corpus delicti </i> of the offense and the fact of its existence is vital to sustain a judgment of conviction beyond reasonable doubt."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> In other words, "the identity of the dangerous drug [must] be established beyond reasonable doubt."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> "Such proof requires an unwavering exactitude that the dangerous drug presented in court as evidence against the accused is the same as that [was] seized from him."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>However, "the presentation of evidence establishing the elements of the offenses of illegal sale and possession of dangerous drugs <i> alone </i> is insufficient to secure or sustain a conviction under RA 9165."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Given the unique characteristics of dangerous drugs which render them <i> not readily identifiable,</i> it is essential to show that the identity and integrity of the seized drugs have been preserved. Thus, we explained in <i> People v. Denoman</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> that:<br><br><blockquote>A successful prosecution for the sale of illegal drugs requires more than the perfunctory presentation of evidence establishing each element of the crime: the identities of the buyer and seller, the transaction or sale of the illegal drug and the existence of the <i>corpus delicti</i>.&nbsp; In securing or sustaining a conviction under RA No. 9165, the intrinsic worth of these pieces of evidence, especially the identity and integrity of the <i>corpus delicti,</i> must definitely be shown to have been preserved. This requirement necessarily arises from the illegal drug's unique characteristic that renders it indistinct, not readily identifiable, and easily open to tampering, alteration or substitution either by accident or otherwise. <b>Thus, to remove any doubt or uncertainty on the identity and integrity of the seized drug, evidence must definitely show that the illegal drug presented in court is the same illegal drug actually recovered from the accused-appellant; otherwise, the prosecution for possession or for drug pushing under RA No. 9165 fails.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><br>Section 21, Article II of RA 9165 provides the procedural safeguards that the apprehending team should observe in the handling of seized illegal drugs in order to preserve their identity and integrity as evidence. "As indicated by their <i> mandatory terms,</i> strict compliance with the prescribed procedure is essential and the prosecution must show compliance in every case."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>The procedure under Section 21, par. 1 of RA 9165, as amended by RA 10640,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> is as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Section 21. Custody and Disposition of Confiscated, Seized, and/or Surrendered Dangerous Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous Drugs, Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, Instruments/Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment. — The PDEA shall take charge and have custody of all dangerous drugs, x x x so confiscated, seized and/or surrendered, for proper disposition in the following manner:<br><br>(1) The apprehending team having initial custody and control of the dangerous drugs, x x x shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, conduct a physical inventory of the seized items and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the persons from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, with an elected public official and a representative of the National Prosecution Service or the media who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof; <i> Provided, </i> T<b>hat the physical inventory and photograph shall be conducted at the place where the search warrant is served; or at the nearest police station or at the nearest office of the apprehending officer/team, whichever is practicable, in case of warrantless seizures:</b> <i> Provided, finally, </i> That noncompliance of these requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and invalid such seizures and custody over said items. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><br>After a thorough review of the records, we find that the buy-bust team failed to <i> strictly </i> comply with the prescribed procedure under Section 21, par. 1. While the amendment of RA 9165 by RA 10640 now allows the conduct of physical inventory at the <i> nearest police station, </i> the buy-bust team, in this case, brought the appellant and the seized items to Police Station A<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> instead of Police Station 5 which was the closest police station to the place of arrest,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> per the instruction of their team leader, PSI Javier.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Although it is true that "non-compliance with the prescribed procedures under Section 21, par. 1, does not, as it should not, <i> automatically </i> result in an accused's acquittal,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> the saving mechanism provided in the last sentence of Section 21, par. 1, Article II of RA 9165, as amended, only operates "under justifiable grounds, and as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>It is therefore incumbent upon the prosecution to: a) recognize and explain the lapse or lapses committed by the apprehending team; and b) demonstrate that the integrity and evidentiary value of the evidence seized had been preserved, despite the failure to follow the procedural safeguards under RA 9165.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>Unfortunately, the prosecution failed not only to recognize and explain the buy-bust team's non-compliance with Section 21, particularly on the immediate marking of the seized items, but also to adduce evidence establishing the chain of custody over said items that would unequivocally demonstrate that the illegal drugs presented in court were the same illegal drugs actually recovered from appellant during the buy-bust operation.<br><br>In <i> People v. Bartolini,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> we strongly emphasized the prosecution's duty to show an unbroken chain of custody over the seized items to ensure that unnecessary doubts on the identity of the evidence – the dangerous drugs – are removed, <i> viz.:</i><br><br><blockquote>x x x The prosecution has the duty to prove every link in the chain, from the moment the dangerous drug was seized from the accused until the time it is offered in court as evidence. <b>The marking of the seized item, the first link in the chain of custody, is crucial in proving an unbroken chain of custody as it is the starting point in the custodial link that succeeding handlers of the evidence will use as a reference point.</b> The succeeding links in the chain are the different processes the seized item will go through under the possession of different persons. This is why it is vital that each link is sufficiently proven to be unbroken – to obviate switching, planting, or contaminating the evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><br>Thus, the following links must be established by the prosecution:<i> "[<b>first,</b>] </i> the seizure and marking, if practicable, of the illegal drug recovered from the accused by the apprehending officer; <i> [<b>second</b>,] </i> the turnover of the illegal drug seized by the apprehending officer to the investigating officer; <i> [<b>third</b>,] </i> the turnover by the investigating officer of the illegal drug to the forensic chemist for laboratory examination; and <i>[<b>fourth</b>,] </i> the turnover and submission of the marked illegal drug seized from the forensic chemist to the court."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>In this case, we find that the prosecution failed to establish the <b>first link</b> in the chain of custody. As previously discussed, there was a failure to mark the drugs <i> immediately </i> after they were allegedly seized from appellant. The items were marked only at Police Station A, and the prosecution offered no reasonable explanation as to <i> (a) </i> why the items were not immediately marked after seizure – PO1 Mateo merely stated in passing that there was a commotion because it was a public place;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> and <i>(b) </i> why the buy-bust team brought the seized items to Police Station A instead of Police Station 5 which was closer to the place of arrest.<br><br>We consider, too, the <i> contradictory </i> statements given by PO1 Tan, PO1 Mateo and SPO2 Delos Reyes as regards the place of marking of the seized items which, regrettably, were not clarified by the prosecution – both PO1 Tan and PO1 Mateo testified that the marking had been done at Police Station A,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>&nbsp; while SPO2 Delos Reyes stated during his cross-examination that the seized items were marked and turned over to him by PO1 Tan and PO1 Mateo "while still at the scene."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>The prosecution's evidence relating to the <b>third link</b> in the chain of custody also has loopholes.

Clearly, the prosecution failed to disclose the identities of: <i> (a) </i> the person who had custody of the seized items after its turnover by SPO2 Delos Reyes, <i>(b) </i>the person who turned over the items to Forensic Chemist Dascil, and <i> (c) </i> the person who had custody thereof after they were examined by the forensic chemist and before they were presented in court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>We note further the <i> unexplained delay </i> in the turnover of the seized items from the investigating officer to the forensic chemist. Per the records, it appears that SPO2 Delos Reyes submitted the Request for Drug Test<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> and urine sample of appellant to the PNP Crime Laboratory on March 3, 2010, at 7:10 p.m,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> but he only turned over the seized drugs to the PNP Crime Laboratory the following morning, at 11:15 a.m.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> In this regard, the prosecution also failed to disclose the person who had custody of the seized items after they were inventoried and photographed on the night of March 3, 2010 up to the time they were turned over to the PNP Crime Laboratory.<br><br>The <b>fourth link</b> in the chain of custody likewise presents a highly irregular circumstance in the prosecution's evidence. For clarity and precision, the forensic chemist's testimony, as stipulated by the prosecution and the defense, is quoted below:<br><br><blockquote><ol><li>That Arlyn Dascil is a Forensic Chemist assigned to the PNP Crime Laboratory, Olongapo City;<br><br></li><li>That she examined the specimen subject matter of these cases;<br><br></li><li>That based on her examination[,] the specimen subject matter of these cases all turned positive for marijuana as shown by the Chemistry Report;<br><br></li><li><b>That upon the request of the Prosecutor['s] Office(,) the specimen subject matter of these cases were turned over by the Evidence Custodian of the PNP Crime Laboratory, Olongapo City to the Prosecutor['s] Office.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</li></ol></blockquote><br><br>In <i>People v. De Guzman.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> we ruled that the City Prosecutor's Office has no authority to take custody of dangerous drugs before they are brought before the court, <i> viz.</i>:<br><br><blockquote>It appears, based on the prosecution's evidence no less, that for reasons unknown, the PNP Crime Laboratory agreed to turn over custody of the seized items to an <i> unnamed </i> receiving person at the City Prosecutor's Office <i> before </i> they were submitted as evidence to the trial court. <b>It should be emphasized that the City Prosecutor's Office is not, nor has it ever been, a part of the chain of custody of seized dangerous drugs. It has absolutely no business in taking custody of dangerous drugs before they are brought before the court.</b> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><br>At this point, the chain of custody was obviously <i> broken, </i> not only because of the PNP Crime Laboratory 's flagrant deviation from the prescribed procedure in turning over the seized items to the City Prosecutor's Office, but also due to the dire lack of information as to the handling and safe-keeping of the said items from the time they were received by a certain "Ligaya Lopez," the receiving clerk in the City Prosecutor's Office,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> up to the time they were presented in court.<br><br>It is settled that "the failure of the authorities to immediately mark the seized drugs raises reasonable doubt on the authenticity of the <i> corpus delicti </i> and suffices to rebut the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> Such presumption, too, cannot arise in cases where the questioned official acts are <b><i> patently </i> irregular</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>Clearly, the lower courts committed a grave error in applying the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties in the prosecution's favor, given the <i> unexplained </i> procedural lapses committed by the police in handling and safe-keeping of the seized marijuana and the <i> serious </i> evidentiary gaps in the chain of its custody.<br><br>The totality of these circumstances leads us to inevitably conclude that the prosecution fell short in proving beyond reasonable doubt that appellant was indeed guilty of the crimes charged.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the appeal is <b>GRANTED</b>.
