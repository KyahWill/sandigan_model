				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Assailed in this appeal is the July 21, 2014 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR-H.C. No. 05891 which affirmed with modification the August 31, 2012 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 55, Irosin, Sorsogon, finding appellant Romulo Bandoquillo y Opalda guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape.<br><br><b><i>The Antecedent Facts</i></b><br><br>Appellant was charged for the crime of rape in an Information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated March 10, 2004 which reads:<br><blockquote>That on or about early in the morning of December 27, 2003, x x x Province of Sorsogon, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, armed with a knife and by the use of force, threat and intimidation whilst inside their residence, with lewd designs, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously, have carnal knowledge with his own daughter, "AAA,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> 14 years of age, a minor below 18 years of age and a child who cannot protect herself from abuse, against her will and consent, where acts and deeds by the accused degrades, demeans and debases her dignity as a child and as a human being, to her damage and prejudice.<br><br>The commission of the offense is further aggravated by the fact that the offender is her own father and am1ed with a knife.<br></blockquote>During his arraignment on July 7. 2004, appellant entered a plea of not guilty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Trial thereafter ensued.<br><br><b><i>Version of the Prosecution</i></b><br><br>The prosecution's version of the incident as summarized by the Office of the Solicitor General is as follows:<br><br>In the early morning of December 27, 2003, "AAA," then only 14 years of age, was sleeping inside her room in their house when she was suddenly awakened by her father, herein appellant, who forcibly undressed her, touched her breasts and kissed her neck. "AAA" begged appellant not to continue with what he was doing, saying: "<i>Papa, do not do this to me, [take] pity [on] my siblings and my honor</i>." Appellant, however, disregarded his daughter's pleas and succeeded in having carnal knowledge of "AAA," against her will.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Immediately thereafter, "AAA" contacted her mother, "ZZZ," who was then residing in Manila, and disclosed what had happened to her. "ZZZ" quickly travelled back to Sorsogon, and on December 29, 2003, "AAA" and "ZZZ" reported the incident to the Department of Social Welfare and Development and to the local authorities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>"AAA" was then physically examined by Dr. Runnel John L. Rebustillo at the Irosin District Hospital.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Based on her Medical Certificate<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> dated February 16, 2004, "AAA" had healed lacerations at 1, 3, 5 &amp; 6 o'clock positions, as well as hematoma on the outer part of her vaginal canal.<br><br><b><i>Version of the Defense</i></b><br><br>The defense presented appellant as its lone witness who testified that:<br><br>On December 26, 2003, appellant instructed "AAA," who was then at their house tending to their store, that if he was not yet home by 8:30 p.m. that evening, she should close the store with the lights turned on, close the gate and go to her aunt's house across the street. But when he arrived home at 9:30 p.m., he noticed that the lights were turned off and the gate was closed. As he opened the gate, a man ran out. He asked "AAA" who the man was but the latter answered that he was just a friend. After asking for the man's identity for the fourth time, he slapped her on the left cheek which made her cry.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br><center><b>Ruling of the Regional Trial Court</b><br></center><br>In its Decision dated August 31, 2012, the RTC found appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape under Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code. It held that:<br><blockquote>A reading and a thorough review of the pertinent transcript of stenographic notes disclosed that [AAA] was in fact firm and consistent on the fact of rape committed on her by her father Romulo Bandoquillo. Her answers to the questions on direct examination, as well [as] on the grueling crossÂ­-examination of [the] defense counsel was clear, simple and natural words typical of children her age, that the accused performed on her sexual intercourse, identifying him properly and positively as the perpetrator of the act complained of.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br></blockquote>Accordingly, the RTC sentenced appellant to suffer thy penalty of <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua</span> and likewise ordered appellant to pay "AAA" P75,000.00 as civil indemnity and P75,000.00 as moral damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Appellant thereafter appealed the RTC Decision before the CA.<br><br><b><i>Ruling of the Court of Appeals</i></b><br><br>In its Decision dated July 21, 2014, the CA affirmed the assailed RTC Decision with the following modifications: a) it convicted appellant of the crime of <i>qualified</i> rape;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> b) it declared appellant ineligible for parole; c) it awarded P30,000.00 as exemplary damages in favor of "AAA;" and d) it imposed interest at six percent (6%) per annum on all awarded damages, reckoned from the date of finality of the Decision until fully paid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>The CA agreed with the RTC's findings that AAA had testified in a firm, consistent, credible and believable manner in recounting how appellant had carnal knowledge of her in the early morning of December 27, 2003.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> It explained that:<br><blockquote>Significantly, AAA never wavered in her direct testimonies on 07 December 2005 and 07 March 2007 that appellant succeeded in having carnal knowledge of her on the date of the incident. In her 07 December 2005 testimony, AAA confirmed the entry of appellant's penis into 'the labia of [her sexual] organ...' For rape to be consummated, full penetration is not necessary, as proof of the entrance of the male organ into the labia of the pudendum of the female organ suffices to consummate the crime of rape. During her direct testimony on 07 March 2007, and her testimony on cross-examination on 13 June 2007, AAA also remained consistent in her assertion that appellant 'inserted [his] penis into [her] vagina...' Contrary to the assertion of appellant, AAA consistently declared that the tape perpetrated by appellant in the early morning of 27 December [2003] was consummated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br></blockquote>On this point, the CA noted that appellant had failed to adduce evidence "to convincingly show any dubious reason or ill-motive on the part of "AAA" to falsely accuse him of such serious offense as rape."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> It thus concluded that "[i]n the absence of ill motive on the part of "AAA," appellant's denial cannot prevail over her categorical and positive testimony."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>The CA also rejected appellant's claim that his alleged act of spanking "AAA" on the eve of the rape incident had prompted her to make such false accusations. It ruled that "[m]ere disciplinary chastisement is not strong enough to make daughters in a Filipino family invent a charge that would only bring shame and humiliation upon them and their own family and make them the object of gossip."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Finally, the CA held that the crime committed by appellant against "AAA" is <span style="font-style: italic;">qualified</span> rape under Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code, given that "AAA" is under 18 years of age and the offender is a parent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Aggrieved, appellant filed the present appeal.<br><br><center><b>The Issues</b><br></center><br>Appellant raises the following issues for the Court's resolution:<br><br><i>First</i>, whether "AAA's" testimony is credible, given the inconsistency in her testimony as regards the consummation of the crime;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Arid <i>second</i>, whether "AAA's" failure to significantly resist appellant's sexual advances casts doubt on the veracity of her assertions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b><br></center><br>It is settled that "<b>when the decision hinges on the credibility of witnesses and their respective testimonies, the trial court's observations and conclusions deserve great respect and are often accorded finality</b>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> unless it is shown that the lower court had <i>overlooked, misunderstood</i> or <i>misappreciated</i> some fact or circumstance of weight which, if properly considered, would have altered the result of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> "<b>[This] rule finds an even more stringent application where said findings are sustained by the Court of Appeals.</b>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>In this case, we find no compelling reason to overturn the factual findings of the trial court, given that: a) it has <i>not</i> been shown that the RTC had overlooked, misunderstood or misappreciated facts or circumstances which would have resulted in appellant's acquittal; and b) said findings were upheld by the CA.<br><br>The records reveal that when "AAA" testified in court as regards her ordeal, she described how she was sexually abused by appellant in her own room on that fateful day of December 27, 2003, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td width="95%"><div align="center"><u>Direct Testimony on December 7, 2005<br><br></u></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td colspan="2"><div align="justify">[PROS.

As we held in <i>People v. Ortoa</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> <b>full penetration is not necessary for rape to be consummated</b>, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>x x x In any case, for rape to be consummated, full penetration is not necessary. Penile invasion necessarily entails contact with the <span style="font-style: italic;">labia</span>. <span style="font-weight: bold;">It suffices that there is proof of the entrance of the male organ into the labia of the pudendum of the female organ.</span> Penetration of the penis by entry into the lips of the vagina, even without rupture or laceration of the hymen, is enough to justify a conviction for rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br></blockquote>Note that "[w]hen the offended party is a <i>young</i> and <i>immature</i> girl between the age of 12 to 16, <i>as in this case</i>, courts are inclined to give credence to her version of the incident, considering not only her relative vulnerability but also the public humiliation to which she would be exposed by court trial if her accusation were untrue."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>In the absence of any ill-motive on the part of "AAA" that would make her testify falsely against appellant, her candid narration of the rape incident deserves full faith and credence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> "For no woman in her right mind will admit to having been raped, allow an examination of her most private parts and subject herself as well as her family to the humiliation and shame concomitant with a rape prosecution, unless the charges are true."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>We also find no merit in appellant's claim that his act of slapping "AAA" on her left cheek had prompted her to make such a false accusation against him. It is quite unbelievable for a 14 year-old girl to publicly and falsely accuse her father of rape in retaliation for such a minor disciplinary measure. After all, "[t]he burden of going through a rape prosecution is grossly out of proportion to whatever revenge the young girl would be able to exact."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Finally, we reject appellant's defense that "AAA's" "failure to significantly resist the alleged attack, viewed together with her conduct thereafter, indubitably casts doubt on her credibility and the veracity of her assertions."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Resistance is not an element of rape, and the absence thereof will <i>never</i> be tantamount to consent on the part of the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Besides, in rape committed by a relative, such as a father, <i>as in this case</i>, moral influence or ascendancy takes the place of violence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Given these circumstances, we uphold the CA's ruling convicting appellant of the crime of <b>qualified rape</b> under Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code, where the rape victim is under 18 years of age and the offender is a parent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>However, there is a need to modify the damages awarded to conform to prevailing jurisprudence. Thus, pursuant to <i>People v. Jugueta</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> appellant must pay "AAA" civil indemnity, moral damages and exemplary damages at P100,000.00 each.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appeal is <b>DISMISSED</b>.
