Consequently, as such stockholder, he would have rights, claims, shares, interest, title and participation in the real properties belonging to VIP.</p> <p> However, while Mr. Dewey Dee was indeed one of the incorporators of VIP, he is no longer a stockholder thereof. He no longer has any rights, claims, shares, interest, title and participation in VIP or any of its properties. As early as December 1980, Mr. Dewey Dee has already sold to Mr. Tee Ling Kiat all his stocks in VIP, as evidenced by a cancelled check which he issued in Mr. Tee Ling Kiat's favor. x x x</p> <p> x x x x</p> <p> Moreover, we would like to point out that even assuming that Mr. Dewey Dee is still a stockholder of VIP, at most he merely has rights, claims, shares, interest, title and participation to its shares of stocks, but not as to the real properties registered under its name, x x x It is well to note that this property is the sole and exclusive property of VIP and that there is no showing that Mr. Dewey Dee has any right, claim, share, interest, title and participation therein. It must be likewise be emphasized that VIP is a corporate entity which has a legal personality separate and distinct from Mr. Dewey Dee and/or Ms. Lily L. Dee.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p>Attached to the <em>Third-Party Claim</em> was a copy of an<em> Affidavit</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> executed by Tee Ling Kiat, attesting to the fact that he is a stockholder of VIP and that he acquired knowledge of the levy on the subject properties only through newspaper,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> as well as a photocopy of cancelled checks<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> issued by Tee Ling Kiat in Dewey Dee's favor, allegedly as payment for the purchase of the latter's shares in VIP.</p> <p> Acting on the <em>Third-Party Claim</em>, the Office of the Clerk of Court of the RTC issued a <em>Notice of Third-Party Claim</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> on March 28, 2007. Amora, who by then had substituted Ayala Corporation, posted a bond in the amount of P2,658,700.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> VIP and Tee Ling Kiat opposed the posting of the bond in an <em>Ex-Parte Motion</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>, claiming that the bond was less than the value of the property levied upon.</p><p> Nevertheless, the court approved the bond, leading VIP and Tee Ling Kiat to file an <em>Omnibus Motion</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> to declare null and void the <em>Notice of Levy on Execution</em> and all proceedings and issuances arising out of the same.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> In the <em>Omnibus Motion</em>, VIP and Tee Ling Kiat reiterated that Dewey Dee no longer had any interest in the levied property and that the bond was far less than the value of the property levied.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> </p><p> In his <em>Opposition to Third Party Claimants' Omnibus Motion</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Amora claimed that from the date of VIP's incorporation until present, no general information sheets and audited financial statements have been submitted by VIP to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Further, nowhere in the SEC records does Tee Ling Kiat's name appear as a stockholder.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Meanwhile, the case was re-raffled to the RTC Branch 59 due to the inhibition of the judge formerly hearing the case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> </p><p> <b><i>Ruling of the RTC Branch 59</i></b></p><p> The RTC, in an <em>Order</em> dated February 20, 2008, denied VIP and Tee Ling Kiat's <em>Omnibus Motion</em> and disallowed the <em>third-party claim</em> because the alleged sale of shares of stock from Dewey Dee to Tee Ling Kiat was not proven. Specifically, the RTC ruled that:</p><p> <i>First</i>, Tee Ling Kiat failed to adduce evidence to prove that the sale of shares of stock from Dewey Dee to Tee Ling Kiat had taken place in accordance with the law. The purported Deed of Sale of Shares of Stock<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> was not recorded in the stock and transfer books of VIP, as required by Section 63 of the Corporation Code.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Thus, there was no valid transfer of shares as against third persons. The RTC observed that in support of the purported sale of shares of stock, Tee Ling Kiat merely submitted a cancelled check<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> issued by Tee Ling Kiat in favor of Dewey Dee and a photocopy<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> of the Deed of Sale of Shares of Stock dated December 29, 1980.</p><p> <i>Second</i>, the SEC had revoked<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> VIP's Certificate of Registration as early as August 11, 2003<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> for failure to comply with reportorial requirements. Consequently, in accordance with Section 122 of the Corporation Code<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> which provides for the three-year period for the winding down of corporate affairs, VIP no longer had any capacity to sue when the third-party claim was instituted on March 26, 2007.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></p><p> <i>Finally</i>, the indemnity bond posted by Amora was sufficient because Tee Ling Kiat was merely claiming "rights, claims, shares, interest, title and participation"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> of Dewey Dee in the subject property, and not the entire property. </p><p> Tee Ling Kiat's<i> Motion for Reconsideration</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> of the above Order having been denied in an RTC <em>Order </em>dated June 26, 2008, Tee Ling Kiat filed a petition for <em>certiorari</em> under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court before the CA. This time, however, the petition for <em>certiorari</em> was instituted solely in Tee Ling Kiat's name.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> </p><p> <b><i>Ruling of the CA</i></b> </p><p> The CA, in the assailed <em>Decision</em> dated September 24, 2009, denied Tee Ling Kiat's petition for <em>certiorari</em>, on the ground that Tee Ling Kiat is not a real party-in-interest, especially considering that the alleged sale of Dewey Dee's shares of stock to Tee Ling Kiat has not been proven. </p><p> In particular, the CA observed that Tee Ling Kiat failed to prove to the Court the existence or veracity of the claimed Deed of Sale of Shares of Stock. The CA held that "[i]t is not sufficient to attach photocopies of the deed or payment of checks to the motion, [Tee Ling Kiat] needed to submit evidence to prove that the transaction took place."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Before the CA, Tee Ling Kiat also raised, for the first time, that he can be properly considered a trustee of VIP, entitled to hold properties on the latter's behalf. The CA observed, however, that there was no evidence produced to show that Tee Ling Kiat is a trustee of the corporation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup></p><p> Thus, the CA held that Tee Ling Kiat utterly failed: (i) to prove that he is a stockholder of VIP; and assuming he is, (ii) to show that he was authorized by the corporation for the purpose of prosecuting the claim on behalf of the corporation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup></p><p> In a <em>Resolution</em> dated May 26, 2010, the CA denied Tee Ling Kiat's motion for reconsideration for lack of merit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> In denying Tee Ling Kiat's motion for reconsideration, the CA maintained its finding that Tee Ling Kiat lacked any legal personality to file the third-party claim, and consequently, the petition for <em>certiorari</em> before the CA. </p><p> Hence, this petition.</p><p> In asking the Court to set aside the assailed CA <em>Decision</em> and <em>Resolution</em>, Tee Ling Kiat submits that:<em> first</em>, as regards the recording of the alleged sale of stocks, the burden was on Ayala Corporation to overcome the disputable presumption that VIP followed its ordinary course of business as provided for in Section 3(q), Rule 131 of the Rules of Court. Considering that the duty to record the sale of shares of stock in the books lies with VIP, Tee Ling Kiat claims that such recording "need not be proved" by him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> <i>Second</i>, that assuming Dewey Dee was still a stockholder of VIP, that what would have been the proper subjects of levy were the precise and actual shares of Dewey Dee and not the subject properties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup></p><p> Tee Ling Kiat further prays for the Court's issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) directing Amora and the sheriffs of RTC Branch 149 to immediately desist from executing the RTC <em>Orders</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> and to issue a Writ of Preliminary Injunction (WPI) after due notice and hearing.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup></p><p> In a <em>Resolution</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> dated July 7, 2010, the Court required Amora to comment on the <em>petition</em> which he did on October 15, 2010.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> In a <em>Resolution</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> dated June 13, 2011, the Court noted Tee Ling Kiat's reply.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup></p><p align="center"> <b>Issue</b></p><p> The sole issue for the Court's resolution is whether the CA committed any reversible error in issuing its <em>Decision</em> dated September 24, 2009 and <em>Resolution</em> dated May 26, 2010. </p><p align="center"><b>Our Ruling</b> </p><p> The petition lacks merit. </p><p> At the crux of determining whether the CA committed any reversible error in issuing the assailed <em>Decision</em> and <em>Resolution</em> is the question of whether it has been sufficiently proven by Tee Ling Kiat that Dewey Dee had in fact sold his shares of stock to Tee Ling Kiat in 1980, such that, as a result, Tee Ling Kiat can be considered a real party-in-interest in the <em>Third-Party Claim</em>, and consequently, in the petition for <em>certiorari</em> before the CA. </p><p> Such determination, however, inevitably necessitates a review of the probative value of the evidence adduced by Tee Ling Kiat. In this regard, the Rules of Court<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> categorically state that a Rule 45 petition shall only raise questions of law. On the one hand, a question of law arises when there is doubt as to what the law is on a certain state of facts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> On the other hand, a question of fact arises when doubt arises as to the truth or falsity of alleged facts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> Once it is clear that the resolution of an issue invites a review of the evidence presented by the parties, the question raised is one of fact<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> which this Court is precluded from reviewing in a Rule 45 petition.</p><p> Here, Tee Ling Kiat imputes error on the CA by the simple expedient of arguing that he did not personally need to prove that the sale of shares of stock between Dewey Dee and himself had in fact transpired, as the duty to record the sale in the corporate books lies with VIP. Such an argument, however, fails to recognize that the very right of Tee Ling Kiat, as a third-party claimant, to institute a<em> terceria</em> is founded on his claimed title over the levied property.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> </p><p>Consequently, although courts can exercise their limited supervisory powers in determining whether the sheriff acted correctly in executing the judgment, they may only do so if the third-party claimant has<em> unmistakably</em> established his ownership or right of possession over the subject property.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> Accordingly, if the third-party claimant's evidence does not persuade the court of the validity of his title or right possession thereto, the third-party claim will, and should be, denied.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> </p><p>Suffice it to state that the only evidence adduced by Tee Ling Kiat to support his claim that Dewey Dee's shares in VIP have been sold to him are a cancelled check<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> issued by Tee Ling Kiat in favor of Dewey Dee and a photocopy<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> of the Deed of Sale of Shares of Stock dated December 29, 1980. A photocopy of a document has no probative value and is inadmissible in evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> The records likewise do not show that Tee Ling Kiat offered any explanation as to why the original Deed of Sale of Shares of Stock could not be produced, instead alleging that because of the disputable presumption "<i>[t]hat the ordinary course of business has been followed</i>"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> provided in Section 3(q) of Rule 131 of the Rules of Court, then the burden is not on him to prove that he is a stockholder, but on Amora, to prove that he is not a stockholder.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> </p><p> This argument is off tangent. Meaning, even if it could be assumed that the sale of shares of stock contained in the photocopies had indeed transpired, such transfer is only valid as to the parties thereto, but is not binding on the corporation if the same is not recorded in the books of the corporation. Section 63 of the Corporation Code of the Philippines provides that: "<b>No transfer, x x x shall be valid, except as between the parties, until the transfer is recorded in the books of the corporation showing the names of the parties to the transaction, the date of the transfer, the number of the certificate or certificates and the number of shares transferred.</b>"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> Here, the records show that the purported transaction between Tee Ling Kiat and Dewey Dee has never been recorded in VIP's corporate books. Thus, the transfer, not having been recorded in the corporate books in accordance with law, is not valid or binding as to the corporation or as to third persons.</p><p> On a final note, the Court observes that the judgment for a sum of money dated November 29, 1990 obtained by Ayala Corporation was against the Spouses Dewey and Lily Dee in their personal capacities as sureties in the money market line transaction. Yet, in the execution of said judgment, the properties levied upon were registered in the name of VIP, a juridical entity with personality separate and distinct from Dewey Dee. It is a basic principle of law that money judgments are enforceable only against property incontrovertibly belonging to the judgment debtor,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> and certainly, a person other than the judgment debtor who claims ownership over the levied properties is not precluded from challenging the levy through any of the remedies provided for under the Rules of Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> In the pursuit of such remedies, however, the third-party must, to reiterate, unmistakably establish ownership over the levied property,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> which Tee Ling Kiat failed to do.</p><p> In as much as the validity of the third-party claim would only be relevant if the person instituting the same has established that he has a real interest in the levied property, the Court will not belabor the merits of the third-party claim in view of the conclusive determination that Tee Ling Kiat has not adduced evidence to prove that the shares of stock of Dewey Dee were indeed sold to him.</p><p> Given the foregoing, the Court finds no reversible error on the part of the CA in affirming the RTC<em> Orders</em> dated February 20, 2008 and June 26, 2008, which dismissed Tee Ling Kiat's third-party claim in Civil Case No. 40074.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup></p><p> For the reasons foregoing, the Court <strong>DENIES</strong> the<em> petition</em>.</p><p> <strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, premises considered, the instant petition for review is <strong>DENIED</strong>.
