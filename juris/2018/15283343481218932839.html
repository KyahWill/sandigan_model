On December 9, 1996, TCT No. 113359 was cancelled and the subject property was transferred in the name of the Republic of the Philippines. Corollarily, several Certificates of Land Ownership (CLOAs) were issued in favor of farmer-beneficiaries.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> </p><p> Not satisfied with the valuation of LBP, Apo filed a complaint for determination of just compensation with the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (DARAB).

No. 164195 is not applicable in the present case. The findings of the commissioners, which were considered by the RTC in awarding the just compensation of Php 130.00 per sq m due to Apo was based on evidence and standards imposed by law. Apo further claimed that there is basis to consider the valuation of Php 130.00 per sq m as just compensation since the subject property is almost at the heart of Tagum City.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></p><p> On the other hand, LBP also alleged that the Php 103.33 valuation merely copied by the CA in G.R.

The social and economic benefits contributed by the farmers and the farmworkers and by the Government to the property as well as the non-payment of taxes or loans secured from any government financing institution on the said land shall be considered as additional factors to determine its valuation.</p> </blockquote> <p> The RTC provided the following explanations in adopting the Commissioners' Report: </p><blockquote> <p> The Court is aware that the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law was enacted to promote social justice. Distributing tracts of land to the landless. Nevertheless, it cannot look with favor at the valuation of the Land Bank. The sum of 33,102.96 per hectare is too unjust and unconscionably low. This is the price of grassy, mountainous, unregistered land is hundred kilometers away from Tagum City. But the property in question is located just almost in the heart of Tagum City. As a matter of fact, the old Poblacion of Tagum town, Madaum, is situated in that part. And this very land is ideal for conversion into residential or industrial purposes. If that happens, the price will not anymore be P130.00 per [sq m] as recommended by the panel of commissioners but it will be ten fold.</p> <p> If truth be told, the only thing that hold its owners from such conversion is that this land is the source of bamboos which are used as proppings of the Cavendish bananas growing in the adjacent vast Hijo Plantations which earns by the dollars. Certainly, it will be ludicrously doing violence to everyone's sense of fairness to take that property from those who own it for a song. Situations like this call to mind [in] the words of Abraham Lincoln. Born in a log cabin and the liberator of the slaves of the United States, no doubt, he was one if not the greatest promoter of social justice of all times. Yet he said 'Governments can not enrich the poor by impoverishing the rich". To this Court, that always serves as a guiding light in cases of this sort.</p> <p> Consequently, this Court views the report of the Panel of Commissioners with ease. It finds its recommendation at P130.00 per [sq m] as just and proper.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> In the case of <i>Ramon Alfonso v. Land Bank of the Philippines and Department of Agrarian Reform</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> this Court ruled that the determination of just compensation is a judicial function. To guide the RTC-SAC in the exercise of its function, Section 17 of R.A. No. 6657 enumerates the factors required to be taken into account to correctly determine just compensation. The law likewise empowers the DAR to issue rules for its implementation. The DAR, thus, issued DAR Administrative Order (A.O) 5-98<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> incorporating the law's listed factors in determining just compensation into a basic formula<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> that contains the details that take these factors into account.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></p><p> Further, in the recent case of <i>Land Bank of the Philippines v. Miguel Omengan</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> We held that: </p><blockquote> <p> Emphatically, the Court En Banc held in the case of <i>Ramon M. Alfonso v. LBP and Department of Agrarian Reform, and also in LBP, et al. v. Heirs of Lorenzo Tañada and Expedita Ebarle</i>, that:</p> <blockquote> <p> For clarity, we restate the body of rules as follows: The factors listed under Section 17 of RA 6657 and its resulting formulas provide a uniform framework or structure for the computation of just compensation which ensures that the amounts to be paid to affected landowners are not arbitrary, absurd or even contradictory to the objectives of agrarian reform. Until and unless declared invalid in a proper case, the DAR formulas partake of the nature of statutes, which under the 2009 amendment became law itself, and thus have in their favor the presumption of legality, such that courts shall consider, and not disregard, these formulas in the determination of just compensation for properties covered by the CARP. When faced with situations which do not warrant the formula's strict application, courts may, in the exercise of their judicial discretion, relax the formula's application to fit the factual situations before them, subject only to the condition that they clearly explain in their Decision their reasons (as borne by the evidence on record) for the deviation undertaken. It is thus entirely allowable for a court to allow a landowner's claim for an amount higher than what would otherwise have been offered (based on an application of the formula) for as long as there is evidence on record sufficient to support the award.</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> The commissioners and the RTC in arriving at their conclusion took into account and meticulously considered the different factors provided for in Section 17 of R.A. No. 6657. The commissioners even found the value of Php 134.42 as just compensation higher than the value determined by the Cuervo Appraisers. The amount of Php 16.5484<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> per sq m as just compensation to Apo's 115.2179 has land is unconscionably low and unjust. It should be noted that the subject property is planted with commercial bamboos and is located almost in the heart of Tagum City.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> In fact even in the earlier case of Apo, We found that the parcels of land adjacent thereto were sold at a higher rate, specifically from a low of Php 146.02 per sq m to as high as Php 580.00 per sq m.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> </p><p> This Court, thus, finds that the just compensation for the subject property taking into account the distance of the subject property to different landmarks in Tagum City,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> the fact that it is planted with commercial bamboos, the Average of Sales Data used by the commissioners, the Deeds of Sale of properties found near and adjacent to the subject property, is hereby fixed at Php 130.00 per sq m. </p><p> The valuation of Php 103.33 as ruled by the CA, following the pronouncement of this Court in G.R. No. 164195, cannot be adopted in the present case. Note should be taken that while the subject property was mentioned in the said case, the subject property is not included in the cases appealed before this Court in G.R. No. 164195. In the said case, only Agrarian Case No. 54-2000, involving the property of Apo covered by TCT No. 11336 measuring 525.1304 has<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> and Agrarian Case No. 55-2000, involving the property of Hijo Plantation Inc. covered by TCT Nos. 10361, 10362 and 10363 measuring 805.5308 has<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> were resolved by this Court in G.R. No. 164195. While the subject of the instant case is the decision of the RTC in Agrarian Case No. 77-2002 covering the subject property. Thus, it is error to apply in the instant case, the same valuation found by this Court in G.R. No. 164195. Here, the commissioners arrived at a different valuation for the subject property which this Court finds reasonable and just considering the nature of the property involved. </p><table width="50%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><b><i>LBP is liable to pay legal interest from the time of the taking of the property until full payment thereof.</i></b></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>As to the manner of interest, Apo claimed that the 12% legal interest due from LBP because of its delay in paying the just compensation should be computed at the time of the taking of the subject property, <i>i.e</i>., on December 9, 1996, until full payment has been made and not until May 9, 2008. </p><p> As to the 12% interest, LBP claimed that there was no delay on its part in the payment of just compensation. LBP already paid in full the initial valuation for the subject property in the amount of Php 3,814,053.53 before TCT No. 113359 was cancelled and transferred in the name of the Republic of the Philippines. Therefore, LBP should not be held liable to pay legal interest if it already paid in full the preliminary valuation of the subject property.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> </p><p> In <i>Republic of the Phils. v. CA</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> this Court held that: </p><blockquote> <p>The constitutional limitation of "just compensation" is considered to be the sum equivalent to the market value of the property, broadly described to be the price fixed by the seller in open market in the usual and ordinary course of legal action and competition or the fair value of the property as between one who receives, and one who desires to sell, it fixed at the time of the actual taking by the government. Thus, if property is taken for public use before compensation is deposited with the court having jurisdiction over the case, the final compensation must include interests on its just value to be computed from the time the property is taken to the time when compensation is actually paid or deposited with the court. In fine, between the taking of the property and the actual payment, legal interests accrue in order to place the owner in a position as good as (but not better than) the position he was in before the taking occurred.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> The award of interest is intended to compensate the property owner for the income it would have made had it been properly compensated for its property at the time of the taking. "The need for prompt payment and the necessity of the payment of interest is to compensate for any delay in the payment of compensation for property already taken."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> "The award of interest is imposed in the nature of damages for delay in payment which, in effect, makes the obligation on the part of the government one of forbearance to ensure prompt payment of the value of the land and limit the opportunity loss of the owner."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> </p><p> In the recent case of <i>Land Bank of the Philippines v. Phil-Agro Industrial Corporation</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> We had the occasion to rule that the mere fact that the LBP made an initial payment of the just compensation does not mean that the government is not liable for any delay in the payment of just compensation, thus: </p><blockquote> <p> It is doctrinal that to be considered as just, the compensation must be fair and equitable, and the landowners must have received it without any delay. <b>The requirement of the law is not satisfied by the mere deposit with any accessible bank of the provisional compensation determined by it or by the DAR, and its subsequent release to the landowner after compliance with the legal requirements set forth by R.A. No. 6657.</b> (Emphasis ours)</p> </blockquote> <p> In the present case, LBP merely deposited the amount of Php 3,814,053.53 as initial payment of the just compensation. The RTC's valuation in its decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> as just compensation for the subject property is Php 149,783,000.27. There is a staggering difference between the initial payment made by the LBP and the amount of the just compensation due to Apo. It should be noted that the subject property has already been taken by the government on December 9, 1996. Up to this date, the just compensation has not been fully paid. During the interim, Apo is deprived of the income it would have made had it been properly compensated for the properties at the time of the taking. It is therefore necessary to hold LBP liable to pay for the legal interest due to its delay in fully satisfying the payment of the just compensation.</p> <p> Thus, LBP is liable to pay legal interest of 12% counted from December 9, 1996, the time of the taking until June 30, 2013.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> Thereafter, or beginning July 1, 2013 until fully paid, the just compensation shall earn 6% legal interest in accordance with Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Monetary Board Circular No. 799, Series of 2013.</p><p> As to the award of attorney's fees, while the general rule is that attorney's fees cannot be recovered as part of the damages because no premium should be placed on the right to litigate,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> We deem it proper to affirm the award of 10% attorney's fees in favor of Apo.</p><p> We quote with confirmity the ruling of the CA in justifying the award of attorney's fees, thus: </p><blockquote> <p> Despite pragmatic considerations and actualities, convincing figures and statistics, [LBP] and DAR stood firm on their unreasonableness. P16.50 per [sq m], the valuation of [LBP] and DAR, is way off P134.00. The disparity is too obvious; their stubbornness, impossible (sic). [LBP] and DAR should not delude themselves that they are being robbed merely because another deserves to be paid justly. Every person, especially government entities, must, in the exercise of his rights and in the performance of his duties, act with justice, give everyone his due, and observe honesty and good faith.</p> <p> Simple fairness dictates that the [DARAB] should have resolved the matter of just compensation brought before it. The lapse of six years without the adjudication board acting on the case not only compelled Apo Fruits to litigate, this refusal to satisfy Apo Fruits' plainly valid, just and demandable claim is also tantamount to gross and evident bad faith.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> It must be emphasized that the subject property has been transferred in the name of the government as early as December 9, 1996 despite Apo's rejection of LBP's valuation of the subject property. To make matters worse, when Apo filed a. complaint for determination of just compensation with the DARAB, the latter unjustifiably and without any reason failed to act upon the complaint for almost six years, thus, prompting Apo to file a complaint with the RTC for determination of just compensation. Further, despite the ruling that the valuation of the subject property is Php 130.00, LBP still maintained its conviction that only the amount of Php 16.50 per square meter is due to Apo. The award of attorney's fees is justified by LBP's refusal to satisfy Apo's valid claim which forced the latter to litigate to protect its property rights.</p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the Decision dated September 25, 2012 and the Resolution dated April 21, 2015 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
