Appellant's defense of mere denial could not prevail over the positive testimonies of the prosecution's witnesses as the Court often views with disfavor the defense of denial, especially if it is not substantiated by any clear and convincing evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> It is an inherently weak defense as it is a self-serving negative evidence that cannot be given more evidentiary weight than the affirmative declarations of credible witnesses.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Moreover, it is a settled rule that factual findings of the trial courts are accorded great respect because they are in the best position to assess the credibility of the witnesses having had the opportunity to observe their demeanor during the trial.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Thus, the Court finds no reason to disturb the factual finding of the RTC, which was affirmed by the CA, that appellant was guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crimes charged.<br><br>However, in view of the recent enactment of RA 10951,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> there is a<br><br>need to modify the penalties imposed by the CA insofar as the two counts of estafa, docketed as Criminal Case Nos. 27592-R and 27602-R, are concerned. For committing estafa involving the amounts of P440,000.00 and P350,000.00, Article 315 of the RPC, as amended by RA 10951, now provides that the penalty of <i>arresto mayor </i>in its maximum period to <i>prision correccional </i>in its minimum period shall be imposed if the amount involved is over P40,000.00 but does not exceed P1,200,000.00. There being no mitigating and aggravating circumstance, the maximum penalty should be one (1) year and one (1) day of <i>prision correccional. </i>Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the minimum term of the indeterminate sentence is: <i>arresto mayor </i>in its minimum and medium periods, the range of which is one (1) month and one (1) day to four (4) months. Thus, the indeterminate penalty for each count of estafa should be modified to a prison term of two (2) months and one (1) day of <i>arresto mayor, </i>as minimum, to one (1) year and one (1) day of <i>prision correccional, </i>as maximum.<br><br>In addition, an interest rate of 6% <i>per annum </i>is likewise imposed on the amounts of P440,000.00 and P350,000.00 from the date of finality of this Resolution until full payment.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> premises considered, the appeal is <b>DISMISSED.</b> The Court <b>ADOPTS</b> the findings of the Regional Trial Court as affirmed by the Count of Appeals.
