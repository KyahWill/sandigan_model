The CA noted that the death certificate the petitioners presented was not an authenticated copy on security paper issued by the National Statistics Office (now Philippine Statistics Authority); and that the name of the deceased on the death certificate (Loreta Yulo Tabuada) did not match the name of the registered title holder (Loreta H. Tabuada). It pointed out that the "discrepancy is material as it puts in issue the real identity of the Loreta H. Tabuada who the plaintiffs claim is their predecessor-in-interest and the person whose name appears in the death certificate as Loreta Yulo Tabuada. Consequently this inconsistency puts in doubt the plaintiffs-appellees' ownership over Lot No. 4272-B-2."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> </p><p>The CA thereby underscored that the petitioners did not prove Sofia Tabuada's legal relationship with the late Loreta Tabuada because she did not present documentary evidence thereof.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> </p><p> The CA grossly erred. </p><p>Under the <i>Rules of Court</i>, evidence – as the means of ascertaining in a judicial proceeding the truth respecting a matter of fact<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> – may be object,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> documentary,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> and testimonial.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> It is required that evidence, to be admissible, must be relevant and competent.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> But the admissibility of evidence should not be confused with its probative value. Admissibility refers to the question of whether certain pieces of evidence are to be considered at all, while probative value refers to the question of whether the admitted evidence proves an issue. Thus, a particular item of evidence may be admissible, but its evidentiary weight depends on judicial evaluation within the guidelines provided by the rules of evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> </p><p>Although documentary evidence may be preferable as proof of a legal relationship, other evidence of the relationship that are competent and relevant may not be excluded. The preponderance of evidence, the rule that is applicable in civil cases, is also known as the greater weight of evidence. There is a preponderance of evidence when the trier of facts is led to find that the existence of the contested fact is more probable than its nonexistence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> In short, the rule requires the consideration of all the facts and circumstances of the cases, regardless of whether they are object, documentary, or testimonial.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> </p><p>The mere discrepancy – as perceived by the CA – between the name of the deceased entered in the death certificate (Loreta Yulo Tabuada) and the name of the titleholder (Loreta H. Tabuada) did not necessarily belie or disprove the legal relationship between Sofia Tabuada and the late Loreta Tabuada. To establish filiation, the courts like the RTC herein should consider and analyze not only the relevant testimonies of witnesses who are competent but other relevant evidence as well.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> There was on record herein Sofia Tabuada's unchallenged declaration of her being the daughter-in-law of the registered titleholder.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Also on record was the petitioners' being in the actual possession of Lot No. 4272-B-2, which they had been using as the site for their family residence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Such established circumstances indicated that the deceased Loreta Yulo Tabuada and titleholder Loreta H. Tabuada could only be one and the same person. Moreover, even the Spouses Certeza were aware that respondents Eleanor Tabuada and Tabuco were the relatives of Sofia Tabuada; and that the respective families of Eleanor Tabuada, Tabuco and Sofia Tabuada actually resided on the same lot.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Verily, the facts and circumstances sufficiently and competently affirmed the legal relationship between Sofia Tabuada and the late titleholder Loreta H. Tabuada. </p><p align="center"> <b>2. <br> Real estate mortgage was null and void</b> </p><p> Under Article 2085 of the <em>Civil Code</em>, a mortgage, to be valid, must have the following requisites, namely: (a) that it be constituted to secure the fulfillment of a principal obligation; (b) that the mortgagor be the absolute owner of the thing mortgaged; and (c) that the person constituting the mortgage has free disposal of the property, and in the absence of the right of free disposal, that the person be legally authorized for the purpose.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> </p><p> It is uncontested that the late Loreta Tabuada had died in 1990, or four years before the mortgage was constituted; and that Eleanor Tabuada and Trabuco admitted to petitioner Sofia Tabuada that they had mortgaged the property to the Spouses Certezas. Accordingly, the RTC was fully justified in declaring the nullity of the mortgage based on its finding that Eleanor Tabuada had fraudulently represented herself to the Spouses Certeza as the late Loreta Tabuada, the titleholder.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> That the titleholder had been dead when the mortgage was constituted on the property by Eleanor Tabuada was not even contested by Eleanor Tabuada and Tabuco. In any event, Eleanor Tabuada had not been legally authorized to mortgage the lot to the Spouses Certeza. </p><center> <p><strong>3. <br> Respondents Spouses Certeza<br> were not mortgagees in good faith </strong></p> </center> <p>The Spouses Certeza contend that they were mortgagees in good faith considering that they had no notice prior to the filing of Civil Case No. 05- 28420 that the real owner of the property had died several years before the execution of the mortgage; and that they had believed in good faith in the representations made by Eleanor Tabuada that she had been Loreta Tabuada, the titleholder.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> </p> <p>The contentions of the Spouses Certeza lack persuasion.</p> <p> The Spouses Certeza admitted that the petitioners were the relatives by blood or affinity of their co-defendants Eleanor Tabuada, <em>et al.</em>;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> and that Sofia Tabuada, <em>et al.</em> and the petitioners had been living in their respective residences built on the property subject of the mortgage.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Such admissions belied the Spouses Certeza's contention of being mortgagees in good faith. At the very least, they should have been prudent and cautious enough as to have inquired about Eleanor Tabuada's assertion of her capacity and authority to mortgage in view of the actual presence of other persons like the petitioners herein on the property. Such prudence and caution were demanded of persons like them who are about to deal with realty; they should not close their eyes to facts that should put a reasonable man on his guard and still claim he acted in good faith.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Indeed, the status of a mortgagee in good faith does not apply where the title is still in the name of the rightful owner and the mortgagor is a different person pretending to be the owner. In such a case, the mortgagee is not an innocent mortgagee for value and the registered owner will generally not lose his title.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> </p> <p align="center"> <b>4. <br> Award of moral damages reversed because<br> action was not an instance of disrespect to the dead</b> </p><p>The RTC awarded moral damages to the petitioners based on disrespect to the dead on the part of Eleanor Tabuada for fraudulently signing and executing the mortgage by impersonating the late Loreta Tabuada. </p><p> We hold that the RTC thereby fell into a legal error that the Court should correct. The petitioners cannot recover moral damages from Eleanor Tabuada on the ground of "disrespect to the dead."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> The <em>Civil Code</em> provision under Article 309<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> on showing "disrespect to the dead" as a ground for the family of the deceased to recover moral and material damages, being under the title of <em>Funerals</em>, obviously envisions the commission of the disrespect during the period of mourning over the demise of the deceased or on the occasion of the funeral of the mortal remains of the deceased. Neither was true herein. Hence, the act of Eleanor Tabuada of fraudulently representing the late Loreta Tabuada did not amount to disrespect to the dead as basis for the recovery of moral damages. </p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court <strong>GRANTS </strong>the petition for review on <em>certiorari</em>; <strong>REVERSES</strong> and <strong>SETS ASIDE </strong>the decision promulgated on September 30, 2009; <strong>REINSTATES</strong> the judgment rendered on January 18, 2006 by the Regional Trial Court, Branch 28, in Iloilo City in Civil Case No. 05-28420 subject to the deletion of the award of moral damages; and <strong>ORDERS</strong> the respondents to pay the costs of suit. </p><p> <b>SO ORDERED.</b></p><p> <em>Leonardo-De Castro, C.J., (Chairperson), Del Castillo</em>, and <em>Jardeleza, JJ.</em>, concur. <br> <em>Tijam, J</em>., on official leave. <br><br></p><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="noshade" align="LEFT"> <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <em>Rollo</em>, pp. 47-58; penned by Associate Justice Samuel H.
