Ynares, Jr. (Ynares) and former Undersecretary of the Department of Interior and Local Government Atty. Narciso "Jun" Y. Santiago, Jr. (Santiago) were written by Amado "Jake" Macasaet (Macasaet).

No. 196720 (first petition)</i></b><br><br>The assailed CA February 2011 Decision in the first petition summarizes the facts as follows:<br><blockquote>xxx Macasaet is the Publisher and Chairman of Malaya, a newspaper of general circulation while xxx Romualdez and xxx [D]elos Reyes are the Executive Editor and Editor, respectively, of said publication.<br><br>On April 27, 1999, xxx Santiago, who was then the Secretary-General of the National Cockers Association (NCA), filed an Affidavit-Complaint against [the accused], accusing them of publishing an allegedly libelous article entitled, "Santiago's gambling habits." The relevant portion of the complaint states:<br><blockquote><b><i>"3. In the April 21, 1999 issue of Malaya, a newspaper of general circulation, [accused], conspiring and confederating with one another, caused to be published a libelous article entitled [']Santiago's gambling habits['], a photocopy of which is hereto attached as Annex "A ".<br><br>4. The above article imputes defamatory statements against me in that I allegedly have a vice or defect, particularly, that I have a serious gambling habit which is widely known, xxx."</i></b><br></blockquote>The affidavit-complaint was filed in Pasig City, where the article was allegedly first printed and published, xxx Macasaet filed his counter-affidavit stating, among others, that venue was improperly laid since xxx Santiago was a resident of Quezon City and Malaya was published in Manila.<br><br>The Office of the Provincial Prosecutor of Rizal issued a Consolidated [Review] Resolution, dated September 28, 2007, ruling in this wise:<br><blockquote><b><i>"As earlier stated, venue is jurisdictional in criminal actions. Hence, the Provincial Prosecution Office of Rizal does not have jurisdiction to take cognizance over all these complaints for libel.

Pursuant thereto, [the accused] submitted their Memorandum, dated April 25, 2008, alleging mainly that the subject articles involved matters of public interest and that no malice attended its publication.<br><br>On July 9, 2008, the DOJ issue a Consolidated Resolution, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote><b><i>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, we find probable cause for libel covered by I.S.

Manila City, July 9, 2008."</i></b><br></blockquote>Resultantly, on July 9, 2008,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> an Information for libel was filed against [the accused before the RTC Manila, Br. 37 and was docketed as Criminal Case No. 08-263273], thus:<br><blockquote><b><i>"That on April 21, 1999, in Manila City, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, above-named accused, as publisher/writer, executive editor and editor, respectively of Malaya with address at Port Area, Manila City defamed private complainant Narciso Y.

The motion was denied in the assailed Order, dated February 19, 2009, thus:<br><blockquote><i>"In any event, accused have voluntarily agreed to be arraigned on January 29, 2009 (Macasaet and Romualdez) and February 17, 2009 (Delos Reyes).

The article depicted xxx Santiago xxx, husband of Senator Miriam Defensor-Santiago, xxx Ynares xxx and Jorge Araneta of the Araneta Coliseum as the key players involved in the dirty campaign to undermine the operations of the UCAP.<br><br>Also in said article, Macasaet claimed that Ynares had pressured Pasig Mayor Vicente Eusebio to cancel UCAP's permit to use its Pasig Square Garden for its cock derbies.

Article 360 originally did not specify the public officers and the courts that may conduct the preliminary investigation of complaints for libel.<br><br>Before Article 360 was amended, the rule was that a criminal action for libel may be instituted in any jurisdiction where the libelous article was published or circulated, irrespective of where it was written or printed xxx. Under that rule, the criminal action is transitory and the injured party has a choice of venue.<br><br>Experience had shown that under that old rule the offended party could harass the accused in a libel case by laying the venue of the criminal action in a remote or distant place.<br><br>xxxx<br><br>To forestall such harassment, Republic Act No. 4363 was enacted. It lays down specific rules as to the venue of the criminal action so as to prevent the offended party in written defamation cases from inconveniencing the accused by means of out-of-town libel suits, meaning complaints filed in remote municipal courts. (Explanatory Note for the bill which became Republic Act No. 4363, Congressional Record of May 20, 1965, pp. 424-5; xx x).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br></blockquote>The rules on venue of criminal actions for libel were also restated in <i>Agbayani</i>, thus:<br><blockquote>1. Whether the offended party is a public official or a private person, the criminal action may be filed in the Court of First Instance of the province or city where the libelous article is printed and first published.<br><br>2. If the offended party is a private individual, the criminal action may also be filed in the Court of First Instance of the province where he actually resided at the time of the commission of the offense.<br><br>3. If the offended party is a public officer whose office is in Manila at the time of the commission of the offense, the action may be filed in the Court of First Instance of Manila.<br><br>4. If the offended party is a public officer holding office outside of Manila, the action may be filed in the Court of First Instance of the province or city where he held office at the time of the commission of the offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br></blockquote>In the present case, the venue is apparently the place where the alleged defamatory article in <i>Malaya</i> was printed and first published.<br><br>The CA's ruling that the criminal action for libel was filed with the wrong venue was founded on the following:<br><blockquote>Ostensibly, the Information only shows that the article was written and published in Malaya which has an address in Port Area, Manila. There is no allegation of the <i>situs</i> where the article was printed and first published. It is fatally defective because it failed to specify whether the address of Malaya, is the same place where the article was printed and first published. We must emphasize that the address of the publisher is not necessarily the place of publication. The address would generally refer to the name or description of a place of residence, business, etc., where a person may be found or communicated with. It may include the business address, billing address, mailing address or the residence address of an entity or establishment. To be sure, it is not identical with the place of publication. While it is possible that the address of Malaya is the same place where it conducts its business of publication, We cannot presume such identity without transgression to the basic principle that penal laws are strictly interpreted against the State and liberally construed in favor of the accused. Presumption will be disfavored when it collides against the constitutional right of the accused to be presumed innocent. Thus, without stating more, We find the allegations in the Information insufficient to confer the RTC of Manila with jurisdiction over the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br></blockquote>The Court in <i>Bonifacio v. Regional Trial Court of Makati, Branch 149</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> made the following clarification in case the basis of the venue of the libel criminal action is the place where the libel was printed and first published:<br><blockquote>If the circumstances as to where the libel was printed and first published are used by the offended party as basis for the venue in the criminal action, the Information must allege with particularity <u>where</u> the defamatory article was printed and <u>first published</u>, <b>as evidenced or supported by, for instance, the address of their editorial or business offices in the case of newspapers, magazines or serial publications</b>. This pre-condition becomes necessary in order to forestall any inclination to harass.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Admittedly, the Information under scrutiny, without using the phrase "printed and first published," merely states:<br><blockquote>That on April 21, 1999, in Manila City, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, above-named accused, as publisher/writer, executive editor and editor, respectively of Malaya with address at Port Area, Manila City defamed private complainant Narciso Y. Santiago, Jr., did then and there, knowingly, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously by writing and publishing an article in the Malaya xxx.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br></blockquote>The Information does not specifically indicate that Port Area, Manila is the editorial or business office of <i>Malaya</i>, following the formulation in <i>Bonifacio</i>. And, it cannot be presumed as the CA further claims that the "address of Malaya is the same place where it conducts its business of publication."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>The Court disagrees with the CA; it finds the Information sufficient.<br><br>Paraphrasing the Information, the accused, as publisher/writer, executive editor and editor defamed Santiago on April 21, 1999, in Manila City, by writing and publishing an article in the <i>Malaya</i> with address at Port Area, Manila. To the Court, it is clear that Port Area, Manila is where the defamatory article was written and published because that is the address of <i>Malaya</i>, an unquestionably printed newspaper, wherein the article appeared. That the Information did not expressly state "first published" is of no moment because the word "published" does not exclude the first publication.<br><br>In turn, the accused do not deny that Port Area, Manila is the editorial and business offices of <i>Malaya</i> and interestingly, they did not raise the ground of lack of jurisdiction to dismiss Criminal Case No. 08-263272 despite the fact that the Information filed before RTC Manila, Br. 36 is similarly worded as the Information in Criminal Case No. 08-263273 filed before RTC Manila, Br. 37 as to the address of <i>Malaya</i> being at Port Area, Manila City and the non-inclusion of the phrase "printed and first published."<br><br>According to <i>Bonifacio</i>, "the Information must allege with particularity <u>where</u> the defamatory article was printed and <u>first published</u>, as evidenced or supported by, for instance, the address of their editorial or business offices in the case of newspapers."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> The Information in question complies with the <i>Bonifacio</i> directive because it alleges with particularity Port Area, Manila as the place where the alleged defamatory article was printed and first published as evidenced or supported by the records of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> The Information need not parrot the provisions of Article 360 of the RPC and expressly use the phrase "printed and first published." If there is no dispute that the place of publication indicated in the Information, which is Manila in the present case, is the place where the alleged defamatory article was "printed and first published," then the law is substantially complied with. After all, the filing of the Information before an RTC of the City of Manila would, borrowing the phraseology of <i>Bonifacio</i>, forestall any inclination to harass the accused. Besides, it is incumbent upon the accused to show that Port Area, Manila is not the business or editorial office of Malaya in the face of evidence in the records of the case that it is so.<br><br>The DOJ Consolidated Resolution in its summary of the pertinent facts stated that: "Records also show that Malaya is published by the People's Independent Media, Inc., with editorial and business offices at Port Area, Manila xxx."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> The Consolidated Review Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> of the Provincial Prosecutor of Rizal dated September 28, 2007 which initially dismissed the nine libel complaints of Santiago and Ynares for lack of jurisdiction indicated the venue where the complaints should be filed, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>In the case of complainant Santiago, Jr., his libel complaints should be filed either in Manila, where the libelous matters appearing in ABANTE and MALAYA were first printed and published, or in the place where he actually resided at the time of the commission of the alleged offense. However, the records do not show Pasig City as to (sic) the actual residence of complainant Santiago, Jr. at the time of the commission of the offense charged, except to say that he held office at No. 3 West Fourth St., West Triangle, Quezon City. And even if we consider this address as his actual place of residence, or his office address as a public official, which he did not state in his complaints, still, the filing of these complaints before the Provincial Prosecutor's Office of Rizal violates the rule on venue as provided for in Article 360 of the Revised Penal Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br></blockquote>Thus, the CA erred in dismissing the Information in Criminal Case No. 08-263273 and nullifying the Orders dated November 3, 2009 and January 29, 2010 of the RTC Manila, Br. 37, denying the accused's motion to dismiss.<br><br><u>G.R. Nos. 196720 and 197324</u><br><br>The first and third petitions are also meritorious.<br><br>The accused posit that the CA erred in affirming the RTC ruling that, even though the delay was not disputed or the reason for it was not explained by the Prosecution, the accused's right to speedy trial was not violated, and that the accused are deemed to have waived their right to speedy disposition of their cases for failing to plead such defense during the preliminary investigation.<br><br>Indeed, the Constitution guarantees in the Bill of Rights, Article III, Section 14(2) that: "In all criminal prosecutions, the accused xxx shall enjoy the right xxx to have a speedy, impartial, and public trial xxx" and in Article III, Section 16 that: "All persons shall have the right to a speedy disposition of their cases before all judicial, quasi-judicial, or administrative bodies." Congress has also enacted in February 12, 1998 Republic Act No. (RA) 8493, otherwise known as the "Speedy Trial Act of 1998." For its part, the Court promulgated Circular No. 38-98 on August 11, 1998 for the purpose of implementing the provisions of RA 8493. The provisions of the Circular were adopted in the 2000 Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>The right to speedy disposition of the accused's case is explained in <i>Caballes v. CA</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> thus:<br><blockquote>The right of the accused to a speedy trial and to a speedy disposition of the case against him was designed to prevent the oppression of the citizen by holding criminal prosecution suspended over him for an indefinite time, and to prevent delays in the administration of justice by mandating the courts to proceed with reasonable dispatch in the trial of criminal cases. Such right to a speedy trial and a speedy disposition of a case is violated only when the proceeding is attended by vexatious, capricious and oppressive delays. The inquiry as to whether or not an accused has been denied such right is not susceptible by precise qualification. The concept of a speedy disposition is a relative term and must necessarily be a flexible concept.<br><br>While justice is administered with dispatch, the essential ingredient is orderly, expeditious and not mere speed. It cannot be definitely said how long is too long in a system where justice is supposed to be swift, but deliberate. It is consistent with delays and depends upon circumstances. It secures rights to the accused, but it does not preclude the rights of public justice. Also, it must be borne in mind that the rights given to the accused by the Constitution and the Rules of Court are shields, not weapons; hence, courts are to give meaning to that intent.<br><br>xxxx<br><br>A balancing test of applying societal interests and the rights of the accused necessarily compels the court to approach speedy trial cases on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.<br><br>In determining whether the accused has been deprived of his right to a speedy disposition of the case and to a speedy trial, four factors must be considered: (a) length of delay; (b) the reason for the delay; (c) the defendant's assertion of his right; and (d) prejudice to the defendant. Prejudice should be assessed in the light of the interest of the defendant that the speedy trial was designed to protect, namely: to prevent oppressive pre-trial incarceration; to minimize anxiety and concerns of the accused to trial; and to limit the [possibility that his defense will be impaired. Of these, the most serious is the last, because the inability of a defendant adequately to prepare his case skews the fairness of the entire system. There is also prejudice if the defense witnesses are unable to recall accurately the events of the distant past. Even if the accused is not imprisoned prior to trial, he is still disadvantaged by restraints on his liberty and by living under a cloud of anxiety, suspicion and often, hostility. His financial resources may be drained, his association is curtailed, and he is subjected to public obloquy.<br><br>Delay is a two-edged sword. It is the government that bears the burden of proving its case beyond reasonable doubt. The passage of time may make it difficult or impossible for the government to carry its burden. The Constitution and the Rules do not require impossibilities or extraordinary efforts, diligence or exertion from courts or the prosecutor, nor contemplate that such right shall deprive the State of a reasonable opportunity of fairly prosecuting criminals. As held in <i>Williams v. United States</i>, for the government to sustain its right to try the accused despite a delay, it must show two things: (a) that the accused suffered no serious prejudice beyond that which ensued from the ordinary and inevitable delay; and (b) that there was no more delay than is reasonably attributable to the ordinary processes of justice.<br><br>Closely related to the length of delay is the reason or justification of the State for such delay. Different weights should be assigned to different reasons or justifications invoked by the State. For instance, a deliberate attempt to delay the trial in order to hamper or prejudice the defense should be weighted heavily against the State. Also, it is improper for the prosecutor to intentionally delay to gain some tactical advantage over the defendant or to harass or prejudice him. On the other hand, the heavy case load of the prosecution or a missing witness should be weighted less heavily against the State.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br></blockquote>The right to speedy disposition of one's case, similar to the right to speedy trial, may be waived. The Court in <i>Nepomuceno v. The Secretary of National Defense</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> observed that the right to speedy trial as any other constitutionally or statutory conferred right, except when otherwise expressly so provided by law, may be waived. Therefore, it must be asserted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> The assertion of such right is entitled to strong evidentiary weight in determining whether the accused is being deprived thereof such that the failure to claim the right will make it difficult to prove that there was a denial of a speedy trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> The accused's failure to timely question the delay would be an implied acceptance of such delay and a waiver of the right to question the same. Also, his silence may amount to laches.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>To recall, the Affidavit-Complaint which triggered the filing of the Information in the first petition was filed by Santiago on April 27, 1999 before the Provincial Prosecutor of Rizal. Macasaet filed his Counter-Affidavit on May 24, 1999. On the other hand, the Affidavit-Complaint that triggered the filing of the Information in the third petition was filed by Ynares on March 16, 1999. Macasaet filed his Counter-Affidavit on April 12, 1999. The Provincial Prosecutor of Rizal dismissed without prejudice the complaints on September 28, 2007, or <b><i><u>more than eight years</u> from the filing of the complaints</i></b>. On January 29, 2008, the DOJ issued Summons requiring accused to appear before the said office in relation to the complaints for libel. On July 9, 2008, the DOJ issued a Consolidated Resolution finding probable cause for both. On August 21, 2008, two separate Informations for libel were filed against the accused. One was docketed as Criminal Case No. 08-263272 and raffled to RTC Manila, Br. 36. And the other was docketed as Criminal Case No. 08-263273 and raffled to RTC Manila, Br. 37.<br><br>In the first criminal case, the accused were arraigned on October 6, 2008 and they filed their motion to dismiss grounded on their right to speedy disposition of their case on October 7, 2008 while in the second criminal case, they filed their motion to dismiss based on same ground on November 26, 2008.<br><br>Given such backdrop, in both the CA<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> January 2011 Decision (assailed in the third petition) and the CA<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> February 2011 Decision (assailed in the first petition), the CA uniformly applied the principle of laches or implied acquiescence in construing the silence of the accused or their inaction to object to the delay and/or failure to seasonably raise the right to speedy disposition of their cases as waiver thereof.<br><br>The CA invoked <i>Valencia v. Sandiganbayan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> which cited the Court's ruling in <i>Guerrero v. CA</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> in justifying that the failure of the accused to seasonably raise the right to speedy trial precludes them from relying on the alleged violation of such right as a ground to dismiss the case and that by not asserting such right at the earliest possible opportunity they are deemed to have slept on their right. The CA likewise relied on <i>Dela Peña v. Sandiganbayan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> cited in <i>Valencia</i>, as its justification in construing the silence of the accused and the absence of any signs or overt acts of asserting their right to a speedy disposition of their cases in the nine years from the filing of the complaint to the filing of the Information and their arraignment as waiver of their right, and their inaction on and lack of objection to the delay can be perceived as implied acquiescence by them.<br><br>The Court disagrees with the CA. The CA failed to consider the other factors that must be present before the right to speedy case determination may be considered to have been waived. <b>The CA did not consider the length of delay and the reason for the delay.</b> The length of delay must be commensurate with the reason thereof. In these cases, it must be recalled that in a Consolidated Review Resolution dated September 28, 2007 of the Rizal Provincial Prosecutor, the complaints filed by Ynares and Santiago were dismissed, without prejudice, for want of jurisdiction by reason of improper venue.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> It took the Rizal Provincial Prosecutor <b>more than eight years</b> from the filing of the complaints to dismiss without prejudice the complaints. The issue on venue in libel cases is neither a novel nor difficult one. <b><u>The more than eight years it took the Rizal Provincial Prosecutor to resolve a rather routine issue is clearly inordinate, unreasonable and unjustified.</u></b> Under the circumstances, it cannot be said "that there was no more delay than is reasonably attributable to the ordinary processes of justice."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br>Furthermore, the silence of the accused during such period could not be viewed as an unequivocal act of waiver of their right to speedy determination of their cases. That the accused could have filed a motion for early resolution of their cases is immaterial. The more than eight years delay the Rizal Provincial Prosecutor incurred before issuing his resolution of the complaints is an affront to a reasonable dispensation of justice and such delay could only be perpetrated in a vexatious, capricious and oppressive manner.<br><br>All told, the CA erroneously denied the accused's petitions questioning the denial by the RTC Manila, Br. 36 and Br. 37 of their motions to dismiss based on their right to speedy disposition of their cases.<br><br>Since the dismissal of the complaints against the accused is warranted because of the violation of their right to speedy disposition of their cases, the Court's finding that the second petition has merit is rendered superfluous. The dismissal of the Information for libel by the CA in the second petition is maintained but on a different ground — the denial of the right of the accused to speedy disposition of their case.
