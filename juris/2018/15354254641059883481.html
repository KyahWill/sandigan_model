The late [spouses Aguilar's] sugar crop loans, which were obtained sometime between the late 1970's and the early 1980's, were secured by real estate mortgage over four registered parcels of land, namely: residential Lot No. 3, Block 13, situated in Sagay, Negros Occidental [with an area of 342 square meters<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>, and agricultural Lots No[s]. 3587 [with an area of 225,594 square meters<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>], 3588 [with an], area of 19,283 square meters<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>] and 3749 [with an area of 181,935 square meters<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>], all situated at Escalante, Negros Occidental. However, for failure of the late spouses Aguilar to pay their obligations with [PNB], the mortgage was foreclosed in 1985 and subsequently, ownership of the subject four pieces of property was consolidated under the name of [PNB].<br><br>With the enactment of RA 7202 on February 29, 1992, the late Romulus Aguilar wrote [PNB] on July 5, 1995, and he stated: "<i>Since our indebtedness with the PNB had been foreclosed, we are asking your good Office for a reconsideration of our account based on the Sugar Restitution Law</i>." After the death of Romulus Aguilar, his spouse, the late Evelyn Aguilar, received a letter from [PNB] dated September 17, 1997, during which occasion [PNB] informed the late Evelyn Aguilar that while the subject loan account was covered by the provisions of RA 7202 and have been audited by the Commission on Audit (COA), the late Evelyn Aguilar was still required to comply with the following matters: (1) to arrange and implement restructuring of accounts within sixty (60) days from receipt of the notice, (2) to signify her conformity to the computation of the account, and (3) to submit the ten (10) year crop production for the period 1974/1975 to 1984/1985.<br><br>Plaintiffs-appellees Aguilar [the Aguilars] claimed that they complied with the stated requirements, and that subsequently, [PNB] furnished them [with] Statements of Account, the earliest of which was the COA audited statement as of December 15, 1996 and the latest was as of November 30, 1999, which reflected a P2,236,337.91 total amount due.<br><br>[Based on Statement of Account as of November 30, 1999,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> the accounts of the Aguilars with the PNB were computed as follows:<br><br><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="20%"><div align="justify">1.

According to [the Aguilars], they were likewise assured by [PNB] that if the proceeds from LBP would exceed the obligations of the late spouses Aguilar, the excess amount would be returned to [the Aguilars], including the subject residential property. On December 21, 1998, LBP issued the Memorandum of Valuation of agricultural Lot No. 3749 for P1,254,328.17, and on November 23, 1999, for agricultural Lot No. 3587 in the amount of P1,957,684.31.<br><br>Following the November 23, 1999 Memorandum of Valuation, [the Aguilars] requested [PNB] to commence restructuring of the loan account, and on three occasions, <i>i.e.</i>, February 8, 2000, March 15, 2000 and April 24, 2000, one of the children of the late spouses Aguilar, x x x Glenn Aguilar, in behalf of his siblings x x x Astrid Van de Brug and Martin Aguilar, wrote [PNB] and asked that they be accorded the benefits of RA 7202. Through his letters, x x x Glenn Aguilar also made mention of an allegedly similar case, docketed as <i>Civil Case No. 7212</i> entitled <i>Sps. Fred and Mildred Pfleider vs. PNB, et al.</i>, then pending before RTC, Branch 45, Bacolod City, wherein [PNB] purportedly entered into a compromise agreement with Sps. Pfleider, notwithstanding consolidation of the foreclosed property under the bank's name.<br><br>On September 22, 2000, [PNB] replied in writing and stated, among other matters, that: "<i>Since PNB has already acquired the properties at the foreclosure sale, it can now exercise its rights as owner of these properties, including the right to convey the same to the DAR and to receive the proceeds thereof from Land Bank of the Philippines, without any right to the excess proceeds, if any, inuring/accruing to your favor</i>."<br><br>Hence, the case for implementation of RA 7202, with prayer for payment of P200,000.00 moral damages, P200,000.00 exemplary damages, P100,000.00 attorney's fees plus P1,500.00 fee per appearance and P25,000.00 litigation expenses, was filed by [the Aguilars] on January 3, 2001.<br><br>For its part, [PNB] emphasized that [the Aguilars] failed to comply with the requirements enumerated based on its September 17, 1997 letter. Hence, [PNB] argued that [the Aguilars] have no cause of action against [PNB] because whatever rights [the Aguilars] have under RA 7202 were already forfeited when they failed to comply with the requirements.<br><br>The non-compliance by [the Aguilars] of the requirements was confirmed by the Chief of [PNB's] Loans Department, x x x Edgardo Miraflor. While x x x Miraflor admitted that x x x Glenn Aguilar tried to negotiate with [PNB] for the restructuring of the account of the late spouses Aguilar under RA 7202, [the Aguilars] did not formally signify their conformity to [PNB's] recomputation of the account as of December 15, 1996, which was audited and certified by the COA. Neither did [the Aguilars] dispute the COA audited recomputation which disclosed that after recomputation based on the provisions of RA 7202, there was no excess payment on the account of the late spouses Aguilar. x x x Miraflor continued to add that while it was true that it was x x x Glenn Aguilar who followed up the status of LBP's payment of the subject agricultural lands which were already conveyed to the DAR, and that he advised x x x Glenn Aguilar to likewise negotiate with [PNB's] Bacolod Business Center, x x x Miraflor was subsequently notified by the Bacolod Business Center that pursuant to Department of Justice (DOJ) Opinion No. 91, Series of 1995, the foreclosed pieces of property of [the Aguilars], which were already consolidated under the name of [PNB], could no longer be returned to them.<br><br>[PNB] further contended that [the Aguilars] cannot invoke the compromise agreement it entered into with Sps. Fred and Mildred Pfleider in <i>Civil Case No. 7212</i> because [the Aguilars] were not parties to the case.<br><br>By way of counterclaim, [PNB] prayed for P100,000.00 moral damages, P100,000.00 exemplary damages, attorney's fees and litigation expenses.<br><br>During the rebuttal stage, x x x Glenn Aguilar claimed that [the Aguilars] did not sign the restructuring agreement primarily because of the exclusion of the value of the agricultural lands, which were already conveyed to the DAR, in the recomputation of the account of the late spouses Aguilar.<br><br>After hearing, the [RTC] rendered the assailed Decision, the decretal portion whereof reads:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered dismissing the Defendant's counterclaim and ordering judgment in favor of the Plaintiffs and against the Defendant as follows:<br><ol><li>To accord the Plaintiffs the benefits of R.A. 7202 and in particular to credit to the Plaintiffs' account the proceeds from the VOS<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> of the agricultural properties heretofore described as Lots 3585, 3749 and 3588, located at Escalante City, Negros Occidental, with the excess thereof being delivered to the Plaintiffs or the shortfall to be paid by the Plaintiffs in thirteen (13) years with interest provided for by R.A. 7202, and upon full payment of the account to return to the [P]laintiffs the title to and ownership of the abovementioned residential lot, Lot No. 3, Block 13, of the subdivision plan Psd-33419, Sagay Cadastre, now covered by TCT No. T-203;<br><br></li><li>Ordering the [D]efendants (sic) to pay [the] [P]laintiffs P100,000.00 moral damages, P50,000.00 exemplary damages, P50,000.00 attorney's fees and litigation expenses of P10,000.00 and to pay the costs.<br></li></ol>SO ORDERED."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br></blockquote></blockquote>The RTC justified the reconveyance or restitution of the residential lot in Sagay City to the Aguilars by crediting in their favor the proceeds of the Voluntary Offer to Sell (VOS) to the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) of the two agricultural lots, which "reached to more than Three Million Pesos[;] and in applying the proceeds thereof to the payment of their accounts, said outstanding account [would] be fully paid and in addition to that [PNB] would still be obligated to return the balance thereof which is more than P900,000.00 to the [Aguilars]."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>As to the Opinion of the Secretary of Justice, to the mind of the RTC, it refers only to foreclosed properties which, thru public auction, the ownership thereof has passed to third persons.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> According to the RTC, it does not apply to the instant case because the subject foreclosed properties' ownership has not passed to third persons but only to another government agency that is also mandated to implement Republic Act No. (RA) 7202<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> or the Sugar Restitution Law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>The RTC justified the judgment in favor of the Aguilars as in keeping with public policy behind RA 7202, which "was passed as a sort of social legislation and an urgent measure to uplift the plight of sugar producers who were put to a great disadvantage, thus they suffered damages, among which are non-payment of the sugar crop loans that led to foreclosure of their collaterals thereof mainly 'due to actions taken by government agencies and in order to revive the economy in the sugar-producing areas of the country',"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> thus:<br><blockquote>In plain and simple language what [PNB] has done in denying to the [Aguilars] the benefits of the Sugar Restitution Law is against the spirit that created the said Law, <span style="font-style: italic;">i.e.</span> to help the sugar producers, the [Aguilars] herein included, who suffered due to the acts of government agencies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br></blockquote>The RTC found PNB guilty of malice and bad faith in not pursuing its duty in helping the Aguilars avail of the benefits of RA 7202 and, pursuant to Articles 19 and 21 of the Civil Code, justified the award of moral and exemplary damages as well as attorney's fees and litigation expenses in favor of the Aguilars.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Aggrieved by the RTC Decision, PNB appealed to the CA.

When it is reflected that while codes of law and statutes have changed from age to age, the conscience of man has remained fixed to its ancient moorings, one can not but feel that it is safe and salutary to transmute, as far as may be, moral norms into legal rules, thus imparting to every legal system that enduring quality which ought to be one of its superlative attributes.<br><br>"Furthermore, there is no belief of more baneful consequence upon the social order than that a person may with impunity cause damage to his fellow-men so long as he does not break any law of the State, though he may be defying the most sacred postulates of morality.

Nevertheless, based on the allegations in respondent's complaint, it may be gathered that the basis for his claim for damages is Article 19 of the Civil Code, which provides:<br><blockquote>Art. 19. Every person must, in the exercise of his rights and in the performance of his duties, act with justice, give everyone his due, and observe honesty and good faith.<br></blockquote>The foregoing provision sets the standards which may be observed not only in the exercise of one's rights but also in the performance of one's duties. When a right is exercised in a manner which does not conform with the norms enshrined in Article 19 and results in damage to another, a legal wrong is thereby committed for which the wrongdoer must be held responsible. But a right, though by itself legal because recognized or granted by law as such, may nevertheless become the source of some illegality. A person should be protected only when he acts in the legitimate exercise of his right; that is, when he acts with prudence and in good faith, but not when he acts with negligence or abuse. There is an abuse of right when it is exercised only for the purpose of prejudicing or injuring another.
