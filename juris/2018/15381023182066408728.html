				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In this Petition for Certiorari<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> under Rule 64, in relation to Rule 65, petitioner Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) seeks the nullification of the following issuances of the Commission on Audit (COA): <blockquote> <p>a. Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> No. 2012-207 dated November 15, 2012, which denied DBP's Petition for Review, thereby sustaining the disallowance of the payment of Governance Forum Productivity Award to DBP's officials and employees in the total amount of P170,893,689.00; and </p> <p>b. Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated December 6, 2013, which denied with finality DBP's subsequent Motion for Reconsideration. </p> </blockquote> <p align="center"><b>The </b><b>Antecedent Facts</b> </p><p> DBP, a government financial institution created and operating under its own charter<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>, was faced with labor unrest in 2003 due to its employees' insistence that they be paid their benefits which includes Amelioration Allowance (AA), Cost of Living Allowance (COLA) and the Bank Equity Benefit Differential Pay (BEBDP), for the year that the Department of Budget and Management Corporate Compensation Circular No. 10 (DBM CCC No. 10) was declared ineffective by this Court for non-publication.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> </p><p>After a series of conferences referred to as a governance forum, the employees' group and DBP arrived at an agreement to put an end to the division causing disruptions in bank operations. The DBP Board of Directors (BOD) adopted Board Resolution No. 0133<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> dated May 9, 2003, approving a one-time grant called the Governance Forum Productivity Award (GFPA) to DBP's officers and employees. The total amount distributed was PhP170,893,689.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> </p><p>An audit team was subsequently constituted to look into the legality of the GFPA pursuant to Office Order No. 2003-078 of the COA Legal and Adjudication Office. As a result, Audit Observation Memorandum (AOM) No. 001<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> dated January 7, 2005 found the grant of the GFPA without legal basis and recommended its refund.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> </p><p>Meanwhile, the Executive Committee (Execom) of the DBP adopted Resolution No. 0151<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> dated November 16, 2005, which granted the payment of Amelioration Allowance (AA) to bank employees. The amount due as AA for individual employees was offset against the GFPA already received by them, in the following manner: </p><blockquote> <p> <b>To finally settle both the AA and GFPA issues, it will be better to pay the AA, to be offset from the amount already paid as GFPA</b> with the following suggested conditions: </p> <blockquote> <p>a. If the amount of the AA is more than the GFPA, the differential amount will be paid to the employees.</p> <p> b. If the AA is less than the GFPA, concerned employees shall no longer be required to return the amount. </p> <p>c. Those who did not receive the GFPA will get their AA in full. </p> <p>d. Retirees/resignees without the usual waiver will likewise receive their AA in full. Those with waivers, do not get anything more.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> (Emphasis ours.)</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> On January 3, 2007, DBP received Notice of Disallowance (ND) No. LAS-OGC-2006-001<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> dated December 18, 2006, disallowing the grant of the GFPA. According to COA's Legal and Adjudication Team, industrial peace may not be used as a legal and sufficient basis in granting monetary awards. Furthermore, the GFPA partakes the nature of a compromise agreement and circumvents the rule that only a settled claim may be a subject of compromise.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> </p><p> In its Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> on February 28, 2007, DBP assailed the ND by arguing that payment of the GFPA was made pursuant to the power of its Board of Directors (BOD) to enter into a compromise agreement for settlement of employees' claims; that industrial peace is a valid consideration for a compromise agreement; and that the GFPA was superseded and rendered inexistent by the grant of the AA to DBP's employees.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> </p><p>COA's Fraud Audit and Investigation Office (FAIO) treated DBP's Motion for Reconsideration (MR) as an appeal and upheld the disallowance thru the Decision No. 2010-005 dated October 7, 2010.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> The FAIO ruled that the power of DBP's Board to fix the remuneration and emoluments of its officials and employees is not absolute and is subject to Sections 5 and 6 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1597<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> and Section 3 of Memorandum Order (MO) No. 20 of the Office of the President dated June 25, 2001 requiring prior presidential approval. It held that the power of DBP's BOD to enter into a compromise agreement has no basis in law. Furthermore, the subsequent payment of the AA was a separate matter that does not render the disallowance of the GFPA moot and academic. </p><p> Aggrieved, on January 21, 2011, DBP filed a Petition for Review<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> arguing that: PD No. 1597 and MO No. 20 requiring prior approval of the President, are not applicable to its case; reiterating its contention that subsequent payment of the AA rendered the grant of GFPA moot and academic as it was already converted part of the AA; and, that the employees received the GFPA in good faith and with honest belief that the same was valid, hence, they should not be required to refund the amount. </p><p>On March 10, 2011, DBP filed its Reply raising lack of due process for not citing PD No. 1597 and MO No. 20 as grounds for disallowance of GFPA in the ND. </p><p>On November 15, 2012, the Commission in its Decision No. 2012-207 denied the Petition for Review and held that there was no denial of due process as the COA's general audit power does not restrict itself on the grounds relied upon by the agency's auditor. It further stated that matters relating to salaries, allowances and benefits of employees in the public sector cannot be a valid subject of a compromise or negotiation because these are governed and fixed by laws. It debunked the notion that the subsequent grant of the AA rendered the case moot and academic, and argued that good faith is not a valid defense under the principle of <i>solutio indebiti</i>. </p><p> On December 6, 2013, the Motion for Reconsideration of DBP was thereafter denied with finality. Hence, the present petition dated February 4, 2014. </p><p align="center"><b>The Court's Ruling</b> </p><p> On June 20, 2014, the Office of the Solicitor General, as counsel for respondent COA filed its Comment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> on the instant petition. </p><p> Acting on DBP's Manifestation with Motion to Resolve filed on July 17, 2014, this Court issued a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) on September 16, 2014, restraining the COA from enforcing the assailed Decision and Resolution relating to the grant of the GFPA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> </p><p>In compliance with our June 6, 2017 Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>, DBP filed its Reply<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> on August 4, 2017. DBP insists that under its charter, the BOD was authorized to settle its employees' claims, which it did, by way of the grant of GFPA. It reiterated its exemption from RA No. 6758, otherwise known as the <i>Compensation and Position Classification Act of 1989</i> or popularly known as the <i>Salary Standardization Law</i> (SSL). DBP also maintains that the GFPA recipients and DBP Directors who approved the disbursement all acted in good faith; consequently, should the disallowance be upheld, they may not be held liable for the return of the disallowed amount. Finally, DBP invites our attention to the fact that COA's ND against the AA, subject of another case docketed as G.R. No. 213126, also entitled <i>DBP v. COA</i>, was finally upheld on November 18, 2014, the refund of which is presently the subject of execution proceedings.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> </p><p> It bears recalling that the grant of GFPA on May 9, 2003 was subsequently offset against the AA granted on November 16, 2005. Considering that the COA is currently implementing a refund of the AA pursuant to the final decision in G.R. No. 213126, it is now argued that DBP should not be asked to return the same amount twice. </p><p> We now resolve. </p><p>The ultimate issue for this Court's resolution is whether or not the COA acted without or in excess of its jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, when it disallowed the GFPA on the basis that it was in the nature of a compromise agreement to settle a labor dispute, allegedly an <i>ultra vires</i> act of DBP's BOD. </p><p> There is no quibbling over the fact that labor unrest impelled the DBP, in the interest of industrial peace, to grant the GFPA to its employees. In the COA's view, it was not within the board's powers to grant a monetary award or benefit as a result of labor negotiations. The DBP, on the other hand, points to Section 9 of its charter in arguing that its BOD was authorized to compromise claims against it, pertinently: </p><blockquote> <p> Sec. 9. <i>Powers and Duties of the Board of Directors</i>. The Board of Directors shall have, among others, the following duties, powers and authority: </p> <p> x x x x </p> <blockquote> <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="3%"><div align="justify">(e)</div></td> <td width="97%"><div align="justify">To compromise or release, in whole or in part, any claim of or settled liability to the Bank regardless of the amount involved, under such terms and conditions it may impose<strong> to protect the interests of the Bank. This authority to compromise shall extend to claims against the Bank.</strong> xxx (Emphasis supplied)</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p>Emphasizing further that its charter grants it a free hand in the fixing of compensation and allowances of its officers and employees, DBP cites Section 13 thereof:</p> <blockquote> <p> Sec. 13. <i>Other Officers and Employees</i>. -The Board of Directors shall provide for an organization and staff of officers and employees of the Bank and upon recommendation of the President of the Bank, <b>fix their remunerations and other emoluments</b>. All positions in the Bank shall be governed by the compensation, position classification system and qualification standards approved by the Board of Directors based on a comprehensive job analysis of actual duties and responsibilities. The compensation plan shall be comparable with the prevailing compensation plans in the private sector and shall be subject to periodic review by the Board of Directors once every two (2) years, without prejudice to yearly merit or increases based on the Bank's productivity and profitability. <b>The Bank shall, therefore, be exempt from existing laws, rules, and regulations on compensation, position classification and qualification standard. The Bank shall however, endeavor to make its system conform as closely as possible with the principles under Compensation and Position Classification Act of 1989 (<i>Republic Act No. 6758, as amended</i>)</b>. (Emphasis supplied.) </p> </blockquote> <p> Notably, while Sec. 13 of DBP's charter as amended on February 14, 1998, exempts it from existing laws on compensation and position classification, it concludes by expressly stating that DBP's system of compensation shall nonetheless conform to the principles under the SSL. From this, there is no basis to conclude that the DBP's BOD was conferred unbridled authority to fix the salaries and allowances of its officers and employees. The authority granted DBP to freely fix its compensation structure under which it may grant allowances and monetary awards remains circumscribed by the SSL; it may not entirely depart from the spirit of the guidelines therein.</p><p> The policy requiring prior Presidential approval upon recommendation from the Secretary of Budget as provided in PD 1597, with respect to the grant of allowances and benefits, was re-affirmed by the Congress in 2009 through <i>Joint Resolution No. 4</i>, also known as the <i>Salary Standardization Law III</i> which provides that the "coverage, conditions for the grant, including the rates of allowances, benefits, and incentives to all government employees, shall be rationalized in accordance with the policies to be issued by the President upon recommendation of the Department of Budget and Management." This policy mirrors MO No. 20 issued earlier in 2001, which directed the heads of government-owned and controlled corporations, government financial institutions (GFIs), and subsidiaries exempted from the SSL to implement pay rationalization in all senior officer positions.</p><p> What made the GFPA granted by the DBP to its officers and employees in 2003 unique was that it was the product of a compromise arrived at after negotiations between DBP employees and management referred to as a governance forum. The COA considered the process undertaken as labor negotiations. </p><p> It appears that DBP misconstrued its authority to compromise. Sec. 9 (e) of its charter authorizes its BOD to compromise or release any claim or settled liability to or against the bank. To interpret the provision as including contested benefits that are demanded by employees of a chartered GFI such as the DBP is a wide stretch. To reiterate, its officers and employees' remunerations may only be granted in the manner provided under Sec. 13 of its charter and conformably with the SSL.</p><p> The COA's insistence that industrial peace is not a determining factor under the principles of the SSL in fixing the compensation of DBP's employees, is correct. The grant of a wider latitude to DBP's BOD in fixing remunerations and emoluments does not include an abrogation of the principle that employees in the civil service "cannot use the same weapons employed by the workers in the private sector to secure concessions from their employees."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> While employees of chartered GFIs enjoy the constitutional right to bargain collectively, they may only do so for non­ economic benefits and those not fixed by law, and may not resort to acts amounting to work stoppages or interruptions. There is no other way to view the GFPA, other than as a monetary benefit collectively wrung by DBP's employees under threat of disruption to the bank's smooth operations. We held in <i>Dulce M. Abanilla v. Commission On Audit</i>, reiterating <i>Alliance of Government Workers v. Minister of Labor and Employment</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>: </p><blockquote> <p> Subject to the minimum requirements of wage laws and other labor and welfare legislation, the terms and conditions of employment in the unionized private sector are settled through the process of collective bargaining. In government employment, however, it is the legislature and, where properly given delegated power, the administrative heads of government which fix the terms and conditions of employment. And this is effected through statutes or administrative circulars, rules, and regulations, <b>not through collective bargaining agreements</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)</p> </blockquote> <p> All told, the grant of GFPA was indeed an <em>ultra vires</em> act or beyond the authority of DBP's BOD. There was no grave abuse of discretion on the part of COA when it disallowed the GFPA on the basis of a compromise agreement to settle a labor dispute. We thus, sustain the disallowance. </p><p> We take judicial notice of the fact that this Court in another case docketed as G.R. No. 213126 entitled <i>DBP v. COA</i> had already sustained the disallowance of the AA granted by the DBP and which was offset against the GFPA earlier distributed, for being contrary to the SSL. In this regard, DBP argued that it cannot be ordered to refund the same amount twice. A careful scrutiny of the records of the said related case, however, revealed that the AA disallowed and is now the subject of execution proceedings only covered<b> the difference</b> in the amount between the GFPA already distributed and the subsequent AA granted. There is no merit in the contention that ordering a refund of the GFPA would result in double recovery.</p><p> Notwithstanding the foregoing, We hold that a refund of the GFPA would not be in order. A refund of the AA was considered proper by this Court in G.R. No. 213126 not only on the basis of <i>solutio indebiti</i>, but more significantly because there was a determination of bad faith on the part of DBP's Execom. There was a finding that DBP patently disregarded DBM Budget Circular No. 2001-03 dated November 12, 2001 clearly prohibiting the payment of AA and other inflation connected allowance. DBP also remained indifferent on the settled decision of the Executive Secretary that the AA was already considered integrated into the basic salary of DBP's employees. The same does not hold true in the case of the GFPA.</p><p> We find the records of the present petition bereft of findings of bad faith on the part of the DBP with regard to the grant of the GFPA. Even the COA argued that the disallowance of the GFPA was a distinct matter from the legality of the AA because the disallowance of the GFPA boiled down to the propriety of the compromise between DBP and its employees. To remedy an ongoing labor dispute in 2003, the DBP's BOD relied in good faith on its interpretation of statutory authority to fix the compensation structure of the bank's officials and employees<em> vis-a-vis</em> its statutory power to enter into a compromise in protection of the bank's interests. It acted under the honest belief that its charter conferred its authority to settle contested employees' benefits in the interest of the bank. Hence, in line with settled jurisprudence on disbursements subsequently disallowed by the COA, which provides that recipients or payees need not refund disallowed amounts when received in good faith,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> We hold that the DBP is no longer required to refund the GFPA distributed. </p><p> It is settled that Government officials and employees who received benefits or allowances, which were disallowed, may keep the amounts received if there is no finding of bad faith and the disbursement was made in good faith. On the other hand, officers who participated in the approval of the disallowed allowances or benefits are required to refund only the amounts received when they are found to be in bad faith or grossly negligent amounting to bad faith.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, We <b>AFFIRM</b> the Commission on Audit's disallowance of the payment of Governance Forum Productivity Award to DBP's officials and employees in the total amount of PhP170,893,689.00 as contained in its Decision No. 2012-207 dated November 15, 2012 subject to the <b>MODIFICATION</b> that the DBP's officials and employees are no longer required to refund the said amount.</p><p> <b>SO ORDERED.</b></p><p> <i>Carpio, Velasco, Jr., Leonardo-De Castro, Peralta, Bersamin, Del Castillo, Perlas-Bernabe, Caguioa, Martires, Reyes, Jr</i>., and <i>Gesmundo, JJ</i>., concur. <i><br> Leonen, J</i>., dissent.

I also disagree with the posture that the Development Bank of the Philippines' employees may only collectively bargain for non-economic benefits.</p><p> The Development Bank of the Philippines is an economic agent in the public sector acquired by the government. It was established as a separate corporate entity to engage in the banking business—with a private and commercial objective—and as such, different from regular agencies of the government performing governmental functions. In this sense, its employees are similarly situated to those in government corporations established under the Corporation Code who enjoy full collective bargaining rights. To exclude economic benefits from the scope of the Development Bank of the Philippines' employees' collective bargaining rights would constitute an abridgment of their fundamental right and cause prejudice against them, besides being contrary to social justice.</p><p align="center"> <b>I</b> </p><p> The right to labor and the right to form unions or employee organizations are unassailable. They are guaranteed under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> to which the Philippines is a signatory, and the 1987 Constitution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Article III, Section 8, in particular, expressly recognizes the right of workers m the public sector to form unions, associations, and societies.</p><p> This guarantee is reiterated in the second paragraph of Article XIII, Section 3, on Social Justice and Human Rights, which mandates that the State "shall guarantee the rights of all workers to self-organization, collective bargaining and negotiations, and peaceful concerted activities, including the right to strike in accordance with law" and that "[t]hey shall also participate in policy and decision-making processes affecting their rights and benefits as may be provided by law." </p><p> Specifically with respect to employees in the civil service, i.e., "all branches, subdivisions, instrumentalities, and agencies of the Government, including government-owned or controlled corporations with original charters,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Article IX-B, Section 2, paragraph (5) provides that "[t]he right to self-organization shall not be denied to government employees." The rationale for this provision was: </p><blockquote> <p> The government is in a sense the repository of the national sovereignty and, in that respect, it must be held in reverence if not in awe. It symbolizes the unity of the nation, but it does perform a mundane task as well. It is an employer in every sense of the word except that terms and conditions of work are set forth through a Civil Service Commission. The government is the biggest employer in the Philippines. There is an employer-employee relationship and we all know that the accumulated grievances of several decades are now beginning to explode in our faces among government workers who feel that the rights afforded by the Labor Code, for example, to workers in the private sector have been effectively denied to workers in government ... and the government did not even state the reasons why. The government employees were being discriminated against. As a general rule, the majority of the world's countries now entertain public service unions. What they really add up to is that the employees of the government form their own association. Generally, they do not bargain for wages because these are fixed in the budget but they do acquire a forum where, among other things, professional and self-development is (sic) promoted and encouraged. They also act as watchdogs of their own bosses so that when graft and corruption is committed, generally, it is the unions who are no longer afraid by virtue of the armor of self-organization that become the public's own allies for detecting graft and corruption and for exposing it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> (Citation omitted)</p> </blockquote> <p> Statutory implementation of the Constitutional guarantee of self­ organization is found in Article 245 of Presidential Decree No. 442 or the Labor Code, as amended by Executive Order No. 111 (1986): </p><blockquote> <p> Article 245. <i>Right of employees in the public service</i>. — Employees of government corporations established under the Corporation Code shall have the right to organize and to bargain collectively with their respective employers.

In this connection, they are divided in to two (2) groups, namely, those employed in government corporations established under the Corporation Code, and those in the civil service, including government corporations with original charters. While it is specifically provided that those belonging to the first class may bargain collectively with their employers; those pertaining to the second class may organize "for purposes not contrary to law."</p><p> Under the Labor Code, the right to self-organization essentially includes (a) the right to organize labor unions for purposes of collective bargaining or negotiation, and (b) to engage in lawful concerted activities for furtherance and protection of the members' rights and interests.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></p><p> However, for employees in the civil service, they have limited collective bargaining rights <i>only</i> in the sense that the terms and conditions of employment are "fixed by law."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Article IX-B, Section 8 of the 1987 Constitution prohibits against additional compensation of elective or appointive officer or employee of the government except when specifically authorized by law.

It is expected of a government official or employee that he keeps uppermost in mind the demands of public welfare. He is there to render public service. He is of course entitled to be rewarded for the performance of the functions entrusted to him, but that should not be the overriding consideration. The intrusion of the thought of private gain should be unwelcome. The temptation to further personal ends, public employment as a means for the acquisition of wealth, is to be resisted. That at least is the ideal. There is then to be an awareness on the part of an officer or employee of the government that he is to receive only such compensation as may be fixed by law. With such a realization, he is expected not to avail himself of devious or circuitous means to increase the remuneration attached to his position. It is an entirely different matter if the legislative body would itself determine for reasons satisfactory to it that he should receive something more.

The principle behind labor unionism in private industry is that industrial peace cannot be secured through compulsion by law. Relations between private employers and their employees rest on an essentially voluntary basis. Subject to the minimum requirements of wage laws and other labor and welfare legislation, the terms and conditions of employment in the unionized private sector are settled through the process of collective bargaining. In government employment, however, it is the legislature and, where properly given delegated power, the administrative heads of government which fix the terms and conditions of employment.

It also has the power to fix the salaries and emoluments of its officers and employees, and to grant increases based on the Development Bank of the Philippines' profitability. The flexibility that was given to the Development Bank of the Philippines' Board of Directors to set the compensation package for its employees was to enable the Development Bank of the Philippines to hire and retain competent and highly motivated personnel so that it could effectively carry out its objectives.

The phrase "as closely as possible," which qualifies TIDCORP's duty "to endeavor to conform," <i>recognizes that the law allows TIDCORP to deviate from RA 6758, but it should still try to hew closely with its principles and modes</i>. Had the intent of Congress been to require TIDCORP to fully, exactly and strictly comply with RA 6758, it would have so stated in unequivocal terms.

This Court discussed these two (2) functions in the early case of <i>Bacani v. NACOCO</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> The former [constituent] are those which constitute the very bonds of society and are compulsory in nature; the latter [ministrant] are those that are undertaken only by way of advancing the general interests of society, and are merely optional. President Wilson enumerates the constituent functions as follows:</p> <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="4%"><div align="center">(1)</div></td> <td width="96%"><div align="justify">The keeping of order and providing for the protection of persons and property from violence and robbery.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="center">(2)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">The fixing of the legal relations between man and wife and between parents and children.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="center">(3)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">The regulation of the holding, transmission, and interchange of property, and the determination of its liabilities for debt or for crime.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="center">(4)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">The determination of contract rights between individuals.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="center">(5)</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">The definition and punishment of crime.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="center">(6)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">The administration of justice in civil cases.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="center">(7)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">The determination of the political duties, privileges, and relations of citizens.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="center">(8)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Dealings of the state with foreign powers: the preservation of the state from external danger or encroachment and the advancement of its international interests....</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p> The most important of the ministrant functions are: public works, public education, public charity, health and safety regulations, and regulations of trade and industry. The principles determining whether or not a government shall exercise certain of these optional functions are: (1) that a government should do for the public welfare those things which private capital would not naturally undertake and (2) that a government should do these things which by its very nature it is better equipped to administer for the public welfare than is any private individual or group of individuals....</p> <p> From the above we may infer that, strictly speaking, there are functions which our government is required to exercise to promote its objectives as expressed in our Constitution and which are exercised by it as an attribute of sovereignty, and those which it may exercise to promote merely the welfare, progress and prosperity of the people. To this latter class belongs the organization of those corporations owned or controlled by the government to promote certain aspects of the economic life of our people such as the National Coconut Corporation. These are what we call government-owned or controlled corporations which may take on the form of a private enterprise or one organized with powers and formal characteristics of a private corporations [sic] under the Corporation Law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> (Citations omitted)</p> </blockquote> <p> One example of a government-owned or -controlled corporation performing proprietary functions is the Bases Conversion Development Authority.

Section 3 of Republic Act No. 7227 reads:</p> <blockquote> <p> SECTION 3. <i>Creation of the Bases Conversion and Development Authority</i>. — There is hereby created a body corporate to be known as the Conversion Authority which shall have the attribute of perpetual succession and shall be vested with the powers of a corporation.</p> </blockquote> <p> It may not be amiss to state at this point that the functions of government have been classified into governmental or constituent and proprietary or ministrant. While public benefit and public welfare, particularly, the promotion of the economic and social development of Central Luzon, may be attributable to the operation of the BCDA, yet it is certain that the functions performed by the BCDA are basically proprietary in nature. The promotion of economic and social development of Central Luzon, in particular, and the country's goal for enhancement, in general, do not make the BCDA equivalent to the Government. Other corporations have been created by government to act as its agents for the realization of its programs, the SSS, GSIS, NAWASA and the NIA, to count a few, and yet, the Court has ruled that these entities, although performing functions aimed at promoting public interest and public welfare, are not government-function corporations invested with governmental attributes. <i>It may thus be said that the BCDA is not a mere agency of the Government but a corporate body performing proprietary functions</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> Here, the Development Bank of the Philippines was created as a body corporate and a government financial institution "principally to service the medium and long term needs of agricultural and industrial enterprises, particularly in the countryside and preferably for small and medium scale enterprises."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></p><p> Section 3 of its Revised Charter vests in the Development Bank of the Philippines specific powers normally exercised by privately owned banks.
