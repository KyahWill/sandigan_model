could not prevail over the positive allegations of the police officers, who were presumed to be in the regular performance of their official duties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Further, while there was an admitted non-compliance by the officers with the procedure under Section 21 of RA 9165, <i>i.e.</i>, the presence of the required witnesses after seizure, the RTC nevertheless held that the integrity and evidentiary value of the items seized were preserved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Accused-appellant Luna filed a Motion for

the CA agreed with the RTC's finding that the integrity and evidentiary value of the <i>corpus delicti</i> were properly preserved by the police officers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> The CA explained that the prosecution's evidence was able to establish an uninterrupted chain of custody from the time the drugs were allegedly seized from accused-appellant Luna until the time it was offered in evidence during trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> The dispositive portion of the CA Decision stated, thus:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the <b>APPEAL</b> is hereby <b>DENIED</b>. Accordingly, the Joint Decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 168, Marikina on December 8, 2010, which pronounced accused-­appellant's guilt beyond reasonable doubt for violation of <i>Sections 5</i> and <i>11, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165</i>, is hereby <b>AFFIRMED</b>.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br></blockquote>Hence, this appeal.<br><br>In the main, accused-appellant Luna anchors his defense on the failure of the police officers to comply with the procedure under Section 21 of RA 9165, which he argues is mandatory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> He argues, among other things, that the government official (Kagawad Oscar Frank Rabe) and media representative (Danny Placides) - both of whom are required witnesses under the law - were not present immediately after seizure and confiscation of the dangerous drugs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br><center><u><i>Issue</i></u><br></center><br>The principal issue for resolution is whether accused-appellant Luna is guilty beyond reasonable doubt for the crime of violation of Sections 5 and 11, Article II of RA 9165.<br><br><center><u><i>The Court's Ruling</i></u><br></center><br>The appeal is granted.<br><br>The merits of the case are straightforward. In this regard, before disposing of the substantive issues, the Court finds it proper to first review the current literature on Section 21 of RA 9165.<br><br><i>Section 21, Article II of RA 9165, re­examined.</i><br><br>The legality of entrapment operations involving illegal drugs begins and ends with Section 21,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> Article II of RA 9165. Under the law, the following procedure must be observed in the seizure, custody, and disposition of dangerous drugs and related paraphernalia:<br><blockquote>SEC. 21. <i>Custody and Disposition of Confiscated, Seized, and/or Surrendered Dangerous Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous Drugs, Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, Instruments/ Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment</i>. - The PDEA shall take charge and have custody of all dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, as well as instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment so confiscated, seized and/or surrendered, for proper disposition in the following manner:<br><br>(1) The apprehending team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, <b>immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused</b> or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, <b>a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof</b>[.] (Emphasis supplied; italics in the original)<br></blockquote>Meanwhile, the Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA 9165 (IRR) supplied details as to the place where the physical inventory and photographing of the seized items should be done, <i>i.e.</i>, at the place of seizure, at the nearest police station, or at the nearest office of the apprehending officer or team. Further, a "saving clause" was added in case of non-compliance with the requirements under justifiable grounds. Section 21(a), Article II of the IRR, thus states:<br><blockquote><b>SECTION 21.</b> x x x <br>&nbsp;<br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(a) </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">The apprehending officer/team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof: Provided, that the physical inventory and photograph shall be conducted <strong>at the place where the search warrant is served; or at the nearest police station or at the nearest office of the apprehending officer/team, whichever is practicable, in case of warrantless seizures;</strong> Provided, further, <strong>that non-compliance with these requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and invalid such seizures of and custody over said items</strong>[.]<br></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>In sum, the law puts in place requirements of time, witnesses and proof of inventory with respect to the custody of seized dangerous drugs, to wit:<br><blockquote><ol><li>The initial custody requirements must be done <b>immediately after seizure</b> or confiscation;<br><br></li><li>The <b>physical inventory and photographing</b> must be done <b>in the presence of</b>:<br><ol type="a"><br><li>The <b>accused</b> or his representative or counsel;<br><br></li><li>The <b>required witnesses</b>:<br><ol type="i"><br><li>a representative from the <b>media</b> and the <b>Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official</b> for offenses committed during the effectivity of RA 9165 and prior to its amendment by RA 10640, <u><b>as in this case</b></u>;<br><br></li><li>an <b>elected public official</b> and a representative of the <b>National Prosecution Service of the DOJ or the media</b> for offenses committed during the effectivity of RA 10640.<br></li></ol></li></ol></li></ol></blockquote>As a rule, strict compliance with the foregoing requirements is mandatory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> However, following the IRR ofRA 9165, the courts <b>may</b> allow a deviation from these requirements if the following requisites are availing: <b>(1) the existence of "justifiable grounds" allowing departure from the rule on strict compliance; <u>and</u> (2) the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending team</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> If these two elements concur, the seizure and custody over the confiscated items shall not be rendered void and invalid; <i>ergo</i>, the integrity of the <i>corpus delicti</i> remains untarnished. The Court's disquisition in <i>People v. Reyes</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> is particularly illuminating:<br><blockquote>Under the last paragraph of Section 21(a), Article II of the IRR of R.A. No. 9165, a saving mechanism has been provided to ensure that not every case of noncompliance with the procedures for the preservation of the chain of custody will irretrievably prejudice the Prosecution's case against the accused. <b>To warrant the application of this saving mechanism, however, the Prosecution must recognize the lapse or lapses, and justify or explain them. Such justification or explanation would be the basis for applying the saving mechanism.</b> Yet, the Prosecution did not concede such lapses, and did not even tender any token justification or explanation for them. <b>The failure to justify or explain underscored the doubt and suspicion about the integrity of the evidence of the <i>corpus delicti</i>.</b> With the chain of custody having been compromised, the accused deserves acquittal. x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> (Emphasis supplied; citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Following a plain reading of the law, it is now settled that <b>non­compliance with the mandatory procedure in Section 21 triggers the operation of the saving clause enshrined in the IRR of RA 9165</b>. <i>Verba legis non est recedendum</i> from the words of a statute there should be no departure. Stated otherwise, in order not to render void and invalid the seizure and custody over the evidence obtained, the prosecution <u><b>must</b></u>, as a matter of law, establish that such non-compliance was based on justifiable grounds and that the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items were preserved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> Hence, before the prosecution can rely on this saving mechanism, they (the apprehending team) must first recognize lapses, and, if any are found to exist, they must justify the same accordingly.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>Now to this case.<br><br><i>The police officers failed to comply with the mandatory requirements under Section 21 of RA 9165</i><br><br>After a judicious scrutiny of the records of this case, the Court finds that the police officers reneged on their duty to comply with the requirements on the seizure, initial custody, and handling of the seized items pursuant to Section 21. Such lapses, to the mind of the Court, cast serious doubt on the identity and integrity of the <i>corpus delicti</i> and, consequently, reasonable doubt on the guilt of accused-appellant Luna.<br><br><u><i>On the three-witness requirement</i></u><br><br>To recall, the language of the first paragraph of Section 21 is clear: the apprehending team is duty-bound to conduct a physical inventory of the seized items and photograph the same "<b>immediately</b> after seizure and confiscation x x x <b>in the presence</b> of the accused x x x, a representative from the media and the [DOJ], and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>The plain import of the phrase "immediately after seizure and confiscation" means that the physical inventory and photographing of the drugs must be performed immediately <b>at the place of apprehension</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> And, in case this is not practicable, then the inventory and photographing may be done as soon as the apprehending team reaches the nearest police station or office of the apprehending officer/team. Necessarily, <b>this could only mean that the three (3) witnesses should already be physically present at the time of apprehension</b> - a requirement that can easily be complied with by the buy-bust team, considering that buy-bust operations, by their very nature, entail meticulous planning and coordination.<br><br>In other words, in case of warrantless seizures, while the physical inventory and photographing is allowed to be done "at the nearest police station or at the nearest office of the apprehending officer/team, whichever is practicable," this does <u><b>not</b></u> dispense with the requirement of having the DOJ or media representative and an elected public official to be <b>physically present at the time of apprehension</b>.<br><br>The reason for this is dictated by simple logic: these witnesses are presumed to be disinterested third parties insofar as the buy-bust operation is concerned. Hence, it is at the time of arrest - or at the time of the drugs' "seizure and confiscation" - that the insulating presence of the witnesses is most needed, as <b>it is their presence at the time of seizure and confiscation that would foreclose the pernicious practice of planting of evidence</b>.

Neither was it apparent from the records that the photograph of accused-appellant Luna holding the plastic sachets was taken in the presence of the witnesses, as mandated by Section 21.<br><br><i>The prosecution failed to successfully trigger the saving clause under the IRR of RA 9165</i><br><br>All told, given the demonstrable failure of the police officers to faithfully observe the mandatory requirements in Section 21, the question now is whether the saving clause under the IRR of RA 9165 was triggered.

There was likewise no showing of any efforts exerted by the police officers to at least coordinate with witnesses ahead of the buy-bust operation. In fact, only two (2) out of the three (3) required witnesses under Section 21 were eventually summoned to affix their signature on the pre­accomplished Inventory of Confiscated Evidence. Likewise, as already mentioned above, there was no apparent reason to defer the photographing of the <i>corpus delicti</i> immediately after seizure because the buy-bust team was able to perform an inventory at the scene.<br><br>Even in the <i>Sinumpaang Salaysay</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> of SPO1 Soriano, there was no attempt whatsoever to place on record the reasons for the non-compliance with the procedure in Section 21:<br><blockquote>Na, aking nilagyan ng rnarkang "RTL-RS BUYBUST" 04/14/08 ang aking nabiling isang pirasong transparent plastic sachet na may larnang pinaghihinalaang shabu.<br><br>Na, akin ding nilagyan ng markang "RTL-RS POSS" 04/14/08 ang aking nakumpiska sa kanyang pag-iingat na isang pirasong transparent plastic sachet na may larnang pinaghihinalaang shabu.<br><br>Na, ako ay gumawa ng inventory of confiscated evidence at akin itong pinirmahan at hindi lumagda ang taong suspetsado at pinirmahan ng Brgy[.] Official ng Brgy.
