It brushed aside Naredico's contention that the disputed area was not included in Section 1.1 or the Operating Area of Krominco's Operating Contract.

Subsequently, it entered into a Mineral Production Sharing Agreement<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> with the Government for a 25-year period, from September 28, 2009 to September 28, 2034. Respondent's present Mineral Production Sharing Agreement temporarily excluded the overlap area pending resolution of the present dispute.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup></p><p> Respondent opines that the Court of Appeals correctly applied the firstÂ­in-time, first-in-right principle since a dispute on overlapping contract areas involves a mining claim.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> It states, "Even Naredico would admit that the right to explore, develop[,] and utilize a mineral area is rendered nugatory if the area to which such right adheres to is subject to multiple claims."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup></p><p> Respondent likewise posits that the Court of Appeals was not bound by Secretary Alcala's factual findings that the Amended Survey Plan was void, since these were not supported by substantial evidence. It contends that the law at that time authorized the Mines and Geosciences Bureau, not the Environment and Natural Resources Secretary, to approve survey plans. In this case, the Mines and Geosciences Bureau approved its Amended Survey Plan.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup></p><p> Respondent also points out that even if its Amended Survey Plan was indeed void, the overlap area would still not be conveyed to petitioner as part of petitioner's contract area under its Agreement, since the overlap area was not "abandoned or relinquished by the former grantee of mining rights or operator."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup></p><p> Respondent highlights that petitioner, having always known of an overlap between their mining claims, agreed to exclude the areas with mining rights in its final contract area.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> It declares that petitioner was estopped from claiming rights over the overlap area: </p><blockquote> <p> Here, Naredico may not renege on its own acts and representations to the prejudice of the Government and Krominco, both of whom relied on Naredico's representation.

Respondent points out that it was neither allowed to participate in the actual survey nor was it given a copy of the resulting Joint Relocation Survey Report.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> </p><p> Finally, respondent claims that the Court of Appeals did not err in reversing the Mines Adjudication Board Decision, since the latter effectively created new contracts for petitioner and respondent without their consent.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> </p><p> On April 16, 2012,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> this Court directed petitioner to reply to the Comment. </p><p> In its Reply,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> petitioner points out that respondent already admitted that its own Mineral Production Sharing Agreement did not include the overlap area.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> </p><p> Petitioner claims that following the first-in-time, first-in-right principle, it has a superior right over the overlap area as it was the first to discover the mineral deposits within it.
