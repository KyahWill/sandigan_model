The valuation recommended by the commissioners cannot also be adopted as the appraised value was arrived at considering only the average of recorded sales of property within or adjacent to the subject property in Tandang Sora[,] ranging from as low as P5,780.00 to as high as Php25,190.00 per square meter, the BIR Zonal Valuation of Php14,000.00 and the highest recorded sale for adjacent property of Php25,190.00. No other documents or proofs that can serve as basis for determining market value were presented to substantiate their recommended valuation. The valuation recommended by Philippine Appraisal Co., Inc.

The highest appraised value of a lot within the immediate vicinity is at Php38,500.00 per square meter is expected considering the presence of a golf course in the area, the existence of which will always command a high market value. <u>From the foregoing, this Court believes that the fair market value for the properties subject of these expropriation cases is Php25,000.00 per square meter.</u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Petitioner's motion for reconsideration was denied by the RTC in a <i>Resolution</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> dated November 29, 2012, for lack of merit.<br><br>Unsatisfied, Petitioner appealed to the CA, alleging that the RTC erred when it ruled that the fair market value of the properties subject of expropriation is P25,000.00 instead of P17,893.33 per square meter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br><center><b><i>Ruling of the CA</i></b><br></center><br>In its <i>Decision</i> dated February 28, 2014 the CA denied Petitioner's appeal and consequently, <b>affirmed</b> the RTC Decision <i>in toto, viz.</i>:<br><blockquote>Given the foregoing, We find the amount of P25,000.00 fixed by the court <i>a quo</i> as the full and fair equivalent of the properties sought to be expropriated.

This too is the mandate of Section 4 of R.A. 8974, <i>viz.</i>: "[w]hen the decision of the court becomes final and executory, the implementing agency shall pay the owner the difference between the amount already paid and the just compensation as determined by the court."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br><br>In other words, R.A. 8974 requires the government to pay at two stages: <b><u><i>first</i></u>, immediately upon the filing of the complaint, the initial deposit</b> which is 100% of the value of the property based on the current relevant zonal valuation of the BIR, and the value of the improvements and/or structures sought to be expropriated; and <u><b><i>second</i></b></u>, the just compensation as determined by the court, when the decision becomes final and executory, in which case the implementing agency shall pay the owner the difference between the just compensation as determined by the court and the amount already or initially paid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><br>Accordingly, absent full payment of just compensation, interest on the unpaid portion (<i>i.e.</i>, the just compensation determined by the court at the time the decision becomes final and executory minus the initial deposit), likewise runs as a matter of law and follows as a matter of course<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> — in order to place the owner in a position as good as (but not better than) the position he was in before the taking occurred.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> The underlying reason is simple. Compensation would not be "just" if the government does not pay the property owner interest on the just compensation from the date of the taking of the property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br>As aptly observed by the Court in <i>Evergreen Manufacturing Corp. v. Republic</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup><br><blockquote>Section 9, Article III of the 1987 Constitution provides that "no private property shall be taken for public use without just compensation." Just compensation in expropriation cases has been held to contemplate just and timely payment, and prompt payment is the payment in full of the just compensation as finally determined by the courts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> Thus, just compensation envisions a payment in full of the expropriated property. Absent full payment, interest on the balance would necessarily be due on the unpaid amount. In <i>Republic v. Mupas</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> we held that interest on the unpaid compensation becomes due if there is no full compensation for the expropriated property, in accordance with the concept of just compensation. We held:<br><blockquote>The reason is that just compensation would not be "just" if the State does not pay the property owner interest on the just compensation from the date of the taking of the property. Without prompt payment, the property owner suffers the immediate deprivation of both his land and its fruits or income. The owner's loss, of course, is not only his property but also its income-generating potential.<br><br>Ideally, just compensation should be immediately made available to the property owner so that he may derive income from this compensation, in the same manner that he would have derived income from his expropriated property.<br><br>However, if full compensation is not paid for the property taken, then the State must pay for the shortfall in the earning potential immediately lost due to the taking, and the absence of replacement property from which income can be derived. <b>Interest on the unpaid compensation becomes due as compliance with the constitutional mandate on eminent domain and as a basic measure of fairness.</b><br><br>Thus, <b>interest in eminent domain cases "runs as a matter of law and follows as a matter of course from the right of the landowner to be placed in as good a position as money can accomplish, as of the date of taking."</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote></blockquote>While it is ideal that just compensation be immediately made available to the property owner so that he may derive income from that compensation, that is not always the case.
