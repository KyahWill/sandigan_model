However, the Governor-General may, for reasons of public interest, declare lands of the public domain open to disposition before the same have had their boundaries established or been surveyed, or may, for the same reasons, suspend their concession or disposition until they are again declared open to concession or disposition by proclamation duly published or by Act of the Legislature.</p> <p> Section 9. For the purposes of their government and disposition, the lands of the public domain alienable or open to disposition shall be classified, according to the use or purposes to which such lands are destined, as follows:</p> <blockquote> <p> (a) Agricultural.<br> (b) Commercial, industrial, or for similar productive purposes.<br> (c) Educational, charitable, and other similar purposes.<br> (d) Reservations for town sites, and for public and quasi-public uses.</p> </blockquote> <p> The Governor-General, upon recommendation by the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources, shall from time to time make the classifications provided for in this section, and may, at any time and in a similar manner, transfer lands from one class to another.

They reason that the passage of "[t]he Public Land Act, coupled with the issuance of Homestead Patent No. V-67820 over [Lot No. H-19731] in the name of Daquer[,] is equivalent to an official proclamation classifying [Lot No. H- 19731] as alienable or disposable land of the public domain."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup></p><p> Private respondents' reliance on <em>Chavez</em> is misplaced. <em>Chavez</em> is inapplicable since it involves the sale of reclaimed foreshore and submerged lands to a private corporation through a Joint Venture Agreement. The facts of the case are as follows: </p><p> In 1973, the government, through the Commissioner of Public Highways, entered into a contract with the Construction and Development Corporation of the Philippines for the reclamation of certain foreshore and offshore areas of Manila Bay. Their contract involved the construction of Manila-Cavite Coastal Road Phases I and II.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup></p><p> Subsequently, then President Ferdinand E. Marcos, issued Presidential Decree No. 1084, which created the Public Estates Authority (PEA) and tasked PEA "to reclaim land, including foreshore and submerged areas,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> and "to develop, improve, acquire, . . . lease and sell any and all kinds of lands."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> Then President Marcos likewise issued Presidential Decree No. 1085, transferring to PEA the "lands reclaimed in the foreshore and offshore area of Manila Bay" under the Manila-Cavite Coastal Road and Reclamation Project.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> </p><p> Thereafter, then President Corazon C. Aquino issued Special Patent No. 3517, granting and transferring to PEA the parcels of land reclaimed under the Manila-Cavite Coastal Road and Reclamation Project. Consequently, Transfer Certificates of Title Nos. 7309, 7311, and 7312, covering three (3) reclaimed islands known as the "Freedom Islands," were issued in favor of PEA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> </p><p> PEA and Amari, a private corporation, then entered into a Joint Venture Agreement for the development of the Freedom Islands.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> Under the Joint Venture Agreement, Amari would acquire and own a maximum of 367.5 hectares of reclaimed land which would be titled in its name.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup></p><p> On November 29, 1996, then Senator Ernesto Maceda delivered a privilege speech and called the Joint Venture Agreement between PEA and Amari as the "grandmother of all scams."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> The Senate Committee on Government Corporations and Public Enterprises, and the Committee on Accountability of Public Officers and Investigations held a joint investigation on the matter. They reported that: (1) the reclaimed lands that PEA sought to transfer to Amari under the Joint Venture Agreement "are lands of the public domain which the government has not classified as alienable lands and therefore PEA cannot alienate these lands; (2) the certificates of title covering the Freedom Islands are thus void, and (3) the [Joint Venture Agreement] itself is illegal."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup></p><p> Subsequently, petitioner Francisco Chavez filed a Petition for Mandamus with Prayer for the Issuance of a Writ of Preliminary Injunction and Temporary Restraining Order, assailing the sale of lands of public domain to Amari. He argued that the sale was "a blatant violation of Section 3, Article XII of the 1987 Constitution prohibiting the sale of alienable lands of the public domain to private corporations."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup></p><p> On the issue of land classification, this Court held that foreshore and submerged areas belong to the public domain. Mere reclamation by PEA "does not convert these inalienable natural resources of the State into alienable or disposable lands of the public domain. There must be a law or presidential proclamation officially classifying these reclaimed lands as alienable or disposable and open to disposition or concession."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> Thus: </p><blockquote> <p> Under Section 2, Article XII of the 1987 Constitution, the foreshore and submerged areas of Manila Bay are part of the "lands of the public domain, waters . . . and other natural resources" and consequently "owned by the State." As such, foreshore and submerged areas "shall not be alienated," unless they are classified as "agricultural lands" of the public domain. The mere reclamation of these areas by PEA does not convert these inalienable natural resources of the State into alienable or disposable lands of the public domain. There must be a law or presidential proclamation officially classifying these reclaimed lands as alienable or disposable and open to disposition or concession. Moreover, these reclaimed lands cannot be classified as alienable or disposable if the law has reserved them for some public or quasi-public use.</p> <p> Section 8 of C[ommonwealth] A[ct] No. 141 provides that "only those lands shall be declared open to disposition or concession which have been <i>officially delimited and classified</i>." The President has the authority to classify inalienable lands of the public domain into alienable or disposable lands of the public domain, pursuant to Section 6 of C[ommonwealth] A[ct] No. 141.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> (Emphasis in the original, citations omitted)</p> </blockquote> <p> Nonetheless, this Court considered the issuance of a presidential decree and a special patent proclaiming the land as alienable and disposable as a positive act of the Executive Department that converted the reclaimed areas into alienable and disposable agricultural lands: </p><blockquote> <p> P[residential] D[ecree] No. 1085, coupled with President Aquino's <em><strong>actual issuance</strong></em> of a special patent covering the Freedom Islands, is equivalent to an official proclamation classifying the Freedom Islands as alienable or disposable lands of the public domain. P[residential] D[ecree] No. 1085 and President Aquino's issuance of a land patent also constitute a declaration that the Freedom Islands are no longer needed for public service. <b><i>The Freedom Islands are thus alienable or disposable lands of the public domain, open to disposition or concession to qualified parties.</i></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)</p> </blockquote> <p> In other words, Presidential Decree No. 1085<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> provides for the express and direct transfer of ownership of the reclaimed lands located in the foreshore and offshore area of Manila Bay. On the other hand, Act No. 2874 merely outlines the procedure for the administration and disposition of alienable lands of the public domain.</p><p> Clearly, the lack of any qualifying words that explicitly declare the lands as alienable and disposable, or convey ownership over them proves that Act No. 2874 was enacted merely to serve as a guideline for the proper administration and disposition of alienable lands.</p><p> Act No. 2874, Section 8 provides that only lands which have been officially delimited and classified as alienable may be disposed of through any of the authorized methods. </p><p> Therefore, the issuance of Homestead Patent No. V-67820 in favor of Daquer, pursuant to the Public Land Act, did not, by itself, reclassify Lot No. H-19731 into alienable and disposable public agricultural land. </p><p align="center"> <b>II.B</b> </p><p> In denying petitioner's complaint, the Regional Trial Court ruled that since Lot No. H-19731 falls within the unclassified zone under the Land Classification Map, it should be presumed that it was public agricultural land.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> In its ruling, the Regional Trial Court relied on <em>Krivenko v.

The Supreme Court in [the] case of Krivenko v.

When, therefore, this provision, with reference [to] lands of the public domain, makes mention of only agricultural, timber and mineral lands, it means that all lands of the public domain are classified into said three groups, namely, agricultural, timber and mineral. And this classification finds corroboration in the circumstance that at the time of the adoption of the Constitution, that was the basic classification existing in the public laws and judicial decisions in the Philippines, and the term "public agricultural lands" under said classification had then acquired a technical meaning that was well-known to the members of the Constitutional Convention who were mostly members of the legal profession.</p> <p> As early as 1908, in the case of Mapa vs. Insular Government (10 Phil., 175, 182), this Court said that the phrase "agricultural public lands" as defined in the Act of Congress of July 1, 1902, which phrase is also to be found in several sections of the Public Land Act (No. 926), means "those public lands acquired from Spain which are neither mineral nor timber lands.["] This definition has been followed in a long line of decisions of this Court. . . . And with respect to residential lands, it has been held that since they are neither mineral nor timber lands, of necessity they must be classified as agricultural.</p> <p> . . . But whatever the test might be, the fact remains that at the time the Constitutional (sic) was adopted, lands of the public domain were classified in our laws and jurisprudence into agricultural, mineral, and timber, and that the term "public agricultural lands" [was] construed as referring to those lands that were not timber or mineral, and as including residential lands[.] It may safely [be] presumed, therefore, that what the members of the Constitutional Convention had in mind when they drafted the Constitutional (sic) was this well-known classification and its technical meaning then prevailing. </p> </blockquote> <p> Being not classified as mineral or timberland, it could be presumed that the land subject of this case is agricultural applying the afore-quoted jurisprudence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> The Regional Trial Court's reliance on <i>Krivenko</i> is erroneous. The pivotal issue in <i>Krivenko</i> is whether or not an alien could acquire a residential lot in the Philippines. Here, the issue is whether the mere issuance of a homestead patent could classify an otherwise unclassified public land into an alienable and disposable agricultural land of the public domain. </p><p> Even if the property falls within the unclassified zone, this Court, in <i>Heirs of the late Spouses Palanca v. Republic</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> ruled that unclassified lands, until released and rendered open to disposition, shall be considered as inalienable lands of the public domain, thus: </p><blockquote> <p> While it is true that the land classification map does not categorically state that the islands are public forests, the fact that they were unclassified lands leads to the same result. In the absence of the classification as mineral or timber land, the land remains unclassified land until released and rendered open to disposition. When the property is still unclassified, whatever possession applicants may have had, and however long, still cannot ripen into private ownership. This is because, pursuant to Constitutional precepts, all lands of the public domain belong to the State, and the State is the source of any asserted right to ownership in such lands and is charged with the conservation of such patrimony. Thus, the Court has emphasized the need to show in registration proceedings that the government, through a positive act, has declassified inalienable public land into disposable land for agricultural or other purposes.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> (Citations omitted) </p> </blockquote> <p align="center"> <b>II.C</b> </p><p> As a rule, a certificate of title issued pursuant to a homestead patent partakes the nature of a certificate of title issued through a judicial proceeding and becomes incontrovertible upon the expiration of one (1) year. Thus, in <i>Wee v. Mardo</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> [O]nce a patent is registered and the corresponding certificate of title is issued, the land ceases to be part of public domain and becomes private property over which the Director of Lands has neither control nor jurisdiction. A public land patent, when registered in the corresponding Register of Deeds, is a veritable Torrens title, and becomes as indefeasible upon the expiration of one (1) year from the date of issuance thereof. Said title, like one issued pursuant to a judicial decree, is subject to review within one (1) year from the date of the issuance of the patent. This rule is embodied in Section l 03 of PD 1529, which provides that:</p> <blockquote> <p> Section 103. Certificates of title pursuant to patents. — Whenever public land is by the Government alienated, granted or conveyed to any person, the same shall be brought forthwith under the operation of this Decree. . . . <b>After due registration and issuance of the certificate of title, such land shall be deemed to be registered land to all intents and purposes under this Decree.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> Nevertheless, the rule that "a certificate of title issued pursuant to a homestead patent becomes indefeasible after one year, is subject to the proviso that 'the land covered by said certificate is a disposable public land within the contemplation of the Public Land Law."'<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup></p><p> When the property covered by a homestead patent is part of the inalienable land of the public domain, the title issued pursuant to it is null and void, and the rule on indefeasibility of title will not apply.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> In <i>Agne v. Director of Lands</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> The rule on the incontrovertibility of a certificate of title upon the expiration of one year, after the entry of the decree, pursuant to the provisions of the Land Registration Act, does not apply where an action for the cancellation of a patent and a certificate of title issued pursuant thereto is instituted on the ground that they are <em>null and void</em> because the Bureau of Lands had no jurisdiction to issue them at all[.]<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> In <i>Republic v. Ramos</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> this Court held that despite the registration of the land and the issuance of a Torrens title, the State may still file an action for reversion of a homestead land that was granted in violation of the law. The action is not barred by the statute of limitations, especially against the State: </p><blockquote> <p> Granting that because the homestead land in controversy has been brought under the operation of the Land Registration Act and the Torrens title issued therefor has become indefeasible, under the prayer of any other or further relief, which the court may deem just and equitable to grant, <i>a directive for reconveyance may be granted, if after trial on the merits the court should find that the appellee Ricardo Ramos is not entitled to hold and possess title in fee simple to the homestead land erroneously granted to him</i> ... The action for reconveyance is <i>not yet barred by the statute of limitations</i>, even granting that the statute could, which, of course, does not, run against the State.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> Likewise, <i>Spouses De Guzman v.

It is intended merely to confirm and register the title which one may already have on the land.
