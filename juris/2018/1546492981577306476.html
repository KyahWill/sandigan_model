Foremost, it must be considered that the alleged expenditures cited by the OCAT are expenses which were incidental to the <strong>services of Artes as Events' specialist. </strong>Since Artes procured those items in their own capacity as private contractor and in compliance with their obligations and responsibilities as events specialist,<strong> those expenses will eventually be reimbursed by the Supreme Court to Artes</strong>. The JRPA merely identified the funding source from which those expenses shall be charged. Thus, <strong>those items are not subject of new contracts but are merely part of the services delivered by Artes. </strong>Thus, it would be inaccurate to state that those expenses were incurred prior to the grant of approval by the Chief Justice.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Mr. Davis cited the following provision of SC Administrative Circular No. 60-2003 to explain why the PMO had assisted in the procurement activities, to wit: </p><blockquote> <p> 4.3<strong> All JRSP procurement activities</strong> shall be done through, or with the assistance of the PMO. The Project Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Group of the PMO (PMO-PIMEG) will manage the specific procurement activities, and tract their baseline schedule and actual progress.

These procurement units were envisioned to perform the functions of the BAC Secretariat including the preparation of procurement documents. Considering that "request for quotations" or "canvassing documents" as loosely used, verily fall under the same category, then it may be properly inferred that the PMO, being the end-user unit validly conducted the canvass.

He insisted that "Artes was engaged to focus on the substantive part of the conference and the important details which should be accurately documented for the purpose of maintaining an official record of the events that transpired during the conference," and, consequently, the allegation of splitting of contracts was "baseless and without merit."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></p><p> Mr. Davis invoked the presumption of regularity in the performance of official functions, and the maxim <em>damnum absque injuria</em>. He manifested that "the OCAT cannot presume that PMO through the JRPA was in bad faith when it entered into the questioned transactions. Absent a clear evidence of bad faith, the same shall not be applied." He added: </p><blockquote> <p> Likewise, we also wish to reiterate our previous statement in Memorandum PMO JRPAO 09-14-2007 that the PMO's involvement in the <strong>said transaction was merely to facilitate the process by overseeing that Artes took into consideration the important factors in selecting the suppliers, particularly its capacity to execute the design and timely delivery of such requirements.</strong> The canvass made by the PMO which reflected quotations from other suppliers (although not generally required due to the very nature of subject items), was in fact an exercise of due diligence because it exerted the effort to ensure that the prices charged by Artes were still within the reasonable market price, even after including a reasonable profit margin in exchange for the additional customized design inputted by Artes to the said items under consideration. <strong>There was nothing irregular in the conduct of the PMO</strong>, thus it should not be penalized for doing its responsibilities efficiently to ensure that the National and Global Forums were successfully hosted by the Court.

An action is considered moot when it no longer presents a justiciable controversy because the issues involved have become academic or dead, or when the dispute has already been resolved and, hence, one is not entitled to judicial intervention unless the issue is likely to be raised again between the parties. As the consequence, nothing more needs to be resolved after its determination has been overtaken by subsequent events.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup></p><p> However, the mootness principle bows to certain exceptions, such that mootness will not always deter further proceedings upon a matter until its resolution in due time if there is a valid reason to do so. In <em>David v.

Based on the Report of the OCAt, liability of some form for violations of the law and rules on procurement already might have probably attached to the public officials involved. To still proceed herein clearly responds to the Constitutional declaration that public office is a public trust.

No 9184, which were to be applied suppletorily. The OCAt noted that under the procurement rules the borrower, which was the Court itself, should identify the body that would conduct the procurement activities for the borrower. For the purpose, SC Administrative Circular No. 60-2003 adopted Article V of R.A. No. 9184 to establish the JRSP Bids and Awards Committee (JRSP BAC) to be in charge of the conduct of the procurement activities. In light of this, and given that the PMO Program Director was tasked with the overall monitoring of the procurement process, Ms. Dumdum and the PMO should not have engaged in actual procurement activities, as their doing so would mean that she and the PMO were risking not being able to perform the monitoring function properly.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup></p> <p> The IBRD Guidelines defined two modes of procurement: the <b>international competitive bidding</b> (ICB); and the <b>other methods of procurement</b>. The latter included <b>limited international bidding</b> (LIB); <b>national competitive bidding</b> (NCB); <b>shopping; direct contracting</b>; <em>etc.</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup></p><p> Specifically, <strong>shopping</strong> was defined by the January 1999 IBRD Guidelines in the following manner: </p><blockquote> <p> Shopping (International and National)</p> <p> 3.5 Shopping is a procurement method based on comparing price quotations obtained from several Suppliers, usually at least three, to assure competitive prices, and is an appropriate method for procuring readily available off-the-shelf goods or standard specification commodities that are small in value. Requests for quotations shall indicate the description and quantity of the goods, as well as desired delivery time and place. Quotations may be submitted by telex or facsimile. The evaluation of quotations shall follow sound public or private sector practices of the purchaser. <b>The terms of the accepted offer shall be incorporated in a purchase order.</b> (Emphasis Supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> The PMO appeared to have resorted to <strong>shopping</strong> as the method of procurement in canvassing three suppliers for the goods and supplies intended for the National Forum.</p><p align="center"><strong> <em>Re</em>: Supplies for the National Forum and <br> the Global Forum on Liberty and Prosperity </strong> </p><p> Considering that the National Forum and the Global Forum were projects conceptualized under the aegis of the JRSP, SC Administrative Circular No. 60-2003 governed the procurement of goods, works and services. </p><p> By resorting to <strong>national shopping</strong>, however, the PMO ignored the last sentence of the IBRD Guidelines on such alternative method of procurement that required a<strong> purchase order</strong> (PO) in which the accepted offer should be indicated. The PO was akin to a "contract between the parties as it requires inputs showing the requisites of a contract of consent, object certain, and cause of obligation."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> Instead of the PO, the PMO used and relied on <strong>letter-quotations</strong> to reflect and contain the agreements between the parties. All that Ms. Dumdum as the Program Director had to do was to affix her signature on the <strong>letter-quotations</strong> beneath the word <em>Conforme</em> to indicate conformity to the terms stated therein. This manner of contracting was yet again a clear violation of the IBRD Guidelines and the Standard Bidding Documents, Procurement of Goods.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup></p><p> What were to be contained in the contracts was quite clearly stated in the law. In the 1999 version of the IBRD Guidelines, the following parameters were expressly written, to wit: </p><blockquote> <p> <b>Conditions of Contract</b> </p> <p> 2.37 The contract documents shall clearly define the scope of work to be performed, the goods to be supplied, the rights and obligations of the Borrower and of the supplier or contractor, and the functions and authority of the engineer, architect, or construction manager, if one is employed by the Borrower, in the supervision and administration of the contract. In addition to the general conditions of contract, any special conditions particular to the specific goods or works to be procured and the location of the project shall be included.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> Moreover, as the OCAt has correctly observed, the IBRD Guidelines mentioned of <strong>contract documents</strong> instead of a single document. This observation is consistent with the Generic Procurement Manual (GPM) that synchronized the provisions of R.A. No. 9184 with the procurement rules of the Asian Development Bank, Japan Bank for International Cooperation, and the World Bank itself by requiring that contracts resulting from procurement activities for goods should be supported not only by <em>a</em> contract document but by a <em>number</em> of documents including the <em>bid documents</em>. Yet, based on the detailed study made by the OCAt, no proper bidding procedure pursuant to the guidelines of SC Administrative Circular No, 60-2003 was followed by the JRSP-BAC in choosing Artes as the service provider for the National Forum and the Global Forum. Consequently, the patent nullity of the contracts with Artes became the only legal consequence to be reached from the failure to comply with the proper procurement procedure. </p><p> We are not also prepared to find that the PMO conducted the canvassing for the supplies for having been already pressed for time. Such explanation was a feeble and implausible excuse in the face of the statement by Caunca of the Property Division to the effect that the Property Division could have done the canvassing<em> in time</em> through the Phil-GEPS despite time constraints. Indeed, the records revealed no immediate or compelling justification for dispensing with the requirement of public bidding in choosing the service provider for the procurement of the goods involved thereon. To insist that a public bidding would have unnecessarily delayed the implementation of the program was truly unacceptable. By conducting the canvass without prior coordination with the Property Division, Ms. Dumdum and the PMO ignored the proper procurement procedure, and unavoidably caused the making of "advance deliveries" in contravention of the law. </p><p> The assertion by the JRP Administrator that Artes had itself conducted the canvassing of suppliers, and that the PMO had only facilitated the process was fundamentally discredited by the documents reviewed by the OCAt. The records disclosed that Ms. Dumdum as the JRP Administrator had approved the recommended award of contracts to Artes as the winning bidder despite Artes having itself conducted the bidding. We advert to the points cogently made by the OCAt thereon, <em>viz</em>.: </p><blockquote> <p> <b><i>If indeed it is true that the PMO merely facilitated the process as an overseer, and Aries was the actual canvasser, then a lot of questions are raised by the fact that Artes itself emerged the winner in the canvasses "facilitated" by the PMO, as evidenced by the undated Abstracts of Bids approved by the JRP Administrator. </i></b>Notably, Artes emerged the firm with the ''lowest quotation" for jewelry boxes and ball pens even though the JRP Administrator conformed to its quotation and Artes delivered the said goods <i>days before</i> OfficeMAN and Chateau offered their quotations for the same goods; </p> <p> Moreover, assuming that the PMO had been authorized as a special procurement body, it may not conduct shopping without authority from the Chief Justice as head of the procuring entity. Section 48 of Republic Act No. 9184 provides that to promote economy and efficiency, an alternative method of procurement such as shopping may only be conducted upon prior approval by the Head of the Procuring Entity and "whenever justified by the conditions" provided by Republic Act No. 9184. The JRP Administrator, who does not appear to have been specially authorized by the Chief Justice for the purpose of approving the alternative method of procurement to competitive bidding to be adopted,<em> may not arrogate unto herself the responsibility of the Chief Justice to authorize the conduct of shopping</em>. (Italicized and bold emphases are part of the original)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> At the very least, the resulting situation of the canvasser later emerging as the winning bidder was highly irregular because of the plainly obvious conflict of interest. </p><p> Considering that most of the expenditures whose payments were sought by Ms. Dumdum as the authorized approving official came within the threshold allowed in SC Administrative Circular No. 06-2003 (<i>i.e</i>., P1,000,000.00 and below), the payment of contracts on the goods, works, and services procured under the JRSP would have been presumed to have initially complied with the proper procurement procedure conducted by the JRSP-BAC. Yet, we cannot even presume regularity simply because of several indicia of non-compliance with the proper procurement procedure. The presumption of regularity vanished with the appearance of even just one irregularity. We agree with the OCAt that it was doubtful if the actual canvass had been conducted in view of the abstracts of canvass, particularly with respect to the jewelry boxes and the ball pens, being undated. The OCAt pertinently noted: </p><blockquote> <p> Documents show that the JRP Administrator signed the letter-quotation of Artes dated August 14, 2006. The face of the letter-quotation does not show when she signed it. However, two days later or on August 16, 2006, Artes sent her Sales Invoice No. 360 for the full payment of P35,224.00 for the said goods. On August 20, 2006, or four days after Artes had presented Sales Invoice No. 360 to the PMO, OfficeMan and Chateau Manufacturing sent quotations for the same goods. Could there be canvassing of all three proponents under these circumstances? In all probability, the Abstract of Bids was prepared and included in the records only to justify the premature award of the contract to Artes.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> It is also true that a contract that has all the essential requisites for its validity is binding between the parties regardless of its form.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> But when the law requires that a contract be in some form in order that it may be valid or be enforceable, or demands that a contract he proved in a certain way, the requirement of a particular form or manner is absolute and indispensable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> Once the formal requirement for the contract is absolute and indispensable, any procurement contract that does not adhere to the requirement can only be deemed invalid and unenforceable. As such, every letter-quotation signed by an unauthorized purchaser in behalf of a government agency in a manner contrary to the loan agreement with the foreign lender and contrary to the local procurement law can only be a mere scrap of paper that cannot by any means be accorded any validity or enforceability.</p><p> We cannot but notice that the records do not show that the PMO had secured the CAF for each of the contracts. According to the OCAt, the CAFs were still required because the <em>Government Auditing Code of the Philippines</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> the <em>Administrative Code of 1987</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> and the General Provisions of the relevant<em> General Appropriations Act</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> uniformly required expenditures of appropriated funds to be supported by CAFs. We hold that the loan proceeds were undoubtedly appropriated funds. In addition, R.A. No. 9184, which was definitely applicable, has specified "'confirming the certification of availability of funds, as well as reviewing all relevant documents in relation to their adherence to law"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> as parts of the assessment of the readiness of the procurement during the pre-procurement conference. With the requirement for the CAFs being <em>sine qua non</em> in government procurement and contracts, every contract without the corresponding CAF should be characterized as null and void.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup></p><p> The transactions consummated by Ms. Dumdum for the PMO could not be classified as regular despite the lack of a contrary finding by the COA. Such contrary finding by the COA was not yet forthcoming because the Court had not yet settled the claim of Artes for the balance of the aggregate contract price in view of the material violations of SC Administrative Circular No. 60-2003 and the relevant procurement laws. Hence, there would be no disbursement of public funds to be disallowed or no expenditure to be declared illegal.</p><p> We also clarify that the contracts with Artes did not make it to the category of ineligible as determined by the WB, and this was due to the Court's continued refusal to settle the nearly P3 million supposedly owed to Artes. The refusal to pay was most likely the reason why the contracts with Artes were not included in the WB's list of ineligibles.</p><p align="center"> <b><i>Re</i>: Splitting of contracts</b></p><p> That Ms. Dumdum committed <b>splitting of contracts</b> was undeniable.</p><p> <b>Splitting of contracts</b> means the breaking up of contracts into smaller quantities and amounts, or dividing contract implementation into artificial phases or subcontracts, for the purpose of making them fall below the threshold for shopping or small value procurement, or evading or circumventing the requirement of public bidding.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> Public officers and agencies are called upon by the COA to ensure that no splitting of requisitions, purchase orders, vouchers, and the like, is resorted to in order to circumvent the control measures provided in the circulars it issued and other laws and regulations. In this connection, a project funded under a single obligating authority and implemented in several phases whether by the same or different contractors shall be deemed <strong>splitting of contracts</strong>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup></p><p> Under the general guidelines of the Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB), splitting of contracts is strictly prohibited. </p><p> COA Circular No. 76-41, dated July 30, 1976, is instructive on the matter of <strong>splitting of contracts</strong>, to wit: </p><blockquote> <p> Forms of Splitting: </p> <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="3%"><div align="justify">1)</div></td> <td width="97%"><div align="justify">Splitting of Requisitions consists in the non-consolidation of requisitions for one or more items needed at or about the same time by the requisitioner.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><br></td> <td><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">2)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Splitting of Purchase Orders consists in the issuance of two or more purchase orders based on two or more requisitions for the same or at about the same time by different requisitioners; and</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><br></td> <td><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">3)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Splitting of Payments consists in making two or more payments for one or more items involving one purchase order. </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>The above-enumerated forms of splitting are usually resorted to in the following cases: </p> <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="3%"><div align="justify">1)</div></td> <td width="97%"><div align="justify">Splitting of requisitions and purchase orders to avoid inspection of deliveries;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><br></td> <td><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">2)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Splitting of requisitions and purchase orders to avoid action, review or approval by higher authorities; and</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><br></td> <td><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">3)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Splitting of requisitions to avoid public bidding. </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p> The foregoing enumeration of the forms of splitting is merely illustrative and by no means exhaustive. But in whatever form splitting has been resorted to, <strong>the idea is to do away with and circumvent control measures promulgated by the government. It is immaterial whether or not loss or damage has been sustained by, or caused to, the government</strong>. In a celebrated administrative case wherein a ranking official was charged with and found guilty of splitting of purchases, the Office of the President of the Philippines was quite emphatic when it ruled that "his <strong>liability is not contingent on proof of loss to the Government because of said violations of rules on procurement</strong>." For this reason, except "requisitions for supplies materials and equipment spare parts xxx acquired through emergency purchase from reputable firms xxx:" (Section 18, Letter of Implementation No. 44, dated April 8, 1976 of the President of the Philippines), Auditors should be on the lookout for cases of splitting in varied forms such as splitting of requisitions and purchase orders to avoid inspection of deliveries; splitting of requisitions, purchase orders, and payments to avoid action, review or approval by higher authorities; and splitting of requisitions to avoid public bidding.</p> <p> The Commission on Audit, therefore, cognizant of its responsibility under the Constitution to safeguard expenditures and uses of government funds and property hereby enjoins all concerned to strictly enforce and faithfully adhere to all laws, rules, regulations, and policies calculated to prevent or prohibit splitting in any or all forms for the protection of the government. (Emphasis supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> The foregoing COA circular is addressed to all heads of departments; chiefs of bureaus and offices; managing heads of government-owned or - controlled corporations; <em>etc</em>., and proscribes the splitting of requisitions, purchase orders, vouchers and others. The heads of the departments, bureaus or offices are expressly enjoined to observe prudence, accountability and transparency in ensuring that no such splitting of requisitions, POs, vouchers, <em>etc</em>. escape their attention or happen under their charge. With the increasing volume of transactions involving purchases of goods, equipment, supplies and materials, there arises the need to enforce control measures to insure that procurement is effected in a manner that is most advantageous to the Government. The control measures protect the Government from losing millions of pesos through irregularities in the procurement process. </p><p> The following elements constitute the act of splitting of contracts or procurement project, to wit: </p><ol><li> That there is a government contract or procurement project;<br><br></li><li> That the requisitions, purchase orders, vouchers, and the like of the project are broken up into smaller quantities and amounts, or the implementation thereof is broken into subcontracts or artificial phases; and <br><br></li><li>That the splitting of the contract falls under any of the following or similar purposes, namely: <br><br> <ol start="" type="a"><li> evading the conduct of a competitive bidding;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]<br><br></sup> </li><li>circumventing the control measures provided in the circulars and other laws and regulations;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> or <br><br></li><li>making the contract or project fall below the threshold for shopping or small value procurement.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup></li></ol> </li></ol> Applying the foregoing elements to Artes' contracts, we find that the JRSP WB loan was used to fund both the National Forum and the Global Forum in the respective amounts of P7.5 million and P20.6 million; but instead of conducting a public bidding for the two events, Ms. Dumdum entered into several<strong> letter-contracts</strong> or<strong> quotation-contracts</strong> with Artes for various phases of the events, each phase involving amounts that were well within her authority to approve under SC Administrative Circular No. 60-2003. Such<strong> letter-contracts</strong> or<strong> quotation-contracts </strong>were aimed not only at dispensing with competitive bidding but also at avoiding the control measures set in place under SC Administrative Circular No. 60-2003, the COA Circulars, R.A. No. 9184 and other relevant laws and regulations on government procurement. <p> In its Report, the OCAt cogently opined that - </p><blockquote> <p> On the claim of Ms. Dumdum that Artes was an "events" organizer, this Office pointed out that the Philippine Convention and Visitors Corporation (PCVC), a non-profit corporation that serves as the marketing arm of the Department of Tourism, was the events organizer under a Memorandum of Agreement that Ms. Dumdum herself signed for the Court.</p> <p> The various contracts entered into with Artes for each of the two events, in light of the claim of Ms. Dumdum that Artes was an "events organizer," only led to the conclusion that there was splitting of contracts.

That the value of each of the <strong>letter-contracts</strong> and <strong>quotation-contracts</strong> entered into by Ms. Dumdum was within her authority to approve (<em>i.e</em>., P1 million and below) was another strong manifestation of splitting of contracts.</p><p> <b>Splitting of contracts</b> is a serious transgression of the procurement rules of the Government. Section 65(4) of R.A. No. 9184 penalizes public officers who commit "splitting of contracts which exceed procedural purchase limits and competitive bidding" with "imprisonment of not less than six (6) years and one (1) day but not more than fifteen years."</p><p align="center"> <b>Personal liability of Ms. Dumdum</b></p><p> Section 103 of the <em>Government Auditing Code of the Philippines declares th</em>at "[e]xpenditures of government funds or uses of government property in violation of law or regulations shall be the personal liability of the official or employee found to be directly responsible therefor." </p><p> Considering that Artes already waived any and all claims it had against the Court pursuant to the several contracts entered into with Ms. Dumdum, there is no more need to make the latter personally liable for the reimbursement of any amounts that Artes was claiming.</p><p> Her release from personal liability for reimbursement notwithstanding, Ms. Dumdum should be investigated for any administrative or criminal liability for acts done in connection with the following circumstances, namely: </p><ol start="" type="a"><li> requesting authority to fund the National Forum twice on the same day for the separate amounts of P7,500,000.00 and P6,800,000.00 without indicating whether the first request is superseded or that the latter request was intended to be for an amount to be added to the first request; <br><br></li><li> entering into contracts even before the Chief Justice approved the use of funds from which the expenses for the contracts were drawn;<br><br></li><li>allowing her subordinates to conduct the alternative method of procurement of shopping without her having been duly authorized as the representative of the Chief Justice for the purpose of approving the alternative mode of procurement; <br><br></li><li>prematurely awarding to Artes the contract for the jewelry boxes and ball pens before actual receipt of offers of other proponents; <br><br></li><li> participating in procurement activities notwithstanding that her authority was to monitor such activities, in violation of the rule on conflict of interest; <br><br></li><li> allowing the conduct of activities that violate procurement rules such as the rule prohibiting splitting of contracts; <br><br></li><li> signing contracts prepared by private contracting parties as letter-quotations with no Certificate of Availability of Funds (CAF) attached thereto and hence in violation of formal requirements prescribed by law and the Loan Agreement; and<br><br></li><li> authorizing the payment of the amount of P1,313,435.00 (or P1,427,647.72 inclusive of tax), which is beyond her threshold of authority for payments of P1 million under Administrative Circular No. 60-2003.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup></li></ol> <p> Even if the disciplinary procedure provided in Paragraph 9.4 of Administrative Circular No. 60-2003 is no longer applicable to Ms. Dumdum in view of her having meanwhile ceased to be connected with the Court, Paragraph 9.3 of Administrative Circular No. 60-2003 may apply, <em>viz</em>.: </p><blockquote> <p>9.3 Sanctions. Supreme Court officials, employees and private individuals <b><u>who shall fail to comply with the provisions of this Administrative Circular without just cause shall be held liable and subject to sanctions/penalties</u></b> provided under Articles XXI to XXIII of R.A. 9184 (see Annex J). [Emphasis supplied.] </p> </blockquote> <p> In addition, the provisions of R.A. No. 3019 may be taken into consideration in order to ascertain whether or not any act or omission committed by any party, including Ms. Dumdum, resulted in or caused undue injury to the Government. However, it is not the Court but another office that should make the ascertainment in that regard. </p><p align="center"> <b>No personal liability on the part of <br> Chief Justice Panganiban</b></p><p> We have found nothing in the records that established former Chief Justice Panganiban's privity to the contracts entered into by Ms. Dumdum with Artes. Although he had approved, belatedly, the budgets for the holding of the National Forum and the Global Forum in the respective amounts of P7.5 million and P20.6 million, his approval was within his official authority to grant as the Chief Justice.</p><p> The documents presented for Chief Justice Panganiban's approval had undergone the presumed study and verification by the PMO under Ms. Dumdum as well as by the committee constituted for the purpose. He must have relied in utmost good faith on his subordinates, upon whom the primary responsibility of ensuring that all procurement of goods and services were within the limits required by the laws and the procurement rules. Such reliance in good faith absolved him from any personal liability in the absence of proof of any conspiracy between them.</p><p align="center"> <b>Conclusion</b> </p><p> Based on the OCAt's Report dated June 20, 2012, violations of law in the disbursement of funds of the Court as well as of funds derived from the loans extended by the World Bank appear to have been committed. The laws on procurement as well as those on auditing and official accountability were also contravened. Although such violations would have resulted in the nullification of the contracts for services and supplies between the Court and Artes, the Court would have still authorized payments to Artes of any unpaid balances based on the equitable principle of <em>quantum meruit</em> in order not to be guilty of being unjustly enriched. The Court would then consequently move to seek from the concerned individuals the reimbursement of whatever amounts it would have thereby paid. That would not happen now because Artes meanwhile expressly released the Court from any further monetary liability upon its claim.</p><p> <strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, acting on the Report dated June 20, 2012 submitted by the Office of the Chief Attorney, the Court <strong>RESOLVES</strong> to: </p><ol><li> <strong>CONSIDER</strong> the claim of Artes International, Inc. for payment extinguished in accordance to the unilateral <em>Release, Waiver &amp; Quitclaim</em> executed and submitted by Artes International, Inc.; and<br><br> </li><li><strong>FURNISH</strong> a copy of this <strong>RESOLUTION</strong> to the <strong>OFFICE OF THE OMBUDSMAN</strong> and the <strong>COMMISSION ON AUDIT </strong>as basis for whatever further action may be warranted or necessary to be taken against <strong>MS.

During the pendency of the case, the contractor submitted a quitclaim, release and waiver informing the Court that there was merely a misunderstanding and the amount claimed is fully settled. Accordingly, the contractor released the Court from any liability whatsoever supposedly arising from the fully-settled contracts which the Court entered into more than a decade ago. Despite this positive development, the Resolution incorrectly finds fault for these mistaken claims and erroneously concludes that the contracts would have been annulled for violating procurement laws. </p><p> As narrated in the Resolution, on 21 December 2005, or shortly after then Chief Justice Artemio V. Panganiban took his oath, he declared his "judicial philosophy of safeguarding the liberty and nurturing the prosperity of the people under the rule of law."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Pursuant to this philosophy, the National Forum on Liberty and Prosperity (held on 24-25 August 2006) and the Global Forum on Liberty and Prosperity (held on 18-20 October 2006) were conceptualized and launched. </p><p> There is no dispute that the Court, through the Program Management Office with Evelyn Toledo-Dumdum (Dumdum) as then Administrator, entered into several contracts with Artes International, Inc. (Artes) relative to the said fora, as well as other activities relative to the Retirement Ceremony of then Chief Justice Panganiban. There is also no dispute that the Court successfully hosted these events, with Artes being the events specialist hired "[t]o assist the Ad Hoc Committees, specifically by addressing the creative, logistical, physical and technical requirements of the Forum, x x x."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> </p><p> Thereafter, Artes requested payment for allegedly unpaid balances arising from its contracts with the Court. However, Artes subsequently submitted a Release, Waiver &amp; Quitclaim to the effect that "it was waiving any and all its rights and interests in the claim; and expressly stated that it was releasing the Court from any further financial liability."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> </p><p> Notwithstanding, the Resolution cites the Report of the Office of the Chief Attorney on the contracts with Artes in concluding that "violations of law in the disbursement of funds of the Court as well as of funds derived from the loans extended by the World Bank appear to have been committed. The laws on procurement as well as those on auditing and official accountability were also contravened."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> </p><p> The Chief Attorney is gravely mistaken. </p><p> <em>First</em>, Republic Act No. 9184 or<strong> the Government Procurement Reform Act does not apply to executive agreements</strong>. </p><p> In the Loan Agreement, dated 2 October 2003, between the Republic of the Philippines,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> represented by then Secretary of Finance Jose Isidro N. Camacho, and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Bank has agreed to extend a Loan to the Philippine government in an amount equal to $21,900,000 to assist in the financing of the Judicial Reform Support Project (the Project or JRSP). </p><p> There is no question that the Loan Agreement in this case is in the nature of an executive agreement. It was entered into by the Philippine government, as a subject of international law possessed of a treaty-making capacity, and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which, as an international lending institution organized by world governments to provide loans conditioned upon the guarantee of repayment by the borrowing government, is also regarded a subject of international law and possessed of the capacity to enter into executive agreements with sovereign states.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> </p><p> Considering that the Loan Agreement is an executive agreement, Republic Act No. 9184 (RA 9184), or the "Government Procurement Reform Act" does not apply. Section 4 of RA 9184 provides: </p><blockquote> <p> SEC. 4. Scope and Application. This Act shall apply to the Procurement of Infrastructure Projects, Goods and Consulting Services, regardless of source of funds, whether local or foreign, by all branches and instrumentalities of government, its departments, offices and agencies, including government-owned and/or controlled corporations and local government units, subject to the provisions of Commonwealth Act No. 138. <b>Any treaty or international or executive agreement affecting the subject matter of this Act to which the Philippine government is a signatory shall be observed. </b>(Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> Section 4 of RA 9184 clearly recognizes the government's commitment to the terms and conditions of executive agreements, such as the Loan Agreement in this case. In <i>Land Bank of the Philippines v. Atlanta Industries, Inc</i>.,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> which involved a Loan Agreement between the IBRD and the Land Bank, the Court declared: </p><blockquote> <p> While mandating adherence to the general policy of the government that contracts for the procurement of civil works or supply of goods and equipment shall be undertaken only after competitive public bidding, RA 9184 recognizes the country's commitment to abide by its obligations under any treaty or international or executive agreement. xxx.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> In the same case of <i>Land Bank of the Philippines v. Atlanta Industries, Inc</i>.,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> the Court held that public bidding under RA 9184 does not apply to the procurement of goods to be financed from the proceeds of the Loan Agreement subject of that case, thus: </p><blockquote> <p> <strong>Considering that Loan Agreement No. 4833-PH expressly provides that the procurement of the goods to be financed from the loan proceeds shall be in accordance with the IBRD Guidelines</strong> and the provisions of Schedule 4, and that the accessory SLA contract merely follows its principal's terms and conditions,<strong> the procedure for competitive public bidding prescribed under RA 9184 therefore finds no application to the procurement of goods</strong> for the Iligan City Water Supply System Development and Expansion Project. The validity of similar stipulations in foreign loan agreements requiring the observance of IBRD Procurement Guidelines in the procurement process has, in fact, been previously upheld by the Court in the case of <em>Department of Budget and Management Procurement Service (DBMPS) v. Kolonwel Trading</em>. (Emphasis supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> In <em>Abaya v. Ebdane, Jr.,</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> petitioners therein assailed the recommendation of the Department of Public Works and Highways, as the implementing agency of the projects in the Loan Agreement therein, to award the road improvement contract to China Road &amp; Bridge Corporation for violating RA 9184. The Court ruled that Executive Order No. 40<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> was applicable since RA 9184 could not be applied retroactively. The Invitation to Prequalify and to Bid was published in November and December 2002. At the time, the law in effect was EO 40. RA 9184 took effect two months later or on 26 January 2003. </p><p> Even assuming that RA 9184 could be given retroactive effect, the Court declared that RA 9184 did not apply to the Loan Agreement. According to the Court, "the terms of the Exchange of Notes dated December 27, 1999 and Loan Agreement No. PH-P204 would still govern the procurement for the CP I project."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> </p><p> In <i>DBM-PS v. Kolonwel Trading</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> citing <i>Abaya v. Ebdane, Jr</i>.,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> the Court made a similar pronouncement. The Court held that the Loan Agreement therein is in the nature of an executive agreement whose terms and conditions govern the procurement of goods, thus: </p><blockquote> <p> The question as to whether or not foreign loan agreements with international financial institutions, such as Loan No. 7118-PH, partake of an executive or international agreement within the purview of Section 4 of R.A. No. 9184, has been answered by the Court in the affirmative in <em>Abaya, supra</em>. Significantly, <em>Abaya</em> declared that the RP-JBIC loan agreement was to be of governing application over the CP I project and that the JBIC Procurement Guidelines, as stipulated in the loan agreement, shall primarily govern the procurement of goods necessary to implement the main project. </p> </blockquote> <p> Being an executive agreement, the Loan Agreement subject of this case is governed by international law. As the Court has consistently ruled in numerous cases, the Philippine government, particularly the implementing agency, in this case the Supreme Court, is therefore obligated to comply with the terms and conditions of the Loan Agreement under the international law principle of <em>pacta sunt servanda</em> which is embodied in Section 4 of RA 9184. </p><p> In dismissing the petition in <i>Abaya v. Ebdane, Jr.</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> the Court held thus: </p><blockquote> <p> Under the fundamental principle of international law of <em>pacta sunt servanda</em>, which is, in fact, embodied in Section 4 of RA 9184 as it provides that "[a]ny treaty or international or executive agreement affecting the subject matter of this Act to which the Philippine government is a signatory shall be observed," the DPWH, as the executing agency of the projects financed by Loan Agreement No. PH-P204, rightfully awarded the contract for the implementation of civil works for the CP I project to private respondent China Road &amp; Bridge Corporation. </p> </blockquote> <p> Similarly, in <i>DBM-PS v.

Being similar to a treaty but without requiring legislative concurrence, Loan Agreement No. 4833-PH - following the definition given in the <i>Bayan Muna</i> case - is an executive agreement and is, thus, governed by international law. Owing to this classification, the Government of the Philippines is therefore obligated to observe its terms and conditions under the rule of <em>pacta sunt servanda</em>, a fundamental maxim of international law that requires the parties to keep their agreement in good faith. It bears pointing out that the <em>pacta sunt servanda</em> rule has become part of the law of the land through the incorporation clause found under Section 2, Article II of the 1987 Philippine Constitution, which states that the Philippines "adopts the generally accepted principles of international law as part of the law of the land and adheres to the policy of peace, equality, justice, freedom, cooperation, and amity with all nations."</p> </blockquote> <p> <b>To repeat, under Section 4 of RA 9184, the Government Procurement Reform Act does not apply to executive agreements such as the Loan Agreement in this case. </b>Consequently, RA 9184 does not apply in the procurement of goods and services pursuant to the Loan Agreement between the Philippine government and the IBRD for the Judicial Reform Support Project. </p><p> Moreover, the Loan Agreement for the Project expressly provides that the procurement of goods and services shall be in accordance with World Bank guidelines. </p><p> Section 3.02 of the Loan Agreement provides: "Except as the Bank shall otherwise agree, procurement of goods, works and services required for the Project and to be financed out of the proceeds of the Loan shall be governed by the provisions of Schedule 4 to this Agreement."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Schedule 4, in turn, provides: <b>"Goods and works shall be procured in accordance with the provisions of Section I of the 'Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits' published by the Bank in January 1995 and revised in January and August 1996, September 1997 and January 1999 (the Guidelines) x x x."</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> </p><p> The Court's Administrative Circular No. 60-2003,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> which has the force and effect of a legal instrument for compliance of all concerned with the implementation of the JRSP,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> expressly provides that the terms and conditions of the Loan Agreement shall be observed in the procurement of goods, works, and consulting services <strong>in accordance with World Bank guidelines</strong>, thus: </p><blockquote> <p> 5.1.1 <b>JRSP LOAN AGREEMENT. </b>The Loan Agreement executed by and between the GOP and the WB on October 2, 2003 shall govern the legal relationship between the Bank and the Supreme Court as the Project's Implementing Agency. <b>The terms and conditions set forth therein for the procurement of goods, works and consulting services shall be observed in consonance with the Bank Guidelines.</b> (Emphasis supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> <i>Second</i>, <b>the World Bank, from whom the funds for these events were charged, did not consider the expenses for these events ineligible.</b> </p><p> To implement the Project, the Philippine government "shall maintain until completion of the Project, a Program Management Office in the Supreme Court, responsible for overseeing the implementation of the Supreme Court's Action Program for Judicial Reform and the Project, chaired by a Director, and said Office to be provided at all times with adequate funds and other resources and staffed by qualified and experienced personnel in adequate numbers as shall be necessary to accomplish its objectives."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> </p><p> In implementing the Project, the PMO, with the approval of the Court, procured the services of Artes through several contracts for the subject events. Significantly, during and after the implementation of the Project, the PMO never received any notice from the World Bank classifying the contracts with Artes, including the incurred expenses for the subject events, as ineligible expenditures. Neither did the World Bank question in any forum the procurement procedures undertaken by the PMO with respect to these contracts. In other words, the World Bank considered these expenditures as eligible, which are defined as "expenditures in respect of the reasonable cost of goods, works and services required for the Project and to be financed out of the proceeds of the Loan allocated from time to time to the eligible Categories x x x."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> </p><p> On the other hand, based on the PMO Memorandum dated 18 June 2012, the World Bank's list of ineligible transactions consisted of five major activities, to wit: (1) Conduct of the distinguished lecture series; (2) Conduct of the seminar on "Revisiting the Code of Conduct for Court Personnel; (3) Conduct of and attendance of SC and Judiciary officials to local and international training, seminars and workshops on court administration, international commercial law and facilitating workshops and trainings; (4) Printing of the Reporter's Case Index for the use of justices, judges, court attorneys and legal researchers, and (5) Procurement of IT equipment for various SC offices. The World Bank considered these as ineligible transactions for being (1) not connected with the project development objective; (2) not agreed with the World Bank; or (3) not reflected in the procurement plan. Attached hereto as Annex "A" is the PMO Memorandum, as well as the list of the ineligible expenditures. </p><p> <b>A review of the list of ineligible expenditures shows that there is absolutely no item of expenditure which is even remotely related to the questioned contracts with Artes. In fact, the name Artes or Dumdum does not appear in the list of the names of officials, contractors or suppliers of the ineligible expenditures. Notably, the ineligible expenditures referred to various activities conducted in the years 2010 and 2011, or at least four years after the questioned events were held.</b> </p><p> While the PMO in the same Memorandum claims that the listed ineligible transactions were "in fact, incurred in furtherance of the project development objectives of the JRSP" and were "actually regular and eligible transactions undertaken in the course of the JRSP's implementation," the PMO adjusted the total amount to US$115,416.00, instead of US$132,766.00, and recommended the refund for the first four transactions from the JRSP-GOP Counterpart Fund and for the procurement of IT equipment from the Court's Fiscal Autonomy Fund. </p><p> <b>To repeat, the questioned contracts with Artes and the expenses related to the subject fora and retirement ceremony have not been identified as ineligible expenditures by the World Bank, and in fact, were not among those ineligible expenditures which the PMO recommended to be refunded by the Court using the JRSP-GOP Counterpart Fund or the Court's Fiscal Autonomy Fund. Suffice to state, if there indeed were any violation of the terms and conditions of the Loan Agreement, or any of its procurement procedures, then the World Bank would have categorized such expenses as ineligible and required the Supreme Court to refund the amount of the ineligible expenditures, as what it did for the expenditures in 2010 and 2011 enumerated in its Aide Memoire, covering the period during the incumbency of then Chief Justice Renato C. Corona.</b> </p><p> In fact, if the World Bank has found any irregularity or misprocurement related to the subject events, it would have cancelled that portion of the loan allocated to such misprocured goods or services. This is clearly spelled out in the IBRD Guidelines,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> thus: </p><blockquote> <p> Misprocurement<br> 1.12 The Bank does not finance expenditures for goods and works which have not been procured in accordance with the agreed provisions in the Loan Agreement and as further elaborated in the Procurement Plan.

Notably, among the deficiencies for 2006 which the COA found was the splitting of contracts in the procurement of steel filing safe cabinets. </p><p> Paragraph 4 of the Executive Summary of COA's Annual Audit Report on the Supreme Court for calendar year 2007<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> states that "Commitment Fees in the amount of P13,754,859.51 were incurred due to slow utilization of the proceeds of Loan No. 7191-PH with International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)." Accordingly, the COA recommended "that management implement the programs and projects of the JRSP strictly in accordance with timetables and to speed up the procurement of works, goods and services to avoid incurrence of commitment fees." Aside from this observation regarding the slow utilization of the loan proceeds, there was no COA finding, observation or recommendation regarding the subject contracts with Artes. </p><p> Paragraph 17 of the Executive Summary of COA's Annual Audit Report on the Supreme Court for calendar year 2008<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> states that "[t]he government paid a commitment fee amounting to P1,509,043.62 for the unwithdrawn principal amount of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) Loan No. 7191-PH for the Judicial Reform Support Project (JRSP) due to low utilization rate of the loan." Accordingly, the COA recommended that "management fully implement the reforms and measures instituted by the Court to fast-track the procurement of works, goods and services and finally, to stop the incurrence of commitment fees." Similar to the 2006 and 2007 COA Audit Reports, there was no COA finding, observation or recommendation regarding the subject contracts with Artes. </p><p> The COA Annual Audit Reports on the Judicial Reform Support Project for the years 2004 to 2011 yielded the same observation. There was no specific report on the contracts with Artes, much less any finding of irregularity with respect to the expenditures for the subject events. </p><p> In COA's Annual Audit Report on the JRSP for calendar year 2009, the COA reported that "[t]he government paid the amount of P1,320,124.97 due to commitment fees incurred for the unwithdrawn principal amount of the loan"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> and recommended that "management should immediately resolve the implementation issues that arose during the year and to fully implement the reforms and measures instituted by the Court to fast-track the procurement of works, goods and services and finally, to stop the incurrence of commitment fees."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> </p><p> Paragraph 10 of the 2009 Executive Summary on the status of the implementation of prior year's recommendation states that "the audit recommendation for CY 2007 to adopt measures to avoid the incurrence of commitment fees was fully implemented by Management, however, the audit recommendation for CY 2008 to fully implement the reforms and measures to fast-track the procurement of works, goods and services was only partially implemented."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> There was no observation or recommendation regarding the contracts with Artes for the subject events. </p><p> For calendar year 2010, the COA made a similar observation of slow/low availment/utilization rate of the loan for the Project which resulted in the payment of commitment fees.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> The COA also found, among others, a discrepancy of P40,893,091.88 in reporting the balances of the Property, Plant &amp; Equipment (PPE) accounts between the actual physical count and the accounting records in the PPE account. There was no observation or recommendation regarding the contracts with Artes for the subject events. </p><p> In the 2011 Annual Audit Report on the JRSP, the COA observed, among others, that: </p><blockquote> <p> 1. Procurement of IT equipment in CY totaling P3,850,257.87 was not included in the JRSP Implementation Procurement Plan contrary to the agreement between the Supreme Court and the World Bank.

The unconditional approval by the Chief Justice of the contracts with Artes entered into by Dumdum, on behalf of the Court, signifies clearly that the hosting of these events, as well as the corresponding expenses for these events embodied in the said contracts, was completely sanctioned by the Court. <b>More importantly, the World Bank has not found any irregularity in the several letter-contracts or quotation-­contracts with Artes for the various phases of the National Forum and the Global Forum.</b> </p><p> <b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, I vote that this case be considered closed and terminated.
