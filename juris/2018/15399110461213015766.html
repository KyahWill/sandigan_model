Mirant (Philippines) Operations, Corporation</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> the CTA <i>En Banc</i> reversed and set aside the decision dated March 23, 2011 of the CTA First Division, explaining and holding thusly:<br><blockquote>x x x Section 76 is clear and unequivocal. Once the carry-over option is taken, actually or constructively, it becomes irrevocable. It mentioned no exception or qualification to the irrevocability rule (<i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Bank of the Philippine Islands 592 SCRA 231</i>). Hence, the controlling factor for the operation of the irrevocability rule is that the taxpayer chose an option; and once it had already done so, it could no longer make another one. Consequently, after the taxpayer opts to carry-over its excess tax credit to the following taxable period, the question of whether or not it actually gets to apply said tax credit is irrelevant. <i>Section 76 of the NIRC of 1997</i> is explicit in stating that once the option to carry over has been made[,] no application for tax refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate shall be allowed therefor' (<i>supra</i>).<br><br>Applying the foregoing rulings to the instant case, considering that petitioner opted to carry-over its unutilized creditable withholding tax of P1,500,653.00 for taxable year 2005 to the first, second and third quarters of taxable year 2006 when it had actually carried-over said excess creditable withholding tax to the first, second and third quarters in its Quarterly Income Tax Returns for taxable year 2006, said option to carryÂ­over becomes irrevocable. Petitioner's act of reporting in its Annual Income Tax Return for taxable year 2006 of prior year's excess credits other than MCIT as 0.00, will not change the fact that petitioner had already opted the carry-over option in its first, second and third quarters Quarterly Income Tax Returns for taxable year 2006, and said choice is irrevocable. As previously mentioned, whether or not petitioner actually gets to apply said excess tax credit is irrelevant and would not change the carry-over option already made.<br><br>Thus, the present petition praying for refund or issuance of a TCC of its unutilized creditable withholding tax for taxable year 2005 in the amount of P1,500,653.00 must perforce be denied in view of the irrevocability rule on carry-over option of unutilized creditable withholding tax.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the instant Petition for Review is hereby <b>GRANTED</b>. Accordingly, the Decision of the First Division dated March 23, 2011 and Resolution dated June 30, 2011 are hereby <b>REVERSED</b> and <b>SET ASIDE</b>, and another one is hereby entered <b>DISMISSING</b> the Petition for Review filed in C.T.A. Case No. 7711.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br></blockquote>On March 13, 2013, the CTA <i>En Banc</i> denied Rhombus' motion for reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Hence, Rhombus appeals to resolve whether or not it has proved its entitlement to the refund.<br><br><center><b>Ruling of the Court</b><br></center><br>The appeal is meritorious.<br><br>The irrevocability rule is enunciated m Section 76 of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC), <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>Section 76. <i>Final Adjusted Return</i>. - Every corporation liable to tax under Section 27 shall file a final adjustment return covering the total taxable income for the preceding calendar of fiscal year. If the sum of the quarterly tax payments made during the said taxable year is not equal to the total tax due on the entire taxable income of that year, the corporation shall either:<br><br>(A) Pay the balance of the tax still due; or<br><br>(B) Carry over the excess credit; or<br><br>(C) Be credited or refunded with the excess amount paid, as the case may be.<br><br>In case the corporation is entitled to a tax credit or refund of the excess estimated quarterly income taxes paid, the excess amount shown on its final adjustment return may be carried over and credited against the estimated quarterly income tax liabilities for the taxable quarters of the succeeding taxable years. <b>Once the option to carry over and apply the excess quarterly income tax against income tax due for the taxable years of the succeeding taxable years has been made, such option shall be considered irrevocable for that taxable period and no application for cash refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate shall be allowed therefor.</b> (Bold underscoring supplied to highlight the relevant portion)<br></blockquote>The application of the irrevocability rule is explained in <i>Republic v. Team (Phils.) Energy Corporation (formerly Mirant [Phils.] Energy Corporation</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> where the Court stated:<br><blockquote>In <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Bank of the Philippine Islands</i>, the Court, citing the pronouncement in Philam Asset Management, Inc., points out that Section 76 of the NIRC of 1997 is clear and unequivocal in providing that the carry-over option, once actually or constructively chosen by a corporate taxpayer, becomes <i>irrevocable</i>. The Court explains:<br><blockquote>Hence, the controlling factor for the operation of the <i>irrevocability rule</i> is that the taxpayer chose an option; and once it had already done so, it could no longer make another one. Consequently, after the taxpayer opts to carry-over its excess tax credit to the following taxable period, the question of whether or not it actually gets to apply said tax credit is irrelevant. Section 76 of the NIRC of 1997 is explicit in stating that once the option to carry over has been made, "no application for tax refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate shall be allowed therefor."<br><br>The last sentence of Section 76 of the NIRC of 1997 reads: "Once the option to carry-over and apply the excess quarterly income tax against income tax due for the taxable quarters of the succeeding taxable years has been made, such option <b>shall be considered irrevocable for that taxable period</b> and no application for tax refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate shall be allowed therefor." The phrase "for that taxable period" merely identifies the excess income tax, subject of the option, by referring to the taxable period when it was acquired by the taxpayer. In the present case, the excess income tax credit, which BPI opted to carry over, was acquired by the said bank during the taxable year 1998. The option of BPI to carry over its 1998 excess income tax credit is irrevocable; it cannot later on opt to apply for a refund of the very same 1998 excess income tax credit.<br><br>The Court of Appeals mistakenly understood the phrase "for that taxable period" as a prescriptive period for the <i>irrevocability rule</i>. This would mean that since the tax credit in this case was acquired in 1998, and BPI opted to carry it over to 1999, then the irrevocability of the option to carry over expired by the end of 1999, leaving BPI free to again take another option as regards its 1998 excess income tax credit. This construal effectively renders nugatory the <i>irrevocability rule</i>. The evident intent of the legislature, in adding the last sentence to Section 76 of the NIRC of 1997, is to keep the taxpayer from flip-flopping on its options, and avoid confusion and complication as regards said taxpayer's excess tax credit. The interpretation of the Court of Appeals only delays the flip-flopping to the end of each succeeding taxable period.<br><br>The Court similarly disagrees in the declaration of the Court of Appeals that to deny the claim for refund of BPI, because of the <i>irrevocability rule</i>, would be tantamount to unjust enrichment on the part of the government. The Court addressed the very same argument in <i>Philam</i>, where it elucidated that there would be no unjust enrichment in the event of denial of the claim for refund under such circumstances, because there would be no forfeiture of any amount in favor of the government. The amount being claimed as a refund would remain in the account of the taxpayer until utilized in succeeding taxable years, as provided in Section 76 of the NIRC of 1997. It is worthy to note that unlike the option for refund of excess income tax, which prescribes after two years from the filing of the FAR, there is no prescriptive period for the carrying over of the same. Therefore, the excess income tax credit of BPI, which it acquired in 1998 and opted to carry over, may be repeatedly carried over to succeeding taxable years, <i>i.e.</i>, to 1999, 2000, 2001, and so on and so forth, until actually applied or credited to a tax liability of BPI.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br></blockquote></blockquote>The CTA First Division duly noted the exercise of the option by Rhombus in the following manner:<br><blockquote>The evidence on record shows that <b>petitioner clearly signified its intention to be refunded of its excess creditable tax withheld for calendar year 2005 in its Annual ITR for the said year. Petitioner under Line 31 of the said ITR marked "x" on the box "To be refunded".</b> Moreover, petitioner's 2006 and 2007 Annual ITRs do not have any entries in Line 28A "Prior Year's Excess Credits" which only prove that petitioner did not carry-over its 2005 excess/unutilized creditable withholding tax to the succeeding taxable years or quarters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> (Bold underscoring is supplied for emphasis)<br></blockquote>Although the CTA <i>En Banc</i> recognized that Rhombus had actually exercised the option <i>to be refunded</i>, it nonetheless maintained that Rhombus was not entitled to the refund for having reported the prior year's excess credits in its quarterly ITRs for the year 2006, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote><b>Based on the records, it is clear that respondent marked the box "To be refunded" in its Annual Income Tax Return.</b> It is also clear that the 2005 excess CWT were included in the prior year's excess credits reported in the 2006 Quarter ITRs. The 2006 Annual ITR did not reflect the 2005 excess CWT in the prior year's excess credits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>The CTA <i>En Banc</i> thereby misappreciated the fact that Rhombus had already exercised the option for its unutilized creditable withholding tax for the year 2005 <i>to be refunded</i> when it filed its annual ITR for the taxable year ending December 31, 2005. Based on the disquisition in <i>Republic v. Team (Phils.) Energy Corporation, supra</i>, the irrevocability rule took effect when the option was exercised. In the case of Rhombus, therefore, its marking of the box "To be refunded" in its 2005 annual ITR constituted its exercise of the option, and from then onwards Rhombus became precluded from carrying-over the excess creditable withholding tax. The fact that the prior year's excess credits were reported in its 2006 quarterly ITRs did not reverse the option to be refunded exercised in its 2005 annual ITR. As such, the CTA <i>En Banc</i> erred in applying the irrevocability rule against Rhombus.<br><br>It is relevant to mention the requisites for entitlement to the refund as listed in <i>Republic v. Team (Phils.) Energy Corporation, supra</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> to wit:<br><blockquote><ol><li>That the claim for refund was filed within the two-year reglementary period pursuant to Section 229 of the NIRC;<br><br></li><li>When it is shown on the ITR that the income payment received is being declared part of the taxpayer's gross income; and<br><br></li><li>When the fact of withholding is established by a copy of the withholding tax statement, duly issued by the payor to the payee, showing the amount paid and income tax withheld from that amount.<br></li></ol></blockquote>Finding that Rhombus n:et the foregoing requisites based on its examination of the documents submitted, the CTA First Division rendered the following findings:<br><blockquote>x x x [P]etitioner filed its Annual ITR for the year 2005 on April 17, 2006. Counting from the said date, petitioner had until April 17, 2008, within which to file both its administrative and judicial claim for refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate. Clearly, petitioner's administrative claim filed on December 29, 2006 and judicial claim via the instant Petition for Review filed on December 07, 2007, were within the two-year prescriptive limit.<br><br>To comply with the second requisite, petitioner presented Certificates of Creditable Tax Withheld at Source issued by its sole customer Distileria Bago, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of La TondeÃ±a, Inc. (now Ginebra San Miguel, Inc.). The details of the said certificates are summarized as follows:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>To show compliance with the third requisite that petitioner declared in its return the income related to the creditable withholding taxes of Php28,523,295.45, it presented the following documents:<br><ol><li>Annual Income tax Return for the year ended December 31, 2005 with attached audited financial statements and Account Information Form marked as Exhibit "B";<br><br></li><li>Certificates of Creditable Tax Withheld at Source issued to petitioner for the first three quarters of taxable year 2005 marked as Exhibits "J", "Y", "L" and "K";<br><br></li><li>Summary of invoices issued for taxable year 2005 marked as Exhibit "M"; and<br><br></li><li>The sales invoices issued for taxable year 2005 marked as Exhibits "O-1" to "O-14".<br></li></ol>The withholding tax certificates reveal that the creditable income taxes of Php28,523,295.45 were withheld from petitioner's energy service fees of Php9,313,272.54 and from the sale of its generation facility amounting to Php472,283,838.00. The energy fees paid by Distileria Bago, Inc. in the amount of Php9,313,272.54 from which creditable withholding tax in the aggregate amount of Php186,265.45 was withheld was reported by petitioner as part of its "Sales/Revenues/Receipts/Fees" amounting to Php59,551,116.00 in Item No. 15A of its 2005 Annual ITR.<br><br>As regards the income from the sale of power generation facility in the amount of Php472,283,838.00 from which the amount of Php28,337,030.00 creditable withholding tax was withheld, petitioner reported a gain of only Php209,320,181.00 as appearing under Item 18B (Non-Operating and Other Income) of petitioner's Annual ITR marked as Exhibit B. There was nothing fallacious in doing so for petitioner could deduct valid cost (i.e. Book Value of the asset) from the selling price to arrive at the amount of "Non-operating and Other Income" to be reported in its 2005 Annual ITR.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br></blockquote>The members of the CTA First Division were in the best position as trial judges to examine the documents submitted in relation thereto,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> and to make the proper findings thereon.
