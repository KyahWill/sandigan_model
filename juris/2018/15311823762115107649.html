Trial ensued, during which, incidentally, the parties presented evidence on their respective ownership claims. Petitioner's documentary evidence in this regard includes the Deed of Donation allegedly executed by Juana H.

It observed that petitioner had failed to aver in the Complaint for Unlawful Detainer with Damages certain jurisdictional elements as to qualify the complaint as an unlawful detainer suit. For instance, he failed to aver that respondent had held possession of Cadastral Lot No. 77 by virtue of an express or implied contract that later expired or terminated.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> On this basis, the RTC dismissed the complaint for its failure to state a cause of action for unlawful detainer. Incidentally, it also ruled that it could not entertain the same complaint as a suit for forcible entry.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> </p><p>Petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> The motion was denied.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> </p><p><b><i>The Ruling of the CA</i></b> </p><p> Aggrieved, petitioner filed a Petition for Review before the CA, which was docketed as C.A.-G.R. SP No. 120649. </p><p>As already noted, the appellate court affirmed the dismissal of the subject Complaint for Unlawful Detainer with Damages. In fine, the CA agreed with the RTC that the MCTC had no jurisdiction over the complaint. We quote the appellate court's discussion and dispositive portion in this regard, in order that the ruling under our review may speak for itself: </p><blockquote> <p> [T]he allegations in the complaint failed to make out a case for unlawful detainer. It clearly did not contain any averment of fact that would substantiate petitioner's claim<strong> that he permitted or tolerated the occupation of the property by the respondent</strong>. The complaint made out by the petitioner is for forcible entry which the MCTC cannot duly take cognizance of because there is no statement in the complaint as to when the respondent entered into the premises of the land.</p> <p> Furthermore, and as the record of the case would bear out, it is worthy to note that <strong>no express contract admittedly existed between the parties. Neither could we appropriately conclude that an implied one exists as petitioner failed to support his claim as to the presence of tolerance. </strong></p> <p>This failure of petitioner to allege the key jurisdictional facts constitutive of unlawful detainer is fatal. Since the complaint did not satisfy file jurisdictional requirement of a valid cause for unlawful detainer, the municipal trial court had no jurisdiction over the case.</p> <p> It is in this light that this Court finds that the Regional Trial Court correctly found that the Municipal Circuit Trial Court had no jurisdiction over the complaint. </p> <p><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of the foregoing premises, judgment is hereby rendered by us <b>DENYING</b> the instant petition. The Decision dated April 15, 2011 rendered by Branch 22 of the Regional Trial Court in Narvacan, Ilocos Sur in Civil Case No. 3211-N is hereby <b>AFFIRMED</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p>Hence, the present Petition for Review. </p> <p><b><i>The Petition for Review on Certiorari</i></b></p> <p> Before this Court, petitioner insists that the subject complaint sufficiently amounted to a case for unlawful detainer.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> This insistence pivots on the following pleaded points. <em>First</em>, that since respondent "is the one physically in possession of the property, hence, it is she who should be ejected from the property subject matter of the suit To eject her from the property is clearly in order."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> <em>Second</em>, that since the "Deed of Quitclaim" on which Josefina Reintegrado Baron anchored her claim of ownership to the property was not registered, it could not bind third persons and thus should be deemed as weak evidentiary weight.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> <em>Third</em>, the RTC's denial of petitioner's motion for execution pending appeal was erroneous, as "[p]etitioner was entitled to such relief simply based on the rules."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> </p> <p align="center"> <b>THE COURT'S RULING</b> </p><p>We affirm the dismissal of the subject ejectment complaint. </p><p><b><i>DISCUSSION</i></b> </p><p> It is immediately observable that the petition ill persuades. While the petition rhapsodizes on the supposed merits of the subject Complaint for Unlawful. Detainer with Damages as an action for unlawful detainer viz, "We believe that the elements of unlawful detainer have been sufficiently, if not substantially, established by Petitioner in the case below",<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> it does not refer to any specific averment in said complaint to support this critical point. </p><p> Such failure is fatal. What is at issue before this Court is the jurisdiction of the MCTC over the complaint at bar. The basic rule is that what determines the nature of an action, as well as the court which has jurisdiction over it, are the allegations in the complaint.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> In ejectment complaints, such allegations must correspond to the classes of actions defined and provided for in <b>Section 1, Rule 70</b> of the Rules of Court, namely forcible entry and unlawful detainer.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> </p><p> The complaint at bar identifies itself as an unlawful detainer suit. In <i>Cabrera v. Getaruela</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> the Court held that a complaint sufficiently alleges a cause of action for unlawful detainer if it recites the following: </p><ol><li> That initially, the possession of the property by the defendant was by contract with or by tolerance of the plaintiff;<br><br></li><li>That eventually, such possession became illegal upon notice by plaintiff to defendant of the termination of the latter's right of possession;<br><br></li><li>That thereafter, the defendant remained in possession of the property and deprived the plaintiff of the enjoyment thereof; and<br><br></li><li>That within one year from the last demand on defendant to vacate the property, the plaintiff instituted the complaint for ejectment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> </li></ol> <p> These averments are jurisdictional and must appear on the face of the complaint.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> As demonstrable on its face, the subject complaint fails to aver, at the very least, the first and the second recitals. We thus agree with both the RTC and the CA that it fails to satisfy the jurisdictional requirements of an action for unlawful detainer, following which, the MCTC could not exercise jurisdiction over it. </p><p> Incidentally, we agree with the appellate court that the recitals in the complaint are more in tune with those in a complaint for forcible entry. In <em>Zacarias v. Anacay</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> we gave this observation on the supposed "unlawful detainer" complaint subject of that case: </p><blockquote> <p> The bare allegation of petitioner that "sometime in May, 2007" she discovered that the defendants have entered the subject property and occupied the same," as correctly found by the MCTC and CA, would show that respondents entered the land and built their houses thereon clandestinely and without petitioner's consent, which facts are constitutive of forcible entry, not unlawful detainer.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> We likewise agree with the conclusion that the MCTC would still not be able to validly exercise jurisdiction over the subject complaint even if it were to be treated as an action for forcible entry. That said, we cannot agree with how CA reached this conclusion. To recall, according to the appellate court, the subject complaint could not be deemed a viable action for forcible entry because it did not aver a date as to when respondent had entered the premises of Cadastral Lot No. 77. Such<em> rationale </em>is not consistent with our above quoted observation in <em>Zacarias v. Anacay</em>. To this Court's mind, then, the proper basis lies in the subject ejectment complaint's failure to be filed on time. In <i>Nuñez v. Slteas Phoenix Solutions, Inc</i>.,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> we held: </p> <blockquote> <p> The one-year period within which to bring an action for forcible entry is generally counted from the date of actual entry on the land, except that when the entry is through stealth, the one-year period is counted from the time plaintiff learned thereof.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> In the present case, petitioner discovered respondent's entry "Sometime on January 2005."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Hence, he had until January 2006 within which to file the necessary ejectment suit. He filed the present complaint over a year later, on 8 December 2006. </p><p>Given the foregoing, the rest of the arguments in the petition warrant little consideration. Suffice it to say that the petition also raises a question of fact that the Court cannot entertain under Rule 45. </p><p>A note in passing. We are aware that with the dismissal of the present petition, the controversy between the parties may or may not still subsist. In similar vein, we have previously observed that when the complaint fails to aver the facts constitutive of forcible or unlawful detainer, as where it does not state how entry was effected or how and when dispossession started, the remedy should either be <em>accion publiciana</em> or an <em>accion reinvindicatoria</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> filed before the proper RTC. Should any controversy still subsist between the parties, they may review their options and decide on their proper recourses. For now, the recourse of the petitioner to ejectment must be dismissed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> </p><p> <strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the petition is <strong>DENIED</strong> for lack of merit.
