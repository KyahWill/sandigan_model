				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Through this Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition, petitioner Rey Nathaniel C. Ifurung <i>(petitioner)</i>, <i>in propria persona, </i>seeks a declaration from the Court that: (a) Section <i>(Sec.) </i>8(3) in relation to Sec. 7 of Republic Act <i>(R.A.) </i>No. 6770, also known as the Ombudsman Act of 1989, is unconstitutional for being an outright transgression of Sec. 11, in relation to Secs. 8 and 10 of Article <i>(Art.) </i>XI of the 1987 Constitution; and (b) all individual respondents as <i>de facto </i>Ombudsman and Deputies Ombudsman, respectively, and all these positions are vacant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br><b><i>The Petition</i></b><br><br>Petitioner, who claims to be a taxpayer, a concerned Filipino citizen, and a member of the Bar, invokes the jurisprudence laid down by the Court in <i>Funa v. Villar,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> in asserting that he has <i>locus standi </i>to file the instant petition. He avers that he is seeking the correction of a recurring statutory wrong and a declaration from the Court that the positions held by the respondents are vacant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>Respondents are the incumbent officials of the Office of the Ombudsman, <i>viz: </i>Conchita Carpio Morales, Ombudsman <i>(Ombudsman Morales); </i>Melchor Arthur H. Carandang, Overall Deputy Ombudsman; Gerard Abeto Mosquera, Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon; Paul Elmer M. Clemente as Deputy Ombudsman for Visayas; Rodolfo M. Elman, Deputy Ombudsman for Mindanao; and Cyril Enguerra Ramos, Deputy Ombudsman for the Military.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Petitioner maintains that the constitutional issue raised in his petition is of transcendental importance since this Court's ruling will finally determine the correct term and tenure of the Ombudsman and his deputies and settle the matter as to the constitutionality of Sec. 8(3) of R.A. No. 6770. He alleges that Sec. 8(3), in relation to Sec. 7 of R.A. No. 6770, which provides that in case of a vacancy at the Office of the Ombudsman due to death, resignation, removal or permanent disability of the incumbent Ombudsman and his deputies, the newly appointed Ombudsman and his deputies shall be appointed to a full term of seven (7) years, is constitutionally infirm as it contravenes Sec. 11 in relation to Secs. 8 and 10 of Art. XI of the 1987 Constitution. He avers that like all constitutionally created positions, i.e., President, Vice-President, Senators, Members of the House of Representatives and Members of the Civil Service Commission <i>(CSC), </i>the Commission on Elections <i>(COMELEC), </i>and the Commission on Audit <i>(COA), </i>the successor to the positions of the Ombudsman and deputies should serve only the unexpired term of the predecessor. Hence, petitioner insists that the incumbent Ombudsman and deputies have been overstaying in their present positions for more than two years considering that their terms have expired on 1 February 2015. "To allow them to stay in the said positions one day longer constitutes a continuing affront to the 1987 Constitution, unduly clips presidential prerogatives, and deprives the nation of the services of legitimate Ombudsman and Deputies Ombudsman."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>To fortify his position, petitioner states that the intent of the framers of the 1987 Constitution during its 26 July 1986 discussion was to constitutionalize the Office of the Ombudsman, i.e., by granting it autonomy and independence the same as and equal to those of the other constitutionally created offices and positions. That in the process of constitutionalizing the Office of the Ombudsman, the framers ensured its stature and clout as a constitutional body like the COMELEC, the COA, the CSC, and the Commission on Human Rights <i>(CHR), viz: </i>by creating the office and giving it fiscal autonomy and independence thus making it a constitutionally created office; by providing the qualifications, disqualifications, manner of appointment, cessation, and removal from office; and by specifying the salary, positional rank, term of office, powers, functions, and duties thereof; thereby making the Ombudsman and the deputies constitutionally created positions. He claims that the intention of the framers was evident in Secs. 5 to 14, Art. XI of the 1987 Constitution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>According to the petitioner, with the effectivity of the 1987 Constitution, President Corazon C. Aquino <i>(President Aquino), </i>on 24 July 1987, issued pursuant to Sec. 6,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Art. XVIII of the 1987 Constitution, Executive Order <i>(E.O.) </i>No. 243<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> creating the Office of the Ombudsman. On 17 November 1989, R.A. No. 6770 was approved. Considering that the intent of the framers of the Constitution was that the position of the Ombudsman and the deputies shall have the same status as the three constitutional commissions, the limitations as to the latter's term of office shall likewise apply to the Ombudsman and the deputies. Hence, petitioner maintains that the grant of a full term to an Ombudsman's successor, when the vacancy in the office is for a cause other than the expiration of term, is an outright non-observance of the intent of the framers and Sec. 11, Art. XI of the 1987 Constitution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Petitioner insists that in <i>Gaminde v. COA (Gaminde),</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> the Court en banc has determined that the starting point of the terms of office of the first appointees to the constitutional commissions is uniformly set on 2 February 1987. He maintains as regards the appointment of Conrado M. Vasquez as first Ombudsman in May 1988, the seven-year term which was supposed to start on 2 February 1987 and culminate seven (7) years thereafter, was not complied with.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>The petitioner presented the following table:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="121"> <div align="CENTER">OMBUDSMAN </div> </td> <td width="109"> <div align="CENTER">7-YEAR <br> TERM </div> </td> <td width="112"> <div align="CENTER">ACTUAL<br>&nbsp; TENURE </div> </td> <td width="114"> <div align="CENTER">DE FACTO <br> SERVICE </div> </td> <td width="119"> <div align="CENTER">CESSATION <br> OF SERVICE </div> </td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td width="121"> <div align="LEFT"><br>Conrado M.

This observation, petitioner claims, holds true with the other respondent deputies.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Petitioner posits that the "recurrence of this cycle of noncompliance and nonobservance of the intent of the framers and the explicit provision of the 1987 Philippine Constitution is an outright affront to the fundamental law of the land and, if it remains unchecked, will create a cycle of non-compliance with and nonobservance of what the Constitution provides."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Petitioner argues that the Office of the Ombudsman is not <i>sui generis; </i>thus, what applies and holds true for all the other constitutionally created offices and positions should also apply to this office. The Ombudsman cannot be an exception, to the rule set by the 1987 Constitution, i.e., to serve for the unexpired term, so much so that each uncompleted term creates a fresh term for the appointed Ombudsman. Petitioner speculates that such fresh term of seven years could effectively deprive an incoming President the power and opportunity to appoint an Ombudsman. Thus the term of the Ombudsman will be subject to political maneuverings such that the outgoing President can divest the next President of the prerogative to appoint. If the unexpired term is the policy, every President can appoint an Ombudsman.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Petitioner cites the ruling in <i>Tañada v.

XI of the 1987 Constitution is clear that the term of the Ombudsman and the Deputies shall be seven years without reappointment without distinction on the cause of filling the vacancy. According to the respondents, to follow petitioner's interpretation would lead to a distinction not found in the law between: (1) the term of the Ombudsman and the deputies who succeeded a predecessor who finished a full term of seven years; and (2) the term of the Ombudsman and the deputies who merely succeeded the predecessor who did not finish the full term of seven years.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Respondents state that unlike Sec. 11, Art. XI of the 1987 Constitution, the term of office of the constitutionally created offices provides that a successor who is appointed to any vacancy shall only serve the unexpired term of the successor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>To disprove the petitioner's assertion that the distinction as to the term of office of constitutionally created offices applies to the Ombudsman and his Deputies, respondents explain that there are other offices created by the Constitution, <i>viz: </i>Supreme Court, Judicial and Bar Council <i>(JBC), </i>Senate Electoral Tribunal <i>(SET), </i>House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal <i>(HRET), </i>judges of lower courts, elective local officials, and the CHR, among others, where such distinction does not apply.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Respondents allege that the deliberations of the framers of the Constitution reveal their intent to grant the Ombudsman and his deputies the same rank and salary as the Chair and members of the Constitutional Commissions but not by the staggered term.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Respondents contend that the ruling in <i>Gaminde </i>where the rotational system of appointment of the CSC chairperson and the commissioners was crucial to the determination of the start of Commissioner Gaminde's term, does not apply to the Office of the Ombudsman where there are no seven-five-three-year rotational intervals for the appointment. Moreover, the Office of the Ombudsman is not a commission composed of a chairperson and several commissioners; thus, whether the term of the first Ombudsman began on 2 February 1987 would be immaterial because the succeeding Ombudsman shall have a fresh seven-year term.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Respondents maintain that the present petition seeks to unseat respondents from public office; thus, the <i>Tañada </i>and <i>Imbong </i>rulings on which petitioner anchors his petition would not apply since these cases do not involve an attack on a public officer's title. Moreover, the present petition, which involves a collateral attack on the respondents' title, should be dismissed for being an improper remedy. Respondents emphasize that the proper remedy would have been a petition for <i>quo warranto </i>under Rule 66 of the Rules of Court to be initiated by the Solicitor General or public prosecutor when directed by the President of the Philippines.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br><center><b>ISSUES</b></center><br><br><blockquote><center>I.<br></center><br>Whether Section 8(3) of R.A.

No. 6770.</i></b><br><br>To justify his claim that a petition for certiorari and prohibition is the proper remedy to assail the validity of Sec. 8(3) of R.A. No. 6770, petitioner cites the ruling in <i>Tañada </i>and <i>Imbong </i>that "certiorari, prohibition, and mandamus are appropriate remedies to raise constitutional issues and to review and/or prohibit/nullify, when proper, acts of legislative and executive officials, as there is no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law."<br><br>To counter petitioner's justification and to prove that <i>quo warranto </i>was the proper remedy in this case, respondents cite <i>Topacio v. Ong.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Respondents failed to consider that the factual antecedents in <i>Topacio </i>are not on four-square with the present petition. In that case, Ferdinand Topacio's petition for certiorari and prohibition sought, in the main, to prevent Justice Gregory Ong from further exercising the powers, duties, and responsibilities of a Sandiganbayan Associate Justice. Topacio chiefly moored his petition on the ground that Ong did not qualify to be appointed as an Associate Justice of the Sandiganbayan on the basis of his citizenship, i.e., whether gauged from his birth certificate which indicates him to be a Chinese citizen or against his bar records bearing out his status as a naturalized Filipino citizen. Simply put, the petition principally involved a review of Ong's qualification for appointment as Associate Justice of the Sandiganbayan which violated, according to Topacio, Sec. 7,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Art. VIII of the 1987 Constitution requiring that the members of the Supreme Court or any collegiate court be natural-born citizens of the Philippines. Thus, the Court held:<br><br><blockquote>While denominated as a petition for certiorari and prohibition, the petition partakes of the nature of a <i>quo warranto </i>proceeding with respect to Ong, for it effectively seeks to declare null and void his appointment as an Associate Justice of the Sandiganbayan for being unconstitutional. While the petition professes to be one for certiorari and prohibition, petitioner even adverts to a <i>quo warranto </i>aspect of the petition.<br><br>Being a collateral attack on a public officer's title, the present petition for certiorari and prohibition must be dismissed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></blockquote><br><br>On the one hand, petitioner prefaced his petition as follows:<br><br><blockquote>This is a petition for certiorari and prohibition under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court seeking to declare the following:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">(a)</div> </td> <td width="95%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">Section 8(3) in relation to Section 7 of Republic Act No. 6770, also known as the Ombudsman Act of 1989, as unconstitutional for being an outright transgression of Section 11 in relation to Sections 8 and 10 of Article XI of the 1987 Constitution; and </div> </td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">(b) </div> </td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">All individual respondents as de facto Ombudsman and Deputies Ombudsman, respectively, and all their positions vacant.</div> </td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br><br>This Honorable Court's jurisdiction over cases involving the constitutionality of laws pursuant to Sections 4(2) and 5 of Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution is being respectfully invoked in view of the transcendental importance of the instant matter.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></blockquote><br><br>The pertinent provisions of Art. XI of the 1987 Constitution which petitioner avers was transgressed by Sec. 8(3) of R.A. No. 6770 are as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 8. The Ombudsman and his Deputies shall be natural-born citizens of the Philippines, and at the time of their appointment, at least forty years old, of recognized probity and independence, and members of the Philippine Bar, and must not have been candidates for any elective office in the immediately preceding election. The Ombudsman must have for ten years or more been a judge or engaged in the practice of law in the Philippines.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Sec. 10. The Ombudsman and his Deputies shall have the rank of Chairman and Members, respectively, of the Constitutional Commissions, and they shall receive the same salary, which shall not be decreased during their term of office.<br><br>Sec. 11. The Ombudsman and his Deputies shall serve for a term of seven years without reappointment. They shall not be qualified to run for any office in the election immediately succeeding their cessation from office.</blockquote><br><br>Clear from his petition was that the petitioner beseeches the Court for a declaration primarily as to the unconstitutionality of Sec. 8(3) in relation to Sec. 7 of R.A. No. 6770, and as a consequence thereof, a pronouncement that the incumbent Ombudsman and the deputies are <i>de facto </i>officers and whose offices are vacant. The petition does not task the Court to scrutinize the qualification of the respondents to hold office as Ombudsman and deputies but rather to determine the constitutionality of Sec. 8(3) of R.A. No. 6770 in so far as their term of office is concerned.<br><br>In contrast with <i>Topacio </i>where the very issue involved was the qualification to office of Ong, the present petition attacks the validity of a law, which petitioner claims has transgressed Sec. 11 in relation to Secs. 10 and 11, Art. XI of the 1987 Constitution. Petitioner points out that the legislature went beyond the parameters of these constitutional provisions when it crafted Sec. 8(3) of R.A. No. 6770,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> and that "there is no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law that can correct the long-running, pervasive, and continuous violation of Sec. 11 in relation to Secs. 8 and 10, Art. XI of the 1987 Constitution and the applicable jurisprudence."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Under the 1987 Constitution, judicial power includes the duty of the courts of justice not only "to settle actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable," but also "to determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Its expanded power of review provides:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 1. The judicial power shall be vested in one Supreme Court and in such lower courts as may be established by law.<br><br>Judicial power includes the duty of the courts of justice to settle actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable, and to determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></blockquote><br><br>Fundamental is the rule that grave abuse of discretion arises when a lower court or tribunal patently violates the Constitution, the law, or existing jurisprudence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> We have already ruled that petitions for certiorari and prohibition filed before the Court "are the remedies by which the grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government may be determined under the Constitution," and explained that "[w]ith respect to the Court, x x x the remedies of <i>certiorari </i>and prohibition are necessarily broader in scope and reach, and the writ of <i>certiorari </i>or prohibition may be issued to correct errors of jurisdiction committed not only by a tribunal, corporation, board or officer exercising judicial, quasi-judicial or ministerial functions, but <b>also to set right, undo[,] and restrain any act of grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction by any branch or instrumentality of the Government, <i>even if the latter does not </i></b><i><b>exercise</b> <b>judicial, quasi-judicial or ministerial functions.</b>"</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>"Where an action of the legislative branch is seriously alleged to have infringed the Constitution, it becomes not only the right but in fact the duty of the judiciary to settle the dispute. The question thus posed is judicial rather than political, x x x. The duty to adjudicate remains to assure that the supremacy of the Constitution is upheld."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> The Court however, does not have unrestrained authority to rule on just any and every claim of constitutional violation. Hence, the legal teaching is that the power of judicial review is limited by four exacting requisites, <i>viz: </i>(a) there must be an actual case or controversy; (b) the petitioners must possess <i>locus standi; </i>(c) the question of constitutionality must be raised at the earliest opportunity; and (d) the issue of constitutionality must be the <i>lis mota </i>of the case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>An actual case or controversy involves a conflict of legal rights, an assertion of opposite legal claims, susceptible of judicial resolution as distinguished from a hypothetical or abstract difference or dispute.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Closely linked to this requirement is that the question must be ripe for adjudication, i.e., when the act being challenged has had a direct adverse effect on the individual or entity challenging it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> It is a prerequisite that something had then been accomplished or performed by either branch before a court may come into the picture, and the petitioner must allege the existence of an immediate or threatened injury to itself as a result of the challenged action.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>The Court holds that the present petition involves an actual case or controversy and that the same is ripe for judicial determination. It will be noted that, granting there was merit to the position raised by the petitioner that Sec. 8(3) of R.A. No. 6770 is unconstitutional, the incumbent Ombudsman and deputies are <i>de facto </i>officers who have overstayed in office since 2 February 2015. Of prime consideration, too, if petitioner's position is correct, is the alleged pervasive noncompliance and non-observance of the constitution relative to the seven-year term of office of the Ombudsman and the deputies, the principles of which, albeit relevant to the constitutional commissions, have been settled in <i>Gaminde. </i>It should likewise be taken into account, granting that petitioner's challenge to Sec. 8(3) of R.A. No. 6770 was valid and legal, that there are continuing illegal disbursements of public funds to pay the salaries of the <i>de facto </i>Ombudsman and deputies. From these considerations, it cannot be gainsaid that there is indeed a justiciable controversy involving an alleged serious infringement of the fundamental law, and which the Court is duty bound to resolve.<br><br><i>Locus standi</i> is defined as follows:<br><br><blockquote>A personal and substantial interest in the case such that the party has sustained or will sustain a direct injury as a result of the governmental act that is being challenged. The term "interest" means a material interest, an interest in issue affected by the decree, as distinguished from mere interest in the question involved, or a mere incidental interest. The gist of the question of standing is whether a party alleges such personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court depends for illumination of difficult constitutional questions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></blockquote><br><br>Jurisprudence dictates that a party challenging the constitutionality of a law, act or statute must show "not only that the law is invalid, but also that he has sustained or is in immediate or imminent danger of sustaining some direct injury as a result of its enforcement, and not merely that he suffers thereby in some indefinite way."<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[44]</sup></font> There is likewise the teaching that <i>locus standi </i>is merely a matter of procedure and that, in some cases, suits are not brought by parties who have been personally injured by the operation of a law or any other government act, but by concerned citizens, taxpayers, or voters who actually sue in the public interest.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[45]</sup></font> This liberal stance has been exemplified in <i>Funa v. Villar,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> <i>viz:</i><br><br><blockquote>To have legal standing, therefore, a suitor must show that he has sustained or will sustain a "direct injury" as a result of a government action, or have a "material interest" in the issue affected by the challenged official act. However, the Court has time and again acted liberally on the <i>locus standi </i>requirements and has accorded certain individuals, not otherwise directly injured, or with material interest affected, by a Government act, standing to sue provided a constitutional issue of critical significance is at stake. The rule on <i>locus standi </i>is after all a mere procedural technicality in relation to which the Court, in a <i>catena </i>of cases involving a subject of transcendental import, has waived, or relaxed, thus allowing non-traditional plaintiffs, such as concerned citizens, taxpayers, voters or legislators, to sue in the public interest, albeit they may not have been personally injured by the operation of a law or any other government act. In <i>David, </i>the Court laid out the bare minimum norm before the so-called "non-traditional suitors" may be extended standing to sue, thusly:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">1.)</div> </td> <td width="95%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">For <i>taxpayers, </i>there must be a claim of illegal disbursement of public funds or that the tax measure is unconstitutional; </div> </td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">2.) </div> </td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">For <i>voters, </i>there must be a showing of obvious interest in the validity of the election law in question; </div> </td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">3.)</div> </td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">For <i>concerned citizens, </i>there must be a showing that the issues raised are of transcendental importance which must be settled early; and </div> </td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">4.)</div> </td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">For <i>legislators, </i>there must be a claim that the official action complained of infringes their prerogatives as legislators.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></div> </td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote></blockquote><br><br>Petitioner, who claims to be a taxpayer, asserts that there has been illegal disbursement of public funds in paying the salaries of the respondents.

To this end, he pleads and outlines the following arguments:<br><br><blockquote>41.

Respondent Carpio-Morales has been holding the position of Ombudsman in a <i>de facto </i>capacity for more than two (2) years already. The vacancy and the appointment of a new Ombudsman is now imperative.<br><br></li><li><i>Fifth. </i>The instant petition involves a constitutional organ. The Office of the Ombudsman is a constitutional office, hence, in the words of <i>The Diocese of Bacolod,</i><font color="#FF0000"><sup>[48]</sup></font><i> </i>"a ruling by this court would be in the best interest of respondents, in order that their actions may be guided accordingly in the future."<br><br></li><li><i>Sixth. </i>There is no other plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the&nbsp; ordinary course of law that can correct the long running and recurring, pervasive and continuous violation of Section 11 in&nbsp; relation to Sections 8 and 10, Article XI of the 1987 Philippine&nbsp; Constitution, and applicable jurisprudence.<br><br></li><li><i>Seventh. </i>This petition directly puts into question the status and legitimacy of respondent Carpio-Morales as Ombudsman and her deputies' continued service as such considering that, pursuant to Section 11 in relation to Sections 8 and 10, Article XI of the 1987 Philippine Constitution, and applicable jurisprudence, her term already expired on 2 February 2015.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></li></ol></blockquote></blockquote><br><br>Interestingly, the OSG hardly addressed these points in its Comment and Memorandum. Nowhere did the OSG counter petitioner's claim that the principal issue he raised is of such transcendental importance that his case may escape the application of the principle of the hierarchy of courts.<br><br>The Court has explained the necessity of the application of the hierarchy of courts <i>Bañez, Jr. v. Concepcion:</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br><blockquote>The Court must enjoin the observance of the policy on the hierarchy of courts, and now affirms that the policy is not to be ignored without serious consequences. The strictness of the policy is designed to shield the Court from having to deal with causes that are also well within the competence of the lower courts, and thus leave time to the Court to deal with the more fundamental and more essential tasks that the Constitution has assigned to it. The Court may act on petitions for the extraordinary writs of certiorari, prohibition and mandamus only when absolutely necessary or when serious and important reasons exist to justify an exception to the policy.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></blockquote><br><br>However, the doctrine of hierarchy of courts is not an iron-clad rule as it in fact admits the jurisprudentially established exceptions thereto, <i>viz: </i>(a) a direct resort to this court is allowed when there are genuine issues of constitutionality that must be addressed at the most immediate time. A direct resort to this court includes availing of the remedies of certiorari and prohibition to assail the constitutionality of actions of both legislative and executive branches of the government; (b) when the issues involved are of transcendental importance; (c) cases of first impression warrant a direct resort to this court. In cases of first impression, no jurisprudence yet exists that will guide the lower courts on this matter; (d) the constitutional issues raised are better decided by this court; (e) the time element; (f) the filed petition reviews the act of a constitutional organ; (g) petitioners have no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law; and (h) the petition includes questions that are dictated by public welfare and the advancement of public policy, or demanded by the broader interest of justice, or the orders complained of were found to be patent nullities, or the appeal was considered as clearly an inappropriate remedy.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Petitioner has amplified in his petition these exceptions to justify a relaxation on the adherence to the doctrine of hierarchy of courts.<br><br>Before proceeding any further, the Court observes that petitioner has named only the incumbent Ombudsman and the deputies as respondents in his petition although the present controversy deals with the constitutionality of a legislative act and, corollary thereto, the act of the President in appointing the respondents allegedly beyond the seven-year term as prescribed by the constitution and explicated through our jurisprudential declarations. The Court hastens to add that it was equally raised in this petition that there were alleged illegal disbursement of public funds as a result of the pervasive noncompliance with the constitutional requirement on the seven-year term of office of the Ombudsman and the deputies; yet, the petitioner failed to include the Department of Budget and Management <i>(DBM) </i>as a respondent.<br><br>Notwithstanding these observations, the Court notes that respondents' present counsel, the OSG, would have likewise represented the legislative body, the Office of the President, or the DBM had they been equally named as respondents in this petition. Bearing in mind that the arguments of the OSG relative to the constitutionality of Sec. 8(3) of R.A. No. 6770 would have equally applied to these persons had they been included as respondents in this petition and that the Court has already determined that it shall take cognizance of this case pursuant to its expanded power of review, we shall then set aside our misgivings on the failure of the petitioner to include the other respondents in his petition.<br><br><b><i>The History of the Office of the<br>Ombudsman</i></b><br><br>The word "ombudsman" originated from Sweden when in 1809 it established the position of <i>Justlieombudsman </i>with the purpose of overseeing government administration.

Courts invariably train their sights on this fundamental rule whenever a legislative act is under a constitutional attack, for it is the postulate of constitutional adjudication. This strong predilection for constitutionality takes its bearings on the idea that it is forbidden for one branch of the government to encroach upon the duties and powers of another. Thus it has been said that the presumption is based on the deference the judicial branch accords to its coordinate branch - the legislature.<br><br>If there is any reasonable basis upon which the legislation may firmly rest, the courts must assume that the legislature is ever conscious of the borders and edges of its plenary powers, and has passed the law with full knowledge of the facts and for the purpose of promoting what is right and advancing the welfare of the majority. Hence, in determining whether the acts of the legislature are in tune with the fundamental law, courts should proceed with judicial restraint and act with caution and forbearance. Every intendment of the law must be adjudged by the courts in favor of its constitutionality, invalidity being a measure of last resort. In construing therefore the provisions of a statute, courts must first ascertain whether an interpretation is fairly possible to sidestep the question of constitutionality.<br><br>In <i>La Union Credit Cooperative, Inc. v. Yaranon </i>we held that as long as there is some basis for the decision of the court, the constitutionality of the challenged law will not be touched and the case will be decided on other available grounds. Yet the force of the presumption is not sufficient to catapult a fundamentally deficient law into the safe environs of constitutionality. Of course, where the law clearly and palpably transgresses the hallowed domain of the organic law, it must be struck down on sight lest the positive commands of the fundamental law be unduly eroded.<br><br>Verily, the onerous task of rebutting the presumption weighs heavily on the party challenging the validity of the statute. He must demonstrate beyond any tinge of doubt that there is indeed an infringement of the constitution, for absent such a showing, there can be no finding of unconstitutionality.

And this can be done if after the appointments of the first three Commissioners, the successor of any one of them who ceases prior to the expiration of his term, be appointed only for the unexpired portion of that term. Of course, when a Commissioner ceases because of the expiration of his term his successor must be appointed for a term of nine years; but when he ceases on other grounds prior to the expiration of his term, his successor must be appointed only for the unexpired portion of that term, otherwise the appointment would be offensive to the Constitution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup></blockquote><br><br>In <i>Republic v. Imperial,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> the Court held that this particular provision of the 1935 Constitution, when taken together with the prescribed term of office for nine years without reappointment, evidences a deliberate plan to have a regular rotation or cycle in the membership of the COMELEC, by having subsequent members appointable only once every three years. With these periods it was the intention to have one position vacant every three years, so that no President can appoint more than one commissioner, thereby preserving and safeguarding the independence and impartiality of the Commission as a body, we may add, for the impartiality and independence of each individual commissioner's tenure was safeguarded by other provisions in the same Article X of the fundamental charter.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup> Moreover, the rotation of the commissioners' appointments at regular and fixed intervals of three years was a deliberate plan, was shown by the history of the provision and by selection of the fixed term of nine years for all subsequent appointees, since no other term would give such a result.<br><br>In <i>Imperial, </i>we established that for the operation of the rotational plan, two conditions, both indispensable to its workability, are required, <i>viz: </i>(1) that the terms of the first three commissioners should <i>start on a common date; </i>and (2) that any vacancy due to death, resignation or disability before the expiration of the term should be filled only <i>for the unexpired balance of the term. </i>Without satisfying these conditions, the regularity of the intervals between appointments would be destroyed, and the evident purpose of the rotation, i.e., to prevent that a four-year administration should appoint more than one permanent and regular commissioner, would be frustrated. It was settled therefore that of the first three COMELEC commissioners appointed whose office shall all commence on a common date, one commissioner shall have a term of office of nine years, the other for six years, and the remaining one for three years.<br><br>The rotational plan, which was unique for the COMELEC under the 1935 Constitution, was subsequently applied to the CSC and the COA pursuant to Art.

The Ombudsman and the deputies, in contrast to the constitutional commissions, do not decide by a majority vote of all its members any case or matter brought before the Office of the Ombudsman. To stress, the Ombudsman and the deputies have their respective jurisdiction; hence, they could not have common responsibility relative to the discharge of their separate and distinct functions.<br><br>Granting that the regular rotation applies to the Office of the Ombudsman and that the first appointed Ombudsman shall enjoy a seven-year term, then these queries are posed: Will the seven-year term likewise apply to the first appointed deputies? Who among the first appointed deputies shall take the five-year term? Or the three-year term? Obviously, the 1987 Constitution does not provide the answers plainly because there is nothing specific in the fundamental law that provides for the regular rotation of seven-five-three-year term of office in the Office of the Ombudsman. Thus, it is only apposite to apply the well-settled rule that the court may not, in the guise of interpretation, enlarge the scope of a statute and include therein situations not provided nor intended by the lawmakers<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup> or, in this case, the framers of the 1987 Constitution.

As a result, the salaries and emoluments of Gaminde and her co-terminous staff effective 2 February 1999, were disallowed in audit. Gaminde appealed to the COA en banc but the commission affirmed the propriety of the disallowance.

XI by itself is clear and can stand on its own. Notably, the framers plainly provided for a seven-year term of the Ombudsman and the deputies.

Thus, the Chief Justice shall remain as the <i>ex officio </i>JBC Chairman until the mandatory retirement age of 70 or becomes incapacitated to discharge the duties of the office; the Secretary of Justice, while holding this Cabinet position; and the representative of Congress,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup> until recalled by the chamber or until the term of the representative expires, his term prematurely ends due to death, resignation, removal, or permanent disability; (c) the Senate and the House Electoral Tribunal, where each electoral tribunal shall be composed of nine members, three of whom shall be Justices of the Supreme Court to be designated by the Chief Justice, and the remaining six shall be members of the Senate or the House of Representatives, as the case may be, who shall be chosen on the basis of proportional representation from the political parties and the parties or organizations registered under the party-list system represented therein. The senior Justice in the electoral tribunal shall be its Chairman. Following the earlier discussion on the JBC, the term of the Justices shall be until they reach the mandatory retirement age of 70 or become incapacitated to discharge the duties of the office; and the members of the Senate and the House of Representatives, until they are recalled by the chamber, or their term expires, or their term prematurely ends due to death, resignation, removal, or permanent disability; and (e) the Commission on Appointments <i>(CA), </i>which shall be composed of twelve Senators and twelve members of the House of Representatives, elected by each House on the basis of proportional representation from the political parties and parties or organizations registered under the party-list system represented herein. The President of the Senate shall be the <i>ex officio </i>chairman of the CA.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[120]</sup></font> Hence, the <i>ex officio </i>chairman shall remain as such until he becomes the President of the Senate, while the members shall continue as such until recalled by the chamber, or until their term expires, or their term prematurely ends due to death, resignation, removal, or permanent disability.<br><br>It is a legal teaching that the courts, as guardians of the Constitution, have the inherent authority to determine whether a statute enacted by the legislature transcends the limit imposed by the fundamental law. And where the acts of the other branches of government run afoul of the Constitution, it is the judiciary's solemn and sacred duty to nullify the same.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[121]</sup></font> The Court has punctiliously reviewed the 1987 Constitution and its jurisprudential declarations but found nothing that would at the very least tenuously support the argument of the petitioner that Sec. 8(3) of R.A. No. 6770 is unconstitutional.<br><br>Going back to our earlier pronouncement that the onerous task of rebutting the presumption weighs heavily on the party challenging the validity of the statute, the Court rules that the petitioner has miserably failed to prove that Sec. 8(3) of R.A. No. 6770 transgresses the provisions of the 1987 Constitution. As such, the Court has no option but to deny the petition.<br><br>To summarize:<br><br>Pertinent to Sec. 10, Art. XI of the 1987 Constitution, it is only as to the rank and salary that the Ombudsman and the deputies shall be the same with the chairman and members, respectively, of the constitutional commissions.<br><br>Harmonizing Sec. 11, Art. XI of the 1987 Constitution with Sec. 8(3) of R.A. No. 6770, in any vacancy for the positions of Ombudsman and the deputies, whether as a result of the expiration of the term or death, resignation, removal, or permanent disability of the predecessor, the successor shall always be appointed for a <u>full term of seven years</u>.<br><br>Unlike the constitutional commissions in Art. IX of the 1987 Constitution, the seven-year term of office of the first appointees for Ombudsman and the deputies is not reckoned from 2 February 1987, but shall be reckoned from their date of appointment. Accordingly, the present Ombudsman and deputies shall serve a full term of seven years from their date of appointment unless their term is cut short by death, resignation, removal, or permanent disability.<br><br>The <i>Gaminde </i>ruling applies to the constitutional commissions and not to the Office of the Ombudsman.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petition is <b>DISMISSED.</b><br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Carpio, (Acting Chief Justice), Velasco, Jr., Leonardo-De Castro, Peralta, Bersamin, Del Castillo, Perlas-Bernabe, Leonen, Jardeleza, Caguioa, Tijam, Reyes,</i> and <i>Gesmundo, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><i>Sereno, C.J.,</i> on leave.<br><br><br><hr align="center" noshade="" size="1" width="60%"><div align="center"><br><br></div><b><center>NOTICE OF JUDGMENT</center><br><br>Sirs/Mesdames:<br><br>Please take notice that on <u>April 24, 2018</u> a <u>Decision</u>/Resolution, copy attached herewith, was rendered by the Supreme Court in the above-entitled case, the original of which was received by this Office on May 9, 2018 at 5:05 p.m.<br><br></b><div align="right"><b>Very truly yours,</b><br><br><b>(SGD.)
