				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This case focuses on the correct period for appealing the decision or award of the Voluntary Arbitrator or Panel of Arbitrators. The issue arises because the decision or award of the Voluntary Arbitrator or Panel of Arbitrators is appealable to the Court of Appeals (CA) by petition for review under Rule 43 of the <i>Rules of Court</i>, which provides a period of 15 days from notice of the decision or award within which to file the petition for review. On the other hand, Article 262-A (now Article 276)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the <em>Labor Code</em> sets 10 days as the period within which the appeal is to be made.<p align="center"> <b>The Case</b> </p><p> Petitioner Guagua National Colleges (GNC) hereby assails by petition for <em>certiorari</em> the resolution promulgated on December 15, 2008,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> whereby the Court of Appeals (CA) denied its <em>Motion to Dismiss</em> filed vis-à-vis the respondents' petition for <em>certiorari</em> in the following manner: </p><blockquote> <p> This Court resolves: </p> <p> 1. x x x</p> <p>2.

Likewise, <em><strong>Leyte IV Electric Cooperative, Inc. vs. LEYECO IV Employees Union-ALU</strong></em>, reiterating the landmark <em><strong>Case of Luzon Development Bank vs. Association of Luzon Development Bank Employees</strong></em>, declared that the proper remedy from the award of a voluntary arbitrator <strong>is a petition for review to the CA</strong>, following Revised Administrative Circular No. 1-95, which in turn provides for a reglementary period of fifteen (15) days within which to appeal. </p> <p> Keeping in mind Article 4 of the Labor Code which mandates that all doubts in the implementation and interpretation of its provisions, including its implementing rules and regulations, should be resolved in favor of labor and considering that technicalities are not supposed to stand in the way of equitably and completely resolving the rights and obligations of labor arid capital, We rule that the Petition for Review was seasonably filed.

(Bold underscoring supplied for emphasis)</p> </blockquote> <p> Article 276 is an amendment introduced by R.A. No. 6715.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Prior to the effectivity of the amendment on March 21, 1989,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Article 262 (the predecessor provision) stated that voluntary arbitration decisions or awards would be <em>final, unappealable</em> and <em>executory</em>. Despite such immediately executory nature of the decisions and awards of the Voluntary Arbitrators, however, the Court pronounced in <em>Oceanic Bic Division (FFW) v. Romero</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> that the decisions or awards of the Voluntary Arbitrators involving interpretations of law were within the scope of the Court's power of review. The Court explained: </p><blockquote> <p> x x x x We agree with the petitioner that the decisions of voluntary arbitrators must be given the highest respect and as a general rule must be accorded a certain measure of finality. This is especially true where the arbitrator chosen by the parties [enjoys] the first rate credentials of Professor Flerida Ruth Pineda Romero, Director of the U.P. Law Center and an academician of unquestioned expertise in the field of Labor Law. It is not correct, however, that this respect precludes the exercise of judicial review over their decisions. Article 262 of the Labor Code making voluntary arbitration awards final, inappealable, and executory except where the money claims exceed P100,000.00 or 40% of paid-up capital of the employer or where there is abuse of discretion or gross incompetence refers to appeals to the National Labor Relations Commission and not to judicial review.</p> <p> Inspite of statutory provisions making '"final" the decisions of certain administrative agencies, we have taken cognizance of petitions questioning these decisions where want of jurisdiction, grave abuse of discretion, violation of due process, denial of substantial justice, or erroneous interpretation of the law were brought to our attention. There is no provision for appeal in the statute creating the Sandiganbayan but this has not precluded us from examining decisions of this special court brought to us in proper petitions. Thus, we have ruled:</p> <blockquote> <p> "Yanglay raised a jurisdictional question which was not brought up by respondent public officials. He contends that this Court has no jurisdiction to review the decisions of the NLRC and the Secretary of Labor 'under the principle of separation of powers' and that judicial review is not provided for in Presidential Decree No. 21.</p> <p> "That contention is a flagrant error, it is generally understood that as to administrative agencies exercising quasi­ judicial or legislative power there is an underlying power in the courts to scrutinize the acts of such agencies on questions of law and jurisdiction even though no right of review is given by statute' (73 C.J.S. 506, note 56). </p> <p> "The purpose of judicial review is to keep the administrative agency within its jurisdiction and protect substantial rights of parties affected by its decisions' (73 C.J.S. 507, Sec. 165). It is part of the system of checks and balances which restricts the separation of powers and forestalls arbitrary and unjust adjudications.</p> <p> "Judicial review is proper in case of lack of jurisdiction, grave abuse of discretion, error of law, fraud or collusion (Timbancaya vs. Vicente, 62 O.G. 9424; Macatangay vs. Secretary of Public Works and Communications, 63 O.G. 11236; Ortua vs. Singson Encarnacion, 59 Phil. 440). </p> <p> "'The courts may declare an action or resolution of an administrative authority to be illegal (1) because it violates or fails to comply with some mandatory provision of the law or (2) because it is corrupt, arbitrary or capricious' (Borromeo vs. City of Manila and Rodriguez Lanuza, 62 Phil. 512, 516; Villegas vs. Auditor General, L-21352, November 29, 1966, 18 SCRA 877, 891). [San Miguel Corporation v. Secretary of Labor, 64 SCRA 60].</p> <p> xxx xxx xxx</p> <p> "It is now settled rule that under the present Labor Code, (Presidential Decree No. 442, as amended [1974] if lack of power or arbitrary or improvident exercise of authority be shown, thus giving rise to a jurisdictional question, this Court may, in appropriate <em>certiorari</em> proceedings, pass upon the validity of the decisions reached by officials or administrative agencies in labor controversies. So it was assumed in Maglasang v. Ople, (L-38813, April 29, 1975, 63 SCRA 508). It was explicitly announced in San Miguel Corporation v. Secretary of Labor, (L-39195, May 16, 1975, 64 SCRA 56) the opinion being penned by Justice Aquino. Accordingly, cases of that character continue to find a place in our docket. (Cf. United Employees Union of Gelmart Industries v. Noriel, L-40810, Oct. 3, 1975, 67 SCRA 267) The present suit is of that category. [Kapisanan ng mga Manggagawa sa La Suerte-Foitaf vs. Noriel, 77 SCRA 415-416]. </p> </blockquote> <p> A voluntary arbitrator by the nature of her functions acts in a quasi-judicial capacity. There is no reason why her decisions involving interpretation of law should be beyond this Court's review. Administrative officials are presumed to act in accordance with law and yet we do not hesitate to pass upon their work where a question of law is involved or where a showing of abuse of authority or discretion in their official acts is properly raised in petitions for <em>certiorari</em>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> Accordingly, the decisions and awards of Voluntary Arbitrators, albeit immediately final and executory, remained subject to judicial review in appropriate cases through petitions for <em>certiorari</em>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> </p><p> Such was the state of things until the promulgation in 1995 of the ruling in <em>Luzon Development Bank v. Association of Luzon Development Bank Employees</em>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Therein, the Court noted the silence of R.A. No. 6715 on the availability of appeal from the decisions or awards of the Voluntary Arbitrators. In declaring the Voluntary Arbitrators or Panels of Voluntary Arbitrators as quasi-judicial instrumentalities,<em> Luzon Development Bank v. Association of Luzon Development Bank Employees</em> pronounced the decisions or awards of the Voluntary Arbitrators to be appealable to the CA,<em> viz</em>.: </p><blockquote> <p> It will thus be noted that the jurisdiction conferred by law on a voluntary arbitrator or a panel of such arbitrators is quite limited compared to the original jurisdiction of the labor arbiter and the appellate jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) for that matter. The state of our present law relating to voluntary arbitration provides that "(t)he award or decision of the Voluntary Arbitrator x x x shall be final and executory after ten (10) calendar days from receipt of the copy of the award or decision by the parties," while the "(d)ecision, awards, or orders of the Labor Arbiter are final and executory unless appealed to the Commission by any or both parties within ten (10) calendar days from receipt of such decisions, awards, or orders." Hence, while there is an express mode of appeal from the decision of a labor arbiter, Republic Act No. 6715 is silent with respect to an appeal from the decision of a voluntary arbitrator.</p> <p> Yet, past practice shows that a decision or award of a voluntary arbitrator is, more often than not, elevated to the Supreme Court itself on a petition for <em>certiorari</em>, in effect equating the voluntary arbitrator with the NLRC or the Court of Appeals. In the view of the Court, this is illogical and imposes an unnecessary burden upon it. </p> <p> In <em>Volkschel Labor Union, et al. v. NLRC, et al</em>., on the settled premise that the judgments of courts and awards of [quasi-judicial] agencies must become final at some definite time, this Court ruled that the awards of voluntary arbitrators determine the rights of parties; hence, their decisions have the same legal effect as judgments of a court. In<em> Oceanic Bic Division (FFW), et al. v. Romero, et al.,</em> this Court ruled that "a voluntary arbitrator by the nature of her functions acts in a quasi-judicial capacity." Under these rulings, it follows that the voluntary arbitrator, whether acting solely or in a panel, enjoys in law the status of a <em>quasi-judicial agency</em> but independent of, and apart from, the NLRC since his decisions are not appealable to the latter.</p> <p> Section 9 of B.P. Blg. 129, as amended by Republic Act No. 7902, provides that the Court of Appeals shall exercise:</p> <blockquote> <p> "xxx xxx xxx (3) Exclusive appellate jurisdiction over <i>all</i> final judgments, decisions, resolutions, orders or awards of Regional Trial Courts and quasi-judicial agencies, <em>instrumentalities</em>, boards or commissions, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Employees' Compensation Commission and the Civil Service Commission, except those falling within the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in accordance with the Constitution, the Labor Code of the Philippines under Presidential Decree No. 442, as amended, the provisions of this Act, and of subparagraph (1) of the third paragraph and subparagraph (4) of the fourth paragraph of Section 17 of the Judiciary Act of 1948.</p> <p> xxx xxx xxx"</p> </blockquote> <p> Assuming arguendo that the voluntary arbitrator or the panel of voluntary arbitrators may not strictly be considered as a [quasi-judicial] agency, board or commission, still both he and the panel are comprehended within the concept of a "quasi-judicial instrumentality." It may even be stated that it was to meet the very situation presented by the quasi-judicial functions of the voluntary arbitrators here, as well as the subsequent arbitrator/arbitral tribunal operating under the Construction Industry Arbitration Commission, that the broader term "instrumentalities" was purposely included in the above-quoted provision.</p> <p> An "instrumentality" is anything used as a means or agency. Thus, the terms governmental "agency" or "instrumentality" are synonymous in the sense that either of them is a means by which a government acts, or by which a certain government act or function is performed. The word "instrumentality," with respect to a state, contemplates an authority to which the state delegates governmental power for the performance of a state function. An individual person, like an administrator or executor, is a judicial instrumentality in the settling of an estate, in the same manner that a sub-agent appointed by a bankruptcy court is an instrumentality of the court, and a trustee in bankruptcy of a defunct corporation is an instrumentality of the state.</p> <p> The voluntary arbitrator no less performs a state function pursuant to a governmental power delegated to him under the provisions therefor in the Labor Code and he falls, therefore, within the contemplation of the term "instrumentality" in the aforequoted Sec. 9 of B.P. 129. The fact that his functions and powers are provided for in the Labor Code does not place him within the exceptions to said Sec. 9 since he is a quasi-judicial instrumentality as contemplated therein. It will be noted that, although the Employees' Compensation Commission is also provided for in the Labor Code, Circular No. 1-91, which is the forerunner of the present Revised Administrative Circular No. 1-95, laid down the procedure for the appealability of its decisions to the Court of Appeals under the foregoing rationalization, and this was later adopted by Republic Act No. 7902 in amending Sec. 9 of B.P. 129. </p> <p> A <i>fortiori</i>, the decision or award of the voluntary arbitrator or panel of arbitrators should likewise be appealable to the Court of Appeals, in line with the procedure outlined in Revised Administrative Circular No. 1-95, just like those of the quasi-judicial agencies, boards and commissions enumerated therein.</p> <p> This would be in furtherance of, and consistent with, the original purpose of Circular No. 1-91 to provide a uniform procedure for the appellate review of adjudications of all quasi-judicial entities not expressly excepted from the coverage of Sec. 9 of B.P. 129 by either the Constitution or another statute. Nor will it run counter to the legislative intendment that decisions of the NLRC be reviewable directly by the Supreme Court since, precisely, the cases within the adjudicative competence of the voluntary arbitrator are excluded from the jurisdiction of the NLRC or the labor arbiter.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> In other words, the remedy of appeal by petition for review under Rule 43 of the <i>Rules of Court</i> became available to the parties aggrieved by the decisions or awards of the Voluntary Arbitrators or Panels of Arbitrators.</p><p> In the 2004 ruling in <i>Sevilla Trading Company v. Semana</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> the Court ruled that the decision of the Voluntary Arbitrator became final and executory after the expiration of the 15-day reglementary period within which to file the petition for review under Rule 43. <i>Manila Midtown Hotel v.

Thus, in the 2007 ruling in <i>Leyte IV Electric Cooperative, Inc. v.

Court of Appeals</i> that despite the period provided in Rule 43, the 10-day period should apply in determining the timeliness of appealing the decision or award of the Voluntary Arbitrator or Panel of Arbitrators, to wit: </p><blockquote> <p> Despite Rule 43 providing for a 15-day period to appeal, we rule that the Voluntary Arbitrator's decision must be appealed before the Court of Appeals within 10 calendar days from receipt of the decision as provided in the Labor Code.</p> <p> Appeal is a "statutory privilege," which may be exercised "only in the manner and in accordance with the provisions of the law." "Perfection of an appeal within the reglementary period is not only mandatory but also jurisdictional so that failure to do so rendered the decision final and executory, and deprives the appellate court of jurisdiction to alter the final judgment much less to entertain the appeal."</p> <p> We ruled that Article 262-A of the Labor Code allows the appeal of decisions rendered by Voluntary Arbitrators. Statute provides that the Voluntary Arbitrator's decision "shall be final and executory after ten (10) calendar days from receipt of the copy of the award or decision by the parties." Being provided in the statute, this 10-day period must be complied with; otherwise, no appellate court will have jurisdiction over the appeal. This absurd situation occurs when the decision is appealed on the 11th to 15th day from receipt as allowed under the Rules, but which decision, under the law, has already become final and executory.</p> <p> Furthermore, under Article VIII, Section 5 (5) of the Constitution, this court "shall not diminish, increase, or modify substantive rights" in promulgating rules of procedure in courts. The 10-day period to appeal under the Labor Code being a substantive right, this period cannot be diminished, increased, or modified through the Rules of Court.</p> <p> In <i>Shioji v. Harvey</i>, this Court held that the "rules of court, promulgated by authority of law, have the force and effect of law, if not in conflict with positive law." Rules of Court are "subordinate to the statute." In case of conflict between the law and the Rules of Court, "the statute will prevail."</p> <p> The rule, therefore, is that a Voluntary Arbitrator's award or decision shall be appealed before the Court of Appeals within 10 days from receipt of the award or decision. Should the aggrieved party choose to file a motion for reconsideration with the Voluntary Arbitrator, the motion must be filed within the same 10-day period since a motion for reconsideration is filed "within the period for taking an appeal."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> The ratiocination in <i>Philippine Electric Corporation (PHILEC) v. Court of Appeals</i> backstopped the ruling in <i>NYK-FIL Ship Management, Inc. v. Dabu</i>. </p><p> Given the variable rulings of the Court, what should now be the period to be followed in appealing the decisions or awards of the Voluntary Arbitrators or Panel of Arbitrators?</p><p> In the 2010 ruling in <i>Teng v. Pagahac</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> the Court clarified that the 10-day period set in Article 276 of the <em>Labor Code</em> gave the aggrieved parties the opportunity to file their motion for reconsideration, which was more in keeping with the principle of exhaustion of administrative remedies, holding thusly: </p><blockquote> <p> In the exercise of its power to promulgate implementing rules and regulations, an implementing agency, such as the Department of Labor, is restricted from going beyond the terms of the law it seeks to implement; it should neither modify nor improve the law. The agency formulating the rules and guidelines cannot exceed the statutory authority granted to it by the legislature.</p> <p> <b>By allowing a 10-day period, the obvious intent of Congress in amending Article 263 to Article 262-A is to provide an opportunity for the party adversely affected by the VA's decision to seek recourse via a motion for reconsideration or a petition for review under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court filed with the CA. Indeed, a motion for reconsideration is the more appropriate remedy in line with the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies. For this reason, an appeal from administrative agencies to the CA via Rule 43 of the Rules of Court requires exhaustion of available remedies as a condition precedent to a petition under that Rule.</b></p> <p> The requirement that administrative remedies be exhausted is based on the doctrine that in providing for a remedy before an administrative agency, every opportunity must be given to the agency to resolve the matter and to exhaust all opportunities for a resolution under the given remedy before bringing an action in, or resorting to, the courts of justice. Where Congress has not clearly required exhaustion, sound judicial discretion governs, guided by congressional intent.</p> <p> <b>By disallowing reconsideration of the VA's decision, Section 7, Rule XIX of DO 40-03 and Section 7 of the 2005 Procedural Guidelines went directly against the legislative intent behind Article 262-A of the Labor Code. These rules deny the VA the chance to correct himself and compel the courts of justice to prematurely intervene with the action of an administrative agency entrusted with the adjudication of controversies coming under its special knowledge, training and specific field of expertise.</b> In this era of clogged court dockets, the need for specialized administrative agencies with the special knowledge, experience and capability to hear and determine promptly disputes on technical matters or intricate questions of facts, subject to judicial review, is indispensable. In <i>Industrial Enterprises, Inc. v. Court of Appeals</i>, we ruled that relief must first be obtained in an administrative proceeding before a remedy will be supplied by the courts even though the matter is within the proper jurisdiction of a court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> Hence, the 10-day period stated in Article 276 should be understood as the period within which the party adversely affected by the ruling of the Voluntary Arbitrators or Panel of Arbitrators may file a motion for reconsideration. Only after the resolution of the motion for reconsideration may the aggrieved party appeal to the CA by filing the petition for review under Rule 43 of the <i>Rules of Court</i> within 15 days from notice pursuant to Section 4 of Rule 43.</p><p> The Court notes that despite the clarification made in <em>Teng v. Pagahac</em>, the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) and the National Conciliation and Mediation Board (NCMB) have not revised or amended the <i>Revised Procedural Guidelines in the Conduct of Voluntary Arbitration Proceedings</i> insofar as its Section 7 of Rule VII<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> is concerned. This inaction has obviously sown confusion, particularly in regard to the filing of the motion for reconsideration as a condition precedent to the filing of the petition for review in the CA. Consequently, we need to direct the DOLE and the NCMB to cause the revision or amendment of Section 7 of Rule VII of the <em>Revised Procedural Guidelines in the Conduct of Voluntary Arbitration Proceedings</em> in order to allow the filing of motions for reconsideration in line with Article 276 of the <em>Labor Code</em>. </p><p align="center"> <b>II <i><br> Certiorari</i> does not lie in assailing<br> the CA's denial of a motion to dismiss</b> </p><p> Generally, the denial of a motion to dismiss cannot be assailed by petition for <em>certiorari</em>. As we indicated in <i>Biñan Rural Bank v. Carlos</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> The denial of a motion to dismiss generally cannot be questioned in a special civil action for <em>certiorari</em>, as this remedy is designed to correct only errors of jurisdiction and not errors of judgment. Neither can a denial of a motion to dismiss be the subject of an appeal which is available only after a judgment or order on the merits has been rendered. Only when the denial of the motion to dismiss is tainted with grave abuse of discretion can the grant of the extraordinary remedy of <em>certiorari</em> be justified. </p> </blockquote> <p> Although it admits being aware of this rule, the petitioner insists on the propriety of its petition for <em>certiorari</em> based on its belief that the CA had gravely abused its discretion in assuming jurisdiction over the respondents' petition. It argues that the decision rendered by Voluntary Arbitrator Bacungan had already become final pursuant to Article 276 of the <em>Labor Code</em>, and, accordingly, the CA could no longer exercise its appellate jurisdiction. </p><p> The petitioner is mistaken.</p><p> Grave abuse of discretion means either that the judicial or quasi-judicial power was exercised in an arbitrary or despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility, or that the respondent judge, tribunal or board evaded a positive duty, or virtually refused to perform the duty enjoined or to act in contemplation of law, such as when such judge, tribunal or board exercising judicial or quasi-judicial powers acted in a capricious or whimsical manner as to be equivalent to lack of jurisdiction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup></p><p> Here, the CA did not act arbitrarily in denying the petitioner's <em>Motion to Dismiss</em>. It correctly noted that <i>Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc. Sales Force Union-PTGWO-Balais v. Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc</i>. did not make a definitive ruling on the correct reglementary period for the filing of the petition for review. Given the varying applications of the periods defined in Article 276 and Section 4 of Rule 43, the CA could not be objectively held to be guilty of grave abuse of discretion in applying the equitable rule on construction in favor of labor. To be underscored is that the underlying aim for the requirement of strict adherence to procedural rules, particularly on appeals, should always be the prevention of needless delays that could enable the unscrupulous employers to wear out the efforts and meager resources of their workers to the point that the latter would be constrained to settle for less than what were due to them.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> </p><p> <b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the Court <b>DISMISSES</b> the unmeritorious petition for <em>certiorari</em>; <b>AFFIRMS</b> the decision promulgated on December 15, 2008 by the Court of Appeals; and <b>DIRECTS</b> the Department of Labor and Employment and the National Conciliation and Mediation Board to revise or amend the <em>Revised Procedural Guidelines in the Conduct of Voluntary Arbitration Proceedings</em> to reflect the foregoing ruling herein. </p><p> No pronouncement on costs of suit.</p><p> <b>SO ORDERED.</b></p><p> <i>Leonardo-De Castro, C.J., Carpio, Peralta, Del Castillo, Perlas-Bernabe , Leonen, Jardeleza, Caguioa, Tijam, A.
