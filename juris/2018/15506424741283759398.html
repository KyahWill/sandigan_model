  </blockquote>
  <p> The respondent, Cagayan Electric Power &amp; Light Co., Inc. 
(CEPALCO) is a public utility engaged in the distribution of electric 
power and the owner of an estimated 17,000 utility poles erected within 
Cagayan de Oro City. The ordinance entailed that the electricity 
distributor would have to pay an annual Mayor's Permit Fee of 
P8,500,000.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>
  </p><p> CEPALCO thus filed a Petition for Declaratory Relief with 
Damages &amp; Prayer for Temporary Restraining Order &amp; Preliminary 
Injunction<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> dated September
 30, 2005 before the Cagayan RTC assailing the ordinance's validity. 
CEPALCO contended that the imposition, in the guise of police power, was
 unlawful for violating the fundamental principle that fees, charges, 
and other impositions shall not be unjust, excessive, oppressive, or 
confiscatory.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> 
Additionally, CEPALCO argued that, assuming the imposition was a valid 
regulatory fee, it violated the legislative franchise that specifically 
exempted the electricity distributor from taxes or fees assessed by 
Cagayan de Oro City.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>
  </p><p> On November 7, 2005, the city filed its Answer with Affirmative/Special Defenses and Compulsory Counterclaim.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>
 It countered that the ordinance was a valid exercise of its powers 
vested by the applicable provisions of the Constitution, the Local 
Government Code, and other laws. Also, the city maintained that Section 9
 of CEPALCO's legislative franchise expressly subjected the latter to 
taxes, duties, fees, or charges.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> 
  </p><p>On May 5, 2006, pending the determination of the ordinance's validity, the Cagayan RTC issued a writ of preliminary injunction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> 
  </p><p align="center"><b>The RTC's Ruling</b>
  </p><p> On February 8, 2008, the Cagayan RTC issued a Resolution 
dismissing the petition for declaratory relief due to CEPALCO's failure 
to exhaust administrative remedies. The <i>fallo</i> reads:  
  </p><blockquote>
    <p>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Court hereby dismissed the 
petition for failure of petitioner CEPALCO to exhaust administrative 
remedies pursuant to Sec. 187, RA 7160 and for being time-barred under 
the circumstances. The writ of preliminary injunction issued on May 5, 
2006 is hereby dissolved. </p>
    <p>SO ORDERED. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> The Cagayan RTC stated that it found the tax excessive, but could 
not interfere with the decision-making of the government agency 
concerned. It declared that the issue on excessiveness was a question 
best addressed to the sound discretion of the city council of Cagayan de
 Oro. Nonetheless, for CEPALCO's neglect to appeal the ordinance to the 
Secretary of Justice, the trial court dismissed the case and ruled that 
the electricity distributor failed to exhaust administrative remedies.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> 
  </p><p> Aggrieved, CEPALCO elevated the case to the CA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> 
  </p><p align="center"><b>The CA's Ruling</b>   
  </p><p>On June 10, 2015, the CA promulgated the herein assailed decision granting CEPALCO's appeal. The dispositive portion reads:   
  </p><blockquote>
    <p><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Appeal is <b>GRANTED</b>. The assailed Resolution dated February 8, 2008 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 17, Cagayan de Oro City is hereby <b>REVERSED</b> and <b>SET ASIDE</b>. The City Ordinance No. 9527-2005 is declared void. </p>
    <p><b>SO ORDERED.</b>
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> The CA declared the ordinance void for being exorbitant and 
unreasonable. It held that, since the city failed to include a 
discussion on how the members of the city council arrived at the amount 
of P500.00 per pole, CEPALCO could not be appraised of the logistics of 
and reasons behind the imposition. According to the CA, the city should 
have explained how the sum would be accounted for, stating the probable 
expenses of regulating and inspecting each of the poles.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>
 The appellate court additionally held that the doctrine of exhaustion 
of administrative remedies was inapplicable considering the case 
involved a regulatory fee and not a tax measure.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></p><p> The foregoing ultimately led to the filing of the instant petition before this Court.</p><p align="center"> <b>The Issues</b> 
  </p><p> In its petition, the petitioner raises issues that may be 
summed up as: (1) whether or not CEPALCO should have exhausted 
administrative remedies by challenging Ordinance No. 9527-2005 before 
the Secretary of Justice prior to instituting the present action; and 
(2) whether or not the amount of the Mayor's Permit Fee is excessive, 
unreasonable, and exorbitant.</p><p align="center"> <b>This Court's Ruling</b> 
  </p><p> The petition is partly meritorious. </p><p> Anent the issue on
 exhaustion of administrative remedies, petitioner argued that CEPALCO 
should have raised the ordinance's alleged excessiveness before the 
Secretary of Justice because it imposes a tax.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>
 Hence, the city maintained that the case should have been dismissed at 
the first instance for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> 
  </p><p>CEPALCO countered that the doctrine of exhaustion of 
administrative remedies applies only to taxes and other revenue 
measures, and not to regulatory fees.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> 
  </p><p>Before delving into the parties' arguments, the Court deems it necessary to ascertain the nature of the Mayor's Permit Fee. 
  </p><p>Unlike the national government, local government units have no inherent power to tax.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> They merely derive the power from Article X, Section 5 of the 1987 Constitution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>
 Consistent with this provision, the Local Government Code was enacted 
to give each local government unit the power to create its own sources 
of revenue and to levy taxes, fees, and charges subject to statutory 
guidelines and limitations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>   
  </p><p>The term "taxes" has been defined by case law as "the enforced 
proportional contributions from persons and property levied by the state
 <strong>for the support of government and for all public needs</strong>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>" While, under the Local Government Code, a "fee" is defined as "any charge fixed by law or ordinance<strong> for the regulation or inspection of a business or activity</strong>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>"  
  </p><p> From the foregoing jurisprudential and statutory definitions, it can be gleaned that the <b>purpose of an imposition will determine its nature as either a tax or a fee</b>.
 If the purpose is primarily revenue, or if revenue is at least one of 
the real and substantial purposes, then the exaction is properly 
classified as an exercise of the power to tax.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>
 On the other hand, if the purpose is primarily to regulate, then it is 
deemed an exercise of police power in the form of a fee, even though 
revenue is incidentally generated. <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>
 Stated otherwise, if generation of revenue is the primary purpose, the 
imposition is a tax but, if regulation is the primary purpose, the 
imposition is properly categorized as a regulatory fee.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>  
  </p><p> In <i>Smart Communications, Inc. v. Municipality of Malvar</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>
 the Municipality of Malvar enacted Ordinance No. 18, entitled "An 
Ordinance Regulating the Establishment of Special Projects." By reason 
of the ordinance, Smart was assessed P389,950.00 on a telecommunications
 tower that it erected within the municipality. This prompted Smart to 
challenge the validity of the ordinance and the consequent assessment 
before the RTC of Batangas. When the case reached the Court, one of the 
issues raised was: <i>whether the ordinance imposed a tax or a fee</i>. 
The Court was able to address the issue after a simple reading of the 
ordinance's whereas clauses, which revealed that the primary purpose of 
the ordinance was to regulate cell sites or telecommunications towers, 
including Smart's. Thus, since the whereas clauses showed that the 
ordinance served a regulatory purpose, it was ruled that the case 
involved a fee and not a tax.
  </p><p> In the case at bar, the CA, adhering to the course of action taken in <i>Smart Communications</i>, concluded that the Mayor's Permit Fee serves a regulatory purpose.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> The appellate court properly took into account the whereas clauses of the ordinance, which read: 
  </p><blockquote>
    <p><i>Whereas</i>, electric and/or telecommunication poles, posts and towers are sprouting everywhere in the City; </p>
    <p><i>Whereas</i>, such poles or posts pose hazard to traffic and 
safety of the public if they are not well maintained, and even as 
nuisance to the panorama or skyline of the City; </p>
    <p><i>Whereas</i>, it is for this reason that the City Government <b><u>imposes some form of regulation</u></b> thereon; 
    </p>
    <p> <i>Whereas</i>, the City Government under the Local Government 
Code is vested with authority to impose regulatory fees and charges for 
activities and undertakings being done in the City; (Emphasis and 
underscoring supplied)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> A cursory reading of the whereas clauses makes it is apparent that <b>the purpose of the ordinance is to regulate the construction and maintenance of electric and telecommunications posts</b> erected within Cagayan de Oro City.</p><p>
 On account of the foregoing, it is clear that the ordinance in this 
case serves a regulatory purpose and is, hence, an exercise of police 
power. Nowhere in the text of the ordinance is it shown that it was 
enacted to raise revenue. On the contrary, the third whereas clause 
expressly states the city's need to impose some form of regulation on 
the construction of electric and telecommunications poles. As in <i>Smart Communications</i>,
 the fee is not imposed on the structure itself, but on the activity 
subject of government regulation, which is the installation and 
establishment of utility posts. Thus, it can be concluded without 
argument that <b>the ordinance imposes a fee since it was enacted 
pursuant to the city's police power and serves to regulate, not to raise
 revenue</b>. </p><p> Proceeding to the question of non-exhaustion, the Court rules that <b>ordinances that impose regulatory fees do not need to be challenged before the Secretary of Justice</b>. </p><p>
 To be sure, this is not a novel issue. Section 187 of the Local 
Government Code, which outlines the administrative procedure for 
questioning the constitutionality or legality of a tax ordinance or 
revenue measure, does not find application in cases where the imposition
 is in the nature of a regulatory fee.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>
 The provision requires that an appeal of a tax ordinance or revenue 
measure should be made to the Secretary of Justice within thirty (30) 
days from the effectivity of the ordinance,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> <em>viz</em>: 
  </p><blockquote>
    <p> <b>Section 187.</b> <i>Procedure for Approval and Effectivity of Tax, Ordinances and Revenue Measures; Mandatory Public Hearings</i>.
 - The procedure for approval of local tax ordinances and revenue 
measures shall be in accordance with the provisions of this Code: <i>Provided</i>, That public hearings shall be conducted for the purpose prior to the enactment thereof: <i>Provided, further</i>, <b><u>That
 any question on the constitutionality or legality of tax ordinances or 
revenue measures may be raised on appeal within thirty (30) days from 
the effectivity thereof to the Secretary of Justice</u></b> who shall 
render a decision within sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of the
 appeal x x x. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> It can be gleaned from the provision that<b> review by the 
Secretary of Justice is mandatory only when what is being questioned is a
 tax ordinance or revenue measure. Section 187 does not require the same
 from parties who assail ordinances imposing regulatory fees</b>. Stated
 otherwise, the procedure found in Section 187 must be followed when an 
ordinance imposes a tax; the institution of an action in court without 
complying with the requirements of the provision will lead to the 
dismissal of the case on the ground of non-exhaustion of administrative 
remedies.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> However, when an
 ordinance imposes a fee, direct recourse to the courts may be had 
without prior protest before the Secretary of Justice. Simply put, fees 
are not subject to the procedure outlined under Section 187. 
  </p><p>CEPALCO additionally argued that, assuming that the ordinance 
does not impose a tax, it is still a revenue measure, which Section 187 
expressly subjects to the exhaustion doctrine.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>
  </p><p> The argument is speculative.   
  </p><p>For clarity, that portion of Section 187 referred to by CEPALCO, as quoted above, states:   
  </p><blockquote>
    <p>x x x <i>Provided, further</i>, That any question on the constitutionality or legality of <b><u>tax ordinances or revenue measures</u></b>
 may be raised on appeal within thirty (30) days from the effectivity 
thereof to the Secretary of Justice x x x (Emphasis and underscoring 
supplied) </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>To be consistent with the rule that the imposition's purpose determines whether it is a tax or a fee,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>
 the Court rules that the word "or," which the legislature placed in 
between the phrases "tax ordinances" and "revenue measures," should not 
be used in its regular disjunctive sense. 
  </p>
  <p> Ordinarily, the use of "or" connects a series of words or 
propositions indicating that the various members of the enumeration are 
to be taken separately.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> The term usually signifies disassociation and independence of one thing from each of the other things enumerated.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></p><p> However, jurisprudence has given the word another interpretation. In <i>Gonzales v. GJH Land, Inc.</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> the Court ruled: 
  </p><blockquote>
    <p> To clarify, the word "or" x x x was intentionally used by the 
legislature to particularize that [an antecedent phrase is the 
equivalent of a subsequent phrase]. This interpretation is supported by <em>San Miguel Corp. v. Municipal Council</em>, wherein the Court held that :</p>
    <p> The word "or" may be used as the equivalent of "that is to say" 
and gives that which precedes it the same significance as that which 
follows it. It is not always disjunctive and is sometimes interpretative
 or expository of the preceding word.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> (Citations omitted)</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> Hence, the word "or" in Section 187 should be used in a non­ 
disjunctive sense. It should be construed in a way that the phrase 
"revenue measures" is read as another way of expressing "tax 
ordinances." Both refer to one and the same thing. After all, the Court 
has consistently held that a tax ordinance is primarily designed to 
raise revenue.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> </p>
  <p>Considering the foregoing, there was no procedural barrier 
preventing CEPALCO from instituting the instant petition for declaratory
 relief before the RTC at the first instance.</p>
  <p> On the issue of the ordinance's substantive validity, petitioner 
maintained that the CA erred when it declared the fee exorbitant and 
unreasonable. The city posited that CEPALCO had the burden to prove the 
unreasonableness of the exaction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>
 Since the electricity distributor failed to present any evidence on the
 propriety of the amount, the city continued, the ordinance should be 
upheld, as it enjoys the presumption of validity.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> </p>
  <p>CEPALCO, on the other hand, submitted that the CA correctly 
declared the ordinance void, the amount of the Mayor's Permit Fee being 
unjust, excessive, oppressive, and confiscatory.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>
 Since it owns 17,000 poles, more or less, the amount it will have to 
pay annually as its Mayor's Permit Fee alone will reach P8,500,000.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>
 This, as argued by the electricity distributor, is by all reasonable 
and judicious standards shockingly unconscionable considering it is 
substantially in excess of the costs of regulation and inspection.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> </p>
  <p>The city's contention is impressed with merit.</p>
  <p> At the outset, it is apt to state that the Court takes judicial 
notice of the practice of regulating the construction and installation 
of utility poles, which are not only eyesores when ill-maintained but, 
just as well, pose a serious threat to the safety of the general public.
 Local governments such as the petitioner, as well as the cities of 
Bacoor<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> and Angeles<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> and the Municipality of Kalibo,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>
 curb the indiscriminate erection and establishment of electricity and 
telecommunications poles by levying regulatory fees from service 
providers that use such poles as an indispensable part of their 
business. These fees are imposed pursuant to the delegated legislative 
power of local government units, exercised through duly enacted 
ordinances.</p>
  <p> Few things are more established in this jurisdiction than the 
requisites of a valid ordinance. In order for an ordinance to be valid 
in substance, it (1) must not contravene the Constitution or any 
statute; (2) must not be unfair or oppressive; (3) must not be partial 
or discriminatory; (4) must not prohibit, but may regulate trade; (5) 
must be general and consistent with public policy; and (6) must not be 
unreasonable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup></p><p> Equally established, however, is the presumption of validity in favor of all laws, which extends to ordinances.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> 
  </p><p>Nonetheless, the presumption, being just that, may be set aside
 when invalidity or unreasonableness (1) appears on the face of the 
ordinance; or (2) is established by proper evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup>
  </p><p> In <em>Balacuit v. Court of First Instance</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup>
  the Court, without examining matters of fact, struck down a Butuan 
City ordinance requiring theaters to sell tickets to children (between 
seven [7] and twelve [12] years of age) at half price. In that case, the ordinance was merely examined under the lens of police power, <em>sans</em>
 the need to take into account facts showing invalidity. The Court 
nullified the ordinance because, on its face, it offended the elementary
 tenets of due process.    
  </p><p> More recently, in <em>City of Manila v. Hon. Laguio, Jr</em>.,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup>
  the Court annulled an ordinance prohibiting the establishment of 
certain businesses such as clubs, parlors, and inns, which were 
considered "houses of ill­-repute." The ordinance was invalidated, <em>inter alia</em>,
 because it failed to meet the requisites for a valid exercise of police
 power, as it substantially curtailed property and personal rights of 
Manila's citizenry. Again, no evidence on extrinsic facts was needed to 
show the ordinance's invalidity; all the Court needed to do was analyze 
it in the light of the extent of a municipal corporation's police power 
and settled due process precepts. 
  
  </p><p> The ordinances in <em>Balacuit</em> and<em> Laguio, Jr.</em> 
served as prime examples of facially apparent invalidity. In those 
cases, the Court did not need to make any fact-based appraisals to reach
 the conclusion that, as a matter of law, the ordinances had to be 
struck down. Their provisions were merely scrutinized against settled 
jurisprudential doctrines on the police power of local government units;
 save for the ordinances themselves and the circumstances of their 
enactment, nothing needed to be proved. 
  </p><p> On the other hand, in <em>Morcoin Co., Ltd. v. City of Manila</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup>
 an ordinance that sought to regulate coin-operated apparatuses, such as
 juke boxes and pinball machines, was held to be invalid only after an 
examination of proof showing unreasonableness. The Court in that case 
struck down an ordinance, which imposed an annual license fee of P300.00
 on every coin-operated contraption, after a juke box operator was able 
to show that his machines had a yearly income of only around P211.00. It
 was held that such a showing of excessiveness invariably warranted the 
nullification of the ordinance. 
  </p><p> Unlike in <i>Balacuit</i> and <i>Laguio, Jr</i>., the alleged 
invalidity of the ordinance involved here is not apparent on its face. 
CEPALCO has not shown that the Mayor's Permit Fee ostensibly contravenes
 any constitutional or statutory provision or settled public policy, or 
is <em>per se</em> unreasonable, oppressive, discriminatory, or in 
restraint of trade. Hence, it is only logical that the Court adheres to 
the methodology used in <em>Morcoin</em>, and thus evaluate the 
ordinance in the light of the evidence presented by CEPALCO to reach a 
conclusive determination of the fee's excessiveness. 
  </p><p> CEPALCO contended that the ordinance was null and void due to 
the unjust, excessive, and confiscatory nature of the Mayor's Permit 
Fee.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> In line with this 
contention, the electricity distributor now bears the burden of showing 
that the ordinance violates Sections 130, 147, and 186 of the Local 
Government Code. </p><p> Section 130 lays down several underlying axioms
 that must be adhered to by all fiscal impositions levied by municipal 
corporations, thus: 
  </p><blockquote>
    <p> <b>Section 130. </b><i>Fundamental Principles</i>. - The 
following fundamental principles shall govern the exercise of the taxing
 and other revenue-raising powers of local government units: </p>
    <p align="center">x x x x</p>
    <p> (b) Taxes, fees, charges and other impositions shall:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p> (1) be equitable and based as far as practicable on the taxpayer's ability to pay;</p>
      <p> (2) be levied and collected only for public purposes; </p>
      <p>(3) <b><u>not be unjust, excessive, oppressive, or confiscatory</u></b>; </p>
      <p>(4) not be contrary to law, public policy, national economic 
policy,	or in the restraint	of trade; (Emphasis and underscoring 
supplied) x x x x</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p> The tenor of paragraph (b) (3) of Section 130 is reiterated in Section 186, which reads:
  </p><blockquote>
    <p> <b>Section 186.</b> <i>Power To Levy Other Taxes, Fees or Charges.</i>
 - Local government units may exercise the power to levy taxes, fees or 
charges on any base or subject not otherwise specifically enumerated 
herein or taxed under the provisions of the National Internal Revenue 
Code, as amended, or other applicable laws: <i>Provided</i>, That the <b><u>taxes, fees, or charges shall not be unjust, excessive, oppressive, confiscatory or contrary to declared national policy</u></b> x x x. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied) </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> On the other hand, Section 147, when read in conjunction with Section 151,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> places a general limitation on the amount levied by regulatory fees imposed by cities, thus: 
  </p><blockquote>
    <p> <b>Section 147.</b> <i>Fees and Charges</i>. - The municipality 
may impose and collect such reasonable fees and charges on business and 
occupation and, except as reserved to the province in Section 139 of 
this Code, on the practice of any profession or calling, <b><u>commensurate with the cost of regulation, inspection and licensing</u></b>
 before any person may engage in such business or occupation, or 
practice such profession or calling. (Emphasis and underscoring 
supplied) </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> It can be gleaned from the foregoing that if a regulatory fee 
produces revenue in excess of the cost of the regulation, inspection, 
and licensing, it will be considered excessive, and hence fail the test 
of judicial scrutiny.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> 
  </p><p>Thus, the Court is faced with the question:  
  </p><p> <i>Whether or not the amount of P500.00 collected annually on a
 per post basis violated Sec. 147 of the Local Government Code, which 
provides that fees must be commensurate with the cost of regulation, 
inspection, and licensing</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup>
  </p>
  <p> For CEPALCO's failure to establish excessiveness, the Court rules 
in the negative. A judicious perusal of the record fails to reveal 
anything definitively showing the ordinance’s unreasonable, excessive, 
oppressive, or confiscatory nature; hence, because it enjoys the 
presumption of validity, the Court is constrained to reverse the 
decision of the CA. </p><p> The presumption of validity is a corollary 
of the presumption of constitutionality, a legal theory of common-law 
origin developed by courts to deal with cases challenging the 
constitutionality of statutes.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> </p><p>
 The presumption of constitutionality, in its most basic sense, only 
means that courts, in passing upon the validity of a law, will afford 
some deference to the statute and charge the party assailing it with the
 burden of showing that the act is incompatible with the constitution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> The doctrine comes into operation when a party comes to court praying that a law be set aside for being unconstitutional.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> In effect, it places a heavy burden on the act's assailant to prove invalidity beyond reasonable doubt;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> it commands the clearest showing of a constitutional infraction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup>
 Thus, before a law may be stn1ck down as unconstitutional, courts must 
be certain that there exists a clear and unequivocal breach of the 
constitution, and not one that is speculative or argumentative.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> To doubt, it has been said, is to sustain.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> </p><p> The United States Supreme Court expressed the rationale for the presumption in <i>Ogden v. Saunders</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> thus: "<b>it
 is but a decent respect due to the wisdom, the integrity, and the 
patriotism of the legislative body by which any law is passed to presume
 in favor of its validity</b> x x x.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup>”</p><p>
 For the same reason, the presumption extends to legislative acts of 
local governments, as well. Thus, ordinances too are presumed 
constitutional,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> and, in 
addition, they are also presumed consistent with the law. This is 
necessary because one of the requisites of a valid ordinance is that it 
does not contravene any statute.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> An ordinance that is incompatible with the law is <i>ultra vires</i> and hence null and void.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup>
 To this end, when an action assailing an ordinance is brought before a 
court, the judge must, as a rule, presume that the ordinance is valid 
and therefore charge the plaintiff with the burden of showing otherwise.
 In <i>U.S. v. Salaveria</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> the Court, speaking through Justice Malcolm, laid down the basis for the presumption in this wise:
  </p><blockquote>
    <p> The presumption is all in favor of validity x x x. The action of
 the elected representatives of the people cannot be lightly set aside. 
The councilors must, in the very nature of things, be familiar with the 
necessities of their particular municipality and with all the facts and 
circumstances which surround the subject and necessitate action. The 
local legislative body, by enacting the ordinance, has in effect given 
notice that the regulations are essential to the well-being of the 
people x x x.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> In the case at bar, the CA annulled Ordinance No. 9527-2005 for 
being exorbitant, unreasonable, and for lacking a basis. The appellate 
court held that the ordinance's enactment was tainted with legal 
infirmities. According to the CA, the city council should not have 
enacted the ordinance without divulging the method it used to arrive at 
the amount of the Mayor's Permit Fee. The city should have justified the
 ordinance by making known the parameters, guidelines, and computations 
it employed to set the fee at P500.00. In addition, it was ruled that 
the city was bound to explain how it would account for the proceeds 
collected by reason of the ordinance thus stating the probable expenses 
for the regulation and inspection of utility poles. This, the CA held, 
was necessary to inform electricity distributors like CEPALCO of the 
reasons of the fee. On this logic, the appellate court struck down the 
ordinance.
  </p><p> By holding that the city council should have explained the 
reasons for the ordinance's enactment, the CA effectively reversed the 
presumption of validity. In essence, the appellate court shifted the 
burden to Cagayan de Oro to show that the ordinance was reasonable and 
that the amount of the Mayor's Permit Fee was not excessive. Verily, no 
law requires that local governments justify the ordinances they pass by 
setting forth the grounds for their enactment. Thus, the CA's 
nullification of the ordinance was done in a manner contrary to 
principles established in jurisprudence. </p><p> After a meticulous scrutiny of the records, the Court finds that, in the proceedings <i>a quo</i>,
 the ordinance was never shown to be violative of the rule that fees 
must be commensurate with the cost of regulation, inspection, and 
licensing. </p><p> <b>A review of the proceedings before the trial court
 shows that the allegation of the fee's unreasonableness was never 
substantiated</b>. In fact, the memorandum<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup>
 CEPALCO filed before the trial court is bereft of any allegations 
showing the impropriety of the amount exacted by the ordinance. Besides 
the self-serving statement that the sum of P500.00 was disproportionate 
to the cost of regulation and inspection of utility poles, CEPALCO 
showed nothing tending to prove the fee's excessiveness. The electricity
 distributor simply maintained that the amount was confiscatory,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup>
 and prayed that the ordinance be struck down for being unlawful and 
unjustified. The RTC, for its part, never ruled that the ordinance was 
void because the amount of the Mayor's Permit Fee was excessive. 
Instead, it dismissed the case for failure to exhaust administrative 
remedies.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> Moreover, according to the trial court, the city had the discretion to determine the amount of the exaction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup></p><p> <b>So, too, the record is devoid of any indication that the fee's excessiveness was established on appeal.</b>
 CEPALCO never pointed out the particulars of the fee's 
unreasonableness. While it stated that the ordinance only ordered the 
inspection and inventory of electric poles erected in the city,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup>
 it never even bothered to allege, much less prove, the cost of such 
inspection and inventory. It merely argued that the simple and 
repetitive work that would be undertaken by reason of the ordinance 
would require minimal expenses on the city's part.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup>
 The CA agreed. However, the appellate court never stated why it found 
the amount excessive. Instead, as mentioned earlier, the CA simply held 
that the city should have discussed the amount's basis so that public 
utility companies would be informed of the rationale of the fee's 
imposition and how the funds levied by the ordinance would be accounted 
for.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup></p><p> Being a public
 utility engaged in the distribution of electricity and the owner of 
around 17,000 poles, CEPALCO could have certainly adduced evidence on 
maintenance, inspection, and inventory expenses. As an electricity 
distributor, CEPALCO is charged with keeping its utility posts 
well-preserved and in good condition. Necessarily, the cost of 
maintaining and inspecting such posts is well within its cognizance. 
Clearly, it had proof of such costs in its possession. Thus, CEPALCO 
could have easily showed that the annual exaction of P500.00 per post 
was in excess of the cost of regulation and, therefore, fee is excessive
 and unreasonable. </p><p> However, CEPALCO failed to do so. It simply 
maintained that the annual payment of P8,500,000.00 was, "by any fairly 
judicious standards, shocking to the conscience of man.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup>"
 The electricity distributor could have compared the fee with the annual
 costs it incurs on the preservation and inventory of its posts or, as 
in <em>Morcoin</em>, showed that the annual fee imposed on a single pole
 was greater than the same pole's yearly income. This would have	readily
 shown the fee's alleged excessiveness. The record, nevertheless, fails 
to reveal that the imposition was not commensurate with the actual cost 
of regulation and inspection. Besides CEPALCO's bare, self-serving, and 
unsubstantiated allegations, nothing even remotely suggests the fee's 
excessiveness. 
  </p><p> <b>Without evidence indicating that the amount of the Mayor's 
Permit Fee is disproportionate to the cost of regulation, inspection, 
and licensing of utility poles located in Cagayan de Oro City, the Court
 cannot agree with the CA's invalidation of the ordinance.</b> </p><p> 
Local governments are allowed wide discretion in determining the rates 
of imposable fees. In the absence of proof of unreasonableness, courts 
are bound to respect the judgment of the local authorities. Any undue 
interference with their sound discretion will imperatively warrant 
review and correction. </p><p> In this case, as the party assailing the 
ordinance, it was CEPALCO's responsibility to prove the amount's 
excessiveness; it had the burden to show that the fee was not 
commensurate with the cost of regulation, inspection, and licensing. 
Nevertheless, for the reasons discussed above, it failed to dismantle 
the presumption of validity because it never established that the city 
council abused its discretion in setting the amount of the fee at 
P500.00. </p><p> Thus, the CA erred in declaring the ordinance invalid. 
Courts, as a rule, must refrain from interfering with legislative acts, 
lest they stray into the realm of policy decision-making.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> The public interest is best served by allowing the political processes to operate without undue interference.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> 
  </p><p>On a final note, the Court deems it appropriate to reiterate its ruling in <i>Victorias Milling Co., Inc. v. Municipality of Victorias</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> to wit: </p><p> </p><blockquote>An ordinance carries with it the presumption of validity. The 
question of reasonableness though is open to judicial inquiry. Much 
should be left thus to the discretion of municipal authorities. Courts 
will go slow in writing off an ordinance as unreasonable unless the 
amount is so excessive as to be prohibitive, arbitrary, unreasonable, 
oppressive, or confiscatory. x x x<p></p><p></p></blockquote> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>. The Decision of the Court of Appeals dated June 10, 2015 in CA-G.R.
