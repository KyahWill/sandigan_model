The CTA erroneously applied the rules meant for distilled spirits to a completely different and tax-exempt article (denatured alcohol). Section 22<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> of RR No. 3-2006 applies to a distiller and to distilled spirits not to denatured alcohol.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Avon was not engaged in the business of producing distilled spirits. Hence, the denatured alcohol it purchased and stored should continue to be exempted from excise tax unless it is reprocessed into a distilled spirit. Thus, there was no legal basis to arbitrarily extend its application to denatured alcohol and to Avon, who is not a distiller.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></p><p> Further, Avon contended that the CTA erred in not applying the case of <i>La Tondeña Inc., v. Collector of Internal Revenue, et. al.</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> where this Court held that "until the spirits requiring rectification has been converted into a finished product, no specific tax shall be due from the rectifier receiving them." Thus, "as long as the alcohol requires rectification, all unintentional, casual, unavoidable and/or natural losses prior to the conversion into some finished product, should not be subject to specific tax."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> As such, the shortages of 21,163.48 liters of denatured alcohol that evaporated in transit from January to December 2008, which were not subject to rectification nor were converted to a finished product, should not be subject to an excise tax.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></p><p> Avon also claimed that Condition No. 3<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> contained in Avon's permit to Buy/Use Denatured Alcohol is contrary to the tax exemption as provided under Section 134 of the NIRC. The BIR cannot simply override the provision of the NIRC and arrogate upon itself the authority to impose the excise tax on distilled spirits on a tax-exempt article that evaporated prior to its conversion to a distilled or reprocessed spirit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> </p><p align="center"><b><u>Respondent's contentions</u></b> </p><p> The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), on behalf of the CIR, alleged that while it was not contested that the article subject of the case is denatured alcohol, Avon failed to prove that the same is exempted from excise tax. Avon failed to establish that the denatured alcohol in question was not less than 90% absolute alcohol to qualify exemption under Section 134 of the NIRC. As such, Section 22 of RR No. 3-2006 as to losses on distilled spirits is applicable in the present case. </p><p align="center"><b>The Court's ruling</b> </p><p> <b><i>The petition is impressed with merit.</i></b> </p><p>Section 129 of the NIRC provides that <i>excise taxes apply to goods manufactured or produced in the Philippines for domestic sales or consumption or for any other disposition and to things imported</i>. </p><p>As held in <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Pilipinas Shell Petroleum Corporation</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> excise tax attaches upon goods manufactured or produced in the Philippines as soon as its existence, thus: </p><blockquote> <p> The transformation undergone by the term "excise tax" from its traditional concept up to its current definition in our <u>Tax Code</u> was explained in the case of <em>Petron Corporation v. Tiangco</em>, as follows: </p> <blockquote> <p>Admittedly, the proffered definition of an excise tax as "a tax upon the performance, carrying on, or exercise of some right, privilege, activity, calling or occupation" derives from the compendium <i>American Jurisprudence</i>, popularly referred to as <i>Am Jur</i> and has been cited in previous decisions of this Court, including those cited by Petron itself. Such a definition would not have been inconsistent with previous incarnations of our Tax Code, such as the NIRC of 1939, as amended, or the NIRC of 1977 because in those laws the term "excise tax" was not used at all. In contrast, the nomenclature used in those prior laws in referring to taxes imposed on specific articles was "specific tax." Yet beginning with the National Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the term "excise taxes" was used and defined as applicable "<strong>to goods manufactured or produced in the Philippines... and to things imported.</strong>" (Underscoring ours) This definition was carried over into the present NIRC of 1997. Further, these two latest codes categorize two different kinds of excise taxes: "specific tax" which is imposed and based on weight or volume capacity or any other physical unit of measurement; and "<em>ad valorem tax</em>" which is imposed and based on the selling price or other specified value of the goods. In other words,<strong> the meaning of "excise tax" has undergone a transformation, morphing from the<em> Am Jur</em> definition to its current signification which is a tax on certain specified goods or articles.</strong></p> </blockquote> <p> The change in perspective brought forth by the use of the term "excise tax" in a different connotation was not lost on the departed author Jose Nolledo as he accorded divergent treatments in his 1973 and 1994 commentaries on our tax laws. Writing in 1973, and essentially alluding to the<em> Am Jur</em> definition of "excise tax," Nolledo observed:</p> <blockquote> <p> Are specific taxes, taxes on property or excise taxes –</p> <p> In the case of <i>Meralco v. Trinidad</i> (G.R.] 16738, 1925) it was held that specific taxes are property taxes, a ruling which seems to be erroneous. Specific taxes are truly excise taxes for the fact that the value of the property taxed is taken into account will not change the nature of the tax. It is correct to say that specific taxes are taxes on the privilege to import, manufacture and remove from storage certain articles specified by law.</p> </blockquote> <p> In contrast, after the tax code was amended to classify specific taxes as a subset of excise taxes, Nolledo, in his 1994 commentaries, wrote: </p> <blockquote> <p>1. <em>Excise taxes</em>, as used in the Tax Code, <strong>refers to taxes applicable to certain specified goods or articles manufactured or produced in the Philippines for domestic sale or consumption or for any other disposition and to things imported into the Philippines.</strong> <em>They are either specific or</em> ad valorem. (Underscoring ours) </p> <p>2. <em>Nature of excise taxes</em>. - They are imposed directly on certain specified goods, (<em>infra</em>) They are, therefore, taxes on property, (see <em>Medina vs. City of Baguio</em>, 91 Phil. 854.)</p> </blockquote> <p> A tax is not excise where it does not subject directly the product or goods to tax but indirectly as an incident to, or in connection with, the business to be taxed.</p> <p> In their 2004 commentaries, De Leon and De Leon restate the <em>Am Jur</em> definition of excise tax, and observe that the term is "synonymous with 'privilege tax' and [both terms] are often used interchangeably." At the same time, they offer a caveat that "[ejxcise tax, as [defined by <em>Am Jur</em>], is not to be confused with excise tax imposed [by the NIRC] on certain specified articles manufactured or produced in, or imported into, the Philippines, 'for domestic sale or consumption or for any other disposition.'"</p> <p> <b>It is evident that<em> Am Jur </em>aside, the current definition of an excise tax is that of a tax levied on a specific article, rather than one "upon the performance, carrying on, or the exercise of an activity.</b>" This current definition was already in place when the Code was enacted in 1991, and we can only presume that it was what the Congress had intended as it specified that local government units could not impose "excise taxes on articles enumerated under the [NIRC]." This prohibition must pertain to the same kind of excise taxes as imposed by the NIRC, and not those previously defined "excise taxes" which were not integrated or denominated as such in our present tax law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)</p> </blockquote> <p> Thus, under the current definition, the liability for excise tax on distilled spirit attaches upon its existence. Section 141<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>, as amended by Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9334, specifically provides that "<i>the tax shall attach to this substance as soon as it is in existence as such, whether it be subsequently separated as pure or impure spirits, or transformed into any other substance either in the process of original production or by any subsequent process</i>. "</p><p> Thus, as soon as the substance known as ethyl alcohol or ethanol has been processed, rectified or distilled, liability for payment of excise tax correspondingly attaches.</p><p> Rectification refers to the process of refining, purifying or enhancing the quality of ethyl alcohol only by distillation. Other processes intended to improve or enhance the quality of alcohol such as, but not limited to, aging, purification, filtration, carbon-treatments, etc., without distillation undertaken by the rectifier or rectifier-compounder itself, are deemed excluded under the term rectification.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> While distillation is the process of separating the components or substances from a liquid mixture by selective boiling and condensation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></p><p> Section 134 of the NIRC provides that denatured alcohol of not less than 180° degrees proof or ninety-percent (90%) absolute alcohol shall, when suitably denatured and rendered unfit for oral intake, be exempt from excise tax as provided for under Section 141 of the NIRC, thus: </p><blockquote> <p> SEC. 134.<i> Domestic Denatured Alcohol</i>. – <strong>Domestic alcohol of not less than one hundred eighty degrees (180°) proof (ninety percent (90%) absolute alcohol) shall, when suitably denatured and rendered unfit for oral intake, be exempt from the excise tax prescribed in Section 141</strong>:<em> Provided, however</em>, That such denatured alcohol shall be subject to tax under Section 106(A) of this Code: <em>Provided, further</em>, That if such alcohol is to be used for automotive power, it shall be taxed under Section 148(d) of this Code: <b><em>Provided, finally</em>, That any alcohol, previously rendered unfit for oral intake after denaturing but subsequently rendered fit for oral intake after undergoing fermentation, dilution, purification, mixture or any other similar process shall be taxed under Section 141 of this Code and such tax shall be paid by the person in possession of such reprocessed spirits</b>. (Emphasis ours) </p> </blockquote> <p> As stated above, denatured alcohol is completely exempted from excise tax, unless: 1) the denatured alcohol is less than 180° proof or 90% absolute alcohol, when suitably denatured<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> and rendered unfit for oral intake; or, when 2) the denatured alcohol previously unfit for oral intake underwent fermentation, dilution, purification, or other similar process, in both instances, the denatured alcohol will be subjected to excise tax. </p><p> Thus, to resolve the question of whether the evaporated denatured alcohol subject in the present case should be subjected to excise tax, We must determine whether the denatured alcohol is less than 180° proof or 90% absolute alcohol or, whether it underwent reprocess, rectification, fermentation, dilution, purification, or other similar process to render it fit for oral intake. </p><p> The CIR, claimed that Avon failed to sufficiently show that the evaporated denatured alcohol was more than 180° proof or 90% absolute alcohol in order for it to be exempted from excise tax. We rule in the negative. </p><p> As shown in the Formal Letter of Demand<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> of the BIR, it is specifically indicated that the denatured alcohol purchased by Avon, which evaporated during transit has 189° proof or 94.5% absolute alcohol. As such, in this aspect, the denatured alcohol is rendered unfit for oral intake, therefore exempt from excise tax. </p><p> To consider the CIR's allegation that Avon was not able to show that the denatured alcohol was more than 180° proof or 90% absolute alcohol was belied by the Formal Letter of Demand and the FDDA<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>. If the CIR, believed that the denatured alcohol purchased by Avon was not suitably denatured, then it could have rendered a deficiency assessment on the whole 1,309,000 liters of denatured alcohol purchased from January to December 2008, instead it only assessed excise tax on the 21,163.48 liters denatured alcohol that evaporated during transit, on the belief that losses of distilled spirits under Section 22 of RR No. 3-2006 can be equally applied to losses of denatured alcohol. </p><p> Having established that the denatured alcohol is more than 180° proof or 90% absolute alcohol, it now becomes necessary to determine whether the denatured alcohol purchased by Avon underwent rectification, distillation or other similar processes to render it fit for oral intake. </p><p> After scrutiny of the records, We hold that the denatured alcohol which evaporated during transit did not go through the process of distillation or rectification to a distilled spirits. As such, the liability for excise tax was not attached. To reiterate, excise tax is applied only if the denatured alcohol is reprocessed to a distilled spirit. </p><p> The CTA therefore erred when it applied Section 22<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> of RR No. 3-2006 on the denatured alcohol that evaporated during transit. As clearly provided, Section 22 deals with losses on distilled spirits. In this case, the evaporated denatured alcohol did not undergo any rectification, distillation, fermentation or other similar processes. It would be absurd to treat the 1,287,836.52 liters of denatured alcohol that Avon received as free of excise tax and to treat the shortages of 21,163.48 liters that evaporated during transit and did not undergo any rectification or distillation process as liable for excise tax, since the spring cannot rise higher than its source. </p><p> It is well-settled that tax statutes are construed <i>strictissimi juris</i> against the government.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> "Tax laws may not be extended by implication beyond the clear import of their language, nor their operation enlarged so as to embrace matters not specifically provided."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Here, CTA applied Section 22 of RR No. 3-2006 which treats losses on distilled spirit to losses on denatured alcohol without any legal basis. The CIR failed to present any proof that the denatured alcohol which evaporated was reprocessed to a distilled spirit. Neither did the CIR show any legal justification in applying Section 22 of RR No. 3-2006 to a completely different article. As such, the 21,163.48 liters of denatured alcohol which evaporated during transit are still exempt from excise tax without any specific law subjecting the same to excise tax. </p><p> <strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, premises considered, the Petition for Review on <em>Certiorari</em> is<strong> GRANTED</strong>.
