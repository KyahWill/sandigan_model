				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Government created policy based on the finding that the boundary payment scheme that has since determined the take-home pay of bus drivers and conductors has been proven inadequate in providing our public utility bus drivers and conductors a decent and living wage. It decided that this was the best approach to ensure that they get the economic and social welfare benefits that they deserve. This Court will not stand in its way. Policy questions are not what this Court decides. <p> This resolves an original action for certiorari and prohibition, assailing the constitutionality of the following: </p><p> First, the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) Department Order No. 118-12, otherwise known as the Rules and Regulations Governing the Employment and Working Conditions of Drivers and Conductors in the Public Utility Bus Transport Industry;</p><p> Second, all the implementing guidelines issued pursuant to Department Order No. 118-12, including the National Wages and Productivity Commission's Guidelines No. 1, series of 2012, otherwise known as the Operational Guidelines on Department Order No. 118-12; and</p><p> Finally, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) Memorandum Circular No. 2012-001, the subject of which is the Labor Standards Compliance Certificate.</p><p> Petitioners Provincial Bus Operators Association of the Philippines, Southern Luzon Bus Operators Association, Inc., Inter City Bus Operators Association, and City of San Jose Del Monte Bus Operators Association (collectively, petitioners) argue that Department Order No. 118-12 and Memorandum Circular No. 2012-001 violate the constitutional rights of public utility bus operators to due process of law, equal protection of the laws, and non-impairment of obligation of contracts.</p><p> The facts of the case are as follows: </p><p> To ensure road safety and address the risk-taking behavior of bus drivers as its declared objective, the LTFRB issued Memorandum Circular No. 2012-001<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> on January 4, 2012, requiring "all Public Utility Bus (PUB) operators ... to secure Labor Standards Compliance Certificates" under pain of revocation of their existing certificates of public convenience or denial of an application for a new certificate. Memorandum Circular No. 2012-001 more particularly provides: </p><blockquote> <p> MEMORANDUM CIRCULAR <br> NUMBER 2012-001 </p> <p align="center"> <b>SUBJECT: LABOR STANDARDS COMPLIANCE CERTIFICATE</b> </p> <p> This Memorandum Circular covers all Public Utility Bus (PUB) Operators and is being issued to ensure road safety through linking of labor standards compliance with franchise regulation. </p> <p> It is based on a DOLE rapid survey of bus drivers/conductors and operators on the working conditions and compensation schemes in the bus transport sector. The survey results, as validated in a series of focus group discussions with bus operators, drivers, government regulating agencies and experts from the academe in the fields of engineering and traffic psychology, indicate that the risk[-]taking behavior of drivers is associated with the lack of proper training on motor skills, safety and on traffic rules and regulations; poor health due to long work hours and exposure to health hazards and; lack of income security under a purely commission-based compensation scheme. The industry players also cited problems with the enforcement of traffic rules and regulations as well as the franchising and licensing systems. </p> <p> To strictly enforce this Memorandum Circular, the Board, thru the [Department of Transportation and Communication], shall strengthen cooperation and coordination with the Department of Labor and Employment. </p> <p align="center"> <b>Labor Standards Compliance Certificate</b></p> <p>To ensure compliance with the established standards for employment and the Board's policies on the promotion of road safety, all Public Utility Bus (PUB) operators are required to secure Labor Standards Compliance Certificates from the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE). </p> <p> The Certificate shall indicate compliance by the PUB operators with all relevant legislations on wages, labor standards, terms and conditions of employment, and such mandatory benefits as may now or in the future be provided under Philippine Labor Laws; Provided that –</p> <p align="center"> <b>Compensation Scheme</b> </p> <p> The compensation scheme set or approved by the DOLE shall cover the PUB drivers and conductors and shall adopt a part-fixed-part­ performance[-]based compensation system. The fixed component shall at no time be lower than the applicable minimum wage in the region. The performance[-]based component shall be based on the net income of the operator or bus company and on employee safety records such as that in regard to involvement in road accidents, commission of traffic violations, and observance of the elementary courtesies of the road.</p> <p> All PUB drivers and conductors shall be entitled to other mandatory compensation such as but not limited to overtime, night shift differential, rest day, holiday, birthday, and service incentive leave pays.</p> <p align="center"> <b>Hours of Work</b></p> <p> The number of working hours and rest periods of the drivers and conductors shall be determined taking into consideration the existing conditions, peculiarities and requirements of the transport industry. </p> <p align="center"> <b>Benefits</b></p> <p> All PUB drivers and conductors shall likewise be entitled to retirement benefits and to all mandatory social security benefits such as membership in the SSS, Philhealth and Pag-Ibig as specified by law. </p> <p align="center"> <b>Right to Self Organization</b> </p> <p> The right of the drivers and conductors to organize themselves to advance their interests and welfare shall be encouraged. It shall not in any way be abridged or diminished by way of any agreement or contract entered into in complying with this issuance or in obtaining the Labor Standards Compliance Certificate.</p> <p> Nothing herein shall be interpreted to mean as precluding the PUB operators and the drivers or conductors from entering into collective bargaining agreements granting them more rights, privileges and benefits. </p> <p> Company policies and practices, and collective bargaining agreements existing on effectivity of this issuance which grant more rights, privileges, and benefits to the drivers and conductors than herein provided shall continue to be in effect and shall not be diminished by virtue hereof or any subsequent policies or agreements. </p> <p> The exercise of the right to self-organization shall in no way adversely affect public safety and convenience. </p> <p align="center"> <b>Effectivity</b></p> <p> Failure on the part of the PUB operators to secure and submit to the Board by July 30, 2012 the required Labor Standards Certificates shall be a ground for the immediate cancellation or revocation of their franchises/[Certificates of Public Convenience]. </p> <p> No application for new [Certificates of Public Convenience] or renewal of existing [Certificates of Public Convenience] shall thereafter be granted by the Board without the required Certificates. </p> <p> This Memorandum Circular shall take effect fifteen (15) days following its publication in at least two (2) newspapers of general circulation. Let three (3) copies hereof be filed with the UP [L]aw Center pursuant to Presidential Memorandum Circular No. 11, dated 9 October 1992.</p> <p> SO ORDERED. </p> </blockquote> <p> Five (5) days later or on January 9, 2012, the DOLE issued Department Order No. 118-12, elaborating on the part-fixed-part-­performance-based compensation system referred to in the LTFRB Memorandum Circular No. 2012-001.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Department Order No. 118-12, among others, provides for the rule for computing the fixed and the performance-based component of a public utility bus driver's or conductor's wage.

The judicial power shall be vested in one Supreme Court and in such lower courts as may be established by law.</p> <p> Judicial power includes the duty of the courts of justice to settle actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable, and to determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the government. </p> </blockquote> <p> Our governmental structure rests on the principle of separation of powers. Under our constitutional order, the legislative branch enacts law, the executive branch implements the law, and the judiciary construes the law. In reality, however, the powers are not as strictly confined or delineated to each branch. "[T]he growing complexity of modem life, the multiplication of the subjects of governmental regulation, and the increased difficulty of administering the laws"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> require the delegation of powers traditionally belonging to the legislative to administrative agencies. The legislature may likewise apportion competencies or jurisdictions to administrative agencies over certain conflicts involving special technical expertise. </p><p> Administrative actions reviewable by this Court, therefore, may either be quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial. As the name implies, quasi-legislative or rule-making power is the power of an administrative agency to make rules and regulations that have the force and effect of law so long as they are issued "within the confines of the granting statute."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> The enabling law must be complete, with sufficient standards to guide the administrative agency in exercising its rule-making power.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> As an exception to the rule on non­ delegation of legislative power, administrative rules and regulations must be "germane to the objects and purposes of the law, and be not in contradiction to, but in conformity with, the standards prescribed by law."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> In <i>Pangasinan Transportation Co., Inc. v. The Public Service Commission</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> this Court recognized the constitutional permissibility of the grant of quasi-legislative powers to administrative agencies, thus: </p><blockquote> <p> One thing, however, is apparent in the development of the principle of separation of powers and that is that the maxim of <i>delegatus non potest delegari</i> or <i>delegata potestas non potest delegari</i>, attributed to Bracton (De Legibus et Consuetedinious Angliae, edited by G.E. Woodbine, Yale University Press, 1922, vol. 2, p. 167) but which is also recognized in principle in the Roman Law (D. 17.18.3), has been made to adapt itself to the complexities of modern governments, giving rise to the adoption, within certain limits, of the principle of "subordinate legislation," not only in the United States and England but in practically all modem governments. (People vs. Rosenthal and Osmeña, G. R. Nos. 46076 and 46077, promulgated June 12, 1939.) Accordingly, with the growing complexity of modern life, the multiplication of the subjects of governmental regulation, and the increased difficulty of administering the laws, there is a constantly growing tendency toward the delegation of greater powers by the legislature, and toward the approval of the practice by the courts. (Dillon Catfish Drainage Dist. v. Bank of Dillon, 141 S. E. 274, 275, 143 S. Ct. 178; State v. Knox County, 54 S. W. 2d. 973, 976, 165 Tenn. 319.) In harmony with such growing tendency, this Court, since the decision in the case of Compañia General de Tabacos de Filipinas vs. Board of Public Utility Commissioners (34 Phil., 136), relied upon by the petitioner, has, in instances, extended its seal of approval to the "delegation of greater powers by the legislature." (Inchausti Steamship Co. vs. Public Utility Commissioner, 44 Phil., 366; Alegre vs. Collector of Customs, 53 Phil., 394; Cebu Autobus Co. vs. De Jesus, 56 Phil., 446; People vs. Fernandez &amp; Trinidad, G. R. No. 45655, promulgated June 15, 1938; People vs. Rosenthal &amp; Osmeña, G. R. Nos. 46076, 46077, promulgated June 12, 1939; and Robb and Hilscher vs. People, G.R.

In the 1931 case of <i>The Municipal Council of Lemery, Batangas v. The Provincial Board of Batangas</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> this Court declared that the power of the Municipal Board of Lemery to approve or disapprove a municipal resolution or ordinance is quasi-judicial in nature and, consequently, may be the subject of a certiorari proceeding.</p><p> Determining whether the act under review is quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial is necessary in determining <i>when</i> judicial remedies may properly be availed of Rules issued in the exercise of an administrative agency's quasi-legislative power may be taken cognizance of by courts <i>on the first instance</i> as part of their judicial power, thus: </p><blockquote> <p> [W]here what is assailed is the validity or constitutionality of a rule or regulation issued by the administrative agency in the performance of its quasi-legislative function, the regular courts have jurisdiction to pass upon the same. The determination of whether a specific rule or set of rules issued by an administrative agency contravenes the law or the constitution is within the jurisdiction of the regular courts. Indeed, the Constitution vests the power of judicial review or the power to declare a law, treaty, international or executive agreement, presidential decree, order, instruction, ordinance, or regulation in the courts, including the regional trial courts. This is within the scope of judicial power, which includes the authority of the courts to determine in an appropriate action the validity of the acts of the political departments. Judicial power includes the duty of the courts of justice to settle actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable, and to determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> (Citations omitted)</p> </blockquote> <p> However, in cases involving quasi-judicial acts, Congress may require certain quasi-judicial agencies to first take cognizance of the case before resort to judicial remedies may be allowed. This is to take advantage of the special technical expertise possessed by administrative agencies. <i>Pambujan Sur United Mine Workers v. Samar Mining Company, Inc</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> explained the doctrine of primary administrative jurisdiction, thus: </p><blockquote> <p> That the courts cannot or will not determine a controversy involving a question which is within the jurisdiction of an administrative tribunal prior to the decision of that question by the administrative tribunal, where the question demands the exercise of sound administrative discretion requiring the special knowledge, experience, and services of the administrative tribunal to determine technical and intricate matters of fact, and a uniformity of ruling is essential to comply with the purposes of the regulatory statute administered.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Usually contrasted with the doctrine of primary jurisdiction is the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies. Though both concepts aim to maximize the special technical knowledge of administrative agencies, the doctrine of primary administrative jurisdiction requires courts to not resolve or "determine a controversy involving a question which is within the jurisdiction of an administrative tribunal."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> The issue is jurisdictional and the court, when confronted with a case under the jurisdiction of an administrative agency, has no option but to dismiss it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> </p><p> In contrast, exhaustion of administrative remedies requires parties to exhaust all the remedies in the administrative machinery before resorting to judicial remedies. The doctrine of exhaustion presupposes that the court and the administrative agency have concurrent jurisdiction to take cognizance of a matter. However, in deference to the special and technical expertise of the administrative agency, courts must yield to the administrative agency by suspending the proceedings. As such, parties must exhaust all the remedies within the administrative machinery before resort to courts is allowed. </p><p> Discussion of the doctrines of primary jurisdiction and exhaustion of administrative remedies aside, the present case does not require the application of either doctrine. Department Order No. 118-12 and Memorandum Circular No. 2012-001 were issued in the exercise of the DOLE's<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> and the LTFRB's<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> quasi-legislative powers and, as discussed, the doctrines of primary jurisdiction and exhaustion of administrative remedies may only be invoked in matters involving the exercise of quasi-judicial power. Specifically, Department Order No. 118-12 enforces the application of labor standards provisions, i.e., payment of minimum wage and grant of social welfare benefits in the public bus transportation industry. For its part, Memorandum Circular No. 2012-001 was issued by the LTFRB in the exercise of its power to prescribe the terms and conditions for the issuance of a certificate of public convenience and its power to promulgate and enforce rules and regulations on land transportation public utilities. </p><p align="center"> <b>II</b></p><p> While resort to courts may directly be availed of in questioning the constitutionality of an administrative rule, parties may not proceed directly before <i>this</i> Court, regardless of its original jurisdiction over certain matters. This Court's original jurisdiction over petitions for certiorari and Prohibition<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> may only be invoked for special reasons under the doctrine of hierarchy of courts. </p><p> The doctrine of hierarchy of courts requires that recourse must first be obtained from lower courts sharing concurrent jurisdiction with a higher court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> This is to ensure that this Court remains <i>a court of last resort</i> so as to "satisfactorily perform the functions assigned to it by the fundamental charter and immemorial tradition."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></p><p> The doctrine was first enunciated in <i>People v. Cuaresma</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> where a petition for certiorari assailing a trial court order granting a motion to quash was directly filed before this Court. Noting that there was no special reason for invoking this Court's original jurisdiction, this Court dismissed the petition and required the "strict observance" of the policy of hierarchy of courts, thus: </p><blockquote> <p> This Court's original jurisdiction to issue writs of certiorari (as well as prohibition, <i>mandamus, quo warranto, habeas corpus</i> and injunction) is not exclusive. It is shared by this Court with Regional Trial Courts (formerly Courts of First Instance), which may issue the writ, enforceable in any part of their respective regions. It is also shared by this Court, and by the Regional Trial Court, with the Court of Appeals (formerly, Intermediate Appellate Court), although prior to the effectivity of <i>Batas Pambansa Bilang</i> 129 on August 14, 1981, the latter's competence to issue the extraordinary writs was restricted to those "in aid of its appellate jurisdiction." This concurrence of jurisdiction is not, however, to be taken as according to parties seeking any of the writs an absolute, unrestrained freedom of choice of the court to which application therefor will be directed. There is after all a hierarchy of courts. That hierarchy is determinative of the venue of appeals, and should also serve as a general determinant of the appropriate forum for petitions for the extraordinary writs. A becoming regard for that judicial hierarchy most certainly indicates that petitions for the issuance of extraordinary writs against first level ("inferior") courts should be filed with the Regional Trial Court, and those against the latter, with the Court of Appeals. A direct invocation of the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction to issue these writs should be allowed only when there are special and important reasons therefor, clearly and specifically set out in the petition. This is established policy. It is a policy that is necessary to prevent inordinate demands upon the Court's time and attention which are better devoted to those matters within its exclusive jurisdiction, and to prevent further over-crowding of the Court's docket. Indeed, the removal of the restriction on the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals in this regard, <i>supra</i> — resulting from the deletion of the qualifying phrase, "in aid of its appellate jurisdiction" — was evidently intended precisely to relieve this Court <i>pro tanto</i> of the burden of dealing with applications for the extraordinary writs which, but for the expansion of the Appellate Court['s] corresponding jurisdiction, would have had to be filed with it. </p> <p> The Court feels the need to reaffirm that policy at this time, and to enjoin strict adherence thereto in the light of what it perceives to be a growing tendency on the part of litigants and lawyers to have their applications for the so-called extraordinary writs, and sometime even their appeals, passed upon and adjudicated directly and immediately by the highest tribunal of the land. The proceeding at bar is a case in point. The application for the writ of <i>certiorari</i> sought against a City Court was brought directly to this Court although there is discernible special and important reason for not presenting it to the Regional Trial Court.</p> <p> The Court therefore closes this decision with the declaration, for the information and guidance of all concerned, that it will not only continue to enforce the policy, but will require a more strict observance thereof.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> (Citations omitted)</p> </blockquote> <p> More recently, this Court in <i>The Diocese of Bacolod v. Commission on Elections</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> explained the purpose of the doctrine: to "ensure that every level of the judiciary performs its designated roles in an effective and efficient manner."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> This Court said: </p><blockquote> <p> Trial courts do not only determine the facts from the evaluation of the evidence presented before them. They are likewise competent to determine issues of law which may include the validity of an ordinance, statute, or even an executive issuance in relation to the Constitution. To effectively perform these functions, they are territorially organized into regions and then into branches. Their writs generally reach within those territorial boundaries. Necessarily, they mostly perform the all-important task of inferring the facts from the evidence as these are physically presented before them. In many instances, the facts occur within their territorial jurisdiction, which properly present the 'actual case' that makes ripe a determination of the constitutionality of such action. The consequences, of course, would be national in scope. There are, however, some cases where resort to courts at their level would not be practical considering their decisions could still be appealed before the higher courts, such as the Court of Appeals.</p> <p> The Court of Appeals is primarily designated as an appellate court that reviews the determination of facts and law made by the trial courts. It is collegiate in nature. This nature ensures more standpoints in the review of the actions of the trial court. But the Court of Appeals also has original jurisdiction over most special civil actions. Unlike the trial courts, its writs can have a nationwide scope. It is competent to determine facts and, ideally, should act on constitutional issues that may not necessarily be novel unless there are factual questions to determine.</p> <p> This court, on the other hand, leads the judiciary by breaking new ground or further reiterating — in the light of new circumstances or in the light of some confusions of bench or bar — existing precedents.

Narrowed as its function is in this manner, the judiciary does not pass upon questions of wisdom, justice or expediency of legislation. More than that, courts accord the presumption of constitutionality to legislative enactments, not only because the legislature is presumed to abide by the Constitution but also because the judiciary in the determination of actual cases and controversies must reflect the wisdom and justice of the people as expressed through their representatives in the executive and legislative departments of the governments.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Even the expanded jurisdiction of this Court under Article VIII, Section 1<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> does not provide license to provide advisory opinions.

In such cases, the conflict will not have sufficient concreteness or adversariness so as to constrain the discretion of this Court. After all, legal arguments from concretely lived facts are chosen narrowly by the parties. Those who bring theoretical cases will have no such limits. They can argue up to the level of absurdity.

As their petition would disclose, <i>private respondents' fear of prosecution was solely based on remarks of certain government officials which were addressed to the general public.

Furthermore, there should also be a clear and convincing demonstration of special reasons why the truly injured parties may not be able to sue.</p><p> Alternatively, there must be a similarly clear and convincing demonstration that the representation of the association is more efficient for the petitioners to bring. They must further show that it is more efficient for this Court to hear only one voice from the association. In other words, the association should show special reasons for bringing the action themselves rather than as a class suit,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup> allowed when the subject matter of the controversy is one of common or general interest to many persons. In a class suit, a number of the members of the class are permitted to sue and to defend for the benefit of all the members so long as they are sufficiently numerous and representative of the class to which they belong.</p><p> In some circumstances similar to those in White Light, the third parties represented by the petitioner would have special and legitimate reasons why they may not bring the action themselves. Understandably, the cost to patrons in the <em>White Light</em> case to bring the action themselves—i.e., the amount they would pay for the lease of the motels—will be too small compared with the cost of the suit. But viewed in another way, whoever among the patrons files the case even for its transcendental interest endows benefits on a substantial number of interested parties without recovering their costs. This is the free rider problem in economics. It is a negative externality which operates as a disincentive to sue and assert a transcendental right.</p><p> In addition to an actual controversy, special reasons to represent, and disincentives for the injured party to bring the suit themselves, there must be a showing of the transcendent nature of the right involved.</p><p> Only constitutional rights shared by many and requiring a grounded level of urgency can be transcendent. For instance, in <i>The Association of Small Landowners in the Philippines, Inc. v. Secretary of Agrarian Reform</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup> the association was allowed to file on behalf of its members considering the importance of the issue involved, i.e., the constitutionality of agrarian reform measures, specifically, of then newly enacted Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law.</p><p> This Court is not a forum to appeal political and policy choices made by the Executive, Legislative, and other constitutional agencies and organs. This Court dilutes its role in a democracy if it is asked to substitute its political wisdom for the wisdom of accountable and representative bodies where there is no unmistakable democratic deficit. It cannot lose this place in the constitutional order. Petitioners' invocation of our jurisdiction and the justiciability of their claims must be presented with rigor. Transcendental interest is not a talisman to blur the lines of authority drawn by our most fundamental law.</p><p> As declared at the outset, petitioners in this case do not have standing to bring this suit. As associations, they failed to establish who their members are and if these members allowed them to sue on their behalf. While alleging that they are composed of public utility bus operators who will be directly injured by the implementation of Department Order No. 118-12 and Memorandum Circular No. 2012-001, petitioners did not present any proof, such as board resolutions of their alleged members or their own articles of incorporation authorizing them to act as their members' representatives in suits involving their members' individual rights.</p><p> Some of the petitioners here are not even persons or entities authorized by law or by the Rules allowed to file a suit in court. As intervenor MMDA sufficiently demonstrated, petitioners Provincial Bus Operators Association of the Philippines, Southern Luzon Bus Operators Association, Inc., and Inter City Bus Operators Association, Inc. had their certificates of incorporation revoked by the Securities and Exchange Commission for failure to submit the required general information sheets and financial statements for the years 1996 to 2003.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup> With their certificates of incorporation revoked, petitioners Provincial Bus Operators Association of the Philippines, Southern Luzon Bus Operators Association, Inc., and Inter City Bus Operators Association, Inc. have no corporate existence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup> They have no capacity to exercise any corporate power, specifically, the power to sue in their respective corporate names.</p><p> Again, the reasons cited—the "far-reaching consequences" and "wide area of coverage and extent of effect"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup> of Department Order No. 118-12 and Memorandum Circular No. 2012-001—are reasons not transcendent considering that most administrative issuances of the national government are of wide coverage. These reasons are not special reasons for this Court to brush aside the requirement of legal standing.</p><p> Thus far, petitioners have not satisfied any of the following requirements for this Court to exercise its judicial power. They have not sufficiently demonstrated why this Court should exercise its original jurisdiction. The issues they raised are not justiciable. Finally, as will be shown, they failed to demonstrate any breach of constitutional text.</p><p align="center"> <b>V</b></p><p> The protection of private property is the primary function of a constitution. This can be gleaned in our earliest fundamental law where members of the Malolos Congress declared their purpose in decreeing the Malolos Constitution: "to secure for [the Filipino people] the blessings of liberty." It is understood that the rights to enjoy and to dispose of property are among these blessings considering that several provisions on property are found in the Constitution. Article 32 of the Malolos Constitution provided that "no Filipino shall establish ... institutions restrictive of property rights." Likewise, Article 17 provided that "no one shall be deprived of his property by expropriation except on grounds of public necessity and benefit."</p><p> At present, the due process clause, the equal protection clause, and the takings clause of the Constitution serve as protections from the government's taking of property. The non-impairment clause may likewise be invoked if the property taken is in the nature of a contract. In any case, all these constitutional limits are subject to the fundamental powers of the State, specifically, police power. As such, the burden of proving that the taking is unlawful rests on the party invoking the constitutional right.</p><p> Unfortunately for petitioners, they miserably failed to prove why Department Order No. 118-12 and Memorandum Circular No. 2012-001 are unconstitutional.</p><p align="center"> <b>VI</b></p><p> Article III, Section 1 of the Constitution provides:</p><p align="center"> ARTICLE III<br> <i>Bill of Rights</i> </p><blockquote> <p> Section 1. No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, nor shall any person be denied the equal protection of the laws.</p> </blockquote> <p> The values congealed in the fundamental principle prohibiting the deprivation of life, liberty, and property "without due process of law" may be those derived within our own cultures even though the current text is but an incarnation from foreign jurisdictions.</p><p> For instance, the phrase "due process of law" does not appear in the Malolos Constitution of 1899. Still, it had similar provisions in Article 32 stating that "no Filipino shall establish ... institutions restrictive of property rights." Specific to deprivation of property was Article 17, which stated that "no one shall be deprived of his property by expropriation except on grounds of public necessity and benefit, previously declared."</p><p> Among the "inviolable rules" found in McKinley's Instructions to the Philippine Commission was "that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[121]</sup></p><p> As it is now worded, the due process clause has appeared in the Philippine Bill of 1902, the Jones Law, the 1935 and 1973 Constitutions and, finally, in the 1987 Constitution.</p><p> The right to due process was first conceptualized in England, appearing in an English statute of 1354,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup> with some early scholars claiming that the right to due process is fundamentally procedural.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup> The statute in which the phrase "due process of law" first appeared was reportedly enacted to prevent the outlawing of individuals "without their being summoned to answer for the charges brought against them."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[124]</sup> The statute, enacted during Edward the Third's reign, thus provided: </p><blockquote> <p> That no man of what Estate or Condition that he be, shall be put out of land or Tenement, nor taken, nor imprisoned, nor disinherited, nor put to death, without being brought in answer by due process of law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[125]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Still, other early scholars asserted that the right to due process originally has a substantive dimension, requiring that any taking of life, liberty, or property be according to "the law of the land."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[126]</sup> This is the view of Sir Edward Coke in interpreting chapter 39 of the Magna Carta on which the due process clause of the United States Constitution is based.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[127]</sup> Chapter 39 of the Magna Carta provides: </p><blockquote> <p> No free man shall be taken, imprisoned, disseised, outlawed, banished, or in any way destroyed, nor will We proceed against or prosecute him, except by lawful judgment of his peers and by the law of the land.</p> </blockquote> <p> Currently, this Court reads the due process clause as requiring both procedural and substantive elements.

What then is the standard of due process which must exist both as a procedural and as substantive requisite to free the challenged ordinance, or any government action for that matter, from the imputation of legal infirmity; sufficient to spell its doom? It is responsiveness to the supremacy of reason, obedience to the dictates of justice. Negatively put, arbitrariness is ruled out and unfairness avoided. To satisfy the due process requirement, official action, to paraphrase Cardozo, must not outrun the bounds of reasons and result in sheer oppression. Due process is thus hostile to any official action marred by lack of reasonableness. Correctly has it been identified as freedom from arbitrariness. It is the embodiment of the sporting idea of fair play. It exacts fealty "to those strivings for justice" and judges the act of officialdom of whatever branch "in the light of reason drawn from considerations of fairness that reflect [democratic] traditions of legal and political thought." It is not a narrow or "technical conception with fixed content unrelated to time, place and circumstances," decisions based on such a clause requiring a "close and perceptive inquiry into fundamental principles of our society."

In the language of this court in Edwards vs. McCoy, ..., "the right to adduce evidence, without the corresponding duty on the part of the board to consider it, is vain. Such right is conspicuously futile if the person or persons to whom the evidence is presented can thrust it aside without notice or consideration."</p> <p> (3) "While the duty to deliberate does not impose the obligation to decide right, it does imply a necessity which cannot be disregarded, namely, that of <u>having something to support its decision</u>.

The obvious purpose of this and similar provisions is to free administrative boards from the compulsion of technical rules so that the mere admission of matter which would be deemed incompetent in judicial proceedings would not invalidate the administrative order.... But this assurance of a desirable flexibility in administrative procedure does not go so far as to justify orders without a basis in evidence having rational probative force. Mere uncorroborated hearsay or rumor does not constitute substantial evidence.... </p> <p> (5) <u>The decision must be rendered on the evidence presented at the hearing, or at least contained in the record and disclosed to the parties affected</u> ... Only by confining the administrative tribunal to the evidence disclosed to the parties, can the latter be protected in their right to know and meet the case against them.

In these cases, the test or standard is whether the law is reasonable. The interests of the State to promote the general welfare, on the one hand, and the right to property, on the other, must be balanced. As expounded in <i>Ichong v. Hernandez</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[150]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> The conflict, therefore, between police power and the guarantees of due process and equal protection of the laws is more apparent than real. Properly related, the power and the guarantees are supposed to coexist. The balancing is the essence or, shall it be said, the indispensable means for the attainment of legitimate aspirations of any democratic society. There can be no absolute power, whoever exercise it, for that would be tyranny. Yet there can neither be absolute liberty, for that would mean license and anarchy. So the State can deprive persons of life, liberty and property, provided there is due process of law; and persons may be classified into classes and groups, provided everyone is given the equal protection of the law. The test or standard, as always, is reason. The police power legislation must be firmly grounded on public interest and welfare, and a reasonable relation must exist between purposes and means. And if distinction and classification ha[ve] been made, there must be a reasonable basis for said distinction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[151]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Given the foregoing, this Court finds that Department Order No. 118-12 and Memorandum Circular No. 2012-001 are not violative of due process, either procedural or substantive.</p><p> Department Order No. 118-12 and Memorandum Circular No. 2012-001 were issued in the exercise of quasi-legislative powers of the DOLE and the LTFRB, respectively. As such, notice and hearing are not required for their validity.</p><p> In any case, it is undisputed that the DOLE created a Technical Working Group that conducted several meetings and consultations with interested sectors before promulgating Department Order No. 118-12. Among those invited were bus drivers, conductors, and operators with whom officials of the DOLE conducted focused group discussions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[152]</sup> The conduct of these discussions more than complied with the requirements of procedural due process. </p><p> Neither are Department Order No. 118-12 and Memorandum Circular No. 2012-001 offensive of substantive due process.</p><p> Department Order No. 118-12 and Memorandum Circular No. 2012-001 are reasonable and are valid police power issuances. The pressing need for Department Order No. 118-12 is obvious considering petitioners' admission that the payment schemes prior to the Order's promulgation consisted of the "payment by results," the "commission basis," or the boundary system. These payment schemes do not guarantee the payment of minimum wages to bus drivers and conductors. There is also no mention of payment of social welfare benefits to bus drivers and conductors under these payment schemes which have allegedly been in effect since "time immemorial."</p><p> There can be no meaningful implementation of Department Order No. 118-12 if violating it has no consequence. As such, the LTFRB was not unreasonable when it required bus operators to comply with the part-fixed-part-performance-based payment scheme under pain of revocation of their certificates of public convenience. The LTFRB has required applicants or current holders of franchises to comply with labor standards as regards their employees, and bus operators must be reminded that certificates of public convenience are not property. Certificates of public convenience are franchises always subject to amendment, repeal, or cancellation. Additional requirements may be added for their issuance, and there can be no violation of due process when a franchise is cancelled for non-compliance with the new requirement.</p><p> An equally important reason for the issuance of Department Order No. 118-12 and Memorandum Circular No. 2012-001 is to ensure "road safety" by eliminating the "risk-taking behaviors" of bus drivers and conductors. This Court in <i>Hernandez v. Dolor</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[153]</sup> observed that the boundary system "place[s] the riding public at the mercy of reckless and irresponsible drivers—reckless because the measure of their earnings depends largely upon the number of trips they make and, hence, the speed at which they drive."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[154]</sup> </p><p> Behavioral economics explains this phenomenon. The boundary system puts drivers in a "scarcity mindset" that creates a tunnel vision where bus drivers are nothing but focused on meeting the boundary required and will do so by any means possible and regardless of risks.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[155]</sup> They stop for passengers even outside of the designated bus stops, impeding traffic flow. They compete with other bus drivers for more income without regard to speed limits and bus lanes. Some drivers even take in performance-enhancing drugs and, reportedly, even illegal drugs such as <i>shabu</i>, just to get additional trips. This scarcity mindset is eliminated by providing drivers with a fixed income plus variable income based on performance. The fixed income equalizes the playing field, so to speak, so that competition and racing among bus drivers are prevented. The variable pay provided in Department Order No. 118-12 is based on safety parameters, incentivizing prudent driving. </p><p> In sum, Department Order No. 118-12 and Memorandum Circular No. 2012-001 are in the nature of social legislations to enhance the economic status of bus drivers and conductors, and to promote the general welfare of the riding public. They are reasonable and are not violative of due process.</p><p align="center"> <b>VII</b></p><p> Related to due process is the non-impairment clause. The Constitution's Article III, Section 10 provides:</p><p align="center"> ARTICLE III <i><br> Bill of Rights</i> </p><blockquote> <p> . . . .<br> Section 10. No law impairing the obligation of contracts shall be passed.</p> </blockquote> <p> The non-impairment clause was first incorporated into the United States Constitution after the American Revolution, an unstable time when worthless money was routinely issued and the States enacted moratorium laws to extend periods to pay contractual obligations that further contributed to the lack of confidence to the monetary system during that time.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[156]</sup> These practices were prohibited under the clause to limit State interference with free markets and debtor-creditor relationships.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[157]</sup></p><p> The clause was first adopted in our jurisdiction through the Philippine Bill of 1902 and, similar to the due process clause, has consistently appeared in subsequent Constitutions. </p><p> Since the non-impairment clause was adopted here, this Court has said that its purpose is to protect purely private agreements from State interference.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[158]</sup> This is to "encourage trade and credit by promoting confidence in the stability of contractual relations."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[159]</sup> </p><p> There are views, however, that the non-impairment clause is obsolete and redundant because contracts are considered property, and thus, are protected by the due process clause. On the other hand, studies show why the non-impairment clause should be maintained. Aside from its traditional purpose of prohibiting State interference in purely private transactions, the non-impairment clause serves as a guarantee of the separation of powers between the judicial and legislative branches of the government.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[160]</sup> The non­ impairment clause serves as a check on the legislature "to act only through generally applicable laws prescribing rules of conduct that operate prospectively." <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[161]</sup> </p><p> This approach, called the institutional regularity approach, was applied in <i>United States v. Diaz Conde and R. Conde</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[162]</sup> The accused in the case lent P300.00 to two (2) debtors with 5% interest per month, payable within the first 10 days of each and every month. The Usury Law was subsequently passed in 1916, outlawing the lending of money with usurious interests. </p><p> In 1921, the accused were charged for violating the Usury Law for money lending done in 1915. The accused were initially convicted but they were subsequently acquitted. This Court held that the loan contract was valid when it was entered into; thus, to render a previously valid contract illegal for violating a subsequent law is against the non-impairment clause. This Court explained: </p><blockquote> <p> A law imposing a new penalty, or a new liability or disability, or giving a new right of action, must not be construed as having a retroactive effect. It is an elementary rule of contract that the laws in force at the time the contract was made must govern its interpretation and application. Laws must be construed prospectively and not retrospectively. If a contract is legal at its inception, it cannot be rendered illegal by any subsequent legislation. If that were permitted then the obligations of a contract might be impaired, which is prohibited by the organic law of the Philippine Islands.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[163]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> It is claimed that the institutional regularity approach "offers the soundest theoretical basis for reviving the [non-impairment clause] as a meaningful constitutional constraint."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[164]</sup> It is consistent with the government's right to regulate itself, but prevents "majoritarian abuse."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[165]</sup> With the non-impairment clause, legislature cannot enact "retroactive laws, selective laws, and laws not supported by a public purpose."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[166]</sup> </p><p> At any rate, so long as the non-impairment clause appears in the Constitution, it may be invoked to question the constitutionality of State actions.</p><p> There is an impairment when, either by statute or any administrative rule issued in the exercise of the agency's quasi-legislative power, the terms of the contracts are changed either in the time or mode of the performance of the obligation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[167]</sup> There is likewise impairment when new conditions are imposed or existing conditions are dispensed with.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[168]</sup> </p><p> Not all contracts, however, are protected under the non-impairment clause.

In other words, there can be no vested right in the continued grant of a franchise. Additional conditions for the grant of the franchise may be made and the grantee cannot claim impairment. </p><p> Similar to the right to due process, the right to non-impairment yields to the police power of the State.</p><p> In <i>Anucension v. National Labor Union</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[172]</sup> Hacienda Luisita and the exclusive bargaining agent of its agricultural workers, National Labor Union, entered into a collective bargaining agreement.

Republic Act No. 3350 was then subsequently enacted in 1961, exempting workers who were members of religious sects which prohibit affiliation of their members with any labor organization from the operation of union security clauses. </p><p> On the claim that Republic Act No. 3350 violated the obligation of contract, specifically, of the union security clause found in the collective bargaining agreement, this Court conceded that "there was indeed an impairment of [the] union security clause."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[173]</sup> Nevertheless, this Court noted that the "prohibition to impair the obligation of contracts is not absolute and unqualified"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[174]</sup> and that "the policy of protecting contracts against impairment presupposes the maintenance of a government by virtue of which contractual relations are worthwhile — a government which retains adequate authority to secure the peace and good order of society."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[175]</sup> A statute passed to protect labor is a "legitimate exercise of police power, although it incidentally destroys existing contract rights."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[176]</sup> "[C]ontracts regulating relations between capital and labor ... are not merely contractual, and said labor contracts ...

It claimed that it acquired its certificates of public convenience to operate public utility buses when the Public Service Act did not provide for a definite period of validity of a certificate of public convenience. Thus, Pangasinan Transportation claimed that it "must be deemed to have the right [to hold its certificates of public convenience] in perpetuity."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[180]</sup> </p><p> Rejecting Pangasinan Transportation's argument, this Court declared that certificates of public convenience are granted subject to amendment, alteration, or repeal by Congress.

Further, these issuances violate the terms of the franchise of bus operators by imposing additional requirements after the franchise has been validly issued.</p><p> Petitioners' arguments deserve scant consideration. For one, the relations between capital and labor are not merely contractual as provided in Article 1700 of the Civil Code.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[183]</sup> By statutory declaration, labor contracts are impressed with public interest and, therefore, must yield to the common good.

In other words, labor contracts are subject to the police power of the State.</p><p> As previously discussed on the part on due process, Department Order No. 118-12 was issued to grant bus drivers and conductors minimum wages and social welfare benefits. Further, petitioners repeatedly admitted that in paying their bus drivers and conductors, they employ the boundary system or commission basis, payment schemes which cause drivers to drive recklessly. Not only does Department Order No. 118-12 aim to uplift the economic status of bus drivers and conductors; it also promotes road and traffic safety. </p><p> Further, certificates ofpub1ic convenience granted to bus operators are subject to amendment. When certificates of public convenience were granted in 2012, Memorandum Circular No. 2011-004 on the "Revised Terms and Conditions of [Certificates of Public Convenience] and Providing Penalties for Violations Thereof” was already in place. This Memorandum Circular, issued before Memorandum Circular No. 2012-001, already required public utility vehicle operators to comply with labor and social legislations.

The law prohibited aliens from engaging in retail business in the Philippines. This Court sustained the classification by citizenship created by Republic Act No. 1180. This Court observed how our economy primarily relied on retailers to distribute goods to consumers; thus, the legislature saw it fit to limit the conduct of retail business to Filipinos to protect the country's economic freedom. This Court said: </p><blockquote> <p> Broadly speaking, the power of the legislature to make distinctions and classifications among persons is not curtailed or denied by the equal protection of the laws clause. The legislative power admits of a wide scope of discretion, and a law can be violative of the constitutional limitation only when the classification is without reasonable basis. In addition to the authorities we have earlier cited, we can also refer to the case of Lindsley vs. Natural Carbonic Gas Co.

A classification having some reasonable basis does not offend against that clause merely because it is not made with mathematical nicety, or because in practice it results in some inequality. 3. When the classification in such a law is called in question, if any state of facts reasonably can be conceived that would sustain it, the existence of that state of facts at the time the law was enacted must be assumed. 4.
