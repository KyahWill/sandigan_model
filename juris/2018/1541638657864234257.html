It argues that since petitioner only raised the objection before the Court of Appeals, her action should have been barred.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Respondent likewise points out that the forfeiture of the bond was due to petitioner's own negligence.

Enriquez should be made liable for the full amount of the bond paid by respondent The Mercantile Insurance Co., Inc. as surety, in relation to a previous case for replevin filed by petitioner.<br><br><center><b>I</b><br></center><br>Replevin is an action for the recovery of personal property.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> It is both a principal remedy and a provisional relief. When utilized as a principal remedy, the objective is to recover possession of personal property that may have been wrongfully detained by another. When sought as a provisional relief, it allows a plaintiff to retain the contested property during the pendency of the action. In <i>Tillson v. Court of Appeals:</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br><blockquote>The term replevin is popularly understood as "the return to or recovery by a person of goods or chattels claimed to be wrongfully taken or detained upon the person's giving security to try the matter in court and return the goods if defeated in the action;" "the writ by or the common-law action in which goods and chattels are replevied," i.e., taken or gotten back by a writ for replevin;" and to replevy, means to recover possession by an action of replevin; to take possession of goods or chattels under a replevin order. Bouvier's Law Dictionary defines replevin as "a form of action which lies to regain the possession of personal chattels which have been taken from the plaintiff unlawfully . . ., (or as) the writ by virtue of which the sheriff proceeds at once to take possession of the property therein described and transfer it to the plaintiff upon his giving pledges which are satisfactory to the sheriff to prove his title, or return the chattels taken if he fail so to do;" the same authority states that the term, "to replevy" means "to re-deliver goods which have been distrained to the original possessor of them, on his giving pledges in an action of replevin." The term therefore may refer either to the action itself, for the recovery of personality, or the provisional remedy traditionally associated with it, by which possession of the property may be obtained by the plaintiff and retained during the pendency of the action. In this jurisdiction, the provisional remedy is identified in Rule 60 of the Rules of Court as an order for delivery of personal property.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></blockquote><br><br>Similarly, in <i>BA Finance Corporation v. Court of Appeals:</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br><blockquote>Replevin, broadly understood, is both a form of principal remedy and of a provisional relief. It may refer either to the action itself, i.e., to regain the possession of personal chattels being wrongfully detained from the plaintiff by another, or to the provisional remedy that would allow the plaintiff to retain the thing during the pendency of the action and hold it <i>pendente lite.</i> The action is primarily possessory in nature and generally determines nothing more than the right of possession. Replevin is so usually described as a mixed action, being partly <i>in rem</i> and partly <i>in personam-in rem</i> insofar as the recovery of specific property is concerned, and <i>in personam </i> as regards to damages involved. As an "action in rem," the gist of the replevin action is the right of the plaintiff to obtain possession of specific personal property by reason of his being the owner or of his having a special interest therein. Consequently, the person in possession of the property sought to be replevied is ordinarily the proper and only necessary party defendant, and the plaintiff is not required to so join as defendants other persons claiming a right on the property but not in possession thereof. Rule 60 of the Rules of Court allows an application for the immediate possession of the property but the plaintiff must show that he has a good legal basis, i.e., a clear title thereto, for seeking such interim possession.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></blockquote><br><br>As a provisional remedy, a party may apply for an order for the delivery of the property before the commencement of the action or at any time before an answer is filed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Rule 60 of the Rules of Court outlines the procedure for the application of a writ of replevin. Rule 60, Section 2 requires that the party seeking the issuance of the writ must first file the required affidavit and a bond in an amount that is double the value of the property:<br><br><blockquote>Section 2. Affidavit and bond. — The applicant must show by his own affidavit or that of some other person who personally knows the facts:<br><br>(a) That the applicant is the owner of the property claimed, particularly describing it, or is entitled to the possession thereof;<br><br>(b) That the property is wrongfully detained by the adverse party, alleging the cause of detention thereof according to the best of his knowledge, information, and belief;<br><br>(c) That the property has not been distrained or taken for a tax assessment or a fine pursuant to law, or seized under a writ of execution or preliminary attachment, or otherwise placed under <i>custodia legis,</i> or if so seized, that it is exempt from such seizure or custody; and<br><br>(d) The actual market value of the property.<br><br>The applicant must also give a bond, executed to the adverse party in double the value of the property as stated in the affidavit aforementioned, for the return of the property to the adverse party if such return be adjudged, and for the payment to the adverse party of such sum as he may recover from the applicant in the action.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></blockquote><br><br>Once the affidavit is filed and the bond is approved by the court, the court issues an order and a writ of seizure requiring the sheriff to take the property into his or her custody.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> If there is no further objection to the bond filed within five (5) days from the taking of the property, the sheriff shall deliver it to the applicant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> The contested property remains in the applicant's custody until the court determines, after a trial on the Issues, which among the parties has the right of possession.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>In Civil Case No. 10846, petitioner Enriquez filed a replevin case against Asuten for the recovery of the Toyota Hi-Ace van valued at P300,000.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> She applied for a bond in the amount of P600,000.00 with respondent in Asuten's favor. The Regional Trial Court approved the bond and ordered the sheriff to recover the van from Asuten and to deliver it to petitioner. While the van was in petitioner's custody, the Regional Trial Court dismissed the case without prejudice for failure to prosecute. Thus, it ordered the sheriff to restore the van to Asuten. When petitioner failed to produce the van, the Regional Trial Court directed respondent to pay Asuten the amount of the bond.<br><br>There was no trial on the merits. The Regional Trial Court's dismissal for failure to prosecute was a dismissal without prejudice to re-filing. In this particular instance, any writ of seizure, being merely ancillary to the main action, becomes <i>functus oficio. </i>The parties returned to the status quo as if no case for replevin had been filed. Thus, upon the dismissal of the case, it was imperative for petitioner to return the van to Asuten. In <i>Advent Capital and Finance Corporation v. Young:</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br><blockquote>We agree with the Court of Appeals in directing the trial court to return the seized car to Young since this is the necessary consequence of the dismissal of the replevin case for failure to prosecute without prejudice. Upon the dismissal of the replevin case for failure to prosecute, the writ of seizure, which is merely ancillary in nature, became <i>functus officio </i>and should have been lifted. There was no adjudication on the merits, which means that there was no determination of the issue who has the better right to possess the subject car. Advent ca mot therefore retain possession of the subject car considering that it was not adjudged as the prevailing party entitled to the remedy of replevin.<br><br>Contrary to Advent's view, <i>Olympia International Inc. v. Court of Appeals </i>applies to this case. The dismissal of the replevin case for failure to prosecute results in the restoration of the parties' status prior to litigation, as if no complaint was filed at all. To let the writ of seizure stand after the dismissal of the complaint would be adjudging Advent as the prevailing party, when precisely no decision on the merits had been rendered. Accordingly, the parties must be reverted to their <i>status quo ante. </i>Since Young possessed the subject car before the filing of the replevin case, the same must be returned to him, as if no complaint was filed at all.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></blockquote><br><br>Petitioner argues that she should not have been made liable for the bond despite her failure to return the van, considering that it was effective only until February 24, 2004, and that she did not renew or post another bond.<br><br><i>De Guia v. Alto Surety &amp; Insurance, Co.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> requires that any application on the bond be made after hearing but before the entry of judgment. Otherwise, the surety can no longer be made liable under the bond:<br><br><blockquote>Construing and applying these provisions of the Rules, we have held in a long line of cases that said provisions are mandatory and require the application upon the bond against the surety or bondsmen and the award thereof to be made after hearing and before the entry of final judgment in the case; that if the judgment under execution contains no directive for the surety to pay, and the proper party fails to make any claim for such directive before such judgment had become final and executory, the surety or bondsman cannot be later made liable under the bond. The purpose of the aforementioned rules is to avoid multiplicity of suits.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup></blockquote><br><br>For this reason, a surety bond remains effective until the action or proceeding is finally decided, resolved, or terminated. This condition is deemed incorporated in the contract between the applicant and the surety, regardless of whether they failed to expressly state it. Under the Guidelines on Corporate Surety Bonds:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br><blockquote>VII. LIFETIME OF BONDS IN CRIMINAL AND CIVIL ACTIONS/SPECIAL PROCEEDINGS<br><br>Unless and until the Supreme Court directs otherwise,<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[55]</sup></font> the lifetime or duration of the effectivity of any bond issued in criminal and civil actions/special proceedings, or in any proceeding or incident therein shall be from its approval by the court, until the action or proceeding is finally decided, resolved or terminated. <i>This condition must be incorporated in the terms and condition of the bonding contract and shall bind the parties notwithstanding their failure to expressly state the same in the said contract or agreement. </i>(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><br>Civil Case No. 10846 is a rare instance where the writ of seizure is dissolved due to the dismissal without prejudice, but the bond stands because the case has yet to be finally terminated by the Regional Trial Court.<br><br>The peculiar circumstances in this case arose when petitioner <i>failed</i> to return the van to Asuten, despite the dismissal of her action. This is an instance not covered by the Rules of Court or jurisprudence. In its discretion, the Regional Trial Court proceeded to rule on the forfeiture of the bond. As a result, respondent paid Asuten twice the value of the van withheld by petitioner. Respondent, thus, seeks to recover <i>this </i>amount from petitioner, despite the van only being worth half the amount of the bond.<br><br>Of all the provisional remedies provided in the Rules of Court, only Rule 60, Section 2<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> requires that the amount of the bond be <i>double </i>the value of the property. The other provisional remedies provide that the amount be fixed by court or be merely equal to the value of the property:<br><br><blockquote><center>Provisional Remedies<br><br>Rule 57<br>Preliminary Attachment</center><br><br>....<br><br>Section 4. Condition of applicant's bond. — The party applying for the order must thereafter give a bond executed to the adverse party <i>in the amount fixed by the court in its order granting the issuance of the writ, </i>conditioned that the latter will pay all the costs which may be adjudged to the adverse party and all damages which he may sustain by reason of the attachment, if the court shall finally adjudge that the applicant was not entitled thereto.<br>....<br><br>Section 12. Discharge of attachment upon giving counter-bond. — After a writ of attachment has been enforced, the party whose property has been attached, or the person appearing on his behalf, may move for the discharge of the attachment wholly or in part on the security given. The court shall, after due notice and hearing, order the discharge of the attachment if the movant makes a cash deposit, or files a counter-bond executed to the attaching party with the clerk of the court where the application is made, <i>in an amount equal to that fixed by the court in the order of attachment, exclusive of costs. </i>But if the attachment is sought to be discharged with respect to a particular property, <i>the counter-bond shall be equal to the value of that property as determined by the court. </i>In either case, the cash deposit or the counter-bond shall secure the payment of any judgment that the attaching party may recover in the action. A notice of the deposit shall forthwith be served on the attaching party. Upon the discharge of an attachment in accordance with the provisions of this section, the property attached, or the proceeds of any sale thereof, shall be delivered to the party making the deposit or giving the counter-bond, or to the person appearing on his behalf, the deposit or counter-bond aforesaid standing in place of the property so released. Should such counter-bond for any reason be found to be or become insufficient, and the party furnishing the same fail to file an additional counter-bond, the attaching party may apply for a new order of attachment.<br>....<br><br>Section 14. Proceedings where property claimed by third person. — If the property attached is claimed by any person other than the party against whom attachment had been issued or his agent, and such person makes an affidavit of his title thereto, or right to the possession thereof, stating the grounds of such right or title, and serves such affidavit upon the sheriff while the latter has possession of the attached property, and a copy thereof upon the attaching party, the sheriff shall not be bound to keep the property under attachment, unless the attaching party or his agent, on demand of the sheriff, shall file a bond approved by the court to indemnify the third-party claimant <i>in a sum not less than the value of the property levied upon. </i>In case of disagreement as to such value, the same shall be decided by the court issuing the writ of attachment. No claim for damages for the taking or keeping of the property may be enforced against the bond unless the action therefor is filed within one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of the filing of the bond.<br>....<br><br><center>Rule 58<br>Preliminary Injunction</center><br>....<br><br>Section 4. Verified application and bond for preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order. — A preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order may be granted only when:<br><br>....<br><br>(b) Unless exempted by the court, the applicant files with the court where the action or proceeding is pending, a bond executed to the party or person enjoined, <i>in an amount to be fixed by the court, </i>to the effect that the applicant will pay to such party or person all damages which he may sustain by reason of the injunction or temporary restraining order if the court should finally decide that the applicant was not entitled thereto. Upon approval of the requisite bond, a writ of preliminary injunction shall be issued.<br>....<br><br>Section 6. Grounds for objection to, or for motion of dissolution of, injunction or restraining order. — The application for injunction or restraining order may be denied, upon a showing of its insufficiency. The injunction or restraining order may also be denied, or, if granted, may be dissolved, on other grounds upon affidavits of the party or person enjoined, which may be opposed by the applicant also by affidavits. It may further be denied, or, if granted, may be dissolved, if it appears after hearing that although the applicant is entitled to the injunction or restraining order, the issuance or continuance thereof, as the case may be, would cause irreparable damage to the party or person enjoined while the applicant can be fully compensated for such damages as he may suffer, and the former files a bond in an amount fixed by the court conditioned that he will pay all damages which the applicant may suffer by the denial or the dissolution of the injunction or restraining order. If it appears that the extent of the preliminary injunction or restraining order granted is too great, it may be modified.<br>....<br><br><center>Rule 59<br>Receivership</center><br>....<br><br>Section 2. Bond on appointment of receiver. — Before issuing the order appointing a receiver the court shall require the applicant to file a bond executed to the party against whom the application is presented, <i>in an amount to be fixed by the court, </i>to the effect that the applicant will pay such party all damages he may sustain by reason of the appointment of such receiver in case the applicant shall have procured such appointment without sufficient cause; and the court may, in its discretion, at any time after the appointment, require an additional bond as further security for such damages.<br><br>Section 3. Denial of application or discharge of receiver. — The application may be denied, or the receiver discharged, when the adverse party files a bond executed to the applicant, <i>in an amount to be fixed by the court, </i>to the effect that such party will pay the applicant all damages he may suffer by reason of the acts, omissions, or other matters specified in the application as ground for such appointment. The receiver may also be discharged if it is shown that his appointment was obtained without sufficient cause.<br>....<br><br><center>Rule 60<br>Replevin</center><br>....<br><br>Section 7. Proceedings where property claimed by third person. — If the property taken is claimed by any person other than the party against whom the writ of replevin had been issued or his agent, and such person makes an affidavit of his title thereto, or right to the possession thereof, stating the grounds therefor, and serves such affidavit upon the sheriff while the latter has possession of the property and a copy thereof upon the applicant, the sheriff shall not be bound to keep the property under replevin or deliver it to the applicant unless the applicant or his agent, on demand of said sheriff, shall file a bond approved by the court to indemnify the third-party claimant <i>in a sum not less than the value of the property under replevin </i>as provided in section 2 hereof. In case of disagreement as to such value, the court shall determine the same. No claim for damages for the taking or keeping of the property may be enforced against the bond unless the action therefor is filed within one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of the filing of the bond.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><br>However, there is a rationale to the requirement that the bond for a writ of seizure in a replevin be double the value of the property. The bond functions not only to indemnify the defendant in case the property is lost, but also to answer for any damages that may be awarded by the court if the judgment is rendered in defendant's favor. In <i>Citibank, N.A. v. Court of Appeals:</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br><blockquote>It should be noted that a replevin bond is intended to indemnify the defendant against any loss that he may suffer by reason of its being compelled to surrender the possession of the disputed property pending trial of the action. The same may also be answerable for damages if any when judgment is rendered in favor of the defendant or the party against whom a writ of replevin was issued and such judgment includes the return of the property to him. Thus, the requirement that the bond be double the actual value of the properties litigated upon. Such is the case because the bond will answer for the actual loss to the plaintiff, which corresponds to the value of the properties sought to be recovered and for damages, if any.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup></blockquote><br><br>Any application of the bond in a replevin case, therefore, is premised on the judgment rendered in favor of the defendant. Thus, the Rules of Court imply that there must be a prior judgment on the merits before there can be any application on the bond:<br><br><blockquote><center>Rule 60<br>Replevin</center><br>....<br><br>Section 9. Judgment. — After trial of the issues, the court shall determine who has the right of possession to and the value of the property and shall render judgment in the alternative for the delivery thereof to the party entitled to the same, or for its value in case delivery cannot be made, and also for such damages as either party may prove, with costs.<br><br>Section 10. Judgment to include recovery against sureties. — The amount, if any, to be awarded to any party upon any bond filed in accordance with the provisions of this Rule, shall be claimed, ascertained, and granted under the same procedure as prescribed in section 20 of Rule 57.</blockquote><br><br>The Rules of Court likewise require that for the defendant to be granted the <i>full </i>amount of the bond, he or she must first apply to the court for damages. These damages will be awarded only after a proper hearing:<br><br><blockquote><center>Rule 57<br>Preliminary Attachment</center><br>....<br><br>Section 20. Claim for damages on account of improper, irregular or excessive attachment. — An application for damages on account of improper, irregular or excessive attachment must be filed before the trial or before appeal is perfected or before the judgment becomes executory, with due notice to the attaching party and his surety or sureties, setting forth the facts showing his right to damages and the amount thereof. Such damages may be awarded only after proper hearing and shall be included in the judgment on the main case.<br><br>If the judgment on the appellate court be favorable to the party against whom the attachment was issued, he must claim damages sustained during the pendency of the appeal by filing an application in the appellate court, with notice to the party in whose favor the attachment was issued or his surety or sureties, before the judgment of the appellate court becomes executory. The appellate court may allow the application to be heard and decided by the trial court.<br><br>Nothing herein contained shall prevent the party against whom the attachment was issued from recovering in the same action the damages awarded to him from any property of the attaching party not exempt from execution should the bond or deposit given by the latter be insufficient or fail to fully satisfy the award.</blockquote><br><br>Forfeiture of the replevin bond, therefore, requires <i>first, </i>a judgment on the merits in the defendant's favor, and <i>second, </i>an application by the defendant for damages. Neither circumstance appears in this case. When petitioner failed to produce the van, equity demanded that Asuten be awarded only an amount equal to the value of the van. The Regional Trial Court would have erred in ordering the forfeiture of the <i>entire </i>bond in Asuten's favor, considering that there was no trial on the merits or an application by Asuten for damages. This judgment could have been reversed <i>had petitioner appealed the Regional Trial Court's May 24, 2004 Order in Civil Case No. 10846.</i> Unfortunately, she did not. Respondent&nbsp; was, thus, constrained to follow the Regional Trial Court's directive to pay Asuten the full amount of the bond.<br><br><center><b>II</b></center><br>This is a simple case for collection of a sum of money. Petitioner cannot substitute this case for her lost appeal in Civil Case No. 10846.<br><br>In applying for the replevin bond, petitioner voluntarily undertook with respondent an Indemnity Agreement, which provided:<br><br><blockquote>INDEMNIFICATION – to indemnify the SURETY for all damages, payments, advances, losses, costs, taxes, penalties, charges, attorney's fees and expenses of whatever kind and nature that the SURETY may at any time sustain or incur as a consequence of having become a surety upon the above-mentioned bond, and to pay, reimburse and make good to the SURETY, its successors and assigns, all sums or all money which it shall pay or become liable to pay by virtue of said bond even if said payment/s or liability exceeds the amount of the bond. . . .<br><br>INCONTESTABILITY OF PAYMENTS MADE BY THE SURETY – any payment or disbursement made by the surety on account of the above-mentioned bond, either in the belief that the SURETY was obligated to make such payment or in the belief that said payment was necessary in order to avoid a greater loss or obligation for which the SURETY might be liable by virtue of the . . . above-mentioned bond, shall be final, and will not be contested by the undersigned, who jointly and severally bind themselves to indemnify the SURETY for any of such payment or disbursement.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup></blockquote><br><br>Basic is the principle that "a contract is law between the parties"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> for as long as it is "not contrary to law, morals, good customs, public order, or public policy."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> Under their Indemnity Agreement, petitioner held herself liable for any payment made by respondent by virtue of the replevin bond.<br><br>Petitioner contends that the Indemnity Agreement was a contract of adhesion since respondent made the extent of liability "so comprehensive and all-encompassing to the point of being ambiguous."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>A contract of insurance is, by default, a contract of adhesion. It is prepared by the insurance company and might contain terms and conditions too vague for a layperson to understand; hence, they are construed liberally in favor of the insured. In <i>Verendia v. Court of Appeals:</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br><blockquote>Basically a contract of indemnity, an insurance contract is the law between the parties. Its terms and conditions constitute the measure of the insurer's liability and compliance therewith is a condition precedent to the insured's right to recovery from the insurer. As it is also a contract of adhesion, an insurance contract should be liberally construed in favor of the insured and strictly against the insurer company which usually prepares it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup></blockquote><br><br>Respondent, however, does not seek to recover an amount which exceeds the amount of the bond or any "damages, payments, advances, losses, costs, taxes, penalties, charges, attorney's fees and expenses of whatever kind and nature,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> all of which it could have sought under the Indemnity Agreement. It only seeks to recover from petitioner the amount of the bond, or P600,000.00.<br><br>Respondent paid P600,000.00 to Asuten pursuant to a lawful order of the Regional Trial Court in Civil Case No. 10846. If there were any errors in the judgment of the Regional Trial Court, as discussed above, petitioner could have appealed this. Petitioner, however, chose to let Civil Case No. 10846 lapse into finality. This case cannot now be used as a substitute for her lost appeal.<br><br>It is clear from the antecedents that any losses which petitioner has suffered were due to the consequences of her actions, or more accurately, her inactions. Civil Case No. 10846, which she filed, was dismissed due to her failure to prosecute. The Regional Trial Court forfeited the replevin bond which she had filed because she refused to return the property. She is now made liable for the replevin bond because she failed to appeal its forfeiture.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the Petition is <b>DENIED.</b> The August 13, 2013 Decision and January 14, 2014 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
