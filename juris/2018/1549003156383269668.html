				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Before the Court is an ordinary appeal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> filed by accused-appellant Orlando Tagle y Roqueta @ "Allan" (Tagle) assailing the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated March 8, 2016 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 06620, which affirmed with modification the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated November 15, 2013 of the Regional Trial Court of Las Piñas City, Branch 254 (RTC) in Crim. Case No. 07-0403, and found Tagle guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Rape, defined and penalized under Article 266-A, paragraph 1 (a) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), as amended by Republic Act No. (RA) 8353,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> otherwise known as "The Anti-Rape Law of 1997."<br><br><center><b>The Facts</b><br></center><br>On May 11, 2007, an Information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> was filed before the RTC charging Tagle of Rape, the accusatory portion of which states:<br><blockquote>That on or about the 6<sup>th</sup> day of May, 2007, in the City of Las Piñas, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above­named and confederating together with one <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">xxxxxxxxxxx</span> a.k.a. "Patis", a seventeen (17) year old, minor, one a.k.a. "Jay-jay", a fifteen (15) year old, minor, one a.k.a. "Danny or Armond; one a.k.a. "Mayang, one a.k.a. "Rose", and one John Doe, whose true identities and present whereabouts are still unknown, and all of them mutually helping and aiding one another, <u>acting with discernment</u>, with lewd design, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge with one [AAA<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>], a thirteen (13) year old, minor, through force, threat and intimidation, by then and there pointing a knife, and against her will and consent and thereby each one of them subjected her to sexual abuse and that the act complained of is prejudicial to the physical and psychological development of the complainant-minor.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>The prosecution alleged that at around midnight of May 6, 2007, AAA was invited by her friend to get some clothes from a certain "Mata" at <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">xxxxxxxxxxx</span>, Las Piñas City. Upon arrival thereat, "Mata" invited AAA and her friend to join a drinking spree, and thereafter, brought them to an unlighted grassy area, where Tagle and four (4) other male individuals were drinking without any tables and chairs. The men offered AAA some beer and forced her to drink, but she poured the contents at her back when no one was looking. AAA's friend then momentarily left AAA with the group. After an hour, "Mata" and the four (4) male individuals held AAA. Tagle and the others undressed AAA. According to AAA, she tried to resist and run away, but she was boxed on her stomach and subsequently restrained. AAA claimed that while she was lying down, Tagle touched her breasts, removed her short pants, mounted her, and inserted his penis into her vagina. Meanwhile, the other five (5) male individuals did not do anything except watch Tagle rape AAA. When Tagle was finished having carnal knowledge of AAA, the other male individuals took turns in ravishing her as well. After the incident, they poked a knife at AAA and warned her not to report what happened to anyone or else something might happen to her family. At around two (2) o'clock in the morning, AAA's friend returned and found AAA crying at the grassy area. AAA then revealed to her friend that she was raped. Thereafter, she was brought to <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">xxxxxxxxxxx</span> Barangay Hall and then to the police station to report the incident. After narrating the incident, AAA, together with the police officers, proceeded to the <i>situs criminis</i> to look for her assailants, but they were nowhere to be found. They then went around <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">xxxxxxxxxxx</span>, where AAA saw and recognized Tagle eating <i>balut</i>. Accordingly, Tagle was arrested and brought to the police station. Meanwhile, on May 7, 2007, AAA, her mother, and their neighbor went to the Philippine National Police Crime Laboratory in Camp Crame, Quezon City, where AAA underwent a medico-legal examination. After examination, Dr. Joseph Palmero (Dr. Palmero) revealed that AAA suffered a deep-healed laceration at three (3) o'clock position, which was supposedly caused by blunt force or penetrating trauma. He also opined that the injuries sustained by AAA were consistent with the alleged incident of rape since a deeply healing laceration is a fresh laceration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> <br><br>For his part, Tagle denied the allegations against him. He maintained that when he was on his way home on May 6, 2007, he saw AAA with a certain· "Patis" and three (3) other men, who were altogether having a drinking spree. Tagle averred that when "Patis" invited him to drink, he only took one "shot" and left immediately. When Tagle arrived at his house, he stayed there for a while and subsequently went out to drink coffee at a store. Thereat, a policeman suddenly approached and arrested him for raping AAA. Consequently, Tagle was detained.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br><center><b>The RTC Ruling</b><br></center><br>In a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> dated November 15, 2013, the RTC found Tagle guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Rape, defined and penalized under Article 266-A of the RPC, in relation to RA 7610, and accordingly, sentenced him to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and to pay AAA the amounts of P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P75,000.00 as moral damages, and P50,000.00 as exemplary damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> It found the prosecution to have duly established all the essential elements of the crime charged, as it was proven that AAA was sexually abused by Tagle at the time of the incident. It gave credence to her candid, straightforward, and categorical account of the incident - which was adequately corroborated by the medical findings of Dr. Palmero - in convicting Tagle of the said crime. Meanwhile, Tagle did not present any evidence - as he only proffered a denial - to overcome the positive and unequivocal testimony of AAA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Aggrieved, Tagle appealed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> to the CA.<br><br><center><b>The CA Ruling</b><br></center><br>In a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> dated March 8, 2016, the CA affirmed Tagle's conviction with modification, finding him guilty of the crime of Rape under Article 266-A, paragraph 1 (a) of the RPC, as amended by RA 8353, and accordingly, sentencing him to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and ordering him to pay AAA the amounts of P75,000.00 as moral damages and P50,000.00 as exemplary damages, with interest at the rate of six percent (6%) on all damages awarded from the date of finality of its decision until fully paid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Agreeing with the RTC, the CA held that AAA was able to narrate the incident in its material points, unmistakably identifying Tagle as one of the men who raped her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Furthermore, it rejected Tagle's defense of non-flight for being insufficient to prove his innocence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>However, the CA ruled that Tagle should be convicted under Article 266-A, paragraph 1 (a) of the RPC, as amended by RA 8353, given that the prosecution's evidence only established that he sexually violated AAA through force and intimidation by threatening her with a bladed instrument and forcing her to submit to his bestial design.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> It further clarified the RTC's judgment of conviction, holding that the same was not grounded on conspiracy but on the individual and personal act of Tagle against AAA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Undeterred, Tagle filed the instant appeal.<br><br><center><b>The Issue Before the Court</b><br></center><br>The issue for the Court's resolution is whether or not Tagle's conviction for the crime of Rape should be upheld.<br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b><br></center><br>The appeal is bereft of merit.<br><br>"At the outset, it must be stressed that in criminal cases, an appeal throws the entire case wide open for review and the reviewing tribunal can correct errors, though unassigned in the appealed judgment, or even reverse the trial court's decision based on grounds other than those that the parties raised as errors. The appeal confers the appellate court full jurisdiction over the case and renders such court competent to examine records, revise the judgment appealed from, increase the penalty, and cite the proper provision of the penal law."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>As will be explained hereunder, the CA correctly upheld Tagle's conviction but erred in appreciating the use of a deadly weapon to perpetrate the crime of Rape against AAA.<br><br>Here, a plain reading of the Information reveals that Tagle was charged of the crime of Qualified Rape under Article 266-A, paragraph 1, in relation to Article 266-B, of the RPC, to wit:<br><blockquote>ART. 266-A. <i>Rape, When and How Committed</i>. - Rape is committed -<br><br>1. By a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:<br><br>a. <u><b>Through force, threat or intimidation;</b></u><br><br>b. When the offended party is deprived of reason or is otherwise unconscious;<br><br>c. By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority;<br><br>d. When the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age or is demented, even though none of the circumstances mentioned above be present.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>ART. 266-B. <i>Penalties</i>. - Rape under paragraph I of the next preceding article shall be punished by <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.<br><br><b>Whenever <u>the rape is committed with the use of a deadly weapon</u> or by two or more persons, <u>the penalty shall be <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua</span> to death</u>.</b><br><br>x x x x (Emphases and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>For the successful prosecution of the crime of Rape by sexual intercourse under Article 266-A, paragraph 1 of the RPC, the prosecution must establish that: (a) the offender had carnal knowledge of a woman; and (b) he accomplished this act through force, threat or intimidation, or when the victim was deprived of reason pr otherwise unconscious, or by means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority, or when the victim is under twelve (12) years of age or is demented.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Essentially, the gravamen of Rape is sexual intercourse with a woman against her will.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>In this case, the Court agrees with the findings of both the RTC and the CA that the prosecution established, <i>inter alia</i>, that: (<i>a</i>) on May 6, 2007, AAA and her friend went to the place of "Mata" at <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">xxxxxxxxxxx</span>, Las Piñas City; (<i>b</i>) when AAA and her friend arrived at the place of "Mata," the latter brought them to an unlighted grassy area, where Tagle and four (4) other male individuals were drinking; (<i>c</i>) when AAA's friend momentarily left her, AAA was held down, boxed on her stomach, and undressed by the male individuals for Tagle to have carnal knowledge of her; (<i>d</i>) after Tagle had carnal knowledge of AAA, the other male individuals took turns in raping her as well; (<i>e</i>) after the incident, :AAA reported the matter to the barangay and police authorities; and (<i>f</i>) upon the conduct of medical examination, Dr. Palmero confirmed that AAA was indeed raped. Verily, the assessment and findings of the trial court are generally accorded great weight, and are conclusive and binding to the Cburt if not tainted with arbitrariness or oversight of some fact or circumstance of weight and influence,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> which exceptions do not obtain in this case.<br><br>However, the CA should not have taken into account the qualifying circumstance of the use of a deadly weapon against AAA. Case law states that the penalty for the crime of Rape is increased from <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death if it is committed "with the use of a deadly weapon."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> In order for the qualifying circumstance of "use of a deadly weapon" - if the same is sufficiently alleged in the Information - to be appreciated, it must be proven that the deadly weapon was <u><b>used to make the victim submit to the will of the offender</b></u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Even the act of molding a bladed instrument, by itself, is strongly suggestive of force or, at least, intimidation, and <u><b>threatening the victim with the same is sufficient to bring her into submission</b></u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> In <i>People v. Dumadag</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> the Court ruled that:<br><blockquote>The intimidations made by the appellant are sufficient since it instilled fear in her mind that if she would not submit to his bestial demands, something bad would befall her. <b>"Well-settled is the rule that where the victim is threatened with bodily injury, as when the rapist is armed with a deadly weapon, such as a pistol, knife, ice pick or bolo, <u>such constitutes intimidation sufficient to bring the victim to submission to the lustful desires of the rapist</u>."</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>In this case, contrary to the finding of the CA that the rape was committed through force and intimidation given that Tagle threatened AAA with a knife and forced her to submit to his bestial designs, a close scrutiny of the records reveals that Tagle's act of threatening AAA with a knife actually happened after the commission of rape and not before or during the incident. Pertinently, the knife was not used to cause AAA to submit to Tagle's bestial designs, as in fact, it was only used to threaten her into silence, so she would not report the incident to anyone. AAA's testimony is enlightening on this matter:<br><blockquote>Q:&nbsp; By the way, while this Orlando Tagle was inserting or touching your body, did you hear him say anything?<br><br>A:&nbsp; Nothing, Ma'am.<br><br>Q:&nbsp; How about the other five male personas? Did they utter anything? <br><br>A:&nbsp; Yes, Ma'am.<br><br>Q:&nbsp; What did they say?<br><br>A:&nbsp; <u>I was told not to report the incident to anyone or else, something might happen to my family, Ma'am.</u><br><br>Q:&nbsp; While saying that, what did they do? <br><br>A:&nbsp; They were having fun, Ma'am.<br><br>Q:&nbsp; <u>Did they threaten you with anything to make you be (sic) quiet?</u> <br><br>A:&nbsp; <u>Yes, Ma'am.</u><br><br>Q:&nbsp; <u>What was that?</u><br><br>A:&nbsp; <u>A knife was poked at me, Ma'am.</u><br><br>Q:&nbsp; <u>What time was it poked on you? Was it before or after the rape was committed?</u><br><br>A:&nbsp; <u><b>After the incident</b>, Ma'am.</u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>The foregoing notwithstanding, in light of the fact that the prosecution duly established Tagle's employment of force and intimidation to accomplish his criminal desires and that this circumstance was properly alleged in the Information, his conviction for Rape is proper.<br><br>Given the above, Tagle must be sentenced to suffer the penalty of <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua</span> and ordered to pay AAA the amounts of P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P75,000.00 as moral damages, and P75,000.00 as exemplary damages,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> all with legal interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the date of finality of this Decision until fully paid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appeal is <b>DENIED</b>.
