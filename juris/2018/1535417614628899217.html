Section 21 of RA 9165 provides:<br><blockquote>SEC. 21. <i>Custody and Disposition of Confiscated, Seized and/or Surrendered Dangerous Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous Drugs, Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, Instruments/Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment</i>. - The PDEA shall take charge and have custody of all dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, as well as instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment so confiscated, seized and/or surrendered, for proper disposition in the following manner:<br><br><b>(1) The apprehending team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof;</b><br><br>(2) Within twenty-four (24) hours upon confiscation/seizure of dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, as well as instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment, the same shall be submitted to the PDEA Forensic Laboratory for a qualitative and quantitative examination;<br><br>(3) A certification of the forensic laboratory examination results, which shall be done under oath by the forensic laboratory examiner, shall be issued within twenty-four (24) hours after the receipt of the subject item/s: <i>Provided</i>, That when the volume of the dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, and controlled precursors and essential chemicals does not allow the completion of testing within the time frame, a partial laboratory examination report shall be provisionally issued stating therein the quantities of dangerous drugs still to be examined by the forensic laboratory: <i>Provided, however</i>, That a final certification shall be issued on the completed forensic laboratory examination on the same within the next twenty-four (24) hours; (Emphasis supplied and italics in the original)<br></blockquote>Filling in the details as to where the physical inventory and photographing of the seized items should be made is Section 21(a), Article II of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA 9165 (IRR) which reads: <br><blockquote><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(a)</div></td><td width="95%"> <div align="justify">The apprehending officer/team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof: <strong>Provided, that the physical inventory and photograph shall be conducted at the place where the search warrant is served; or at the nearest police station or at the nearest office of the apprehending officer/team, whichever is practicable, in case of warrantless seizures</strong>; xxx (Emphasis supplied)<br></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>The same likewise provides for a saving clause in case of nonÂ­compliance with the requirements of RA 9165 and the IRR, thus:<br><blockquote>xxx <b>Provided, further, that non-compliance with these requirements under Justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and invalid such seizures of and custody over said items;</b> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>The foregoing is echoed in Section 2(a) of the Dangerous Drugs Board (DDB) Regulation No. 1, Series of 2002, to wit:<br><blockquote>a.

In fact, the Affidavit<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> dated May 10, 2011 of IO3 Tablate belies the presence of a DOJ Representative even during the inventory, thus:<br><blockquote>I, <b>INTELLIGENCE OFFICER-3 ALEX M.

These witnesses must sign the inventory and be given copies thereof. <b>In the present case, from the evidence of the prosecution itself, none of the witnesses were present during the seizure and confiscation of the subject drugs.</b> <b>Moreover</b>, only two (2) of them - the punong barangay and the media representative - witnessed the photographing and signed the inventory.<br><br>On this note, considering that at the point of seizure, <i>i.e.</i>, the first link in the "chain of custody," irregularities were already attendant, it becomes futile to prove the the rest of the links in the chain. Simply put, since "planting" of the drugs was already made possible at the point of seizure because of the absence of all three (3) insulating witnesses, proving the chain after such point merely proves the chain of custody of planted drugs.<br><br><i>Adobar's flight serves as a waiver of his right to be present during the initial custody requirements of Section 21 of RA 9165, but does not excuse compliance by the buy-bust team with the presence of the three (3) insulating witnesses therein.</i><br><br>Apart from the three (3) insulating witnesses, Section 21 requires that the physical inventory and photographing of the seized drugs by the apprehending team immediately after confiscation and seizure be likewise made in the presence of, "<u><b>the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel</b></u>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup><br><br>The question arises: what if the person from whom the drugs were seized escaped?

The buy-bust team cannot be reasonably expected to secure the presence of the accused's representative or counsel at the time of confiscation and during the buy-bust operation, considering the clandestine nature of such operations. In the same vein, after such escape, it should be difficult, if not impossible, for the buy-bust team to find a counsel or representative for the accused before the initial custody requirements which Section 21 mandates to be performed "immediately after" the confiscation.<br><br>As such, the prosecution is <u>excused</u> from complying with the requirement of Section 21 as to the presence of the accused during the initial custody requirements, <i>i.e.</i>, physical inventory and photographing of the seized drugs. However, it is not excused as to the presence of the three (3) insulating witnesses, <i>i.e.</i>, the DOJ and media representative and elected public official. <u>The buy-bust team must still secure the presence of these insulating witnesses, and the prosecution must still prove such presence, not only during the inventory and photographing but likewise at the time of and at or near the intended place of confiscation and seizure of the subject drugs.</u><br><br>In the same vein, the buy-bust team need not secure the presence of the accused during the marking of the seized drugs as his escape serves as a waiver of his right to witness the same. As will be extensively discussed below, although Section 21 is silent as to the matter of marking of seized drugs, jurisprudence<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> teaches that consistency with the chain of custody rule requires the same to be done in the presence of the accused.<br><br><i>The prosecution failed to trigger the saving clause under the IRR of RA 9165.

No. 9165 is not necessarily fatal to the prosecution's case, the prosecution must still prove that (a) there is a justifiable ground for the non-compliance, and (b) the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items were properly preserved. Further, the non-compliance with the procedures must be justified by the State's agents themselves. The arresting officers are under obligation, should they be unable to comply with the procedures laid down under Section 21, Article II of R.A. No. 9165, to explain why the procedure was not followed and prove that the reason provided a justifiable ground. Otherwise, the requisites under the law would merely be fancy ornaments that may or may not be disregarded by the arresting officers at their own convenience.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup><br></blockquote><u>In this case, the prosecution did not acknowledge the lapses, much less offer a credible and justifiable ground for the failure of the buy-bust team to comply with Section 21.</u> No explanation was advanced as to why none of the insulating witnesses was present at the time of seizure and confiscation of the subject illegal drugs. Neither do the records show any justification as to why no DOJ representative was secured to witness the photographing and physical inventory of the seized drugs. Worse, the prosecution did not even concede such lapses. The affidavit of IO3 Tablate shows the indifference of the prosecution on its failure to comply with Section 21, thus:<br><blockquote>That IO-1 SIGLOS turned over to me, IO-3 TABLATE the one (1) piece of heat-sealed transparent sachet containing white crystalline substance also suspected to be shabu, which was the subject of the buyÂ­bust earlier transacted.<br><br>That during the inventory of the seized items/evidence recovered, which I, IO-3 TABLATE myself conducted in the very table itself where said items were found in plain view in the 2<sup>nd</sup> floor of the house of the suspects, the same were witnessed by the Barangay Captain himself of Brgy. Camaman-an and by a representative from the media through Magnum Radio.<br><br>That at the PDEA Regional Office-10, the arrested female suspect formally identified herself as <b>Jennifer C.

Camaman-an, Cagayan de Oro City while the other suspect who was able to elude arrest despite earnest effort to apprehend him was formally identified as <b>Aquilo Adobar</b>, 48 years old, married and a resident of the same barangay. The latter suspect is a targetÂ­listed personality as per PDEA National Drugs Information System (NDIS).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote>Hence, considering the prosecution neither acknowledged nor explained its noncompliance with Section 21, the first prong was not satisfied, thus leading to the inevitable conclusion that the saving clause was not triggered. Accordingly, there is no point anymore in determining if the second prong had been satisfied - <i>i.e.</i>, proving the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized illegal drugs.<br><br>To be sure, from the records, outside the non-compliance with Section 21, the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized illegal drugs are heavily tainted. The second prong, even if the Court allows proof of such despite failure to prove the first prong, seems difficult if not impossible to establish in light of the serious irregularities in the transfer of custody of the seized illegal drugs.<br><br>Proving the second prong of the saving clause - the integrity of the seized illegal drugs - despite non-compliance with Section 21 requires establishing the <u>four links in the chain of custody</u>: First, the seizure and marking, if practicable, of the illegal drug recovered from the accused by the apprehending officer; second, the turnover of the illegal drug seized by the apprehending officer to the investigating officer; third, the turnover by the investigating officer of the illegal drug to the forensic chemist for laboratory examination; and fourth, the turnover and submission of the marked illegal drug seized from the forensic chemist to the court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup><br><br><u>In the present case</u>, there was failure to mark the seized illegal drugs <i>immediately</i> after confiscation due to the palpable gap between the confiscation of the drugs to its subsequent marking which the prosecution utterly failed to explain.<br><br>Marking is the placing by the arresting officer or the poseur-buyer of his/her initials and signature on the items after they have been seized. In <i>People v. Beran</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup> the Court held that while the matter of marking of the seized illegal drugs in warrantless seizures is not expressly specified in Section 21, <u><b>consistency with the chain of custody rule requires that such marking should be done (1) in the presence of the apprehended violator and (2) immediately upon confiscation</b></u>, to wit:<br><blockquote>What Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165 and its implementing rule do not expressly specify is the matter of "marking" of the seized items in warrantless seizures to ensure that the evidence seized upon apprehension is the same evidence subjected to inventory and photography when these activities are undertaken at the police station rather than at the place of arrest. Consistency with the "chain of custody" rule requires that the "marking" of the seized items-to truly ensure that they are the same items that enter the chain and are eventually the ones offered in evidence-should be done (1) <b>in the presence of the apprehended violator (2) immediately upon confiscation</b>. This step initiates the process of protecting innocent persons from dubious and concocted searches, and of protecting as well the apprehending officers from harassment suits based on planting of evidence under Section 29 and on allegations of robbery or theft. xxx<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote>It is vital that the seized contrabands are immediately marked because succeeding handlers of the specimens will use the markings as reference. The Court has held:<br><blockquote><b>Crucial in proving [the] chain of custody is the marking of the seized drugs or other related items immediately after they are seized from the accused.</b> Marking after seizure is the starting point in the custodial link, thus it is <b>vital that the seized contraband[s] are immediately marked</b> because succeeding handlers of the specimens will use the markings as reference. The marking of the evidence serves to separate the marked evidence from the corpus of all other similar or related evidence from the time they are seized from the accused until they are disposed of at the end of criminal proceedings, obviating[,] switching, "planting," or contamination of evidence.<br><br><b>Long before Congress passed RA 9165, this Court has consistently held that failure of the authorities to immediately mark the seized drugs raises reasonable doubt on the authenticity of the <i>corpus delicti</i></b> and suffices to rebut the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties, the doctrinal fallback of every drug-related prosecution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup> (Additional emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>In the present case, a considerable period of time intervened between the confiscation of the subject drugs and its subsequent marking - which was unaccounted for by the prosecution. This gaping hiatus is brought about by the failure of the poseur buyer, IO1 Siglos, to credibly account for her whereabouts and the handling of the subject drugs from the time she confiscated the same from Adobar to the time she turned it over to IO3 Tablate for marking.

Being the first custodian in the chain and having held onto the then unmarked seized drugs for a considerable lapse of time, IO1 Siglos must clearly and convincingly account for her handling and care of the subject drugs before turning them over to IO3 Tablate for marking. In this, she failed, thus, effectively creating an obvious but unexplained break in the chain. Hence, assuming that the illegal drugs which went into the chain are actually the same drugs seized from Adobar's person, <i>i.e.</i>, assuming the same were not planted at the point of seizure, there remains that great possibility of switching while the same were in IO1 Siglos' custody.<br><br>The foregoing conflicting narrations, seemingly trivial when viewed in isolation, cast very serious doubts on the veracity of the prosecution's overall narrative when juxtaposed against the procedural lapses of the buyÂ­bust team and its abject failure to justify said lapses.<br><br><i>Courts must be extra vigilant in trying drugs cases.</i><br><br>Unfortunately, the CA and the trial court glossed over these obvious irregularities which attended the present buy-bust operation and the resulting confiscation of the subject drugs.<br><br>The CA, while seemingly recognizing the lapses in observing Section 21,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup> simply dismissed the same "because it was shown by the prosecution that the integrity and evidentiary value of the specimens were properly preserved by the buy-bust team."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup> In other words, the CA excused the failure of the buy-bust team to comply with Section 21 on the basis of the second prong of the saving clause (that the integrity and evidentiary value of the subject drugs are established) <b>but <u>ignoring altogether</u> the first prong (absence of justifiable reasons for the procedural lapses)</b>. The CA justifies its decision to excuse this nonÂ­observance of Section 21 by ruling that only substantial adherence thereto is required.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup><br><br><b>This position taken by the CA is mistaken.</b> To reiterate, the procedure enshrined in Section 21 is a matter of substantive law and cannot be brushed aside as a simple procedural technicality.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup> Substantive law requires strict observance of these procedural safeguards.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> Courts, in resolving drugs cases must keep in mind this mandate and the peculiar nature of buy-bust operations being susceptible to police abuse as discussed by the Court, thus:<br><blockquote>xxx a buy-bust operation has a significant downside that has not escaped the attention of the framers of the law. It is susceptible to police abuse, the most notorious of which is its use as a tool for extortion. In <i>People v. Tan</i>, this Court itself recognized that <i>by the very nature of antiÂ­-narcotics operations, the need for entrapment procedures, the use of shady characters as informants, the ease with which sticks of marijuana or grams of heroin can be planted in pockets of or hands of unsuspecting provincial hicks, and the secrecy that inevitably shrouds all drug deals, the possibility of abuse is great</i>. xxx<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup> (Italics in the original)<br></blockquote>For this, the Court has instructed lower courts to exercise extra vigilance in trying drugs cases "lest an innocent person be made to suffer the unusually severe penalties for drug offenses."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup> The presumption that regular duty was performed by the arresting officers simply cannot prevail over the presumption of innocence granted to the accused by the Constitution. It is thus incumbent upon the prosecution to prove that the accused is indeed guilty beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup><br><br>At this point, it is well to emphasize that this case involves a meager 0.03 gram of <i>shabu</i>. Courts must employ heightened scrutiny, consistent with the requirement of proof beyond reasonable doubt, in evaluating cases involving miniscule amounts of drugs as they can be readily planted and tampered with.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup> Consistent with this, in <i>People v. Segundo</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup> involving the same amount of drugs as the case at hand (0.03 gram), the Court emphasized the extra caution that law enforcers must observe in preserving the integrity of small amounts of seized drugs, thus:<br><blockquote><b>To sum, "[l]aw enforcers should not trifle with the legal requirement to ensure integrity in the chain of custody of seized dangerous drugs and drug paraphernalia." Thus, "[t]his is especially true when only a miniscule amount of dangerous drugs is alleged to have been taken from the accused."</b><br><br>Although the miniscule quantity of confiscated illicit drugs is solely by itself not a reason for acquittal, this instance accentuates the importance of conformity to Section 21 that the law enforcers in this case miserably failed to do so. If initially there were already significant lapses on the marking, inventory, and photographing of the alleged seized items, a doubt on the integrity of the <i>corpus delicti</i> concomittantly exists. xxx<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Adobar's defense of denial is concededly weak and uncorroborated. This weakness, however, does not add strength to the prosecution's case as the evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own weight. Well-entrenched in jurisprudence is the rule that the conviction of an accused must rest not on the weakness of the defense but on the strength of the evidence of the prosecution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[121]</sup><br><br>Based on the foregoing and following the Court's precedents as discussed above, the Court is constrained to reverse Adobar's conviction.<br><br>The prosecution failed to prove the <i>corpus delicti</i> of the crime due to the serious lapses in observing Section 21 of RA 9165 and the concomitant failure to trigger the saving clause. Anent the latter point, the prosecution utterly failed to acknowledge and credibly justify its procedural lapses and was unable to prove the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized drugs. Adobar's innocence, as presumed and protected by the Constitution, must stand in light of the reasonable doubt on his guilt.<br><br>To conclude, the Court issues anew a reminder: The prosecution arm of the government has the duty to prove, beyond reasonable doubt, each and every element of the crime charged. In illegal drugs cases, this includes proving faithful compliance with Section 21 of RA 9165, being fundamental to establishing the element of <i>corpus delicti</i>. <u><b>In the course of proving such compliance before the trial courts, prosecutors must have the initiative to not only acknowledge, but also justify, any perceived deviations from the procedural requirements of Section 21.</b></u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup><br><br><b>As no less than the liberty of an accused is at stake, appellate courts, this Court included, must, in turn, sift the records to determine if, indeed, the apprehending team observed Section 21 and if not, if the same is justified under the circumstances.</b> This, regardless if issues thereon were ever raised or threshed out in the lower court/s, consistent with the doctrine that appeal in criminal cases throws the whole case open for review and the appellate court must correct errors in the appealed judgment whether they are assigned or not.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup> If, from such full examination of the records, there appears unjustified failure to comply with Section 21, it becomes the appellate court's bounded duty to acquit the accused, and perforce, overturn a conviction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[124]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the Decision dated July 31, 2015 of the CA in CA-G.R.

Be that as it may, I would like to emphasize on important matters relative to Section 21 of R.A.

No. 10640,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> which amended Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165, now only requires <b>two (2) witnesses</b> to be present during the conduct of the physical inventory and taking of photograph of the seized items, namely: (a) an elected public official; <u><b>and</b></u> (b) either a representative from the National Prosecution Service <u><b>or</b></u> the media.<br><br>In her Sponsorship Speech on Senate Bill No. 2273, which eventually became R.A. No. 10640, Senator Grace Poe conceded that "while Section 21 was enshrined in the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act to safeguard the integrity of the evidence acquired and prevent planting of evidence, the application of said Section resulted in the ineffectiveness of the government's campaign to stop the increasing drug addiction and also, in the conflicting decisions of the courts."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Senator Poe stressed the necessity for the amendment of Section 21 based on the public hearing that the Senate Committee on Public Order and Dangerous Drugs had conducted, which revealed that "compliance with the rule on witnesses during the physical inventory is difficult. For one, media representatives are not always available in all comers of the Philippines, especially in the remote areas. For another there were instances where elected <i>barangay</i> officials themselves were involved in the punishable acts apprehended and thus, it is difficult to get the most grassroot-elected public official to be a witness as required by law."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>In his Co-sponsorship speech, Senator Vicente C. Sotto III said that in view of the substantial number of acquittals in drug-related cases due to the varying interpretations of prosecutors and judges on Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165, there is a need for "certain adjustments so that we can plug the loopholes in our existing law" and ensure [its] standard implementation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Senator Sotto explained why the said provision should be amended:<br><blockquote>Numerous drug trafficking activities can be traced to operations of highly organized and powerful local and international syndicates. The presence of such syndicates that have the resources and the capability to mount a counter-assault to apprehending law enforcers makes the requirement of Section 21(a) impracticable for law enforcers to comply with. It makes the place of seizure extremely unsafe for the proper inventory and photograph of the seized illegal drugs.<br><br>xxxx<br><br>Section 21(a) of RA 9165 need to be amended to address the foregoing situation. We did not realize this in 2002 where the safety of the law enforcers and other persons required to be present in the inventory and photography of seized illegal drugs and the preservation of the very existence of seized illegal drugs itself are threatened by an immediate retaliatory action of drug syndicates at the place of seizure. The place where the seized drugs may be inventoried and photographed has to include a location where the seized drugs as well as the persons who are required to be present during the inventory and photograph are safe and secure from extreme danger.<br><br>It is proposed that the physical inventory and taking of photographs of seized illegal drugs be allowed to be conducted either in the place of seizure of illegal drugs or at the nearest police station or office of the apprehending law enforcers. The proposal will provide effective measures to ensure the integrity of seized illegal drugs since a safe location makes it more probable for an inventory and photograph of seized illegal drugs to be properly conducted, thereby reducing the incidents of dismissal of drug cases due to technicalities.<br><br>Non-observance of the prescribed procedures should not automatically mean that the seizure or confiscation is invalid or illegal, as long as the law enforcement officers could justify the same and could prove that the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are not tainted. This is the effect of the inclusion in the proposal to amend the phrase "justifiable grounds." There are instances where there are no media people or representatives from the DOJ available and the absence of these witnesses should not automatically invalidate the drug operation conducted. Even the presence of a public local elected official also is sometimes impossible especially ifthe elected official is afraid or scared.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br></blockquote>However, under the original provision of Section 21 and its IRR, which is applicable at the time the appellant committed the crimes charged, the apprehending team was required to immediately conduct a physical inventory and photograph the drugs after their seizure and confiscation in the presence of no less than <b>three (3) witnesses</b>, namely: (a) a representative from the media, <u><b>and</b></u> (b) the DOJ, <u><b>and</b></u>; (c) any elected public official who shall be required to sign copies of the inventory and be given copy thereof. The presence of the three witnesses was intended as a guarantee against planting of evidence and frame up, as they were "necessary to insulate the apprehension and incrimination proceedings from any taint of illegitimacy or irregularity."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>The prosecution bears the burden of proving a valid cause for nonÂ­ compliance with the procedure laid down in Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165, as amended. It has the positive duty to demonstrate observance thereto in such a way that during the trial proceedings, it must initiate in acknowledging and justifying any perceived deviations from the requirements oflaw.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Its failure to follow the mandated procedure must be adequately explained, and must be proven as a fact in accordance with the rules on evidence. It should take note that the rules require that the apprehending officers do not simply mention a justifiable ground, but also clearly state this ground in their sworn affidavit, coupled with a statement on the steps they took to preserve the integrity of the seized items.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Its strict adherence to Section 21 is required where the quantity of illegal drugs seized is minuscule to prevent incidents of planting, tampering or alteration of evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Here, the prosecution failed to discharge its burden.<br><br>With respect to the presence of all the required witnesses under Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165, the prosecution never alleged and proved any of the following reasons, such as: (1) <b>their attendance was impossible because the place of arrest was a remote area;</b> (2) <b>their safety during the inventory and photograph of the seized drugs was threatened by an immediate retaliatory action of the accused or any person/s acting for and in his/her behalf;</b> (3) <b>the elected official themselves were involved in the punishable acts sought to be apprehended;</b> (4) <b>earnest efforts to secure the presence of a DOJ or media representative and an elected public official within the period required under Article 125</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><b> of the Revised Penal Code prove futile through no fault of the arresting officers, who face the threat of being charged with arbitrary detention; or</b> (5) <b>time constraints and urgency of the anti-drug operations, which often rely on tips of confidential assets, prevented the law enforcers from obtaining the presence of the required witnesses even before the offenders could escape</b>.<br><br>Invocation of the disputable presumptions that the police officers regularly performed their official duty and that the integrity of the evidence is presumed to be preserved, will not suffice to uphold appellant's conviction. Judicial reliance on the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty despite the lapses in the procedures undertaken by the agents of the law is fundamentally flawed because the lapses themselves are affirmative proofs of irregularity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> The presumption may only arise when there is a showing that the apprehending officer/team followed the requirements of Section 21 or when the saving clause found in the IRR is successfully triggered. In this case, the presumption of regularity had been contradicted and overcome by evidence of non-compliance with the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>At this point, it is not amiss to express my position regarding the issue of which between the Congress and the Judiciary has jurisdiction to determine sufficiency of compliance with the rule on chain of custody, which essentially boils down to the application of procedural rules on admissibility of evidence. In this regard, I agree with the view of Hon. Associate Justice Teresita J. Leonardo-De Castro in <i>People v. Teng Moner y Adam</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> that "if the evidence of illegal drugs was not handled precisely in the manner prescribed by the chain of custody rule, the consequence relates not to inadmissibility that would automatically destroy the prosecution's case but rather to the weight of evidence presented for each particular case." As aptly pointed out by Justice Leonardo-De Castro, the Court's power to promulgate judicial rules, including rules of evidence, is no longer shared by the Court with Congress.<br><br>I subscribe to the view of Justice Leonardo-De Castro that the chain of custody rule is a matter of evidence and a rule of procedure, and that the Court has the last say regarding the appreciation of evidence. Evidentiary matters are indeed well within the powers of courts to appreciate and rule upon, and so, when the courts fmd appropriate, substantial compliance with the chain of custody rule as long as the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items have been preserved may warrant the conviction of the accused.<br><br>I further submit that <b>the requirements of marking the seized items, conduct of inventory and taking photograph in the presence of a representative from the media or the DOJ and a local elective official, are police investigation procedures which call for administrative sanctions in case of non-compliance. Violation of such procedure may even merit penalty under R.A. No. 9165</b>, to wit:<br><blockquote><b>Section 29.</b> <i>Criminal Liability for Planting of Evidence</i>. - Any person who is found guilty of uplanting" any dangerous drug and/or controlled precursor and essential chemical, regardless of quantity and purity, shall suffer the penalty of death.<br><br><b>Section 32.</b> <i>Liability to a Person Violating Any Regulation Issued by the Board</i>. - The penalty of imprisonment ranging from six (6) months and one (1) day to four (4) years and a fine ranging from Ten thousand pesos (P10,000.00) to Fifty thousand pesos (P50,000.00) shall be imposed upon any person found violating any regulation duly issued by the Board pursuant to this Act, in addition to the administrative sanctions imposed by the Board.<br></blockquote>However, non-observance of such police administrative procedures should not affect the validity of the seizure of the evidence, because the issue of chain of custody is ultimately anchored on the admissibility of evidence, which is exclusively within the prerogative of the courts to decide in accordance with the rules on evidence.<br><br><hr width="60%" align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> "<i>AN ACT INSTITUTING THE COMPREHENSIVE DANGEROUS DRUGS ACT OF 2002, REPEALING REPUBLIC ACT NO. 6425, OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE DANGEROUS DRUGS ACT OF 1972, AS AMENDED, PROVIDING FUNDS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES</i>"<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Sec. 21. <i>Custody and Disposition of Confiscated, Seized, and/or Surrendered Dangerous Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous Drugs, Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, Instruments/Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment</i>. - The PDEA shall take charge and have custody of all dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, as well as instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment so confiscated, seized and/or surrendered, for proper disposition in the following manner:<br><blockquote>(1) The apprehending team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof;<br></blockquote><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> <i>People v.
