During the confrontation, De Torres suddenly arrived and hacked Endaya with a bolo several times.

Olga Aceron Virtucion, Municipal Health Officer of San Juan, Batangas, to prove the injuries sustained by Endaya and that he had acted in self-defense; and the certification<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>&nbsp; from the San Juan Municipal Police Station to prove that he surrendered on 22 November 1999.<br><br><b><i> The RTC Ruling</i></b><br><br>In its decision, the RTC found Endaya guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crimes of parricide and homicide. The trial court ratiocinated that Endaya failed to satisfy the requirements of self-defense. It found ludicrous Endaya's claim that he had mistakenly stabbed both Jocelyn and Marietta. It further noted that the anatomical sketch presented by the defense indicated no hack wound, but mere scratches and contusions. Lastly, the trial court opined that the multiple stab wounds sustained by the victims proved that the means used by Endaya to repel the alleged aggression were not reasonable nor necessary. It, nevertheless, credited in his favor the benefit of the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender. The dispositive portion reads:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE,</b> in view of the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered as follows:<br><br>In <u><b>Criminal Case No. 058</b></u>, the Court finds the accused <b>Arsenio Endaya Jr.</b> <i>alias </i><b>"Pugo" GUILTY</b> [of] the crime of <i>Parricide </i>defined in and penalized by <i>Article 246 of the Revised Penal Code </i>and hereby imposes on said accused the penalty of <i>Reclusion Perpetua </i>with all the accessory penalties of the law.<br><br>In <u><b>Criminal Case No. 059</b></u>, the Court finds the same accused GUILTY [of] the crime of <i>Homicide </i>defined in and penalized under <i>Article 249 of the Revised Penal Code </i>with the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender to a person in authority. Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the Court hereby imposes upon the said accused the penalty of imprisonment of Six (6) years and One (1) day of <i>prision mayor </i>as minimum to Eight (8) years of <i>prision mayor </i>as maximum.<br><br>Accused is ordered to pay the heirs of the victims the stipulated amounts of Eighty Thousand Pesos (Php 80,000.00) as actual damages for the wake, funeral and burial of the deceased; Three Hundred Fifty Thousand Pesos (Php 350,000.00) for the loss of income of victim <b>Jocelyn Quita-Endaya;</b> and Twenty Thousand Pesos (Php 20,000.00) for the loss of income of <b>Marietta Bukal-Quita.</b><br><br>Accused is further ordered to pay death indemnity of Fifty Thousand Pesos (Php 50,000.00) for each victim.<br><br>The period [in] which accused has undergone preventive imprisonment during the pendency of these cases shall be credited to him provided he agreed in writing to abide by and comply strictly with the rules and regulations imposed upon committed prisoners.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br></blockquote>Aggrieved, Endaya appealed before the CA.<br><br><br><i> <b>The CA Ruling</b></i><br><br>In its assailed decision, the CA affirmed with modification the RTC's decision. The appellate court concurred with the trial court that the defense failed to prove that the acts charged were committed in self-defense, thus, it affirmed Endaya's conviction for parricide and homicide. The appellate court, however, noted that the RTC erred in its imposition of the penalty for homicide. It noted that applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the maximum penalty, considering the attendant mitigating circumstance, should be <i> reclusion temporal </i> in its minimum period, and not <i> prision mayor. </i> The appellate court further updated the award of civil indemnity to conform to prevailing jurisprudence on the matter. The dispositive portion of the assailed decision provides:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appeal is <b>DENIED</b>. The Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 87 of Rosario, Batangas, dated December 10, 2010, in Criminal Case No. RY2K-058 and Criminal Case No. RY2K-059 finding Accused-Appellant Arsenio [E]ndaya, [Jr.] guilty of the crimes charged is <b>AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION.</b> As modified, the ruling of the trial court should read as follows:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered as follows:<br><br>In Criminal Case No. [RY2K-]058, the Court finds the accused Arsenio [E]nday[a] Jr., alias "Pugo" GUILTY for the crime of Parricide defined in and penalized by Article 246 of the Revised Penal Code and hereby imposes on said accused the penalty of Reclusion Perpetua with all the accessory penalties of the law.<br><br>In Criminal Case No. [RY2k-]059, the Court finds the same accused GUILTY for the crime of Homicide defined in and penalized under Article 249 of the Revised Penal Code with tmitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender to a person in authority. Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the Court hereby imposes upon the said accused the penalty of imprisonment of Six (6) years and One (1) day of prision mayor as minimum to <b>Twelve (12) years and One (1) day of reclusion temporal.</b><br><br>Accused is ordered to pay the heirs of the victims the stipulated amounts of Eighty Thousand Pesos (Php80,000.00) as actual damages for the wake, funeral and burial of the deceased; Three Hundred Fifty Thousand Pesos (Php350,000.00) for the loss of income of victim Jocelyn Quita-Endaya; and Twenty Thousand Pesos (Php20,000.00) for the loss of income of Marietta Bukal-Quita.<br><br>Accused is further ordered to pay the death indemnity of <b>Seventy Five Thousand Pesos (Php75,000.00), and moral damages of Fifty Thousand Pesos (Php50,000.00)</b> for each victim.<br><br><b>Finally, interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum shall be applied to the award of civil indemnity, moral damages and exemplary damages from the finality of judgment until fully paid in the two (2) aforementioned criminal cases.</b><br><br>The period which accused has undergone preventive imprisonment during the pendency of these cases shall be credited to him provided he agreed in writing to abide by and comply strictly with the rules and regulations imposed upon committed prisoners.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>&nbsp; (emphases in the original)</blockquote></blockquote><br>Undaunted, Endaya elevated the present appeal to this Court.<br><br><div align="CENTER"><b>THE ISSUE</b><br></div><br><blockquote>WHETHER THE TRIAL AND APPELLATE COURTS ERRED WHEN THEY FAILED TO APPRECIATE THE JUSTIFYING CIRCUMSTANCE OF SELF-DEFENSE IN FAVOR OF ENDAYA.</blockquote><br><br><div align="CENTER"><b>THE COURT'S RULING </b></div><br><br>The appeal lacks merit.<br><br><b><i> Requisites for the appreciation <br>of self-defense</i></b><br><br>There is no question that Endaya was the author of the deaths of his wife, Jocelyn, and his mother-in-law, Marietta. What is left for the Court to determine whether the defense satisfied the requisites of self-defense to exculpate Endaya from criminal liability for parricide and homicide.<br><br>It is settled that when the accused pleads self-defense and effectively admits that he killed the victim, the burden of evidence shifts to him. By admitting the commission of the act charged and pleading avoidance based on the law, he must rely on the strength of his own evidence to prove that the facts that the legal avoidance requires are present; the weakness of the prosecution's evidence is immaterial after he admitted the commission of the act charged.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> It becomes incumbent upon the accused to prove his lack of criminal responsibility by clear and convincing evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>To successfully claim self-defense, the accused must satisfactorily prove that: (1) the victim mounted an unlawful aggression against the accused; (2) that the means employed by the accused to repel or prevent the aggression were reasonable and necessary; and (3) the accused did not offer any sufficient provocation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Measured against these criteria, the Court finds that Endaya's claim of self-defense must fail. His appeal must, perforce, be dismissed for utter lack of merit.<br><br><i> <b>The defense failed to<br>establish self-defense.</b></i><br><br>It is elementary that unlawful aggression on the part of the victim is the primordial consideration in self-defense. Absent this element, there could be no self-defense, whether complete or incomplete.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> For unlawful aggression to be appreciated there must be an actual, sudden and unexpected attack or imminent danger thereof, not merely a threatening or intimidating attitude.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Endaya miserably failed to establish unlawful aggression on the part of De Torres and/or the victims. Aside from their absurdity, Endaya's claims are unsubstantiated by any physical evidence. The anatomical sketch, which was taken the day after the incident, bore nothing which would be consistent with his claims that De Torres hacked him several times. The anatomical sketch made no mention of any hack wound on Endaya's face, back, shoulder, or any other part of his body, but merely indicated that Endaya sustained scratches, the gravest of which being a laceration on his left hand. Contrary to his claims, these minor injuries suggest that they may have been inflicted by Jocelyn and Marietta who resisted the attacks of their ruthless assailant. Thus, the Court could not simply accept Endaya's bare claim that he was hacked by De Torres several times considering the absence of wounds matching his allegation.<br><br>Assuming <i>arguendo </i>that there was indeed unlawful aggression on the part of De Torres and/or any of the two victims, the defense failed to sufficiently explain how the victims ended up with four (4) stab wounds each, nor to establish that the means employed by Endaya to repel the alleged unlawful aggression was reasonable and necessary. Indeed, Endaya admitted that he stabbed Jocelyn at least twice. The fact that the victims suffered multiple stab wounds – four each – which caused their deaths belies and negates Endaya's claim of self-defense. If at all, these stab wounds demonstrate a criminal mind resolved to end the life of the victims.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Clearly, there is no showing that the trial court nor the appellate court overlooked, misunderstood, or misapplied facts or circumstances of weight which would have affected the outcome of the case. Thus, the Court finds no reason to deviate from the findings of both the trial and appellate courts.<br><br><b><i> Penalties and Monetary Awards</i></b><br><br>The Court further concurs with the modifications made by the appellate court with respect to the penalty for homicide.<br><br>Under Article 249 of the Revised Penal Code, any person found guilty of homicide shall be meted the penalty of <i>reclusion temporal, </i>a penalty which contains three (3) periods. In this regard, Article 64(2) states that when only a mitigating circumstance attended the commission of the felony, the penalty shall be imposed in its minimum period. Thus, applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the maximum penalty shall be <i>reclusion temporal </i>in its minimum period, while the minimum penalty shall be <i>prision mayor </i>in any of its periods.<br><br>The Court further affirms the monetary awards as adjusted by the appellate court, but modifies it with respect to the amount of moral damages in Criminal Case No. RY2K-058. In <i>People v. Jugueta,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> the Court opined that when parricide is consummated and <i>reclusion perpetua </i>is imposed for reasons other than Republic Act No. 9346, the court may award moral damages in the amount of P75,000.00 and exemplary damages in the amount of P75,000.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Thus, the Court finds it just to increase the amount of moral damages awarded to the heirs of Jocelyn from P50,000.00 to P75,000.00. In addition, exemplary damages in the amount of P75,000.00 is also awarded to the heirs of Jocelyn.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the assailed Decision, dated 24 September 2015, of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 05156 which affirmed with modifications the 10 December 2010 Decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 87, Rosario, Batangas, in Criminal Case Nos.
