AAA claimed that sometime in April 2010, when she was just 13 years old, her mother XXX brought her to a hotel in Makati to meet with a certain John Hubbard who proceeded to have sexual intercourse with her. AAA further alleged that from 2008 to 2011, XXX ordered her to engage in cybersex for three (3) to four (4) times a week in pornographic websites where AAA was shown in her underwear and made to do sexual activities in front of the computer. For their part, BBB and CCC corroborated AAA's statements, both averring that from 2010-2011, XXX ordered them to dance naked in front of the computer with internet connectivity while facilitating the webcam sessions and chatting with a certain "Sam," their usual client. BBB and CCC alleged that during those sessions, their father YYY would be outside the room or fixing the computer. The children all claimed that they were made to do sexual activities to earn money for their household expenses which were collected by YYY in remittance centers.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Sometime in February 2011, AAA sought the assistance of the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) as she wanted her and her siblings to be rescued. AAA was then taken by the DSWD Social Worker, who then coordinated with the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI). After making an investigation and a technical verification of the pornographic websites which revealed photos and transactions of AAA, the NBI applied for and was granted a search warrant. Subsequently, the law enforcement authorities implemented the search warrant, resulting in the rescue of AAA, BBB, and CCC, the confiscation of the computer units and paraphernalia connected with the alleged crimes, and the arrest of both XXX and YYY.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>For their defense, accused-appellants denied the accusations and claimed not knowing any motive for their children's accusations as XXX is a housewife, while YYY works at a printing press.

In this regard, the RTC pointed out that accused-appellants' assertion that the charges against them are merely fabricated cannot be given credence in light of the children's clear and straightforward testimonies and the lack of ill motive to testify against their own parents.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Aggrieved, accused-appellants appealed to the CA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br><center><b>The CA Ruling</b></center><br><br>In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> dated August 25, 2017, the CA affirmed accused-appellants' conviction, with the following modifications: <i>(a)</i> YYY's conviction is reduced to three (3) counts of Qualified Trafficking in Persons; and <i>(b)</i> the awards of damages for the victims were increased to P500,000.00 as moral damages and P100,000.00 as exemplary damages.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>In affirming accused-appellants' respective convictions, the CA gave credence to the testimonies of the three (3) children-victims who not only positively identified accused-appellants as the perpetrators of the crime, but also straightforwardly explained the acts of sexual exploitation perpetuated against them by their own parents. This notwithstanding, the CA found it appropriate to find the children's father, YYY, guilty for only three (3) counts of Qualified Trafficking, as he was only named as an accused in three (3) of the four (4) total Informations<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> for such crime filed before the RTC.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Hence, this appeal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br><center><b>The Issue Before the Court</b></center><br><br>The issue for the Court's resolution is whether or not XXX and YYY are guilty beyond reasonable doubt of four (4) and three (3) counts, respectively, of Qualified Trafficking in Persons.<br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b></center><br><br>The appeal is without merit.<br><br>Section 3 (a) of RA 9208 defines the term "Trafficking in Persons" as the "recruitment, transportation, transfer or harboring, or receipt of persons with or without the victim's consent or knowledge, within or across national borders by means of threat or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the person, or, the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person for the purpose of exploitation which includes at a minimum, the exploitation or the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery, servitude or the removal or sale of organs." The same provision further provides that "[t]he recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring or receipt of a child for the purpose of exploitation shall also be considered as 'trafficking in persons' even if it does not involve any of the means set forth in the preceding paragraph." ." The crime of "Trafficking in Persons" becomes qualified under, among others, the following circumstances:<br><br><blockquote>Section 6. <i>Qualified Trafficking in Persons. </i>‚Äì The following are considered as qualified trafficking:<br><br>(a) When the trafficked person is a child;<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(d) When the offender is an ascendant, parent, sibling, guardian or a person who exercises authority over the trafficked person or when the offense is committed by a public officer or employee;<br><br>x x x x</blockquote><br><br>In this case, accused-appellants were charged of three (3) counts each of Qualified Trafficking in Persons under Section 4 (e) in relation to Section 6 (a) and (d) of RA 9208. XXX was further charged with another count of the same crime under Section 4 (a) also in relation to Section 6 (a) and (d) of the same law. Section 4 (a) and (e) of RA 9208 reads:<br><br><blockquote>Section 4. <i>Acts of Trafficking in Persons. ‚Äì</i> It shall be unlawful for any person, natural or juridical, to commit any of the following acts:<br><br>(a) To recruit, transport, transfer, harbor, provide, or receive a person by any means, including those done under the pretext of domestic or overseas employment or training or apprenticeship, for the purpose of prostitution, pornography, sexual exploitation, forced labor, slavery, involuntary servitude or debt bondage;<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(e) To maintain or hire a person to engage in prostitution or pornography;<br><br>x x x x</blockquote><br><br>As correctly ruled by the courts <i>a quo, </i>accused-appellants are guilty beyond reasonable doubt of three (3) counts of Qualified Trafficking in Persons under Section 4 (e) in relation to Section 6 (a) and (d) of RA 9208 as the prosecution had established beyond reasonable doubt that: <i>(a)</i> they admittedly are the biological parents of AAA, BBB, and CCC, who were all minors when the crimes against them were committed; <i>(b)</i> they made their children perform acts of cybersex for different foreigner customers, and thus, engaged them in prostitution and pornography; <i>(c)</i> they received various amounts of money in exchange for the sexual exploitation of their children; and <i>(d)</i> they achieved their criminal design by taking advantage of their children's vulnerability as minors and deceiving them that the money they make from their lewd shows are needed for the family's daily sustenance.<br><br>In the same manner, the courts <i>a quo </i>likewise correctly convicted XXX of one (1) count of the same crime, this time under Section 4 (a) in relation to Section 6 (a) and (d) of RA 9208, as it was shown that XXX transported and provided her own minor biological child, AAA, to a foreigner in Makati City for the purpose of prostitution, again under the pretext that the money acquired from such illicit transaction is needed for their family's daily sustenance.<br><br>In light of the foregoing, the Court finds no reason to deviate from the factual findings of the trial court, as affirmed by the CA, as there is no indication that it overlooked, misunderstood or misapplied the surrounding facts and circumstances of the case. In fact, the trial court was in the best position to assess and determine the credibility of the witnesses presented by both parties, and hence, due deference should be accorded to the same.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> As such, accused-appellants' conviction for Qualified Trafficking in Persons must be upheld.<br><br>Anent the proper penalty to be imposed on accused-appellants, Section 10 (c) of RA 9208 states that persons found guilty of Qualified Trafficking shall suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of not less than P2,000,000.00 but not more than P5,000,000.00. Thus, the courts <i>a quo </i>correctly sentenced them to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and to pay a fine of P2,000,000.00 for each count of Qualified Trafficking in Persons.<br><br>Finally, the courts <i>a quo </i>correctly ordered accused-appellants to pay the victims the amounts of P500,000.00 as moral damages and P100,000.00 as exemplary damages for each count of Qualified Trafficking in Persons as such amounts are at par with prevailing jurisprudence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Further, the Court deems it proper to impose on all monetary awards due to the victims legal interest of six percent (6%) per annum from finality of judgment until full payment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the appeal is <b>DENIED.</b> The Decision dated August 25, 2017 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
