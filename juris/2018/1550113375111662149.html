				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The procedures laid down by law on the handling and inventory of dangerous drugs seized from an accused during a buy-bust operation are non-negotiable safeguards of constitutional rights.

The RTC convicted the accused-appellant for violation of Section 5 in relation to Section 26, Article II of Republic Act (<i>R.A.</i>) No. 9165.

The opposing ideological interaction of these presumptions is common in the prosecution of drug-related offenses. Hence, the Court deems it necessary to reiterate past jurisprudential precepts on the proper application of both presumptions.<br><br>On one hand, the accused in a criminal case enjoys the constitutional presumption of innocence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> To overturn this presumption, the prosecution must proffer proof beyond reasonable doubt, or that quantum of proof sufficient to produce a moral certainty as to convince and satisfy the conscience of those who act in judgment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> The constitutional presumption of innocence requires the courts to take "a more than casual consideration" of every circumstance or doubt favoring the innocence of the accused.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> Here, the State through the prosecution, carries the <i>onus probandi</i> or <b>burden of proof</b> in establishing the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt, as a consequence of the tenet "<i>ei incumbit probation, qui dicit, non qui negat</i>," that "he who asserts, not he who denies, must prove"; and as a means of respecting the presumption of innocence in favor of the man or woman on the dock for a crime.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> Once the prosecution overcomes the presumption of innocence by proving the elements of the crime and the identity of the accused as perpetrator beyond reasonable doubt, the <b>burden of evidence</b> then <b><i>shifts</i></b> to the defense. The defense shall then test the strength of the prosecution's case either by showing that no crime was, in fact, committed or that the accused could not have committed or did not commit the imputed crime, or at the very least, by casting doubt on the guilt of the accused.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty comes into play <b><i>only when</i></b> an accused interposes the defense of frame-up or extortion which he or she is bound to establish by clear and convincing evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> To rebut this presumption, the accused must present affirmative evidence of irregularity or of failure to perform one's duty.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> More importantly, such presumption stands only when no reason exists in the records by which to doubt the regularity of the performance of official duty.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup><br><br>More clearly, the presumption of regularity in the performance of duty cannot prevail over the stronger presumption of innocence favoring the accused; otherwise, the constitutional guarantee of the accused being presumed innocent would be held subordinate to a mere rule of evidence allocating the burden of evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> Notwithstanding the jurisprudential <i>dictum</i> that the presumption of regularity cannot by itself prevail over the presumption of innocence, the defense must still be able to present clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption of regularity for the claim of frame-up or extortion to prosper.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> Hence, in order to reconcile these apparently contradictory jurisprudential principles, there is a need to emphasize that <b>it is incumbent on the prosecution to <i>first</i> overcome the presumption of innocence in its evidence-in-chief before the accused can raise the defense of frame-up or extortion</b>. Only then can the prosecution raise the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty. In turn, this triggers the subsequent requirement for the accused, seeking an acquittal, to rebut such presumption by presenting clear and convincing evidence to substantiate the defense of frame-up or extortion.<br><br>The Court, having laid out the procedural dynamics and conventional principles that govern criminal prosecutions, enumerates the following elements of the offense pertaining to the illegal sale of dangerous drugs. These are: (a) the identities of the buyer and the seller, the object of the sale and the consideration; and (b) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment for the thing.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> What is material is the proof that <b>the transaction or sale actually took place</b>, coupled with the presentation in court of the <i>corpus delicti</i> as evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> In cases of illegal sale and illegal possession of dangerous drugs, the dangerous drug seized from the accused constitutes the <i>corpus delicti</i> of the offense.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup><br><br>In the implementation of Section 5 of R.A. No. 9165, the Court has declared that a "buy-bust operation has been recognized in this jurisdiction as a legitimate form of entrapment of the culprit."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> Since a buy-bust operation ultimately leads to the arrest and corresponding search of the person of the accused without any warrant, the law has set up procedural safeguards for the protection of the accused's constitutional rights. One safeguard frequently referred to in past rulings involving the illegal sale or possession of dangerous drugs is "chain of custody." This is the "duly recorded authorized movements and custody of seized drugs or controlled chemicals or plant sources of dangerous drugs or laboratory equipment of each stage, from the time of seizure/confiscation to receipt in the forensic laboratory to safekeeping, to presentation in court for destruction."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> On account of the unique characteristic of narcotic substances that renders them not readily identifiable, these are subject to scientific analysis to determine their composition and nature.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> Here, the prosecution <b>must account for <i>each link</i> in the chain of custody</b> of the dangerous drug, from the moment of seizure from the accused until presented in court as proof of the <i>corpus delicti</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> The rule ensures that unnecessary doubts concerning the identity of the evidence are removed. It seeks a guarantee that the substance illegally possessed in the first place is the same offered in court and is established with the same unwavering exactitude as that requisite to make a finding of guilt.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup><br><br>Jurisprudence has been instructive in illustrating the <b>links</b> in the chain that need to be established, to wit: (a) the seizure and marking, if practicable, of the <b><i>illegal drug</i> recovered from the accused</b> by the apprehending officer; (b) the turnover of the illegal drug seized by the apprehending officer to the investigating officer; (c) the turnover by the investigating officer of the illegal drug to the forensic chemist for laboratory examination; and (d) the turnover and submission of the marked illegal drug seized by the forensic chemist to the court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> Concomitantly, Section 21(a) of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of R.A. No. 9165 requires that the physical inventory and photograph of the seized items shall be conducted where the search warrant is served. Otherwise, warrantless seizures shall be conducted at the <b>nearest police station</b> or at the <b>nearest office</b> of the apprehending officer/team.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> The manner and timing of the marking of seized drugs or related items are crucial in proving the chain of custody.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> Marking of seized items is done to ensure that these are the items that enter the chain and eventually the same ones offered in evidence. Marking should be done in the presence of the apprehended violator and immediately upon confiscation. This is to protect innocent persons from dubious and concocted searches and to shield the apprehending officers as well from harassment suits based on planting of evidence and on allegations of robbery or theft.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br>Accordingly, the State must prove beyond reasonable doubt all the elements of the crime charged as well as the complicity or participation of the accused in every criminal prosecution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> However, proof beyond reasonable doubt does not mean the degree of proof excluding the possibility of error and producing absolute certainty.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> Only moral certainty is required, or that degree of proof which produces conviction in an unprejudiced mind.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> Such proof satisfies the court, keeping in mind the presumption of innocence, as it precludes every reasonable hypothesis except that which it is given to support.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> Furthermore, while not impelling such a degree of proof as to establish absolutely impervious certainty, the quantum of proof required in criminal cases nevertheless charges the prosecution with the immense responsibility of establishing moral certainty, a certainty that ultimately appeals to a person's very conscience.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> Consequently, when moral certainty as to culpability hangs in the balance, acquittal on reasonable doubt inevitably becomes a matter of right.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup><br><br>However, not all procedural lapses committed by law enforcers will entitle the accused to an acquittal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup> In reality, the desire for a perfect and unbroken chain of custody rarely occurs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup> This is the reason why the Court and, eventually, the Congress when it enacted R.A. No. 10640,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup> both recognized that noncompliance with the prescribed procedural requirements would not necessarily render the seizure and custody of the items void and invalid, provided that: (a) there is a <b>justifiable ground</b> for such <b>noncompliance</b>; and (b) the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup> Accordingly, to remove any doubt or uncertainty on the identity and integrity of the seized drug, evidence must definitely show that the illegal drug presented in court is the <b><i>same</i></b> illegal drug actually recovered from the accused-appellant. Otherwise, the prosecution for possession or for drug pushing under R.A. No. 9165 fails.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup><br><br><b><i>Propriety of the Buy-Bust Operation</i></b><br><br>It must be stressed that in criminal cases an appeal throws the entire case wide open for review. The reviewing tribunal can correct errors, though unassigned in the appealed judgment, or even reverse the trial court's decision based on grounds other than those that the parties raised as errors.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup> In this case, the Court is forced to re-evaluate the evidence on record. It cannot turn a blind eye to the fact that the prosecution never justified the failure of the team to photograph the seized dangerous drugs after the arrest of the accused-appellant. It is crucial to establish the first link in the chain of custody: "the seizure and marking of the illegal drug <b>recovered from the accused</b> by the apprehending officer."<br><br>A thorough examination of the photographs<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup> taken by the team showed the seized items merely included a marked P500.00 bill, a small blue SM plastic bag and a pair of blue slippers. Although the photograph labeled as Exhibit M-1<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup> showed that the upper right side of the right slipper appeared to be cut apart, <b>no image of the subject drugs</b> allegedly found inside the slippers <b>was captured</b> in the same photograph. It is puzzling that not one of the prosecution's witnesses gave an explanation as to why they were able to photograph the confiscated blue SM plastic bag and a pair of slippers <b><i>but failed to photograph</i> the three (3) sachets of <i>dangerous drugs</i> they had seized</b>. This is evident in the exchanges between Assistant Prosecutor Alexander T. Yap and IO1 Sandaan in the latter's direct examination, as follows:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="10%"><div align="justify">Asst. Pros. Yap: </div></td><td width="90%"><div align="justify">Do you have the photographs of the three (3) pieces of plastic, just beside the plastic sachets containing drugs?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><br></td><td><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Witness:</div></td><td> <div align="justify">.................... </div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><br></td><td><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Atty.

Make that on record.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>Such gross and unexplained omission automatically discredits the "regularity" in the performance of duty by the handling law enforcers. It likewise raises serious doubts as to the existence of the <i>corpus delicti</i> as required by the first link in the chain of custody. This is fatal to the prosecution's cause even if the accused-appellant had signed the inventory.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup> This glaring gap in the first link of the chain of custody leaves a lingering doubt whether the subject drugs were actually recovered from the accused-appellant. Speculation and probabilities that the contrabands were not received from the accused-appellant cannot take the place of proof required to establish the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup> Such lack of explanation and justification to photograph the seized dangerous drugs directly contravenes the requirements in Sec. 21 of R.A. No. 9165. The Act is precisely legislated to protect the constitutional right of the accused from unreasonable search and seizure by State agents.<br><br>On this point, the Court reiterates the jurisprudential dictum that a discrepancy or gap in the chain of custody would immediately affect the proof of <i>corpus delicti</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> Such negates all elements of the offense of illegal sale of dangerous drugs. Aside from the identity of the dangerous drugs being tainted with serious doubt, the manner of delivery as well as the corresponding payment speak of uncertainty. For purposes of presenting evidence, the Court emphasizes that it is not the absence of a photograph of the confiscated item which <b>renders it inadmissible as evidence</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup> <b>Rather, it is the <i>lack of justification</i> to do so.</b><br><br>Moreover, the records do not indicate that a representative of the DOJ and a member of the media were present with the elected official, Barangay Chair Pomperada, during the marking and inventory of the seized items.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup> Also, the prosecution offered no explanation as to why the team failed to comply with the explicit requirements in Sec. 21 of R.A. No. 9165 pertaining to required buy-bust witnesses. This was admitted by PO2 Gabona in the cross-examination conducted by Atty. Alexander A. Villacorta, as follows:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="10%"><div align="justify">[Atty. Villacorta:]</div></td><td width="90%"><div align="justify">Were you accompanied by any Media [representative] in going to the target area?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">[PO2 Gabona:]</div></td><td><div align="justify">None (<em>sic</em>), sir.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><br></td><td><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">[Atty.

The cross-examination of PO2 Gabona effectively tainted the existence and integrity of the <i>corpus delicti</i>. Except for Barangay Chair Pomperada who was present during the inventory of the seized items, all the other statutorily mandated witnesses were absent during the buy-bust operation and preparation of the inventory. A reasonable hypothesis that the source of the dangerous drugs was from someone else other than the accused-appellant is not far-fetched and cannot be ignored. Therefore, an acquittal based on reasonable doubt as to the existence of the <i>corpus delicti</i> is warranted.<br><br>Concomitantly, the Court points out that even if the accused­-appellant's defenses of extortion and frame-up are jurisprudentially recognized as weak, the prosecution must rest on its own merits and must not rely on the weakness of the defense.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup> The CA and the RTC cannot heavily anchor their judgment of conviction on glaring inconsistencies of the accused-appellant and his son's testimonies. <b>Even before the accused-­appellant's defenses are considered by the trial court, the pieces of evidence adduced by the prosecution should, <i>by themselves</i>, overcome the constitutional presumption of innocence.</b> We emphasize that the burden of proof is on the prosecution. Unless it discharges that burden, the accused need not even offer evidence in his behalf, and he would be entitled to an acquittal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup> In fact, the Court had once held that "the judge or fiscal, therefore, should not go on with the prosecution in the hope that some credible evidence might later turn out during trial, for this would be a flagrant violation of a basic right which the courts are created to uphold."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup> This guarantees that the procedures are chronologically and logically consistent with the constitutional presumption of Innocence.<br><br>It is noteworthy to remind the bench and the bar that prosecutions involving illegal sale of dangerous drugs depend largely on the credibility of the police officers who conduct the buy-bust operation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[121]</sup> Unfortunately, the Court has repeatedly observed that, by the very nature of anti-narcotics operations, <i>i.e.</i>, the need for entrapment procedures, the use of shady characters as informants, the ease with which sticks of marijuana or grams of heroin can be planted in pockets or hands of unsuspecting provincial hicks, and the secrecy that inevitably shrouds all drug deals, greatly increase the possibility of abuse.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup> Although mere procedural lapses in the conduct of a buy-bust operation are not <i>ipso facto</i> fatal to the prosecution's cause, so long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items have been preserved, <b>courts must still thoroughly evaluate and differentiate those errors that constitute a simple procedural lapse from those that amount to a "gross, systematic or deliberate disregard of the safeguards drawn by the law."</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup> Thus, courts are exhorted to be extra vigilant in trying drug cases lest an innocent person is made to suffer the unusually severe penalties for drug offenses.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[124]</sup><br><br>The Court found the need to weed out early from the courts' congested dockets any orchestrated or built-up drug-related cases. In <b><i>People v. Lim</i></b>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[125]</sup> the Court mandated compliance with the following policies:<br><blockquote>1) In the sworn statements/affidavits, the apprehending/seizing officers must state their compliance with the requirements of Section 21 (1) of R.A. No. 9165, as amended, and its IRR.<br><br>2) In case of non-observance of the provision, the apprehending/seizing officers must state the justification or explanation therefor, as well as the steps taken in order to preserve the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized/confiscated items.<br><br>3) If there is no justification or explanation expressly declared in the sworn statements or affidavits, the investigating fiscal must not immediately file the case before the court. Instead, he or she must refer the case for further preliminary investigation in order to determine the (non) existence of probable cause.<br><br>4) If the investigating fiscal filed the case despite such absence, the court may exercise its discretion to either refuse to issue a commitment order (or warrant of arrest) or dismiss the case outright for lack of probable cause in accordance with Section 5, Rule 112, Rules of Court.<br></blockquote><div align="center"><u><b>Conclusion</b></u><br></div><br>The Court is not unaware that today's traffickers of dangerous or illegal drugs continue to devise novel ways to escape detection of their activities by law enforcers. They have learned to conduct their transactions even in plain sight with nary a hint of the exchange of contraband. We have encouraged law enforcers to come up with constitutionally and statutorily valid ways to apprehend offenders. This is so that the aims of R.A. No. 9165 are realized and that civil liberties are not violated. While this is easier said than done, any difficulty may be tempered by conscious and circumspect adherence to procedural safeguards in the conduct of a buy-bust operation. One way is for law enforcers to <b><i>first ascertain</i> the existence of the subject contraband immediately after a body search</b> of the accused and <b>seizure</b> of any illegal items found in his or her person.<br><br><b>The <u>presence of irregularity</u> in carrying out the statutorily mandated procedure in the handling of dangerous drugs during buy­ bust operations <u><i>automatically destroys</i> the presumption of regularity</u> in the performance of duty.</b> In effect, the burden is <b><i>shifted</i></b> to the prosecution to justify through evidence the procedural lapses committed by law enforcers in the custodial handling of the seized dangerous drugs. Consequently, the prosecution's failure to justify such lapses entitles the accused to an acquittal based on reasonable doubt.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of the foregoing reasons, the May 29, 2012 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
