				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Tax assessments issued in violation of the due process rights of a taxpayer are null and void. While the government has an interest in the swift collection of taxes, the Bureau of Internal Revenue and its officers and agents cannot be overreaching in their efforts, but must perform their duties in accordance with law, with their own rules of procedure, and always with regard to the basic tenets of due process.<p> The 1997 National Internal Revenue Code, also known as the Tax Code, and revenue regulations allow a taxpayer to file a reply or otherwise to submit comments or arguments with supporting documents at each stage in the assessment process. Due process requires the Bureau of Internal Revenue to consider the defenses and evidence submitted by the taxpayer and to render a decision based on these submissions. Failure to adhere to these requirements constitutes a denial of due process and taints the administrative proceedings with invalidity. </p><p> These consolidated cases assail the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc November 9, 2011 Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> and April 10, 2012 Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> in CTA EB Case Nos. 661 and 663.

The second option is to await the final decision of the Commissioner and appeal this decision within 30 days from its receipt. Here, Avon opted for the second remedy by filing its petition on July 14, 2004, within 30 days from receipt of the July 9, 2004 Collection Letter, which also served as the final decision denying its protest.

In this regard, this Court held that <i>Ang Tibay</i> did not necessarily do away with the conduct of hearing and a party may invoke its right to a hearing to thresh out substantial factual issues, thus: </p><blockquote> <p> A closer perusal of past jurisprudence shows that the Court did not intend to trivialize the conduct of a formal hearing but merely afforded latitude to administrative bodies especially in cases where a party fails to invoke the right to hearing or is given the opportunity but opts not to avail of it. In the landmark case of <i>Ang Tibay, the Court explained that administrative bodies are free from a strict application of technical rules of procedure and are given sufficient leeway. In the said case, however, nothing was said that the freedom included the setting aside of a hearing but merely to allow matters which would ordinarily be incompetent or inadmissible in the usual judicial proceedings</i>.</p> <p> In fact, the seminal words of <i>Ang Tibay manifest a desire for administrative bodies to exhaust all possible means to ensure that the decision rendered be based on the accurate appreciation of facts. The Court reminded that administrative bodies have the active</i> <b>duty to use the authorized legal methods of securing evidence and informing itself of facts material and relevant to the controversy</b>. As such, it would be more in keeping with administrative due process that the conduct of a hearing be the general rule rather than the exception.</p> <p>. . . . </p> <p> To reiterate, due process is a malleable concept anchored on fairness and equity. The due process requirement before administrative bodies are not as strict compared to judicial tribunals in that it suffices that a party is given a reasonable opportunity to be heard. Nevertheless, such "reasonable opportunity" should not be confined to the mere submission of position papers and/or affidavits and the parties must be given the opportunity to examine the witnesses against them. The right to a hearing is a right which may be invoked by the parties to thresh out substantial factual issues. It becomes even more imperative when the rules itself of the administrative body provides for one. While the absence of a formal hearing does not necessarily result in the deprivation of due process, it should be acceptable only when the party does not invoke the said right or waives the same. <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> In <em>Saunar</em>, this Court held that the petitioner in that case was denied due process when he was not notified of the clarificatory hearings conducted by the Presidential Anti-Graft Commission.

Again, Avon explained the alleged sales discrepancy to the revenue officers, who were convinced that there was no under­ declaration of sales, and that the sales discrepancy between the Annual Income Tax Return and Quarterly VAT Return was merely due to erroneous presentation of sales in the Third Quarter VAT Return.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup> </p><p> By this time, hoping that the Commissioner would cancel the deficiency income and VAT assessments arising from the alleged sales discrepancy, Avon informed the Bureau of Internal Revenue examiners that it would make a partial payment of the assessments, which it did.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup> </p><p> Fourth, however, the Commissioner issued the Collection Letter<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup> dated July 9, 2004 without deciding on the protest letter to the Final Assessment Notices.

It imposed on Villa a fine of P10,000.00 and required her to cease operations on the spurious premise that she had failed to submit the required documents. This Court found the Commissioner's failure or refusal to even acknowledge the documents submitted by Villa indefensible.

Had the Commissioner performed her functions properly and considered the explanations and pieces of evidence submitted by Avon, this case could have been settled at the earliest possible time. For instance, all the evidence needed to settle the issue on under-declared sales, which constituted the bulk of the deficiency tax assessments, have been submitted to the Bureau of Internal Revenue. Indeed, from these same submissions, the Court of Tax Appeals concluded that there was no under-declaration of sales.

In that case, this Court explained that Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation's partial payment of the revised assessments effectively belied its insistence that the waivers were invalid and the assessments were issued beyond the prescriptive period. Thus: </p><blockquote> <p> Estoppel is clearly applicable to the case at bench. RCBC, through its partial payment of the revised assessments issued within the extended period as provided for in the questioned waivers, impliedly admitted the validity of those waivers. Had petitioner truly believed that the waivers were invalid and that the assessments were issued beyond the prescriptive period, then it should not have paid the reduced amount of taxes in the revised assessment. RCBC's subsequent action effectively belies its insistence that the waivers are invalid. The records show that on December 6, 2000, upon receipt of the revised assessment, RCBC immediately made payment on the uncontested taxes. Thus, RCBC is estopped from questioning the validity of the waivers.

Denying the motion, this Court held that it could not anymore "claim that the disputed assessment is not yet final as it remained unacted upon by the Commissioner; that it can still await the final decision of the Commissioner and thereafter appeal the same to the Court of Tax Appeals."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[172]</sup> Since it had availed of the first option by filing a petition for review because of the Commissioner's inaction, although late, it could no longer resort to the second option.</p><p> <em>Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation</em> referred to Rule 4, Section 3(a)(2) of the 2005 Revised Rules of the Court of Tax Appeals, or the 2005 Court of Tax Appeals Rules, which provides: </p><blockquote> <p> Section 3. <i>Cases Within the Jurisdiction of the Court in Divisions</i>. — The Court in Divisions shall exercise:</p> <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="3%"><div align="justify">(a)</div></td> <td colspan="2"> <div align="justify">Exclusive original or appellate jurisdiction to review by appeal the following: </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><br></td> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">. . . . </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><br></td> <td width="3%"><div align="justify">(2)</div></td> <td width="94%"><div align="justify"><strong>Inaction by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue in cases involving disputed assessments</strong>, refunds of internal revenue taxes, fees or other charges, penalties in relation thereto, or other matters arising under the National Internal Revenue Code or other laws administered by the Bureau of Internal Revenue, where the National Internal Revenue Code or other applicable law provides a specific period for action: Provided, that in case of disputed assessments, the inaction of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue within the one hundred eighty day-period under Section 228 of the National Internal Revenue Code shall be deemed a denial for purposes of allowing the taxpayer to appeal his case to the Court and does not necessarily constitute a formal decision of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue on the tax case; Provided, further, that should the taxpayer opt to await the final decision of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue on the disputed assessments beyond the one hundred eighty day-period abovementioned, the taxpayer may appeal such final decision to the Court under Section 3(a), Rule 8 of these Rules; and Provided, still further, that in the case of claims for refund of taxes erroneously or illegally collected, the taxpayer must file a petition for review with the Court prior to the expiration of the two-year period under Section 229 of the National Internal Revenue Code[.] (Emphasis supplied)</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote> <p>In <i>Lascona Land Co., Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[173]</sup> this Court reaffirmed Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation, <i>viz</i>:</p> <blockquote> <p> In arguing that the assessment became final and executory by the sole reason that petitioner failed to appeal the inaction of the Commissioner within 30 days after the 180-day reglementary period, respondent, in effect, limited the remedy of Lascona, as a taxpayer, under Section 228 of the NIRC to just one, that is — to appeal the inaction of the Commissioner on its protested assessment after the lapse of the 180-day period. This is incorrect.</p> <p> . . . .</p> <p> [W]hen the law provided for the remedy to appeal the inaction of the CIR, it did not intend to limit it to a single remedy of filing of an appeal after the lapse of the 180-day prescribed period. Precisely, when a taxpayer protested an assessment, he naturally expects the CIR to decide either positively or negatively. A taxpayer cannot be prejudiced if he chooses to wait for the final decision of the CIR on the protested assessment. More so, because the law and jurisprudence have always contemplated a scenario where the CIR will decide on the protested assessment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[174]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> This Court, nonetheless, stressed that these two (2) options of the taxpayer, i.e., to (1) file a petition for review before the Court of Tax Appeals within 30 days after the expiration of the 180-day period; or (2) to await the final decision of the Commissioner on the disputed assessment and appeal this final decision to the Court of Tax Appeals within 30 days from receipt of it, "<em>are mutually exclusive and resort to one bars the application of the other</em>." <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[175]</sup></p><p> Rule 4, Section 3(a)(2) of the 2005 Court of Tax Appeals Rules clarifies Section 7(a)(2) of Republic Act No. 9282 by stating that the "deemed a denial'' rule is only for the "purposes of allowing the taxpayer to appeal" in case of inaction of the Commissioner and "does not necessarily constitute a formal decision of the Commissioner." Furthermore, the same provision clarifies that the taxpayer may choose to wait for the final decision of the Commissioner even beyond the 180-day period, and appeal from it.</p><p> The 2005 Court of Tax Appeals Rules were approved by the Court En Banc on November 22, 2005, in A.M.

However, the mode or manner by which this right may be exercised is a question of procedure which may be altered and modified provided that vested rights are not impaired. The Supreme Court is bestowed by the Constitution with the power and prerogative, inter alia, to promulgate rules concerning pleadings, practice and procedure in all courts, as well as to review rules of procedure of special courts and quasi-judicial bodies, which, however, shall remain in force until disapproved by the Supreme Court. This power is constitutionally enshrined to enhance the independence of the Supreme Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[178]</sup> (Citation omitted)</p> </blockquote> <p> <i>Carpio-Morales v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[179]</sup> elucidated that while Congress has the authority to establish the lower courts, including the Court of Tax Appeals, and to define, prescribe, and apportion their jurisdiction, the authority to promulgate rules of procedure is exclusive to this Court: </p><blockquote> <p> <b>A court's <u>exercise of the jurisdiction</u> it has acquired over a particular case conforms to the limits and parameters of <u>the rules of procedure duly promulgated by this Court</u>.</b> In other words, procedure is the framework within which judicial power is exercised. In Manila Railroad Co. v. Attorney-General, the Court elucidated that "[t]he power or authority of the court over the subject matter existed and was fixed before procedure in a given cause began. <b><u>Procedure does not alter or change that power or authority; it simply directs the manner in which it shall be fully and justly exercised</u></b>. To be sure, in certain cases, if that power is not exercised in conformity with the provisions of the procedural law, purely, the court attempting to exercise it loses the power to exercise it legally. This does not mean that it loses jurisdiction of the subject matter."</p> <p> While the power to define, prescribe, and apportion the jurisdiction of the various courts is, by constitutional design, vested unto Congress,<strong> the power to promulgate rules concerning the protection and enforcement of constitutional rights, pleading, practice, and procedure in all courts <u>belongs exclusively to this Court</u>.</strong> (Emphasis in the original, citations omitted)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[180]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Section 228 of the Tax Code and Section 7 of Republic Act No. 9282 should be read in conjunction with Rule 4, Section 3(a)(2) of the 2005 Court of Tax Appeals Rules. In other words, the taxpayer has the option to either elevate the case to the Court of Tax Appeals if the Commissioner does not act on his or her protest, or to wait for the Commissioner to decide on his or her protest before he or she elevates the case to the Court of Tax Appeals. This construction is reasonable considering that Section 228 states that the <i>decision</i> of the Commissioner not appealed by the taxpayer becomes final, executory, and demandable.</p><p align="center"> <b>IV</b></p><p> In this case, Avon opted to wait for the final decision of the Commissioner on its protest filed on May 9, 2003.</p><p> This Court holds that the Collection Letter dated July 9, 2004 constitutes the final decision of the Commissioner that is appealable to the Court of Tax Appeals.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[181]</sup> The Collection Letter dated July 9, 2004 demanded from Avon the payment of the deficiency tax assessments with a warning that should it fail to do so within the required period, summary administrative remedies would be instituted without further notice.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[182]</sup> The Collection Letter was purportedly based on the May 27, 2004 Memorandum of the Revenue Officers stating that Avon "failed to submit supporting documents within 60-day period."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[183]</sup> This Collection Letter demonstrated a character of finality such that there can be no doubt that the Commissioner had already made a conclusion to deny Avon's request and she had the clear resolve to collect the subject taxes.</p><p> Avon received the Collection Letter on July 14, 2004. Hence, Avon's appeal to the Court of Tax Appeals filed on August 13, 2004 was not time-barred.</p><p> In any case, even if this Court were to disregard the Collection Letter as a final decision of the Commissioner on Avon's protest, the Collection Letter constitutes an act of the Commissioner on "other matters" arising under the National Internal Revenue Code, which, pursuant to <em>Philippine Journalists, Inc. v. CIR</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[184]</sup> may be the subject of an appropriate appeal before the Court of Tax Appeals.</p><p> On a final note, the Commissioner is reminded of her duty enunciated in Section 3.1.6 of Revenue Regulations No. 12-99 to render a final decision on disputed assessment. Section 228 of the Tax Code requires taxpayers to exhaust administrative remedies by filing a request for reconsideration or reinvestigation within 30 days from receipt of the assessment. Exhaustion of administrative remedies is required prior to resort to the Court of Tax Appeals precisely to give the Commissioner the opportunity to "re-examine its findings and conclusions"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[185]</sup> and to decide the Issues raised within her competence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[186]</sup> </p><p><i>Paat v.

Hence, if a remedy within the administrative machinery can still be resorted to by giving the administrative officer concerned every opportunity to decide on a matter that comes within his jurisdiction then such remedy should be exhausted first before court's judicial power can be sought. The premature invocation of court's intervention is fatal to one's cause of action. Accordingly, absent any finding of waiver or<em> estoppel</em> the case is susceptible of dismissal for lack of cause of action. <b>This doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies was not without its practical and legal reasons, for one thing, availment of administrative remedy entails lesser expenses and provides for a speedier disposition of controversies. It is no less true to state that the courts of justice for reasons of comity and convenience will shy away from a dispute until the system of administrative redress has been completed and complied with so as to give the administrative agency concerned every opportunity to correct its error and to dispose of the case.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[188]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)</p> </blockquote> <p> Taxpayers cannot be left in quandary by the Commissioner's inaction on the protested assessment.

Sandiganbayan</i>, 504 Phil. 407 (2005) [Per J. Panganiban, Third Division] contains a legislative history of this provision in its footnote no. 9 as follows: </p><p> "Sec. 229 was originally found in the NIRC of 1977, which was codified by and made an integral part of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1158, otherwise known as 'A Decree to Consolidate and Codify all the Internal Revenue Laws of the Philippines.' <br> When the NIRC of 1977 was amended by PD 1705 on August 1, 1980, Sec. 229 was restated as Sec. 16(d). On January 16, 1981, PD 1773 further amended Sec. 16 by eliminating paragraph (d) and inserting its contents between Secs. 319 and 320 as a new Sec. 319-A. PD 1994 then renumbered Sec. 319-A as Sec. 270 on January 1, 1986; and on January 1, 1988, Sec. 270 was again renumbered as Sec. 229 and rearranged to fall under Chapter 3 of Title VIII of the NIRC by Executive Order (EO) No. 273, otherwise known as 'Adopting a Value-Added Tax, Amending for this Purpose Certain Provisions of the National Internal Revenue Code, and for other purposes.' At present, Sec. 229 has been amended as Sec. 228 by RA 8424, otherwise known as the 'Tax Reform Act of 1997."' <br> Section 229 of the Old Tax Code provides:<br> Sec. 229. Protesting of assessment. - When the Commissioner of Internal Revenue or his duly authorized representative finds that proper taxes should be assessed, he shall first notify the taxpayer of his findings. Within a period to be prescribed by implementing regulations, the taxpayer shall be required to respond to said notice. If the taxpayer fails to respond, the Commissioner shall issue an assessment based on his findings. <br>Such assessment may be protested administratively by filing a request for reconsideration or reinvestigation in such form and manner as may be prescribed by implementing regulation within thirty (30) days from receipt of the assessment; otherwise, the assessment shall become final and unappealable.<br> If the protest is denied in whole or in part, the individual, association or corporation adversely affected by the decision on the protest may appeal to the Court of Tax Appeals within thirty (30) days from receipt of the said decision; otherwise, the decision shall become final, executory and demandable. </p><p> <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[168]</sup> Pres. Decree No. 1158 (1977), as amended by Executive Order No. 273. </p><p> <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[169]</sup> For instance, in <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Isabela Cultural Corporation (ICC)</i>, 413 Phil. 376 (2001) [Per J. Panganiban, Third Division], Isabela Cultural Corporation received an assessment letter dated February 9, 1990 stating that it had deficiency income taxes due; and it subsequently filed its motion for reconsideration on March 23, 1990. In support of its request for reconsideration, it sent to the Bureau of Internal Revenue additional documents on April 18, 1990. The next communication that Isabela Cultural Corporation received was already the Final Notice Before Seizure dated November 10, 1994, or more than four (4) years later. Isabela Cultural Corporation filed a petition for review with the Court of Tax Appeals alleging that the Final Notice of Seizure was the Commissioner's final decision. The Court of Tax Appeals dismissed the petition. On appeal, this Court ruled that a final demand from the Commissioner reiterating the immediate payment of a tax deficiency previously made is tantamount to a denial of the protest. Such letter amounts to a final decision on a disputed assessment and is thus appealable to the Court of Tax Appeals. </p><p> In <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Union Shipping Corp.</i>, 264 Phil 132 (1990) [Per J. Paras, Second Division], Union Shipping Corporation (Union Shipping) was assessed deficiency income taxes in a letter dated December 27, 1974. On January 10, 1975, Union Shipping protested the assessment. Without ruling on the protest, the Commissioner served a Warrant of Distraint and Levy on November 25, 1976. Union Shipping reiterated its request for reinvestigation of the assessment and for reconsideration of the Warrant. Without again acting on this request, the Commissioner filed a collection suit before the Court of First Instance of Manila. Summons was received by Union Shipping on December 28, 1978. On January 10, 1979, Union Shipping filed a petition for review with the Court of Tax Appeals. The Commissioner raised prescription, contending that the petition was filed beyond 30 days from receipt of the Warrant on November 25, 1976. Ruling in favor of Union Shipping, this Court observed that since the Commissioner did not rule on Union Shipping's motion for reconsideration, the latter was left in the dark as to which action of the Commissioner was the decision appealable to the Court of Tax Appeals. "Had [the Commissioner] categorically stated that he denies [Union Shipping's] motion for reconsideration and that his action constitutes his final determination on the disputed assessment, [it] without needless difficulty would have been able to determine when his right to appeal accrues and the resulting confusion would have been avoided." </p><p><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[170]</sup> 550 Phil 316 (2007) (Resolution) [Per J.
