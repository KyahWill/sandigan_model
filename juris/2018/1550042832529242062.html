Thus, if his Petition for Cancellation is denied, the judgment, which had attained finality, would be rendered nugatory.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></p><p> Moreover, petitioner argues that the cancellation, amendment, or administrative correction of the Certificates of Land Ownership Award to include petitioner as farmer-beneficiary is not an "impairment of the indefeasibility of the [Certificates of Land Ownership Award] issued to the respondents."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> </p><p> The issue for this Court's resolution is whether or not the Department of Agrarian Reform may cancel the registered Certificates of Land Ownership Award or Transfer Certificates of Title four (4) years after their issuance.</p><p> The Petition is denied. </p><p> A certificate of land ownership award is evidence of the award of a public land by the Department of Agrarian Reform to the beneficiary under Republic Act No. 6657.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Upon its registration, the subject land is placed under the operation of the Torrens system.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> </p><p> Well-settled is the rule that certificates of title emanating from the grant of public land in an administrative proceeding enjoy the same protection as those issued in registration proceedings. This Court affirms the Court of Appeals in ruling that "a certificate of land ownership award becomes indefeasible and incontrovertible upon the expiration of one year from the date of registration with the Office of the Registry of Deeds."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> </p><p> In <i>Lahora, et al. v.

In other words, upon expiration of one year from its issuance, the certificate of title shall become irrevocable and indefeasible like a certificate issued in a registration proceeding.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> This was reiterated in <em>Estribillo v. Department of Agrarian Reform</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> where this Court declared that the emancipation patents or certificates of land ownership award under Republic Act No. 6657 are "in themselves, entitled to be as indefeasible as certificates of title issued in registration proceedings."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> </p><p> However, the Court of Appeals erred in its Decision to reinstate the March 15, 2007 Decision of the Provincial Agrarian Reform Adjudicator. Regional Director Arsenal acted without jurisdiction in rendering his September 30, 2003 Order. Thus, all subsequent proceedings are void for lack of jurisdiction. </p><p> Similar to a certificate of title issued in registration proceedings, the registration of a certificate of land ownership award places the subject land under the operation of the Torrens system.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Once under the Torrens system, a certificate of land ownership award or certificate of title issued may only be attacked through a direct proceeding before the court. </p><p> Under Section 48 of Presidential Decree No. 1529, or the Property Registration Decree: </p><blockquote> <p> SECTION 48. <em>Certificate Not Subject to Collateral Attack</em>. - A certificate of title shall not be subject to collateral attack. It cannot be altered, modified, or cancelled except in a direct proceeding in accordance with law. </p> </blockquote> <p> An attack is collateral when "it incidentally questions the validity of the transfer certificate of title in an action seeking a different relief."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> A direct attack is an action that annuls the title itself.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup></p> <p> In <i>De Pedro v. Romasan Development Corporation</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> this Court explained: </p><blockquote> <p> An action for annulment of certificate of title is a direct attack on the title because it challenges the judgment decree of title. </p> <p> In <i>Goco v. Court of Appeals</i>, this court said that "[a]n action for annulment of certificates of title to property [goes] into the issue of ownership of the land covered by a Torrens title and the relief generally prayed for by the plaintiff is to be declared as the land's true owner."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> (Citations omitted)</p> </blockquote> <p> Thus, under Section 48 of Presidential Decree No. 1529, a registered certificate of land ownership award may be altered, modified, or canceled only through an action for annulment of the certificate itself.</p><p> Under Batas Pambansa Blg. 129, or the Judiciary Reorganization Act of 1980, an action for annulment of a registered certificate of land ownership award, like the annulment of a certificate of title, involves title to or possession of real property or any interest therein. This falls under the exclusive original jurisdiction of either the Regional Trial Court<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> or the Municipal Trial Court,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> depending on the assessed value. </p><p> In this case, the lots were already covered by Certificates of Land Ownership Award registered with the Registry of Deeds, with Transfer Certificates of Title issued four (4) years before petitioner filed his Petition for Inclusion as farmer-beneficiary. This Petition was a collateral attack on respondents' title. It incidentally questioned the validity of the Transfer Certificates of Title issued in respondents' favor in an action seeking a different relief—purportedly for petitioner to be included as farmer-beneficiary in the subject lots. </p><p> Regional Director Arsenal's inclusion of petitioner as farmer­ beneficiary over the lots needed the modification of the Transfer Certificates of Title and Certificates of Land Ownership Award registered in respondents' names. In his February 24, 2004 Order, Regional Director Arsenal directed the filing of the appropriate action before the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board "to effect the implementation"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> of his Order.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> This led to petitioner filing a Petition for Cancellation of respondents' Certificates of Land Ownership Award before the Provincial Adjudicator. He is now before this Court after the Court of Appeals annulled the Decision of the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board granting the cancellation of respondents' Certificates of Title, albeit on the ground of indefeasibility of title. Petitioner himself stated that the final decision in his favor shall be insignificant without the cancellation of respondents' title.</p><p> Clearly, the Petition for Inclusion as farmer-beneficiary was a collateral attack on respondents' title to the property. This is prohibited by law.</p><p> Moreover, Regional Director Arsenal has no jurisdiction in a Petition for Inclusion as farmer-beneficiary over lots covered by the Certificates of Title or registered Certificates of Land Ownership Award. Thus, all subsequent proceedings are void for lack of jurisdiction.</p><p> Section 9 of Republic Act No. 9700, which amends Section 24 of Republic Act No. 6657, states that "the cancellation of registered emancipation patents, certificates of land ownership award, and other titles issued under any agrarian reform program are within the exclusive and original jurisdiction of the Secretary of the [Department of Agrarian Reform]."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> This covers only certificates under the Department of Agrarian Reform's jurisdiction. The cancellation of a registered certificate of land ownership award or a certificate of title does not fall under it.</p><p> Finally, petitioner must be reminded that certificates of title do not vest ownership, but merely evidence title or ownership of the property.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> "Courts may, therefore, cancel or declare a certificate of title null and void when it finds that it was issued irregularly."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> Petitioner provided evidence of being an actual tiller of the lots before the Department of Agrarian Reform. He may file the action to annul respondents' title before the competent court, taking into consideration the principle of indefeasibility of title to property.</p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is <b>DENIED</b>.
