Orpilla</i></p><p> On November 15, 2001, Joyce Anabelle L. Orpilla (respondent) was employed by Stradcom as Human Resources Administration Department (HRAD) Head, under a probationary status for six months, with a monthly salary of P60,000.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Her duties included administrative and training matters.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></p><p> On January 2, 2003, Chua, the President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Stradcom, issued a Memorandum addressed to the Chief Operating Officer (COO), Ramon G. Reyes (Reyes), and Chief Financial Officer (CPO), Raul C. Pagdanganan (Pagdanganan), announcing the reorganization of the HRAD.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> The pertinent portions of the memorandum provides: </p><blockquote> <p> 1. The Training Section of the Department shall be spinned off and will form part of the Business Operations. x x x (The Training Section shall be called Human Resources Training and Development).</p> <p> x x x x</p> <p> 3. Under the said reorganization, new sections shall be reporting to the following:</p> <ul><li> The Human Resources Training and Development shall be reporting to Mr. Ramon G.

Orpilla and the Training Section will be reporting directly to the COO. x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></li></ul> </blockquote> <p> After the turn-over of the documents and equipment of HRAD, respondent inquired from Chua as to her status in the light of the said reorganization. Chua, on the other hand, replied that the management has lost its trust and confidence in her and it would be better if she resigned. Respondent protested the resignation and insisted that if there were charges against her, she was open for formal investigation. Chua, however, was not able to come up with any charges.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></p><p> On January 9, 2003, a meeting was held wherein, Atty. Eric Gene Pilapil (Atty. Pilapil), the Chief Legal Officer (CLO) offered a settlement to respondent in exchange for her employment, otherwise, respondent would have to undergo the burden of litigation in pursuing the retention of her employment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Atty. Pilapil set another meeting on January 13, 2003 with respondent, and told her to take a leave in the meantime to think about the settlement offer. Atty. Pilapil also assured respondent that she would continue to receive her salary.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></p><p> On January 13, 2003, per advice of Atty. Pilapil, respondent reported for work but the guards refused her entry and advised her to take a leave of absence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></p><p> Respondent claimed that she was informed by Accounting Manager, Mr. Arnold C. Ocampo, that her January 15, 2003 salary was already deposited in her bank account which included the proportionate 13th month pay for the year 2003 and was her last and final pay. After such, respondent no longer received any kind of payment from petitioners.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Respondent claimed that she was constructively dismissed on January 2, 2003 and turned into an actual dismissal on January 15, 2003, when she received her last pay.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></p><p> On June 29, 2003, respondent filed a complaint for constructive dismissal with monetary claims of backwages, attorney's fees and damages.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></p><p> <i>The Version of Petitioners Stradcom Corporation and Jose A. Chua</i></p><p> On November 15, 2001, respondent was employed by Stradcom as HRAD Head, a managerial position with a monthly salary of P60,000.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> As HRAD Head, respondent's duties and responsibilities included administration and personnel, and training matters.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></p><p> Sometime in December 2002, Pagdanganan gave instructions to respondent to commence preparations for Stradcom's 2002 Christmas party. Chua also gave instructions to respondent to include the Land Registration Systems, Inc. (Lares) officers and employees, an affiliate of Stradcom in the Christmas party, to foster camaraderie and working relations between the two companies.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> </p><p> Contrary to Chua's instruction, respondent then called a staff lunch meeting for Stradcom's 2002 Christmas party, wherein respondent conveyed her intention of easing out Lares' employees from the party.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></p><p> Later, it had come to Stradcom's attention that respondent was not comfortable with the idea to include Lares in the Christmas party, as respondent appeared evasive on the queries about the event made by Ms. May Marcelo, the Head Personnel and Administration of Lares.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> This matter was brought to the attention of Chua, who decided to strip respondent of any responsibility in organizing the Christmas party and transferred the same to another committee. As part of the turnover, respondent furnished the committee with a copy of the initial budget which included the catering services from G&amp;W Catering Services at P250 per head.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></p><p> On December 16, 2002, Ms. Rowena Q. Samson (Samson) and Mr. Saturnino S. Galgana (Galgana), members of the new Christmas party committee went to see Mrs. Myrna G. Sese (Sese), the proprietress of the G&amp;W Catering Services.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> They were surprised to find out that the price of the food was actually P200 per head and not P250 per head as represented by respondent. Suspicious about the correct pricing, Samson and Galgana reported the matter to the Stradcom's management. Stradcom began its investigation and interviewed some employees regarding the conduct of respondent.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></p><p> After the investigation, Stradcom also discovered that respondent required her staff to prepare presentation/training materials/manuals using company resources for purposes not related to the affairs of the company, on overtime and on Sundays.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></p><p> Subsequently, Pagdanganan called for a conference with respondent, and discussed respondent's non-inclusion of Lares in Stradcom's Christmas party, the overpricing of the food, and her moonlighting. Respondent made a bare deniat.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></p><p> On January 3, 2003, Chua notified his employees about the reorganization of the HRAD and the Business Operations Department.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> On the same date and as part of routine procedure, respondent turned-over the necessary documents and equipment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Respondent reported to Reyes, her new immediate superior and secured the latter's approval for her leave of absence on the dates of January 3 in the afternoon up to January 6, 2003, due to personal reasons. Reyes approved her leave.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> </p><p> However, before respondent's scheduled leave, she approached Chua to discuss the reorganization and her previous conference with Pagdanganan regarding her said infractions. Chua told respondent that the management has lost its trust and confidence in her due to her willful disobedience in excluding the employees of Lares in the Stradcom's Christmas party and for willful breach of trust in connection with the canvassing of the caterer.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> </p><p> Respondent explained her side and asked Chua for his advice. Chua replied that considering her position is one that requires the trust and confidence of the management, it would be difficult to force herself on the management. Thus, respondent conveyed her willingness to resign. In view of this, Stradcom's officers agreed that any formal investigation on respondent was unnecessary in view of her willingness to resign.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> </p><p> However, on January 7, 2003, respondent reported for work and suprisedly informed Stradcom that she would not resign. When Chua found out about the respondent's retraction of her statement to resign, he instructed Atty. Pilapil to talk things through with respondent.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></p><p> On January 9, 2003, Atty. Pilapil invited respondent for dinner outside the company premises. Respondent was given another chance regarding her said infractions. Respondent then requested for four days leave to think things through and Atty. Pilapil adhered to request and assured her that she will receive her pay while on leave. They likewise agreed that they would meet again on January 13, 2003, outside the office to discuss respondent's final decision.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></p><p> Petitioners were shocked when they found out that respondent had filed a complaint for constructive dismissal with monetary claims of backwages, attorney's fees and damages on January 29, 2003.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> </p><p> Petitioners contended that the dismissal of respondent was for just cause on the ground of loss of trust and confidence and the same was in compliance with the due process requirements.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Petitioners further contended that the acts that caused the loss of trust and confidence of the petitioners in the respondent were her mishandling of Stradcom's 2002 Christmas party, dishonesty in preparing the budget thereof, misrepresentation in her application for employment, and using company personnel and resources for purposes not beneficial to the interest of Stradcom.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></p><p align="center"> <b>The Ruling of the LA</b> </p><p> On September 30, 2003, the LA rendered a Decision, which ruled that respondent was illegally dismissed and Chua is solidarily liable with Stradcom for the payment of the monetary awards to respondent.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> The dispositive portion of the LA Decision, provides: </p><blockquote> <p> WHEREFORE, decision is hereby rendered, as follows:</p> <blockquote> <p> 1.

The NLRC awarded respondent her unpaid salary for the period of January 16 to April 16, 2003, the date when she was formally advised of her disengagement from service.

As such, the findings of facts and conclusion of the NLRC are generally accorded not only great weight and respect but even clothed with finality and deemed binding on this Court as long as they are supported by substantial evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> However, if the factual findings of the LA and the NLRC are conflicting, as in this case, the reviewing court may delve into the records and examine for itself the questioned findings.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> The exception, rather than the general rule, applies in the present case since the LA and the CA found facts supporting the conclusion that respondent was illegally dismissed, while the NLRC's factual findings contradicted the LA's findings. </p><p> Under this situation, such conflicting factual findings are not binding on Us, and We retain the authority to pass on the evidence presented and draw conclusions therefrom.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> </p><p> After judicious review on the records of the case, this Court finds that the petitioners proved that respondent was dismissed for a just cause. </p><table width="50%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><i>The dismissal of respondent was founded on just cause - loss of trust and confidence</i></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>Among the just causes for termination is the employer's loss of trust and confidence in its employee. Article 297 (c) [formerly Article 282] of the Labor Code provides that an employer may terminate the services of an employee for fraud or willful breach of the trust reposed in him/her.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Article 297, provides: </p><blockquote> <p> Article 297. TERMINATION BY EMPLOYER.—An employer may terminate an employment for any of the following causes: </p> <blockquote> <p> (a) Serious misconduct or willful disobedience by the employee of the lawful orders of his employer or representative in connection with his work;<br> (b) Gross and habitual neglect by the employee of his duties; <b><br> (c) Fraud or willful breach by the employee of the trust reposed in him by his employer or duly authorized representative</b>;<br> (d) Commission of a crime or offense by the employee against the person of his employer or any immediate member of his family or his duly authorized representative; and<br> (e) Other causes analogous to the foregoing. (Emphasis ours)</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> In order for the said cause to be properly invoked, however, certain requirements must be complied with, namely: (1) the employee concerned must be holding a position of trust and confidence; and (2) there must be an act that would justify the loss of trust and confidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> </p><p> The two classes of positions of trust were enunciated in the case of <i>Alaska Milk Corporation, et al. v. Ponce</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> (1) managerial employees whose primary duty consists of the management of the establishment in which they are employed or of a department or a subdivision thereof, and to other officers or members of the managerial staff; and (2) fiduciary rank-and-file employees, such as cashiers, auditors, property custodians, or those who, in the normal exercise of their functions, regularly handle significant amounts of money or property. These employees, though rank-and-file, are routinely charged with the care and custody of the employer's money or property, and are, thus, classified as occupying positions of trust and confidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> </p> <p> As regards a managerial employee, the mere existence of a basis for believing that such employee has breached the trust of his employer would suffice for his dismissal. Hence, in the case of managerial employees, proof beyond reasonable doubt is not required, it being sufficient that there is some basis for such loss of confidence, such as when the employer has reasonable ground to believe that the employee concerned is responsible for the purported misconduct, and the nature of his participation therein renders him unworthy of the trust and confidence demanded by his position.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> It is undisputed that at the time of respondent's dismissal, she was holding a managerial position, which was HRAD Head of Stradcom and directly reported to the President, herein Chua and other high ranking officials of Stradcom. Likewise, respondent performed key and sensitive functions, as her duties and responsibilities included the administration, personnel and training matters of the company. Respondent held a trust and critical position which required the conscientious observance of the company rules and procedures. </p><p> The presence of the first requisite is thus certain. Anent to the second requisite, the Court finds that the petitioners meet their burden of proving that the respondent's dismissal was for a just cause.</p><p> The acts alleged to have caused the loss of trust and confidence of the petitioners in the respondent was her mishandling of Stradcom's 2002 Christmas party, dishonesty in preparing the budget thereof, misrepresentation in her application for employment, and using company personnel and resources for purposes not beneficial to the interest of Stradcom. The evidence on record support Stradcom's claims.</p><p> There was substantial evidence to support that respondent overpriced the food for the 2002 Christmas party. The overpricing was discovered by the new committee which took over the preparations for the said party. It is undisputed that respondent was the one who initially negotiated with G&amp;W Catering Services. Respondent was also the one who prepared the budget for the approval of the President, herein Chua. G&amp;W billed Stradcom for food at the rate of Two Hundred Pesos (P200) per head only, contrary to the Two Hundred Fifty (P250) per head quoted by respondent, and the rental for chairs at Twenty-Eight Pesos (P28), in the aggregate amount of Sixty-Three Thousand Eight Hundred Forty Pesos (P63,840) as evidenced by the Affidavit of Sese, the proprietress of the G&amp;W Catering Services. Clearly, the overpricing amounted to dishonesty.</p><p> Also, respondent's overpricing of P250 per head for the Christmas party was corroborated by Ms. Rowena Samson,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Chua's Secretary of the President and CEO and Mr. Saturnino S. Galgana,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Stradcom's Purchasing Assistant, as evidenced by their affidavits dated March 18, 2003.</p><p> Furthermore, respondent was proven to have engaged in moonlighting activities and used company personnel and resources for purposes not in line with the business interest of Stradcom. In fact, respondent admitted that she actually took home some of the training materials owned by the company without the latter's prior clearance and without disclosed purpose.</p><p> Such dishonesty on the part of the respondent in carrying out her duties is prejudicial to the interest of Stradcom and constitutes just cause to terminate her employment.</p><p> Considering the foregoing, this Court agrees with the findings of the NLRC that there was a just cause for the respondent's dismissal. We emphasize that dismissal of a dishonest employee is to the best interest not only of the management but also of labor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> Stradcom, as an employer in the exercise of self-protection, cannot be compelled to continue employing an employee who is guilty of acts inimical to its interest. </p><table width="50%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><i>Respondent is entitled to nominal damages for violation of her right to statutory procedural due process</i> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>We note however that even if there is a just cause to terminate respondent's employment, her right to due process was not satisfied. </p><p> On the matter of procedural due process, it is well-settled that the employer must furnish the employee with two written notices before termination of employment can be legally effected.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> The first apprises the employee of the particular acts or omissions for which dismissal is sought.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> The second informs the employee of the employer's decision to dismiss him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup></p><p> The case of <i>Libcap Marketing Corp, et. al. v. Baquial</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> explains: </p><blockquote> <p> The law and jurisprudence, on the other hand, allow the award of nominal damages in favor of an employee in a case where a valid cause for dismissal exists but the employer fails to observe due process in dismissing the employee. Financial assistance is granted as a measure of equity or social justice, and is in the nature or takes the place of severance compensation.</p> <p> On the other hand, nominal damages "may be awarded to a plaintiff whose right has been violated or invaded by the defendant, for the purpose of vindicating or recognizing that right, and not for indemnifying the plaintiff for any loss suffered by him. Its award is thus not for the purpose of indemnification for a loss but for the recognition and vindication of a right." The amount of nominal damages to be awarded the employee is addressed to the sound discretion of the court, taking into consideration the relevant circumstances. (Citations omitted)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> As discussed above, the Court is given the latitude to determine the amount of nominal damages to be awarded to an employee who was validly dismissed but whose due process rights were violated. The two causes for a valid dismissal in the Labor Code are under Article 282, due to just causes and Article 283, based on authorized causes. These were differentiated in the case of <i>Jaka Food Processing Corp. v.

Thus, it can be said that the employee himself initiated the dismissal process.</p> <p> On another breath, a dismissal for an authorized cause under Article 283 does not necessarily imply delinquency or culpability on the part of the employee. Instead, the dismissal process is initiated by the employer's exercise of his management prerogative, i.e. when the employer opts to install labor saving devices, when he decides to cease business operations or when, as in this case, he undertakes to implement a retrenchment program.</p> <p> x x x x</p> <p> Accordingly, it is wise to hold that: (1) if the dismissal is based on a just cause under Article 282 but the employer failed to comply with the notice requirement, the sanction to be imposed upon him should be tempered because the dismissal process was, in effect, initiated by an act imputable to the employee; and (2) if the dismissal is based on an authorized cause under Article 283 but the employer failed to comply with the notice requirement, the sanction should be stiffer because the dismissal process was initiated by the employer's exercise of his management prerogative.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> Here, the cause for termination was loss of trust and confidence, thus due to the employee or respondent's fault, but Stradcom failed to comply with the twin-notice requirement, thus, as a measure of equity, We order Stradcom to pay respondent nominal damages in the amount of P30,000. </p><table width="50%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><i>The solidary liability of Chua as a corporate officer is not proper and must be recalled</i> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>It is well-settled that a corporation has its own legal personality separate and distinct from those of its stockholders, directors or officers.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> Absence of any evidence that a corporate officer and/or director has exceeded their authority, or their acts are tainted with malice or bad faith, they cannot be held personally liable for their official acts.
