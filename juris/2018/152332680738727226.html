				<BR><BR><div align="justify">A single act may give rise to multiple offenses. Thus, charging an accused with rape, under the Revised Penal Code, and with sexual abuse, under Republic Act No. 7610, in case the offended party is a child 12 years old and above, will not violate the right of the accused against double jeopardy.<p> This resolves an appeal from the October 9, 2013 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR HC No. 01032 affirming the conviction of accused-appellant, Bienvinido Udang, Sr. y Sevilla (Udang), for two (2) counts of rape defined under Article 266-A, paragraph 1 of the Revised Penal Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Udang was sentenced to suffer the penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua</em> on both counts and ordered to pay the private complainant civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages. </p><p> On December 8, 2005, two (2) Informations for child abuse were filed against Udang before the Regional Trial Court of Cagayan de Oro City. The first was docketed as Family Case No. 2006-140, the accusatory portion of which read: </p><blockquote> <p> The undersigned Prosecutor II accuses BIENVINIDO UDANG for the crime of CHILD ABUSE, committed as follows:</p> <blockquote> <p> That in the later of December, 2003, at more or less 9:00 o'clock in the evening, at Lumbia, Cagayan de Oro City, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, did then and there willfully, unlawfully, feloniously and sexually abuse one [AAA], 14 yrs. old, minor by committing the following acts, to wit: accused together with Bienvinido Udang, Jr., Betty Udang and the offended party dr[a]nk three (3) bottles of pocket size of [T]anduay rum in the house of the accused and when offended party became intoxicated, accused brought and carried her inside the room and undressed her by removing her . . . clothes and panty and accused placed himself on top of her and have sexual intercourse with offended party herein, which acts of the accused had clearly debased, degraded or demeaned the intrinsic worth and dignity of the said minor as a human being.</p> </blockquote> <p> Contrary to and in Violation of Article 266-A in relation to Sec. 5 (b) of R.A. 7610.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> The second Information, docketed as Family Case No. 2006-141, read: </p><blockquote> <p> The undersigned Prosecutor II accuses BIENVINIDO UDANG for the crime of CHILD ABUSE, committed as follows:</p> <blockquote> <p> That in the later part of September, 2002, at more or less 9:00 o'clock in the evening, at Lumbia, Cagayan de Oro City, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, did then and there willfully, unlawfully, feloniously, and sexually abuse one [AAA], 14 yrs. old, minor by committing the following acts, to wit: accused together with his [daughter] Betty Udang, Renate Yana and the offended party dr[a]nk five (5) bottles of pocket size [T]anduay rum in the house of the accused and when offended party became intoxicated, accused brought her inside his room, her clothings (sic) were removed and then and there accused placed himself on top of her and have sexual intercourse with the offended party herein, which acts of the accused had clearly debased, degraded or demeaned the intrinsic worth and dignity of the said minor as a human being.</p> </blockquote> <p> Contrary to and in Violation of Article 266-A in relation to Sec. 5 (b) of R.A. 7610.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Udang pleaded not guilty to both charges during his arraignment on June 26, 2006.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Joint trial then ensued.</p><p> Testimonies from prosecution witnesses, private complainant, AAA, and Dr. Darlene T. Revelo (Dr. Revelo) of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the Northern Mindanao Medical Center, Cagayan de Oro City, proved the following version of the facts.</p><p> One evening in September 2002, AAA, then 12 years old,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> drank alcoholic beverages with Udang's children, her neighbors: Betty Udang (Betty) and Bienvinido Udang, Jr. (Bienvinido, Jr.), at their house in Lumbia, Cagayan de Oro City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></p><p> After drinking five (5) bottles of Tanduay rum, AAA became intoxicated. She later realized that she was being carried by Udang into a dark room where he laid her on the bed, undressed her, and started kissing her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Udang then went on top of AAA and inserted his penis into her vagina.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></p><p> After the incident, Udang went out to report for duty as barangay tanod while AAA remained inside his house as she was still too weak to move.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></p><p> One (1) year and three (3) months after, in December 2003, AAA, who by then was already 13 years old, again had some drinks at Udang's house. This time, she was with Bienvinido, Jr. and Udang himself. When AAA felt sleepy, she went into one (1) of the rooms inside the house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> While AAA was lying in bed, Udang, who had followed her into the room, went on top of her, undressed her, and inserted his penis into her vagina until he ejaculated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> After having sexual intercourse with AAA, Udang went out to report for duty as barangay tanod. AAA, too tired, remained lying in bed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></p><p> On April 14, 2004, AAA had herself physically examined by Dr. Revelo at the Northern Mindanao Medical Center in Cagayan de Oro City. Dr. Revelo found that AAA had hymenal lacerations in the 4, 7, and 10 o'clock positions,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> as well as "excoriations" or reddish superficial scratched marks between her thighs and genitalia.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> According to Dr. Revelo, these lacerations "could have been caused by trauma, frictions, infections, and also sexual intercourse."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Although in AAA's case, the hymenal lacerations were old and already healed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></p><p> The defense presented as witnesses Udang and his daughter, Betty. Monera Gandawali (Gandawali) and Emirald Orcales (Orcales), fellow inmates of AAA at the Cagayan de Oro City Jail, also testified in Udang's defense. Their testimonies proved the following version of the facts.</p><p> Udang's daughter, Betty, denied drinking with AAA in September 2002. She also belied the claim that her father, Udang, and her brother, Bienvinido, Jr., had drinks with AAA in December 2003. However, she alleged that AAA once went to their house to invite her to sniff some rugby, an offer which she refused. She maintained that AAA only wanted to get back at her father for having AAA arrested after she was caught grappling with Betty's grandmother because the latter tried to stop AAA from sniffing rugby inside Udang's house. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></p><p> After Udang caused the arrest of AAA for sniffing rugby,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> AAA was detained at the Cagayan de Oro City Jail where she, Gandawali and Orcales became fellow inmates.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></p><p> Gandawali testified that sometime in 2007, she had the chance to talk to AAA when the latter became anxious for receiving a subpoena to testify in the cases she filed against Udang. During their conversation, AAA disclosed that she was never actually raped by Udang and that it was actually her stepfather who wanted to implicate him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></p><p> For her part, Orcales testified that she did not know Udang personally. She claimed that she only knew Udang when AAA divulged her desire to write to Udang and ask for his forgiveness. AAA likewise disclosed to Orcales that it was not Udang but a security guard who had raped her and that it was AAA's mother who had forced her to testify against Udang in retaliation for her arrest for sniffing rugby.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></p><p> In his defense, Udang denied ever raping AAA. He testified that he was at home with his mother and other siblings at the time of the alleged incident in September 2002. As for the alleged second incident in December 2003, Udang claimed that he was again at home with his mother and siblings, Susan Udang and Cito Udang. He asserted that at 9:00 p.m., he reported for duty as barangay tanod with his colleagues, Ruel Labis and Carlo Banianon. Udang saw no reason for AAA to falsely charge him with rape since no animosity existed between them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></p><p> Branch 22, Regional Trial Court, Cagayan de Oro City found for the prosecution and convicted Udang of rape under Article 266-A(1) of the Revised Penal Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> instead of sexual abuse under Section 5(b) of Republic Act No. 7610.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> It ratiocinated that while the allegations in the first and second Informations satisfied the elements of rape under the first and third paragraphs of Article 266-A, respectively, the charges can only be one (1) for rape under the first paragraph of Article 266-A because "[an] accused cannot be prosecuted twice for a single criminal act."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></p><p> The trial court found that the prosecution "indubitably established"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Udang's act of raping AAA since she "categorically narrated"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> how he took advantage of her while she was intoxicated and that had she resisted his advances, she would be mauled by Betty. That AAA was raped was also supported by Dr. Revelo's finding of hymenal lacerations and excoriations on AAA's thighs and genitalia.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></p><p> The trial court did not give credence to Udang's defense of denial and alibi, stating that he could have requested his family members and fellow barangay tanods, who were allegedly with him at the time of the incidents, to corroborate his testimony but that he failed to do so. Without the corroborating testimony of these alleged companions, his testimony was, for the trial court, "self-serving and unworthy to be believed."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></p><p> The trial court likewise discounted Gandawali's and Orcales' testimonies for being hearsay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> As for Betty, the trial court found her testimony "bare"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> and "unsupported by evidence."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></p><p> In the Regional Trial Court March 12, 2012 Joint Decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Udang was sentenced to suffer the penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua</em> on both counts of rape under the first paragraph of Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code. He was also ordered to pay AAA civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages. The dispositive portion of this Decision read: </p><blockquote> <p> WHEREFORE, the foregoing premises considered[,] judgment is hereby rendered finding the accused BIENVINIDO UDANG y SEVILLA:</p> <p> 1. <b><i>GUILTY</i></b> beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape as defined and penalized under Article 266-A, Par. 1 of the Revised Penal Code in FC-Criminal Case No. 2006-140 and is hereby sentenced to suffer imprisonment of <em>reclusion perpetua</em>, and to pay "AAA" P50,000.00 as civil indemnity, P50,000.00 as moral damages and P30,000.00 as exemplary damages.</p> <p> 2. <b><i>GUILTY</i></b> beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape as defined and penalized under Article 266-A, Par. 1 of the Revised Penal Code in FC-Criminal Case No. 2006-141 and is hereby sentenced to suffer imprisonment of <em>reclusion perpetua</em>, and to pay "AAA" P50,000.00 as civil indemnity, P50,000.000 as moral damages and P30,000.00 as exemplary damages.</p> <p> SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)</p> </blockquote> <p> Udang appealed before the Court of Appeals, maintaining that he did not rape AAA. He also claimed that the judge who penned the Decision, Judge Richard D. Mordeno (Judge Mordeno), was not the judge who personally heard the witnesses testify and was not able to observe their demeanor during trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Udang argued that Judge Mordeno, therefore, was not in the position to rule on the credibility of AAA, given her "unbelievable story"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> of rape.</p><p> Udang emphasized that AAA's testimony was not credible for if she was allegedly raped in his house in September 2002, she would not have gone to the same house to have drinks with her supposed rapist a year after, in December 2003, on the risk of being raped again.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> He highlighted AAA's ill motive against him for having caused her detention in the Cagayan de Oro City Jail for sniffing rugby in his house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Finally, he emphasized that Dr. Revelo's testimony established that the lacerations found in AAA's genitalia could have been caused by trauma other than rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></p><p> In its ruling, the Court of Appeals found that although Judge Mordeno was not the one who conducted trial, Udang's guilt was nonetheless proven beyond reasonable doubt based on the records of the case and AAA's "categorical, convincing and consistent" testimony. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></p><p> That AAA returned to Udang's house a year after she was allegedly raped was, for the Court of Appeals, not as bizarre as Udang would make it appear. The Court of Appeals reasoned that "there is no standard form of behavior that can be expected of rape victims after they have been defiled because people react differently to emotional stress."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></p><p> Finally, the Court of Appeals rejected Udang's claim that AAA charged him with rape as vengeance for her arrest for sniffing rugby. It explained that "ill motives become inconsequential if there is an affirmative and credible declaration from the rape victim which clearly established the liability of the accused."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></p><p> Thus, the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court Decision<em> in toto</em> and dismissed Udang's appeal in its October 9, 2013 Decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> the dispositive portion of which read: </p><blockquote> <p> WHEREFORE, premises considered, the appeal is DISMISSED. The March 12, 2012 Joint Decision of the Regional Trial Court, 10th Judicial Region, Branch 22 of Cagayan de Oro City in FC Criminal Case Nos. 2006-140 and 2006-141 is hereby AFFIRMED <em>in toto</em>.</p> <p> <b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)</p> </blockquote> <p> The case was brought on appeal before this Court through a Notice of Appeal filed on October 23, 2013.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> In its February 26, 2014 Resolution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> this Court directed the parties to file their respective supplemental briefs.</p><p> In their respective manifestations, the Office of the Solicitor General,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> representing the People of the Philippines, and accused-appellant Udang<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> requested this Court to treat their appeal briefs filed before the Court of Appeals as their appeal briefs before this Court. This Court noted the parties' respective manifestations in its July 7, 2014 Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> and the case was considered submitted for decision.</p><p> Udang denies ever raping AAA and maintains his innocence, just as he did before the Court of Appeals. For him, AAA is not a credible witness and her story of rape is unbelievable. He claims that AAA should not have returned to his house a year after the alleged first incident to have drinks with him and his son, Bienvinido, Jr., had he really raped her. He also emphasizes how the rape charges were made only after he caused AAA's arrest for sniffing rugby in his house. He points out how two (2) of AAA's fellow inmates in the Cagayan de Oro City Jail, Gandawali and Orcales, even attested to his innocence based on AAA's confession that he did not rape her. Thus, the accused prays for his acquittal.</p><p> In its Brief for the Appellee,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> the Office of the Solicitor General argues that Udang was correctly convicted of two (2) counts of rape punished under Article 266-A(1) of the Revised Penal Code. It claims that "testimonies of child-victims of rape are to be given full weight and credence"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> because "a girl of tender years,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> like AAA at the time of the reported incidents, "is unlikely to impute to any man a crime so serious as rape, if what she claims is not true."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> It adds that "when a woman, more so when she is a minor, says she has been raped, she says in effect all that is required to prove the ravishment."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup></p><p> The principal issue for this Court's resolution is whether or not accused-appellant, Bienvinido Udang, Sr. y Sevilla, was correctly convicted of rape punished under the first paragraph of Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code.</p><p> The appeal is affirmed with modification. Based on the Informations, Udang was charged with two (2) counts of sexual abuse punished under Section 5(b) of Republic Act No. 7610. Hence, he could only be convicted of sexual abuse under the Informations filed in this case and not for rape under the Revised Penal Code. Furthermore, upon examination of the evidence presented, this Court finds Udang guilty of two (2) counts of sexual abuse. Thus, the penalty erroneously imposed on him—<em>reclusion perpetua</em> for each count of rape—should be reduced accordingly. </p><p align="center"> <b>I</b> </p><p> Udang attempts to raise doubt in his conviction because the judge who penned the trial court decision, Judge Mordeno, was not the judge who heard the parties and their witnesses during trial. For Udang, Judge Mordeno was in no position to rule on the credibility of the witnesses, specifically, of AAA, not having observed the manner by which the witnesses testified.</p><p> Ideally, the same trial judge<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> should preside over all the stages of the proceedings, especially in cases where the conviction or acquittal of the accused mainly relies on the credibility of the witnesses. The trial judge enjoys the opportunity to observe, first hand, "the aids for an accurate determination"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> of the credibility of a witness "such as the witness' deportment and manner of testifying, the witness' furtive glance, blush of conscious shame, hesitation, flippant or sneering tone, calmness, sigh, or the scant or full realization of an oath."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup></p><p> However, inevitable circumstances—the judge's death, retirement, resignation, transfer, or removal from office—may intervene during the pendency of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> An example is the present case, where the trial judge who heard the witnesses, Judge Francisco D. Calingin (Judge Calingin), compulsorily retired pending trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> Judge Calingin was then replaced by Judge Mordeno, who proceeded with hearing the other witnesses and writing the decision. Udang's argument cannot be accepted as this would mean that every case where the judge had to be replaced pending decision would have to be refiled and retried so that the judge who hears the witnesses testify and the judge who writes the decision would be the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> What Udang proposes is impracticable. </p><p> As early as 1915, this Court ruled in <em>United States v. Abreu</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> that in the absence of a law expressly prohibiting a judge from deciding a case where evidence was already taken, no such prohibition may be implied. In <em>Abreu</em>, Judge Jose C. Abreu (Judge Abreu) refused to resolve a case where the witnesses were already heard by the former presiding judge who had resigned, arguing that the witnesses were heard by a judge whose authority had been superseded by the then newly enacted Act No. 2347. </p><p> In rejecting Judge Abreu's argument, this Court held that the legislature could not have intended to render void all the acts undertaken by judges prior to the enactment of Act No. 2347.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> According to this Court, Act No. 2347's purpose was "simply to change the<i> personnel</i> of the judges"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> and that it specifically provided that all cases and judicial proceedings pending decision or sentence under the jurisdiction of the old courts shall be continued until their final decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup></p><p> Further, this Court explained that with the existence of the transcript of records, which are presumed to be a "complete, authentic record of everything that transpires during the trial,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> there is "little reason for asserting that one qualified person may not be able to reach a just and fair conclusion from [the] record as well as another."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> Thus, it compelled Judge Abreu to proceed with deciding the cases where evidence was already taken by the former presiding judge.</p><p> In <i>People v. Court of First Instance of Quezon, Br. X</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> a decision acquitting the accused was penned by a trial judge temporarily detailed to Branch 10 of the Court of First Instance of Quezon. However, the decision was later on promulgated by a different judge who was subsequently appointed permanently. The People of the Philippines then opposed the judgment of acquittal, arguing that it was void for being promulgated without authority as the temporary detail of the judge who penned the decision had already expired.</p><p> This Court rejected the reasoning that "[j]urisdiction is vested in the court, not in the judges, so that when a complaint or information is filed before one branch or judge, jurisdiction does not attach to said branch of the judge alone, to the exclusion of the others."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> Jurisdiction having attached with the court, the judgment of acquittal was deemed valid, regardless of the fact that one judge wrote it and another promulgated it.</p><p> Applying the foregoing, the trial court decision convicting Udang is valid, regardless of the fact that the judge who heard the witnesses and the judge who wrote the decision are different. With no showing of any irregularity in the transcript of records, it is presumed to be a "complete, authentic record of everything that transpire[d] during the trial,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> sufficient for Judge Mordeno to have evaluated the credibility of the witnesses, specifically, of AAA.</p><p align="center"> <b>II</b> </p><p> However, this Court disagrees with the trial court's ruling that charging Udang with both rape, under Article 266-A(1) of the Revised Penal Code, and sexual abuse, under Section 5(b) of Republic Act No. 7610, would violate his right against double jeopardy.</p><p> The right against double jeopardy is provided in Article III, Section 21 of the Constitution: </p><blockquote> <p> Section 21. No person shall be twice put in jeopardy of punishment for the same offense. If an act is punished by a law and an ordinance, conviction or acquittal under either shall constitute a bar to another prosecution for the same act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> The first sentence of the provision speaks of "the same offense," which this Court has interpreted to mean offenses having identical essential elements.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> Further, the right against double jeopardy serves as a protection: first, "against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal";<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> second, "against a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction";<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> and, finally, "against multiple punishments for the same offense."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup></p><p> Meanwhile, the second sentence of Article III, Section 21 speaks of "the same act," which means that this act, punished by a law and an ordinance, may no longer be prosecuted under either if a conviction or acquittal already resulted from a previous prosecution involving the very same act.</p><p> For there to be double jeopardy, "a first jeopardy [must] ha[ve] attached prior to the second;

They engaged in these acts out of mutual love and affection. But may the "'sweetheart theory" be invoked in cases of child prostitution and other sexual abuse prosecuted under Section 5, Article III of RA 7610? No.</p> <p> The sweetheart theory applies in acts of lasciviousness and rape, felonies committed against or without the consent of the victim. It operates on the theory that the sexual act was consensual. It requires proof that the accused and the victim were lovers and that she consented to the sexual relations. </p> <p> For purposes of sexual intercourse and lascivious conduct in child abuse cases under RA 7610, the sweetheart defense is unacceptable. <em>A child exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse cannot validly give consent to sexual intercourse with another person.</em> </p> <p> The language of the law is clear: it seeks to punish</p> <blockquote> <p> [t]hose who commit the act of sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct with a child exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse.</p> </blockquote> <p> Unlike rape, therefore,<i> consent is immaterial in cases involving violation of Section 5, Article III of RA 7610</i>. The mere act of having sexual intercourse or committing lascivious conduct with a child who is exploited in prostitution or subjected to sexual abuse constitutes the offense. It is a <i>malum prohibitum</i>, an evil that is proscribed. </p> <p> A child cannot give consent to a contract under our civil laws. This is on the rationale that she can easily be the victim of fraud as she is not capable of fully understanding or knowing the nature or import of her actions. The State, as <i>parens patriae</i>, is under the obligation to minimize the risk of harm to those who, because of their minority, are as yet unable to take care of themselves fully. Those of tender years deserve its protection. </p> <p> The harm which results from a child's bad decision in a sexual encounter may be infinitely more damaging to her than a bad business deal. Thus, the law should protect her from the harmful consequences of her attempts at adult sexual behavior. For this reason, a child should not be deemed to have validly consented to adult sexual activity and to surrender herself in the act of ultimate physical intimacy under a law which seeks to afford her special protection against abuse, exploitation and discrimination. (Otherwise, sexual predators like petitioner will be justified, or even unwittingly tempted by the law, to view her as fair game and vulnerable prey.) In other words, a child is presumed by law to be incapable of giving rational consent to any lascivious act or sexual intercourse.</p> <p> This must be so if we are to be true to the constitutionally enshrined State policy to promote the physical, moral, spiritual, intellectual and social well-being of the youth. This is consistent with the declared policy of the State </p> <blockquote> <p> <b>[T]o provide special protection to children from all forms of abuse</b>, neglect, cruelty, <b>exploitation</b> and discrimination, <b>and other conditions prejudicial to their development; provide sanctions for their commission</b> and carry out a program for prevention and deterrence of and crisis intervention in situations of child abuse, exploitation, and discrimination.</p> </blockquote> <p> as well as to</p> <blockquote> <p> <b>intervene on behalf of the child </b>when the parents, guardian, teacher or person having care or custody of the child fails or is unable to protect the child against abuse, exploitation, and discrimination or when <b>such acts against the child are committed by the said parent, guardian, teacher</b> or person having care and custody of the same. </p> </blockquote> <p> This is also in harmony with the foremost consideration of the child's best interests in all actions concerning him or her. </p> <blockquote> <p> <b>The best interest of children shall be the paramount consideration in all actions concerning them</b>, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities, and legislative bodies, consistent with the principles of First Call for Children as enunciated in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. <b>Every effort shall be exerted to promote the welfare of children and enhance their opportunities for a useful and happy life.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> (Emphasis in the original, citations omitted)</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> <i>People v.

Thus, she was compelled to return to the accused's house even after she was raped. AAA testified that Betty, her "friend," "sold"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup> her to Udang; Betty, who was taller than AAA, even threatened to "maul" her had she resisted: </p><blockquote> <p> Q.

And you were drinking Tanduay with the accused. </p> <p> A. Yes, because if [I] will not drink, his child Betty will maul me. Q. Was (sic) this Betty already mauled you? A. Yes, because whenever she asked me to buy cigarette, she maul (sic) me because she was taller than me before.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> To this Court, Betty's threat of violence was enough to induce fear in AAA. </p><p> AAA's delay in reporting the incidents did not affect her credibility. Delay is not and should not be an indication of a fabricated charge because, more often than not, victims of rape and sexual abuse choose to suffer alone and "bear the ignominy and pain" of their experience.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup> Here, AAA would not have revealed the incidents had she not been interviewed by the police when she was arrested for sniffing rugby: </p><blockquote> <p> Q.

In other words, the prosecution presented the "amount of evidence which would be sufficient to counterbalance the general presumption of innocence, and warrant a conviction."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup> The burden of evidence then shifted to the defense to counter the prosecution's<em> prima facie</em> case. Explaining the difference between "burden of proof” and "burden of evidence," this Court in <em>Bautista v. Sarmiento</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup> said: </p><blockquote> <p> When a <em>prima facie</em> case is established by the prosecution in a criminal case . . . the burden of proof does not shift to the defense. It remains throughout the trial with the party upon whom it is imposed—the prosecution. It is the burden of evidence which shifts from party to party depending upon the exigencies of the case in the course of the trial. This burden of going forward with the evidence is met by evidence which balances that introduced by the prosecution. Then the burden shifts back.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup> (Citation omitted)</p> </blockquote> <p> Unfortunately Udang failed to present evidence sufficient to counter the prosecution's <i>prima facie</i> case against him. </p><p> To destroy AAA's credibility, Udang capitalizes on the fact that he was charged only after he had AAA arrested for sniffing rugby. However, given AAA's affirmative and credible testimony, Udang's allegation of ill motive is deemed inconsequential. </p><p> While prosecution witness Dr. Revelo testified that the lacerations found in AAA's genitalia could have been "introduced by other operation"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> aside from sexual intercourse, Udang had nothing but denials and alibis as defenses. If, as Udang testified, he was with his mother, siblings, and some barangay tanods during the alleged incidents, he could have presented them as witnesses to corroborate his testimony, but he did not. Neither is Betty's testimony that Udang never had drinks with AAA sufficient to acquit her father. Udang's and Betty's testimonies are "self-serving"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup> and were correctly disregarded by the trial court.</p><p> As correctly held by the trial court and by the Court of Appeals, the testimonies of Gandawali and Orcales, AAA's fellow inmates at the Cagayan de Oro City Jail, were hearsay, hence, inadmissible in evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup> This is because Gandawali and Orcales had no personal knowledge of the incidents as they were not there when the incidents happened. </p><p> In sum, this Court is morally convinced that Udang committed two (2) counts of sexual abuse under Section 5(b) of Republic Act No. 7610, with each count punishable by <i>reclusion temporal </i>in its medium period to<i> reclusion perpetua</i>. Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup> and absent any mitigating or aggravating circumstance in the present case, the maximum imposable penalty for each count should be the penalty prescribed by law in its medium period<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup> which is<i> reclusion temporal</i> in its maximum period ranging from 17 years, four (4) months, and one (1) day to 20 years.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup> On the other hand, the minimum term of the imposable penalty shall be the next penalty lower in degree than that prescribed by law which is <em>prision mayor</em> in its medium period to<em> reclusion temporal</em> in its minimum period.
