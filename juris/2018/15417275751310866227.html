				<BR><STRONG>REYES, JR., J:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an appeal<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> from the Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated December 22, 2016 of the Court of Appeals (CA) rendered in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 06464, which affirmed the Judgment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated October 16, 2013 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Agoo, La Union. In these decisions, accused Ryan Maralit <i>y </i>Casilang (Maralit) was found guilty of violating Section 5, Article II of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9165, otherwise known as the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act.<br><br><center><b>Factual Antecedents</b></center><br><br>Maralit was charged with the offense of illegal trade, transport, and delivery of dangerous drugs, punishable under Section 5, Article II of R.A. No. 9165. The Information against him was docketed as Criminal Case No. A-6046, which reads:<br><br><blockquote><center><u>Criminal Case No. A-6046</u><br></center><br>That on or about the 19<sup>th</sup> day of July 2011, in the Municipality of Sto. Tomas, Province of La Union, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above named accused did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and knowingly, trade, transport, deliver and give away two (2) bricks of marijuana to IO1 EFREN L. ESMIN with a total weight of ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY-NINE POINT NINETY-SEVEN (1,859.97) grams, a dangerous and prohibited drug, without any authority of law.<br><br>Contrary to the provision of Section 5, Art. II of R.A. 9165.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></blockquote><br><br>During the arraignment on August 17, 2011, the charge against Maralit was read to him in the Pangasinan dialect, a language he knew and understood. Maralit, with the assistance of his counsel, pleaded not guilty to the offense.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>The prosecution alleged that on July 19, 2011, IA3 Dexter B. Asayco (IA3 Asayco), the team leader of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency-La Union Special Enforcement Team (PDEA-LUSET), received information from a confidential informant that an individual known as "RAM," who comes from Dagupan City, Pangasinan, was a known dealer of <i>marijuana.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> The confidential informant described "RAM" as 5'11" in height, with an athletic built.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Following his receipt of this information, IA3 Asayco called for a briefing at around 9:00 a.m. regarding a planned entrapment operation against "RAM" later in the day.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Soon after, at 9:15 a.m., IA3 Asayco coordinated with the team leader of the La Union Provincial Anti-Illegal Drug Special Operation Task Group (PAIDSOTG), Police Chief Inspector Erwin Dayag (PCI Dayag). In response, PCI Dayag instructed a member of his team, Police Officer 2 Froilan D. Caalim (PO2 Caalim), to proceed to the PDEA office for the briefing.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>During the briefing, IA3 Asayco informed his team that the confidential informant gave "RAM" the cellphone number of the PDEA-LUSET, under the guise of an interested buyer of <i>marijuana</i> from Tarlac. "RAM," in several text messages, introduced himself as the cousin of the confidential informant and informed them that he had two (2) bricks of dried <i>marijuana</i> he can deliver to an interested buyer.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>IA3 Asayco then passed the cellphone to IO1 Efren L. Esmin (IO1 Esmin), a member of his team, and tasked him to make arrangements with "RAM" for the delivery of the <i>marijuana.</i> IO1 Esmin exchanged text messages with "RAM," and thereafter, "RAM" agreed to deliver the two (2) bricks of <i>marijuana</i> for Php 5,300.00 each (or an aggregate amount of Php 10,600.00). They also agreed to meet at Barangay Damortis, Sto. Tomas, La Union at 6:00 p.m. that day, to complete the transaction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>IO1 Esmin and PO2 Caalim were designated as the, arresting officers, while the rest of the team were tasked to secure the area.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> The briefing ended at around 12:00 noon, and after about an hour, the team proceeded to Sto. Tomas, La Union Police Station using a private vehicle. The team arrived at the police station at around 2:30 p.m., where they passed the time before the designated meeting time with "RAM."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>The team left the police station at around 4:30 p.m. and arrived at the target area by 5:00 p.m. Upon their arrival, the members of the team surveyed the area and positioned themselves according to the plan.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> At about 5:30 p.m., IO1 Esmin received a text message from "RAM" telling him that he was on his way aboard a bus, and identified a certain store as their meeting place. IO1 Esmin then waited for "RAM" outside the said store, while PO2 Caalim positioned himself across the street.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>At around 6:30 p.m., a man that matched the physical description of "RAM" approached IO1 Esmin. The man was holding a brown paper bag and he asked IO1 Esmin to confirm that he was the man from Tarlac. When IO1 Esmin answered in the affirmative, the man handed over the brown paper bag to him. IO1 Esmin opened the brown paper bag and inspected the contents. He found a white plastic bag inside the brown paper bag, which when opened, revealed two (2) bricks of <i>marijuana.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>When IO1 Esmin found that the brown paper bag contained substances suspected to be <i>marijuana, </i>he arrested the man later identified as accused Maralit, and informed him of his constitutional rights.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> In the meantime, the other team members contacted two (2) barangay officials and a media representative to witness the marking and inventory of the illegal drugs. They were unable to obtain the presence of a Department of Justice (DOJ) representative allegedly because the entrapment operation ended after office hours, and there was no available DOJ representative beyond this time.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> IO1 Esmin then frisked Maralit for dangerous weapons and discovered a cellphone in his person. They did not find any messages or a SIM card on the cellphone.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>The barangay officials and the media representative arrived at the scene about ten minutes after Maralit's arrest. IO1 Esmin proceeded to mark the evidence in the presence of the barangay officials, the media representative, and Maralit. The brown paper bag was marked as "A," the white plastic bag containing the two (2) bricks of <i>marijuana </i>was marked as "A-1 " the bricks of <i>mariiuana </i>were marked as "A-2" and "A-3 " respectively, and the cellphone was marked as "B." Each item was also marked with IO1 Esmin's initials ("ELE"), the date ("19 July 2011"), and IO1 Esmin's signature.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>After the marking, IO1 Esmin made an inventory of the seized items.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Photographs of the marking and inventory were also taken.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>The team took Maralit and the seized items to the PDEA Regional Office 1 in Camp Diego Silang, Carlatan, San Fernando City, La Union.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> IO1 Esmin then prepared the Booking Sheet and Arrest Report,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> as well as the Request for Laboratory Examination.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> The Request for Laboratory Examination was signed by IA3 Asayco, and later on delivered by IO1 Esmin to Lei-Yen Valdez (Valdez) of the PDEA Regional Office 1 Laboratory at 7:30 p.m. of the same day.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>The chemistry report yielded a positive result for the presence of <i>marijuana </i>in the specimen samples taken from the pieces of evidence marked as "A-2" and "A-3."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>After the presentation and offer of the prosecution's evidence, Maralit filed a Demurrer to Evidence on June 13, 2013. He alleged that the prosecution's evidence was insufficient to find him guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime charged. Particularly, Maralit pointed out that the money used for the entrapment operation was not even marked or presented before the trial court, which negates the presence of a consideration for the sale of the subject drugsâ€”an essential element of Section 5, Article II of R.A. No. 9165.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> He also argued that the absence of the DOJ representative during the marking and inventory of the seized items casts doubt on their identity and integrity, which warrants his acquittal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> The prosecution objected to the Demurrer to Evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>In an Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> dated July 23, 2013, the RTC denied Maralit's Demurrer to Evidence for lack of merit. The trial court further ruled that since the demurrer was filed without leave of court, Maralit was deemed to have waived the right to present his evidence and the case was submitted for decision.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br><center><b>Ruling of the RTC</b></center><br><br>In the Judgment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> dated October 16, 2013 of the RTC, Maralit was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt for the violation of Section 5, Article II of R.A. No. 9165, thus:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing, this Court finds accused [MARALIT] GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT of violation of Section 5 of [R.A.] No. 9165 and hereby sentences him to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment, the accused shall be credited in the service of his sentence with his preventive imprisonment under the terms and conditions set forth by Article 29 of the Revised Penal Code and to pay a fine of five hundred thousand pesos (Php500,000.00).<br><br>The items subject of the case, particularly the two (2) bricks of <i> marijuana </i>with a total weight of 1,859.97 grams shall be forfeited in favor of the government and shall be destroyed in accordance with law.<br><br>Agoo, La Union, October 16, 2013.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></blockquote><br><br>The trial court ruled that it was unnecessary for the prosecution to present the money used for the entrapment operation. The RTC further found that the chain of custody was sufficiently established despite the absence of a DOJ representative during the marking of the seized pieces of evidence. Thus, the integrity and evidentiary value of the illegal drugs taken from Maralit were preserved.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Aggrieved, Maralit filed a Notice of Appeal with the RTC on October 23, 2013.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> The RTC granted the appeal in its Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> dated October 29, 2013.<br><br>In his brief, Maralit alleged that the trial court erred in finding him guilty of the offense charged against him, considering that the prosecution failed to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. According to Maralit, the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses were contrary to the common experience and observation of mankind, especially pointing out the absence of a consideration for the alleged purchase of the seized marijuana bricks.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Maralit further assailed the inconsistencies in the testimony of IO1 Esmin and the documentary evidence of the prosecution,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> as well as the failure of the PDEA officers to comply with the chain of custody rule.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>The People, on the other hand, argued that there was sufficient proof to establish Maralit's guilt beyond reasonable doubt. According to the prosecution, it was unnecessary to present the marked money used for the entrapment operation. Section 5, Article II of R.A. No. 9165 punishes the mere act of delivering dangerous drugs, even without a consideration. The People also refuted the argument of Maralit regarding the break in the chain of custody, and pointed out that by virtue of his admissions in the RTC, the integrity of the seized illegal drugs was preserved.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br><center><b>Ruling of the CA</b></center><br><br>In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> dated December 22, 2016, the CA denied the appeal and affirmed the judgment of the RTC, thus:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the instant appeal is DENIED. The assailed of Decision dated October 16, 2013 of the [RTC], Branch 32 Agoo, La Union in Criminal Case No. A-6046 is hereby AFFIRMED.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></blockquote><br><br>The CA found that the prosecution sufficiently established the chain of custody of the illegal drugs. The inconsistency as to the time stated by IO1 Esmin in his testimony and the time reflected in the Request for Laboratory Examination, was deemed a trivial matter that does not affect the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized illegal drugs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Considering that IO1 Esmin was the only person in custody of the seized items until it was turned over to the forensic chemist for examination, the CA ruled that the chain of custody was adequately established.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>Unsatisfied with the decision of the CA, Maralit appealed his conviction to the Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> The CA gave due course to the appeal in its Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> dated January 25, 2017.<br><br><center><b>Ruling of the Court</b></center><br><br>The issue presented before the Court is whether the guilt of Maralit was proven beyond reasonable doubt. For purposes of resolving this issue, the Court must review whether the identity and the integrity of the seized illegal drugsâ€”the <i>corpus delicti</i> of this caseâ€”were duly preserved.<br><br>There being no evidence that the chain of custody over the illegal drugs was broken, the Court finds that the guilt of the accused was proven beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>The Court denies the present appeal.<br><br><b><i>A conviction for violating Section 5,<br>Article II of R.A. No. 9165 does not<br>always require the presentation of<br>the marked money.</i></b><br><br>The Information against Maralit charged him with the violation of Section 5, Article II of R.A. No. 9165. It further alleged that Maralit "willfully, unlawfully[,] and knowingly trade[d], transport[ed], deliver[ed] and [gave] away two (2) bricks of <i> marijuana" </i> to IO1 Esmin.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Maralit alleged that in order to be convicted under this provision, the prosecution should have established the consideration for his supposed sale of the <i>marijuana</i> bricks.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>While an accused charged with the violation of this provision is usually caught in the act of selling illegal drugs, Section 5, Article II of R.A. No. 9165 also punishes the trade, delivery, distribution, and giving away of any dangerous drug to another. Section 3, Article I of R.A. No. 9165 defines the punishable acts of <i>"deliver" </i>and <i>"trading" </i>as follows:<br><br><blockquote>(k) Deliver. â€“ Any act of knowingly passing a dangerous drug to another, personally or otherwise, and by any means, <u><b>with or without </b></u>consideration.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(jj) Trading. â€“ Transactions involving the illegal trafficking of dangerous drugs and/or controlled precursors and essential chemicals using electronic devices such as, but not limited to, text messages, email, mobile or landlines, two-way radios, internet, instant messengers and chat rooms or acting as a broker in any of such transactions <u><b>whether for money or any other consideration</b></u> in violation of this Act. (Emphasis and underscoring Ours)</blockquote><br><br>Clearly, the presence (or absence) of consideration in exchange for the delivery of dangerous drugs is not material when an accused is charged with committing the other acts punishable under Section 5, Article II of R.A. No. 9165. The act of giving away, transporting, or delivering the two (2) bricks of <i>marijuana </i>is already a punishable act in itself.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>In <i>People v. De la Cruz,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> the Court held that the presentation of the marked money, as well as the fact that the money was paid in exchange for the delivery of dangerous drugs, were unnecessary to consummate the crime, thus:<br><br><blockquote>[E]ven if the money given to De la Cruz was not presented in court, the same would not militate against the People's case. In fact, there was even no need to prove that the marked money was handed to the appellants in payment of the goods. The crime could have been consummated by the mere delivery of the prohibited drugs. What the law proscribes is not only the act of selling but also, albeit not limited to, the act of delivering. In the latter case, <b>the act of knowingly passing a dangerous drug to another personally or otherwise, and by any means, with or without consideration, consummates the offense.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> (Emphasis Ours)</blockquote><br><br>As applied in the present case, the prosecution correctly charged Maralit with the violation of Section 5, Article II of R.A. No. 9165. Maralit could not be accused of the illegal sale of dangerous drugs because the transaction was not consummated prior to his arrestâ€”there being no money taken in return for the <i>marijuana </i>bricks. This notwithstanding, his mere act of delivering and conveying these <i>marijuana </i>bricks to IO1 Esmin already constitutes a violation of Section 5, Article II of R.A. No. 9165.<br><br>It was therefore unnecessary for the prosecution to present the money used in the entrapment operation in order to prove Maralit's guilt beyond reasonable doubt. In the same manner, neither may Maralit disprove the fact of delivery by simply pointing out that there was no consideration received in exchange for the dangerous drugs.<br><br><b><i>The prosecution was able to<br>establish an unbroken chain of <br>custody.</i></b><br><br>In any case, the prosecution still bore the burden of proving the identity and integrity of the <i>corpus delicti, </i>which in this case is the seized bricks of <i>marijuana. </i>This is accomplished by proving an unbroken chain of custody, to ensure that the items presented before the trial court are the same items taken from the accused. The chain of custody rule thus serves as a mode of authenticating evidence that removes doubts regarding the identity of the evidence presented in court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>In <i>People v. Kamad,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> the Court identified the following links in the chain of custody, which the prosecution should establish:<br><br><blockquote><i>First,</i> the seizure and marking, if practicable, of the illegal drug recovered from the accused by the apprehending officer;<br><br><i>Second,</i> the turnover of the illegal drug seized by the apprehending officer to the investigating officer;<br><br><i>Third,</i> the turnover by the investigating officer of the illegal drug to the forensic chemist for laboratory examination; and<br><br><i>Fourth,</i> the turnover and submission of the marked illegal drug seized from the forensic chemist to the court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup></blockquote><br><br>Each link is discussed sequentially to determine whether the prosecution was able to discharge its burden of proving the identity and integrity of the <i>corpus delicti </i>in this case.<br><br><i>The First Link: the seizure, marking,<br>and inventory of the illegal drugs<br>taken from Maralit.</i><br><br>Section 21(1) of R.A. No. 9165 provides the procedure for the custody and disposition of confiscated, seized, or surrendered dangerous drugs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> This provision specifically requires the apprehending officers to <i>immediately </i>conduct a physical inventory and to photograph the seized items in the presence of the following: (a) the accused or the person from whom the items were confiscated, or his representative or counsel; (b) a representative from the media; (c) a representative from the DOJ; and (d) any elected public official. They should also sign the inventory and be furnished a copy thereof.<br><br>Here, it is evident from the records that the marking and inventory of the two (2) bricks of <i>marijuana </i>were immediately conducted at the place of the arrest, soon after these items were taken from Maralit. Between Maralit's arrest and the marking of the items, only ten (10) minutes passed, which the prosecution adequately justified as the time spent by the apprehending team waiting for the arrival of the witnesses to the marking and inventory.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>Furthermore, during the marking and inventory of the seized items, there were two (2) barangay officials and one (1) media representative present. While there was no DOJ representative to witness the marking and inventory, IO1 Esmin and PO2 Caalim explained that they were no longer able to contact a representative from the DOJ because by the time they were finished with the entrapment operation, it was beyond office hours.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>The Court does not lose sight of the fact that under various field conditions, compliance with the requirements under Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165 may not always be possible.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> Thus, while the presence of all these witnesses are ordinarily required, non-compliance is excusable when the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items were properly preserved. There should also be proper justification for the arresting officers' failure to comply with the procedure under Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>Considering that the police officers explained the absence of the DOJ representative, coupled with the fact that they endeavored to comply with the mandatory procedure by securing the presence of elected officials and a representative from the media, their failure to strictly observe Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165 is not fatal to the case. The integrity and evidentiary value of the seized evidence were nonetheless preserved because there were other witnesses to the marking and inventory of the seized bricks of <i>marijuana. </i>Two (2) barangay officials and a representative from the media were present during this stage, photographs were taken, and an inventory signed by these witnesses was prepared.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> Furthermore, while the inventory does not bear the signature of Maralit, the photographs show that Maralit was present during the marking and inventory of the seized items.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>Notably, the subsequent amendment of Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165 requires only an elected public official, and a representative of the National Prosecution Service <i>or</i> the media, to witness the marking and physical inventory of the seized items.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> The Court also explained in <i>Lescano v. People</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> that the media representative may witness the marking and inventory as an alternative to a DOJ representative:<br><br><blockquote>Moreover, Section 21(1) requires at least three (3) persons to be present during the physical inventory and photographing. These persons are: first, the accused or the person/s from whom the items were seized; second, an elected public official; and third, a representative of the National Prosecution Service. <b>There are, however, alternatives to the first and the third.</b> As to the first (i.e., the accused or the person/s from whom items were seized), there are two (2) alternatives: first, his or her representative; and second, his or her counsel. <b>As to the representative of the National Prosecution Service, a representative of the media may be present in his or her place.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> (Emphasis Ours)</blockquote><br><br>Verily, the presence of the other witnesses, the immediate marking and inventory conducted after Maralit's arrest, and the photographs taken during that time, all attest to the identity and integrity of the seized dangerous drugs. Therefore, the first link in the chain of custody was sufficiently established in this case.<br><br><i>The Second and Third Links: the<br>turnover of the seized drugs by the<br>apprehending officer to the<br>investigating officer, and in turn, to<br>the forensic chemist.</i><br><br>The second and third links in the chain of custody refer respectively to the turnover of the seized drugs by the apprehending officer to the investigating officer, and subsequently, by the investigating officer to the forensic chemist for examination. In this case, IO1 Esmin was the sole custodian of the seized items from the time Maralit was arrested, to the moment they returned to their office, and until such time that he turned it over to the forensic chemist:<br><br><blockquote><table Â ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"> <div align="JUSTIFY">Assistant Provincial Prosecutor Gaudencio G.

These include the fact that: (a) Valdez, the forensic chemist, personally received the Request for Laboratory Examination, together with the specimens enumerated in the request, from IO1 Esmin;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> (b) samples from the specimens were examined for the presence of dangerous drugs, which was later confirmed as positive for <i>marijuana;</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> (c) the specimens were taken from the two (2) bricks of <i>marijuana </i>marked as "A-2 ELE 19 July 2011" and "A-3 ELE 19 July 2011," both with signatures;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> and (d) the items duly described and marked were in the custody of the forensic chemist until these were submitted to the RTC.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>By virtue of these admissions, there is no question as to the fourth link in the chain of custody.

The prosecution also failed to present justifiable grounds for such non-compliance. In view thereof, the integrity and evidentiary value of the <i>corpus delicti </i>had been compromised.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>As summarized in the <i>ponencia, </i>the facts of the case are as follows:<br><br><blockquote>The prosecution alleged that on July 19, 2011, IA3 Dexter B. Asayco (IA3 Asayco), the team leader of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency-La Union Special Enforcement Team (PDEA-LUSET), received information from a confidential informant that an individual known as "RAM," who comes from Dagupan City, Pangasinan, was a known dealer of <i>marijuana. </i>The confidential informant described "RAM" as 5'11" in height, with an athletic built.<br><br>Following his receipt of this information, IA3 Asayco called for a briefing at around 9:00 a.m. regarding a planned entrapment operation against "RAM" later in the day. Soon after, at 9:15 a.m., IA3 Asayco coordinated with the team leader of the La Union Provincial Anti-Illegal Drug Special Operation Task Group (PAIDSOTG), Police Chief Inspector Erwin Dayag (PCI Dayag). In response, PCI Dayag instructed a member of his team, Police Officer 2 Froilan D. Caalim (PO2 Caalim), to proceed to the PDEA office for the briefing.<br><br>During the briefing, IA3 Asayco informed his team that the confidential informant gave "RAM" the cellphone number of the PDEA-LUSET, under the guise of an interested buyer of <i>marijuana </i>from Tarlac. "RAM," in several text messages, introduced himself as the cousin of the confidential informant and informed them that he had two (2) bricks of dried <i>marijuana </i>he can deliver to an interested buyer.<br><br>IA3 Asayco then passed the cellphone to IO1 Efren L. Esmin (IO1 Esmin), a member of his team, and tasked him to make arrangements with "RAM" for the delivery of the <i>marijuana. </i>IO1 Esmin exchanged text messages with "RAM," and thereafter, "RAM" agreed to deliver the two (2) bricks of <i>marijuana </i>for Php 5,300.00 each (or an aggregate amount of Php 10,600.00). They also agreed to meet at Barangay Damortis, Sto. Tomas, La Union at 6:00 p.m. that day, to complete the transaction.<br><br>IO1 Esmin and PO2 Caalim were designated as the arresting officers, while the rest of the team were tasked to secure the area. The briefing ended at around 12:00 noon, and after about an hour, the team proceeded to the Sto. Tomas, La Union Police Station using a private vehicle. The team arrived at the police station at around 2:30 p.m., where they passed the time before the designated meeting time with "RAM."<br><br>The team left the police station at around 4:30 p.m. and arrived at the target area by 5:00 p.m. Upon their arrival, the members of the team surveyed the area and positioned themselves according to the plan. At about 5:30 p.m., IO1 Esmin received a text message from "RAM" telling him that he was on his way aboard a bus, and identified a certain store as their meeting place. IO1 Esmin then waited for "RAM" outside the said store, while PO2 Caalim positioned himself across the street.<br><br>At around 6:30 p.m., a man that matched the physical description of "RAM" approached IO1 Esmin. The man was holding a brown paper bag and he asked IO1 Esmin to confirm that he was the man from Tarlac. When IO1 Esmin answered in the affirmative, the man handed over the brown paper bag to him. IO1 Esmin opened the brown paper bag and inspected the contents. He found a white plastic bag inside the brown paper bag, which when opened, revealed two (2) bricks of <i>marijuana.</i><br><br>When IO1 Esmin found that the brown paper bag contained substances suspected to be <i>marijuana, </i>he arrested the man later identified as the accused Maralit, and informed him of his constitutional rights. In the meantime, the other team members contacted two (2) barangay officials and a media representative to witness the marking and inventory of the illegal drugs. They were unable to obtain the presence of a Department of Justice (DOJ) representative allegedly because the entrapment operation ended after office hours, and there was no available DOJ representative beyond this time. IO1 Esmin then frisked Maralit for dangerous weapons and discovered a cellphone in his person. They did not find any messages or a SIM card on the cellphone.<br><br>The barangay officials and the media representative arrived at the scene about ten minutes after Maralit's arrest. IO1 Esmin proceeded to mark the evidence in the presence of the barangay officials, the media representative, and Maralit. The brown paper bag was marked as "A," the white plastic bag containing two (2) bricks of <i>marijuana </i>was marked as "A-1," the bricks of <i>marijuana </i>were marked as "A-2" and "A-3," respectively, and the cellphone was marked as "B." Each item was also marked with IO1 Esmin's initials ("ELE"), the date ("19 July 2011"), and IO1 Esmin's signature.<br><br>After the marking, IO1 Esmin made an inventory of the seized items. Photographs of the marking and inventory were also taken.<br><br>The team took Maralit and the seized items to the PDEA Regional Office 1 in Camp Diego Silang, Carlatan, San Fernando City, La Union. IO1 Esmin then prepared the Booking Sheet and Arrest Report, as well as the Request for Laboratory Examination. The Request for Laboratory Examination was signed by IA3 Asayco, and later on delivered by IO1 Esmin to Lei-Yen Valdez (Valdez) of the PDEA Regional Office 1 Laboratory at 7:30 p.m. of the same day.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></blockquote><br><br><i>No Sale of Dangerous Drugs</i><br><br>In order to properly secure the conviction of an accused charged with illegal sale of dangerous drugs, the prosecution must prove: (a) the identity of the buyer and the seller, the object, and the consideration; and (b) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, it is readily apparent that no sale was consummated as the consideration, much less its receipt by the accused-appellant, were not established.

The records of the case show that as early as 1:00 o'clock in the afternoon or more than five (5) hours before the buy-bust operation, the members of the buy-bust team were on their way to the area where the transaction took place. <b>Just as the buy-bust team sought the assistance of the local police in securing the presence of the media representative and the elected public officials, the buy-bust team could have easily made arrangements to secure the presence of a DOJ representative, prior to the closing time of the local prosecution office.</b><br><br>Furthermore, I submit that the phrase "immediately after seizure and confiscation" means that the physical inventory and photographing of the drugs were intended by the law to be made immediately after, or at the place of apprehension. And only if this is not practicable, then the inventory and photographing should be done as soon as the apprehending team reaches the nearest police station or the nearest office. There can be no other meaning to the plain import of this requirement. By the same token, however, this also means that the DOJ or media representative and the elected public official should already be physically present at the time of apprehension â€” a requirement that can easily be complied with by the buy-bust team considering that the buy-bust operation is, by its nature, a planned activity. Simply put, the apprehending team has enough time and opportunity to bring with them said witnesses.<br><br>In other words, while the physical inventory and photographing is allowed to be done "at the nearest police station or at the nearest office of the apprehending officer/team, whichever is applicable, in case of warrantless seizures," this does <u><b>not</b></u> dispense with the requirement of having the DOJ or media representative and the elected public official to be physically present at the time or near the place of apprehension. The reason is simple, it is at the time of arrest â€” or at the time of the drugs' "seizure and confiscation" â€” that the presence of the three witnesses is most needed, <u>as it is their presence at the time of seizure and confiscation that would <b>insulate</b> against the police practice of planting evidence.</u><br><br>Using the language of the Court in <i>People v. Mendoza,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> without the <u><b><i>insulating presence</i></b></u> of the representative from the media or the DOJ and any elected public official during the seizure and marking of the drugs, the evils of switching, "planting" or contamination of the evidence that had tainted the buy-busts conducted under the regime of RA 6425 (Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972) again reared their ugly heads as to negate the integrity and credibility of the seizure and confiscation of the subject bricks that were the evidence of the <i>corpus delicti, </i>and thus adversely affected the trustworthiness of the incrimination of the accused.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Thus, it is compliance with this most fundamental requirement â€” the presence of the "insulating" witnesses â€” that the pernicious practice of planting of evidence is greatly minimized if not foreclosed altogether. Stated otherwise, this is the first and foremost requirement provided by Section 21 to ensure the preservation of the "integrity and evidentiary value of the seized drugs" in a buy-bust situation whose nature, as already explained, is that it is a planned operation.<br><br>To restate, the presence of the three witnesses at the time of seizure and confiscation of the drugs must be secured and complied with <u>at the time of the warrantless arrest</u>; such that they are required to be at or near the intended place of the arrest so that they can be ready to witness the inventory and photographing of the seized and confiscated drugs "immediately after seizure and confiscation."<br><br>The practice of police operatives of not bringing to the intended place of arrest the DOJ or media representative and the elected public official, when they could easily do so â€” and "calling them in" to the police station to witness the inventory and photographing of the drugs only after the buy-bust operation has already been finished â€” does not achieve the purpose of the law in having these witnesses prevent or insulate against the planting of drugs. I believe the Court should send a strong message that faithful compliance with this most important requirement â€” bringing them a place near the intended place of arrest â€” should be strictly complied with.<br><br>Given the serious substantive and procedural lapses of the police officers, and considering that the <i>corpus delicti</i> has not been proved with unwavering exactitude, an essential element of the offense is missing, the conviction of the accused-appellant cannot be upheld.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>The presumption of innocence is overturned only when the prosecution has discharged its burden of proof, that is, proving the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> â€” to prove each and every element of the crime charged in the information to warrant a finding of guilt for that crime or for any other crime necessarily included therein.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> To be sure, the concept of moral certainty is subjective.
