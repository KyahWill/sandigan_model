This was further emphasized in <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. San Roque Power Corporation</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> where this Court categorically held that compliance with the 120+30-day periods under Section 112 of the 1997 NIRC is mandatory and jurisdictional. Exempted from this are VAT refund cases that are prematurely filed before the Court of Tax Appeals or before the lapse of the 120-day period between December 10, 2003, when the BIR issued Ruling No. DA-489-03, and October 6, 2010, when this Court promulgated <em>Aichi</em>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> </p><p> Section 112(D)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> is consistent with Section 11 of Republic Act No. 1125, as amended by Section 9 of Republic Act No. 9282 (2004), which provides a 30-day period of appeal either from receipt of the adverse decision of the Commissioner or from the lapse of the period fixed by law for action: </p><blockquote> <p> Section 11. <i>Who May Appeal; Mode of Appeal; Effect of Appeal</i>. -Any party adversely affected by a decision, ruling or inaction of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, . . . may<b> file an appeal with the CTA within thirty (30) days after the receipt of such decision or ruling or after the expiration of the period fixed by law for action</b> as referred to in Section 7(a)(2)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> herein. </p> <p> Appeal shall be made by filing a petition for review under a procedure analogous to that provided for under Rule 42 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure with the CTA <b>within thirty (30) days from the receipt of the decision or ruling or in the case of inaction as herein provided, from the expiration of the period fixed by law to act thereon</b>. (Emphasis supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> In this case, Team Energy's judicial claim was filed beyond the 30-day period required in Section 112(D). The administrative claim for refund was filed on December 17, 2004.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Thus, BIR had 120 days to act on the claim, or until April 16, 2005. Team Energy, in turn, had until May 16, 2005 to file a petition with the Court of Tax Appeals but filed its appeal only on July 22, 2005, or 67 days late. Thus, the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc correctly denied its claim for refund due to prescription. </p><p> Team Energy argues, however, that the application of the <em>Aichi</em> doctrine to its claim would violate the rule on non-retroactivity of judicial decisions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Team Energy adds that when it filed its claims for refund with the BIR and the Court of Tax Appeals, both the administrative and judicial claims for refund must be filed within the two (2)-year prescriptive period.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Moreover, Revenue Regulations No. 7-95 did not require a specific number of days after the 60-day, now 120-day, period given to the Commissioner to decide on the claim within which to appeal to the Court of Tax Appeals.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Team Energy contends that to deny its claim of P70,700,533.01 duly proven before the Court of Tax Appeals First Division "would result to unjust enrichment on the part of the government."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> </p><p> This Court is not persuaded. </p><p> When Team Energy filed its refund claim in 2004, the 1997 NIRC was already in effect, which clearly provided for: (a) 120 days for the Commissioner to act on a taxpayer's claim; and (b) 30 days for the taxpayer to appeal either from the Commissioner's decision or from the expiration of the 120-day period, in case of the Commissioner's inaction.</p><p> "Rules and regulations [including Revenue Regulations No. 7-95] or parts [of them] which are contrary to or inconsistent with [the NIRC] are . . . amended or modified accordingly."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> </p><p> This Court, in construing the law, merely declares what a particular provision has always meant. It does not create new legal obligations. This Court does not have the power to legislate. Interpretations of law made by courts necessarily always have a "retroactive" effect.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> </p><p> In <i>Aichi</i>, where the issue on prematurity of a judicial claim was first raised and passed upon, this Court applied outright its interpretation of the 1997 NIRC's language on the mandatory character of the 120+30-day periods. Consequently, it ordered the dismissal of <i>Aichi</i>'s appeal due to premature filing of its claim for refund/credit of input VAT. The administrative and judicial claims in <i>Aichi</i> were filed on September 30, 2004, even prior to the filing of Team Energy's claims. </p><p> <i>San Roque </i>dealt with judicial claims which were either prematurely filed or had already prescribed. That case, specifically in G.R. No. 197156, <i>Philex Mining Corporation v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue</i>, involved the filing of a judicial claim beyond the 30-day period to appeal as in this case. Then and there, this Court rejected Philex Mining Corporation's (Philex) judicial claim because of late filing: </p><blockquote> <p> Unlike San Roque and Taganito, Philex's case is not one of premature filing but of late filing. Philex did not file any petition with the CTA within the 120-day period. Philex did not also file any petition with the CTA within 30 days after the expiration of the 120-day period. Philex filed its judicial claim long after the expiration of the 120-day period, in fact 426 days after the lapse of the 120-day period. <b>In any event, whether governed by jurisprudence before, during, or after the <i>Atlas</i> case, Philex's judicial claim will have to be rejected because of late filing.</b> Whether the two-year prescriptive period is counted from the date of payment of the output VAT following the <i>Atlas </i>doctrine, or from the close of the taxable quarter when the sales attributable to the input VAT were made following the<i> Mirant</i> and <i>Aichi </i>doctrines, Philex's judicial claim was indisputably filed late. </p> <p> The <i>Atlas</i> doctrine cannot save Philex from the late filing of its judicial claim. <b>The inaction of the Commissioner on Philex's claim during the 120-day period is, by express provision of law, "deemed a denial" of Philex's claim. Philex had 30 days from the expiration of the 120-day period to file its judicial claim with the CTA. Philex's failure to do so rendered the "deemed a denial" decision of the Commissioner final and inappealable.</b> The right to appeal to the CTA from a decision or "deemed a denial" decision of the Commissioner is merely a statutory privilege, not a constitutional right. The exercise of such statutory privilege requires strict compliance with the conditions attached by the statute for its exercise. Philex failed to comply with the statutory conditions and must thus bear the consequences.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted)</p> </blockquote> <p> Philex filed its judicial claim on October 17, 2007, before <i>Aichi </i>was promulgated.</p><p> The proper application of the mandatory and jurisdictional nature of the 120+30-day periods, whether prospective or retroactive, was, in fact, at the heart of this Court <i>en banc</i>'s debates in <i>San Roque</i>. </p><p> Some justices were of the view that the mandatory and jurisdictional nature of the 120+30-day periods must be applied prospectively, or at the earliest upon the effectivity of Revenue Regulations No. 16-2005,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> or upon the finality of <i>Aichi</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Still others<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> argued for retroactive application to all undecided VAT refund cases regardless of the period when the claim for refund was made.</p><p> The majority held that the 120+30-day mandatory periods were already in the 1997 NIRC when the taxpayers filed their judicial claims. The law is clear, plain, and unequivocal and must be applied exactly as worded. However, the majority considered as an exception, for equitable reasons, BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03, which expressly stated that taxpayers need not wait for the lapse of the 120-day period before seeking judicial relief. Thus, judicial claims filed from December 10, 2003, when BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 was issued, to October 6, 2010, when the <i>Aichi</i> doctrine was adopted, were excepted from the strict application of the 120+30-day mandatory and jurisdictional periods.</p><p> San Roque Power Corporation (San Roque) filed a motion for reconsideration and supplemental motion for reconsideration in G.R. No. 187485, arguing for the prospective application of the 120+30-day mandatory and jurisdictional periods. This Court denied <em>San Roque </em>with finality on October 8, 2013.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> </p><p> In <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v.

While its administrative claim was found to have been timely filed, this Court nevertheless denied its refund claim because the judicial claim was filed late or only 138 days after the lapse of the 120+30-day periods. This Court held that the 30-day period to appeal was mandatory and jurisdictional, applying the ruling in <i>San Roque</i>. It further emphasized that late filing was absolutely prohibited.</p><p> Since then, the 120+30-day periods have been applied to pending cases,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> resulting in denial of taxpayers' claims due to late filing.

In that case, AT&amp;T Communications Services Philippines, Inc. (AT&amp;T) applied for tax refund and/or tax credit of its excess/unutilized input VAT from zero-rated sales of services for calendar year 2002. The Court of Tax Appeals First Division, as affirmed by the En Banc, denied AT&amp;T's claim "for lack of substantiation" on the ground that: </p><blockquote> <p> [Considering that the subject revenues pertain to gross receipts from services rendered by petitioner, <b><u>valid VAT official receipts</u></b> and <u>not mere sales invoices <b>should have been submitted</b></u> in support thereof.

It further explained: </p><blockquote> <p> Sales invoices are recognized commercial documents to facilitate trade or credit transactions.

This time in <i>AT&amp;T Communications Services Phils., Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> this Court held that there was a clear delineation between official receipts and invoices and that these two (2) documents could not be used interchangeably. According to this Court, Section 113 on invoicing requirements must be read in conjunction with Sections 106 and 108, which specifically delineates sales invoices for sales of goods and official receipts for sales of services. </p><blockquote> <p> Although it appears under [Section 113 of the 1997 NIRC] that there is no clear distinction on the evidentiary value of an invoice or official receipt, it is worthy to note that the said provision is a general provision which covers all sales of a VAT[-]registered person, whether sale of goods or services. It does not necessarily follow that the legislature intended to use the same interchangeably. The Court therefore cannot conclude that the general provision of Section 113 of the NIRC of 1997, as amended, intended that the invoice and official receipt can be used for either sale of goods or services, because there are specific provisions of the Tax Code which clearly delineates the difference between the two transactions.</p> <p> In this instance, Section 108 of the NIRC of 1997, as amended, provides:</p> <blockquote> <p> SEC. 108. <strong><em>Value-added Tax on <u>Sale of Services</u></em></strong> and Use or Lease of Properties. —</p> <p>. . . . </p> <p> (C) Determination of the Tax — The tax shall be computed by multiplying the total amount indicated in the <b><i>official receipt</i></b> by one-eleventh (1/11). </p> </blockquote> <p> Comparatively, Section 106 of the same Code covers sale of goods, thus:</p> <blockquote> <p> SEC. 106. <b><i>Value-added Tax on <u>Sale of Goods or Properties</u></i></b>. —</p> <p>. . . . </p> <p> (D) Determination of the Tax. — The tax shall be computed by multiplying the total amount indicated in the <b><i>invoice</i></b> by one-eleventh (1/11).</p> </blockquote> <p> Apparently, the construction of the statute shows that the legislature intended to distinguish the use of an invoice from an official receipt. It is more logical therefore to conclude that subsections of a statute under the same heading should be construed as having relevance to its heading. The legislature separately categorized VAT on sale of goods from VAT on sale of services, not only by its treatment with regard to tax but also with respect to substantiation requirements. Having been grouped under Section 108, its subparagraphs, (A) to (C), and Section 106, its subparagraphs (A) to (D), have significant relations with each other.</p> <p> Legislative intent must be ascertained from a consideration of the statute as a whole and not of an isolated part or a particular provision alone. This is a cardinal rule in statutory construction. For taken in the abstract, a word or phrase might easily convey a meaning quite different from the one actually intended and evident when the word or phrase is considered with those with which it is associated. Thus, an apparently general provision may have a limited application if viewed together with the other provisions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted)</p> </blockquote> <p> This Court reiterates that to claim a refund of unutilized or excess input VAT, purchase of goods or properties must be supported by VAT invoices, while purchase of services must be supported by VAT official receipts. </p><p> For context, VAT is a tax imposed on each sale of goods or services in the course of trade or business, or importation of goods "as they pass along the production and distribution chain."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> It is an indirect tax, which "may be shifted or passed on to the buyer, transferee or lessee of the goods, properties or services."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> The output tax<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> due from VAT-registered sellers becomes the input tax<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> paid by VAT-registered purchasers on local purchase of goods or services, which the latter in turn may credit against their output tax liabilities. On the other hand, for a non-VAT purchaser, the VAT shifted forms part of the cost of goods, properties, and services purchased, which may be deductible as an expense for income tax purposes.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup></p><p> <i>Panasonic Communications Imaging Corp. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> explained the concept of VAT and its collection through the tax credit method: </p><blockquote> <p> The VAT is a tax on consumption, an indirect tax that the provider of goods or services may pass on to his customers. Under the VAT method of taxation, which is invoice-based, an entity can subtract from the VAT charged on its sales or outputs the VAT it paid on its purchases, inputs and imports. For example, when a seller charges VAT on its sale, it issues an invoice to the buyer, indicating the amount of VAT he charged. For his part, if the buyer is also a seller subjected to the payment of VAT on his sales, he can use the invoice issued to him by his supplier to get a reduction of his own VAT liability. The difference in tax shown on invoices passed and invoices received is the tax paid to the government. In case the tax on invoices received exceeds that on invoices passed, a tax refund may be claimed.</p> <p> Under the 1997 NIRC, if at the end of a taxable quarter the seller charges output taxes equal to the input taxes that his suppliers passed on to him, no payment is required of him. It is when his output taxes exceed his input taxes that he has to pay the excess to the BIR. If the input taxes exceed the output taxes, however, the excess payment shall be earned over to the succeeding quarter or quarters. Should the input taxes result from zero-rated or effectively zero-rated transactions or from the acquisition of capital goods, any excess over the output taxes shall instead be refunded to the taxpayer.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> (Citations omitted)</p> </blockquote> <p> Our VAT system is invoice-based, i.e. taxation relies on sales invoices or official receipts. A VAT-registered entity is liable to VAT, or the output tax at the rate of 0% or 10% (now 12%) on the gross selling price<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> of goods or gross receipts<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> realized from the sale of services. Sections 106(D) and 108(C) of the Tax Code expressly provide that VAT is computed at 1/11 of the total amount indicated in the <i>invoice</i> for sale of goods or <i>official receipt</i> for sale of services.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> This tax shall also be recognized as input tax credit to the purchaser of the goods or services.</p><p> Under Section 110<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> of the 1997 NIRC, the input tax on purchase of goods or properties, or services is creditable: </p><blockquote> <p> (a) To the purchaser upon consummation of sale and on importation of goods or properties; </p> <p> (b) To the importer upon payment of the VAT prior to the release of the goods from the custody of the Bureau of Customs; and</p> <p> [(c)] [T]o the purchaser [of services], lessee [of property] or licensee upon payment of the compensation, rental, royalty or fee.</p> </blockquote> <p> A VAT-registered person may opt, however, to apply for tax refund or credit certificate of VAT paid corresponding to the zero-rated sales of goods, properties, or services to the extent that this input tax has not been applied against the output tax.</p><p> Strict compliance with substantiation and invoicing requirements is necessary considering VAT's nature and VAT system's tax credit method, where tax payments are based on output and input taxes and where the seller's output tax becomes the buyer's input tax that is available as tax credit or refund in the same transaction. It ensures the proper collection of taxes at all stages of distribution, facilitates computation of tax credits, and provides accurate audit trail or evidence for BIR monitoring purposes.</p><p> The Court of Tax Appeals further pointed out that the noninterchangeability between VAT official receipts and VAT invoices avoids having the government refund a tax that was not even paid. </p><blockquote> <p> It should be noted that the seller will only become liable to pay the output VAT upon receipt of payment from the purchaser. If we are to use sales invoice in the sale of services, an absurd situation will arise when the purchaser of the service can claim tax credit representing input VAT even before there is payment of the output VAT by the seller on the sale pertaining to the same transaction. As a matter of fact[,] if the seller is not paid on the transaction, the seller of service would legally not have to pay output tax while the purchaser may legally claim input tax credit thereon. The government ends up refunding a tax which has not been paid at all. Hence, to avoid this, VAT official receipt for the sale of services is an absolute requirement.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> In conjunction with this rule, Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 42-03<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> expressly provides that an "invoice is the supporting document for the claim of input tax on purchase of goods whereas official receipt is the supporting document for the claim of input tax on purchase of services." It further states that a taxpayer's failure to comply with the invoicing requirements will result to the disallowance of the claim for input tax. Pertinent portions of this circular provide: </p><blockquote> <p> A-13: Failure by the supplier to comply with the invoicing requirements on the documents supporting the sale of goods and services will result to the disallowance of the claim for input tax by the purchaser-claimant.</p> <p> If the claim for refund/[tax credit certificate] is based on the existence of zero-rated sales by the taxpayer but it fails to comply with the invoicing requirements in the issuance of sales invoices (e.g. failure to indicate the TIN), its claim for tax credit/refund of VAT on its purchases shall be denied considering that the invoice it is issuing to its customers does not depict its being a VAT-registered taxpayer whose sales are classified as zero-rated sales. Nonetheless, this treatment is without prejudice to the right of the taxpayer to charge the input taxes to the appropriate expense account or asset account subject to depreciation, whichever is applicable. Moreover, the case shall be referred by the processing office to the concerned BIR office for verification of other tax liabilities of the taxpayer.</p> </blockquote> <p> Pursuant to Sections 106(D) and 108(C) in relation to Section 110 of the 1997 NIRC, the output or input tax on the sale or purchase of goods is determined by the total amount indicated in the VAT invoice, while the output or input tax on the sale or purchase of services is determined by the total amount indicated in the VAT official receipt. </p><p> Thus, the Court of Tax Appeals properly disallowed the input VAT of P258,874.55 for Team Energy's failure to comply with the invoicing requirements. </p><p align="center"> <b>III</b> </p><p> The Commissioner submits that the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc erred in granting Team Energy a tax refund/credit of P11,161,392.67, representing unutilized input VAT attributable to zero-rated sales of electricity to NPC.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> She maintains that Team Energy is not entitled to any tax refund or credit because it cannot qualify for VAT zero-rating under Republic Act No. 9136<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> or the Electrical Power Industry Reform Act (EPIRA) Law for failure to submit its ERC Registration and Certificate of Compliance.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> She avers that to operate a generation facility, Team Energy must have a duly issued ERC Certificate of Compliance, without which an entity cannot be considered a power generation company and its sales of generated power will not qualify for VAT zero-rating.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup></p><p> The Court of Tax Appeals rejected this argument on the ground that the issue was raised for the first time in a motion for partial reconsideration, <i>viz</i>: </p><blockquote> <p> [The Commissioner] raised the issue of [Team Energy's] failure to submit the Registration and Certificate of Compliance (COC) issued by ERC for the first time in the instant Motion for Partial Reconsideration. The said issue was neither raised in the Court a quo nor in the Petition for Review with the Court En Banc. The rule is well settled that no question will be considered by the appellate court which has not been raised in the court below. When a party deliberately adopts a certain theory, and the case is tried and decided upon the theory in the court below, he will not be permitted to change his theory on appeal, because to permit him to do so would be unfair to the adverse party. Thus, a judgment that goes beyond the issues and purports to adjudicate something on which the court did not hear the parties, is not only irregular but also extrajudicial and invalid. In the case of <i>Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> the Supreme Court said: </p> <blockquote> <p> The rule is well-settled that points of law, theories, issues and arguments not adequately brought to the attention of the lower court need not be considered by the reviewing court as they cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, much more in a motion for reconsideration as in this case, because this would be offensive to the basic rules of fair play, justice and due process. This last ditch effort to shift to a new theory and raise a new matter in the hope of a favorable result is a pernicious practice that has consistently been rejected. </p> </blockquote> <p> Also, both parties stipulated and recognized in the Joint Stipulation of Facts and Issues that [Team Energy] is principally engaged in the business of power generation.

In such case, the taxpayer must prove that it has been duly authorized by the ERC to operate a generation facility and that it derives its sales from power generation. This was the thrust of this Court's ruling in <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Toledo Power Company (TPC)</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup> </p><p> In <i>Toledo</i>, the Court of Tax Appeals granted Toledo Power Company's (TPC) claim for refund of unutilized input VAT attributable to sales of electricity to NPC, but denied refund of input VAT related to sales of electricity to other entities<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup> for failure of TPC to prove that it was a generation company under the EPIRA. This Court held that TPC's failure to submit its ERC Certificate of Compliance renders its sales of generated power not qualified for VAT zero-rating. This Court, in affirming the Court of Tax Appeals, held: </p><blockquote> <p> Section 6 of the EPIRA provides that the sale of generated power by generation companies shall be zero-rated. Section 4 (x) of the same law states that a generation company "refers to any person or entity authorized by the ERC to operate facilities used in the generation of electricity." Corollarily, <b>to be entitled to a refund or credit of unutilized input VAT attributable to the sale of electricity under the EPIRA, a taxpayer must establish: (1) that it is a generation company, and (2) that it derived sales from power generation.</b> </p> <p> . . . .</p> <p> In this case, when the EPIRA took effect in 2001, TPC was an existing generation facility. And at the time the sales of electricity to CEBECO, ACMDC, and AFC were made in 2002, TPC was not yet a generation company under EPIRA. Although it filed an application for a COC on June 20, 2002, it did not automatically become a generation company. It was only on June 23, 2005, when the ERC issued a COC in favor of TPC, that it became a generation company under EPIRA.
