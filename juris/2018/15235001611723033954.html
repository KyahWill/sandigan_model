Accused, a stay-in construction worker in Baliwag, Bulacan, [was] also a friend of AAA's uncle who would usually sleep over at the victim's house.<br><br>On February 24, 2007, at or about 12:00 a.m, AAA was awakened by the accused when he removed her pajama and panty and placed himself on top of her. The accused licked her vagina before inserting his penis into it She felt pain and cried. Since the accused threatened her with harm if she [told] the incident to anybody, she kept mum about it.<br><br>[O]n March 18, 2007, during the wee hours of the morning, or about 2:00 a.m., AAA was awakened by the shout of her uncle, CCC. There, she saw accused standing at the corner of the house with her panty at the latter's feet. Realizing that she was naked, she instantly wore her short pants and ran and embraced her uncle. Thereafter, AAA, together with her grandparents and uncles, went to the police to report what happened. The medico legal examination of the private organ of AAA revealed no laceration in her hymen.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br></blockquote><b><i>Version of the Defense</i></b><br><br>Appellant raised the defenses of denial and alibi, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>x x x On February 24, 2007, he was working as a construction worker at NFA, Baliwag, Bulacan. He worked there from Monday to Saturday. [On said date,] he was working until 5:00 o'clock in the afternoon in Bulacm1.<br><br>On March 18, 2007, he was at home resting. At around 8:00 o'clock in the evening of that day, he went out to join his friends, Jonas Rabosa, Aron Rabosa, Jomari Magondayao, Randy Ramirez, Erma Bergancia and Bongbong in a drinking spree in front of the house of AAA's aunt, BBB, where AAA also lived. The drinking spree lasted until 12:00 o'clock midnight when he started vomiting. They slept at BBB's house. He, together with his friends, slept, side by side with each other in the living room, but before he fell asleep he noticed that AAA was sleeping on the sofa.<br><br>At around 2:00 o'clock in the morning, [he] was awakened by the punches thrown at him by AAA's uncle, CCC, who claimed to have seen him molesting the girl. He was surprised. Another uncle, ODD, followed suit and both clobbered him. His cousin, Randy Ramirez, intervened to pacify, and brought him home. At home, he narrated to his mother what [had] happened, and she cried. Then, policemen arrived at their house to arrest him, although without showing any warrant of arrest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br></blockquote><b><i>Ruling of the Regional Trial Court</i></b><br><br>In its Decision dated February 3, 2011, the RTC found appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of <span style="font-weight: bold;">rape</span> under Article 266 of the Revised Penal Code in Criminal Case No. 07-0284 and <span style="font-weight: bold;">acts of lasciviousness</span> under Article 336 in Criminal Case No. 07-0589.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> It held that:<br><blockquote>On the first rape, AAA narrated that she was roused from sleep when accused was removing her pajama and panty. After removing he[r] pajama and panty, accused licked her vagina, [and] inserted something hard into [it]. [She later clarified that it was appellant's penis that was inserted into her vagina] She did not disclose this to anybody because accused told her not to tell it to anybody.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>x x x x<br><br>On the alleged (second rape incident], AAA narrated that she was roused from sleep when her uncle[,] CCC[,] was shouting angry words at the accused when they saw the latter lying on top of AAA. x x x It is clear from AAA's testimony that when the accused carried out the lecherous intent on March 18, 2007, he did not commit rape, consummated nor attempt[ed]. There [was] no indication that accused successfully penetrated, at least the labia of AAA. Accused should only be held liable for acts of lasciviousness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br></blockquote>Accordingly, the RTC sentenced appe1lant to suffer the penalty of <i>a</i>) <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and to pay "AAA" P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P75.000.00 as moral damages and P50,000.00 as exemplary damages in Criminal Case No. 07-0284; and <i>b</i>) imprisonment of six (6) months of <i>arresto mayor</i>, as minimum, to four (4) years and two (2) months of <i>prision correccional</i>, as maximum, and to pay "AAA" P30,000.00 as civil indemnity, P30,000.00 as moral damages and P20,000.00 as exemplary damages in Criminal Case No. 07-0589.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Appellant thereafter appealed the RTC Decision before the CA.<br><br><b><i>Ruling of the Court of Appeals</i></b><br><br>The CA affirmed the RTC Decision <i>in toto</i>. Like the RTC, the CA found "AAA's" testimony worthy of credence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> It also noted that "AAA" had "positively identified appellant as her abuser and her statements under oath were sufficient to convict appe1lant for [his misdeeds]."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>In addition, the CA held that appellant's defense of denial cannot prevail over "AAA's" testimony as it was not properly corroborated or substantiated by clear and convincing evidence. 1t likewise reiterated that the defense of denial could not prevail over "AAA's" positive identification of appellant as the perpetrator of the crimes charged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Aggrieved, appellant filed the present appeal. <br><br><center><b>The Issues</b><br></center><br>Appellant raises the following issues for the Court's resolution:<br><br><i>First</i>, whether "AAA's" testimony was credible and straightforward, given that: (<i>a</i>) she simply answered "yes" to almost all of the trial prosecutor's leading questions;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> and (<i>b</i>) the defense was able to prove that the alleged acts of rape could not have been perpetrated by appellant, as there were other persons present when said acts were supposedly committed;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> and,<br><br><i>Second</i>, whether the absence of hymenal lacerations on "AAA" casts doubt on appellant's guilt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b><br></center><br>After due consideration, we resolve to (<i>a</i>) <b>affirm</b> appellant's conviction in Criminal Case No. 07 0589, but <b><i>modify</i></b> the designation of the crime committed; and (<i>b</i>) <b>grant</b> his appeal in Criminal Case No. 07-0284.<br><br><b><i>Elements of Rape in Criminal Case No. 07-0589 Established</i></b><br><br>Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code provides:<br><blockquote><b>ART. 266-A.</b> <i>Rape, When and How Committed</i>. - Rape is committed -<br><br>1.

We, too, see no reason to disbelieve "AAA's" testimony as regards the first rape incident, since it was not shown that the lower courts had overlooked, <i>misunderstood</i> or <i>misappreciated</i> facts or circumstances of weight and substance which, if properly considered would have altered the result of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>We reject appellant's contention that the presence of other persons during the commission of the first rape incident rendered "AAA's" testimony unbelievable. "It is not impossible or incredible for the members of the victim's family to be in deep slumber and not to be awakened while a sexual assault is being committed."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> After all, "[i]t is settled that lust is not a respecter of time or place and rape is known to happen [even] in the most unlikely places."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>We are likewise not persuaded by appellant's claim that the absence of lacerations on "AAA's" hymen negated sexual intercourse. "The rupture of the hymen is not an essential and material fact in rape cases; it only further confirms that the vagina has been penetrated and damaged in the process."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Besides, as the CA correctly pointed out, the Initial Medico-Legal Report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> itself stated that although there was "no evident injury at the time of examination," the "medical evaluation cannot exclude sexual abuse."<br><br><b><i>Acts of lasciviousness not proven beyond reasonable doubt</i></b><br><br>At this juncture, we draw attention to the unique nature of an appeal in a criminal case - the appeal throws the <i>whole case</i> open for review and it is the duty of the appellate court to correct, cite and appreciate errors in the appealed judgment whether they are assigned or unassigned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> It is on the basis of such review that we find the present appeal <i>partially</i> meritorious.<br><br>The Information in Criminal Case No. 07-0284 alleged that appellant had carnal knowledge of "AAA" "on or about the 18<sup>th</sup> day of March, 2007. For precision and clarity, we quote "AAA's" testimony on the incident that transpired on March 18, 2007 as follows:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td colspan="2"><div align="justify">[COURT:]</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q:</div></td><td><div align="justify"><strong>You mentioned that you did not see the person who took off your pants, you mean you are not sure who he is?</strong></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A: <strong></strong></div></td><td><div align="justify"><strong>No, [y]our Honor.</strong></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q: </div></td><td><div align="justify">You said you did not see him?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A:</div></td><td><div align="justify"> Because I was asleep at that time.

"AAA's" narrative thereto clearly consisted of <b>hearsay evidence</b> which, "whether objected to or not, <i>has no probative value</i> unless the proponent can show that the evidence falls within the excepti.ons to the hearsay evidence rule x x x."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>On this point, we deem it appropriate to reiterate our ruling in <i>People v. Mamalias</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> where we emphasized that the admission of hearsay evidence in a criminal case would be tantamount to a violation of the rights of the accused, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>x x x We have held that in criminal cases, the admission of hearsay evidence would be a violation of the constitutional provision that the accused shall enjoy the right to conti·ont tl1e witnesses testifying against him and to cross-examine tl1em. <b>A conviction based alone on proof that violates the constitutional right of an accused is a nullity and the court that rendered it acted without jurisdiction in its rendition.</b> Such a judgment cannot be given any effect whatsoever especially on the liberty of an individual.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Clearly, the RTC committed a grave mistake when it relied on hearsay evidence to convict appellant of the crime of acts of lasciviousness. We also note the enor in the <i>fallo</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> of the RTC Decision where the trial court convicted appellant of rape in Criminal Case No. 07-0284 (the second rape incident) and acts of lasciviousness in Criminal Case No. 07-0589<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> (the first rape incident), when it should have been the other way around, based on the discussion in the body of said Decision.<br><br>The CA, too, is equally at fault for failing not only to recognize the glaring flaw in the prosecution's evidence, but also to correct the mistake in the <i>fallo</i> of the RTC Decision when the case was elevated on appeal.<br><br><b><i>The Crime Committed and the Proper Penalty in Criminal Case No. 07-0589</i></b><br><br>As earlier discussed, sexual intercourse with a woman who is below 12 years of age constitutes statutory rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Moreover, Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, provides that the death penalty shall be imposed "when the victim is a child below seven (7) years old."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>In this case, "AAA" was only six years old at the time of the incident, as evidenced by her Certificate of Live Birth<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> showing that she was born on September 7, 2000. Consequently, the crime committed by appellant is <b>qualified statutory rape</b> under Article 266-B. Since the death penalty cannot be imposed in view of Republic Act No. 9346, or An Act Prohibiting the Imposition of Death Penalty in the Philirpines, the proper penalty is reclusion perpetua without eligibility for parole.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>We likewise modify the amounts awarded to "AAA" in view of our ruling in <i>People v.
