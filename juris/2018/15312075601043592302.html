CV No. 03233-MIN.<br><br><center><b>The Facts</b><br></center><br>Involved is a parcel of land covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) Nos. T-18203, T-18204, T-255986, and T-255985, with an aggregate area of 2,450 sq.m., including the building erected thereon, situated in Agdao, Davao City.<br><br>Sometime in the year 1976, respondent Social Security System (SSS) filed a case before the Social Security Commission (SSC) against the Dalisay Group of Companies (DGC) for the collection of unremitted SSS premium contributions of the latter's employees. The said cases are: (1) <i>SSS v. Desiderio Dalisay Investments, Inc.</i> (SSC Case No. 6414); (2) <i>SSS v. Desidal Fruits Corporation</i> (SSC Case No. 6415); and (3) <i>SSS v. Davao Stevedore Terminal Co., Inc.</i> (SSC Case No. 6416).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>On March 11, 1977, Desiderio Dalisay, then President of petitioner Desiderio Dalisay Investments, Inc. (DDII), sent a Letter to SSS offering the subject land and building to offset DGC's liabilities subject of the aforementioned cases at P3,500,000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> The parties, however, failed to arrive at an agreement as to the appraised value thereof. Thus, no negotiation took place.<br><br>Later, or on December 15, 1981, Desiderio Dalisay sent another Letter seeking further negotiation with SSS by recommending that the appraisal be done by Asian Appraisal, Co. Inc.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> SSC agreed, but it later turned out that Asian Appraisal, Inc. did not respond to Dalisay's request. Thus, Atty. Honesto Cabarroguis, DGC's lawyer, suggested that the appraisal be done by Joson, Capili and Associates instead. The suggestion was later approved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>On July 24, 1982, DDII's Special Board of Directors issued a Resolution stating that the properties covered by TCT Nos. T-18204 and T-8227<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> together with all improvements thereon be sold to SSS in order to settle the unremitted premiums and penalty obligations of DDII, Davao Stevedore Terminal Co., and Desidal Fruits, Inc. In the same Board Resolution, Desiderio Dalisay, or in his absence, Veronica Dalisay-Tirol (Dalisay-Tirol), was authorized to sign in behalf of the corporation any and all papers pertinent to effect full and absolute transfer of said properties to the SSS.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>On May 21, 1982, the real estate appraisers Joson, Capili and Associates, whose services Dalisay engaged for the purpose of appraising the value of the properties being offered to SSS, sent a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> to him informing him that the total value of the lots is One Million Nine Hundred Fifty Four Thousand Seven Hundred Seventy-Seven &amp; 78/100 (P1,954,777.78), rounded to P1,955,000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> This Appraisal Report was then indorsed to the SSC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>On May 27, 1982, during a meeting (1982 Meeting) of the SSS' Committee on Buildings, Supplies and Equipment (Committee) attended by Atty. Cabarroguis, the latter, representing DGC, explained that the DGC is in financial distress and is in no way capable of settling its obligation in cash.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> When asked what the DGC's offer is, he stated that he has "the authority to offer [the properties] in the amount of 2 million pesos."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> He also assured them that that they will turn the properties over to SSS free of liens and encumbrances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> The offer for <i>dacion</i> was accepted at the appraised value of P2,000,000. As regards the implementation of the <i>dacion</i>, Atty. Cabarroguis stated that "[t)]he Legal Department of the SSS can prepare the Deed of Sale or whatever documents that have to be prepared. My clients are ready to vacate the premises and you can have it occupied anytime."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> During the same Meeting, Atty. Cabarroguis likewise relayed to SSS that they are requesting that the P2,000,000 amount be applied first to the unpaid premiums and the excess be used to settle part of the penalties due.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>On May 28, 1982, DDII's total liabilities with SSS covering unpaid premium contributions, inclusive of penalties and salary/calamity loan amortizations, amounted to P4,421,321.62.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>On June 9, 1982, the SSC issued Resolution No. 849 - s. 82.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> In said Resolution, it accepted DDII's proposed <i>dacion en pago</i> pegged at the appraised value of P2,000,000. Said Resolution reads:<br><blockquote>On motion duly seconded,<br><br>RESOLVED, that the acceptance of the offer of the Dalisay Group of Companies to offset their outstanding liabilities with the SSS with their lot and building at Davao City valued at 2M, as recommended by the SSC Committee on Building, Supplies and Equipment, be, as it is hereby, approved and confirmed, subject to the terms and conditions contained in the Memorandum, dated June 8, 1982, of the Executive Officer of the said Committee.<br><br>RESOLVED FURTHER, That the following additional conditions be, as they are hereby, imposed:<br><blockquote><ol><li>That part of tge (sic) 2M is to be applied to its outstanding educational/salary loans obligations;<br><br></li><li>That the criminal cases against the Dalisay Group of companies shall not be withdrawn as the penalties are not being paid in full and it is up to them to make the necessary representations with the Fiscal's Office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote></blockquote>The SSC then informed DDII of its acceptance of the proposed <i>dacion</i> in payment, including its specified terms and conditions, via a Letter dated June 17, 1982.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Said Letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> reads:<br><blockquote>We are pleased to inform you that pursuant to Resolution No. 849 dated June 9, 1982, the Social Security Commission approved and confirmed the acceptance of the offer of your client, the Dalisay Group of Companies, that they be allowed to offset their outstanding liabilities with the SSS with their property (lot and building), as described in the offer, at Davao City valued at P2 million, subject to the following terms and conditions:<br><blockquote><ol><li>The P2 million consideration in this transaction shall be applied first to the premium contribution in arrears which amounts to P1.5 million, more or less, and whatever amount in excess of the P2 million after premium contribution shall then be applied to the payment of penalties.<br><br></li><li>Part of the P2 million shall also be applied to its outstanding education/salary loan obligations.<br><br></li><li>The criminal cases against the Dalisay Group of Companies shall not be withdrawn as the penalties have not as yet been valid (sic) in full and it is up to them to make the necessary representations with the Fiscal's Office.<br></li></ol></blockquote>May we invite you, therefore, to sit down with us for the preparation of the documents preparatory to the final transfer of the titles of the properties to the SSS.<br></blockquote>On July 8, 1982, Dalisay-Tirol, then Acting President and General Manager of Dalisay Investment, informed SSS that the company is preparing the subject property, especially the building, for its turnover on August 15, 1982.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Said Letter reads:<br><blockquote>We are pleased to advise you that by August 15, 1982, we will already transfer to the next building. Desidal Building will already be available for you to prepare for you own transfer. The delay is caused by the preparation we have to make for the transfer of our office equipment and records.<br><br>Kindly, send somebody on August 15<sup>th</sup>, so we can effect the proper turnover of the building to you.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br></blockquote>Later, or on July 31, 1982, An Affidavit of Consent for the Sale of Real Property was executed by the surviving heirs of the late Regina L. Dalisay, stating that in order to settle the companies' obligations to SSS, they expressly agree to the sale thereof to the SSS for its partial settlement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>On September 18, 1989, Desiderio Dalisay passed away.<br><br>As of November 30, 1995, the company's total obligations allegedly amounted to P15,689,684.93.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Later, or on December 29, 1995, the Philippine National Bank (PNB) executed a Deed of Confirmatory Sale in favor of DDII for properties that it reacquired, including the property subject of the present dispute.<br><br><br>On March 20, 1998, Eddie A. Jara (Jara), Assistant Vice-President of the SSS - Davao I Branch, executed an Affidavit of Adverse Claim<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> over the properties subject of the instant case because of the companies' failure to turn over the certificates of title to SSS.<br><br>Then, on April 2, 1998, Jara sent a letter to Dalisay-Tirol, formally demanding the certificates of title over the properties subject of the <i>dacion</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> In said letter, Jara stated that "[t]he mortgage with PNB has already been settled by Desiderio Dalisay Investments, Inc. last January 20, 1994, but the titles were not delivered to the SSS in violation of the express terms in the <i>dacion</i> in payment that the Dalisay group should deliver the titles after the release of the mortgage with the PNB."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>In her reply dated May 5, 1998 to the April 2, 1998 Letter, Dalisay-Tirol, who was then the President of DDII, stated that the corporation could not at that time give due course to and act on the matter because of several issues that need to be resolved first, including two cases involving the subject properties, to wit: (1) the properties are being claimed by the estate of Desiderio F. Dalisay, Sr. and included in the inventory already filed by the executrix, where the corporation's stockholders are contesting said inclusion; and (2) the SSS' pending petition covering the properties where the accuracy and propriety of the amount of PI5,605,079.25 contained therein has yet to be substantiated and verified.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> She likewise pointed out that the "Board Resolution covers only two (2) parcels of land which were proposed and submitted for the purpose of a negotiated sale to settle unremitted premiums and penalties."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>On November 18, 1999, DDII, through its Managing Director Edith L. Dalisay-Valenzuela (Dalisay-Valenzuela), wrote a letter addressed to SSS President and Chief Executive Officer Carlos A. Arellano, requesting the reevaluation and reconsideration of their problem.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> In said Letter, DDII requested the following:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">1)</div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify"> Condonation of penalties and interest or accrual of rentals for off­setting against the penalties, interest and principal;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">2) </div></td><td><div align="justify">Payment of original liabilities for unpaid premiums of P4,421,321.62;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">3)</div></td><td><div align="justify"> Return of the property to DDII; and</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">4) </div></td><td><div align="justify">Withdrawal of claim against the Estate of Desiderio F. Dalisay, Sr.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>On January 18, 2000, DDII issued a Letter to SSS proposing the "offset of SSS obligations with back rentals on occupied land and building of the obligor." It alleged that SSS is bound to pay back rentals totaling P34,217,988.19<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> for its use of the subject property from July 1982 up to the present. It likewise demanded for the return of the said property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Meanwhile, despite repeated written and verbal demands made by SSS for DDII to deliver the titles of the subject property, free from all liens and encumbrances, DDII still failed to comply.<br><br>On October 8, 2002, DDII filed a complaint for Quieting of Title, Recovery of Possession and Damages against SSS with the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 14, in Davao City, docketed as Civil Case No. 29, 353-02.<br><br>In said complaint, DDII asserted that it is the owner of the subject property. It averred that when SSS filed the abovementioned cases, the late Desiderio Dalisay, during his lifetime and as president of the company, offered the property appraised at P3,500,000 to SSS for the offsetting of said amount against DGC's total liability to SSS. SSS accepted such but only in the amount of P2,000,000 and subject to certain conditions. It also insists that while negotiations with SSS were still ongoing, it decided to vacate the subject property in favor of SSS to show goodwill on its part. Unfortunately, the negotiations were not fruitful as they failed to agree on the terms and conditions set forth by SSS. Furthermore, DDII insists that Atty. Cabarroguis' alleged acceptance of the proposals of SSS was not covered by any Board Resolution or Affidavit of Consent by the corporate and individual owners of the properties. Thus, according to DDII, there was no meeting of the minds between the parties. Consequently, there was no dation in payment to speak of, contrary to the claim of SSS. With these, DDII asserted that SSS owes it P43,208,270.99 as back rentals for its use of the property from 1982 onwards. It also prayed for attorney's fees and costs of litigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>In its Answer, SSS argued that the offer for <i>dacion</i> was categorically accepted by SSS, thereby perfecting such.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br><center><b>RTC Judgment</b><br></center><br>On July 22, 2010, the RTC resolved the case in favor of DDII, holding that there was no perfected <i>dacion</i> in payment between the parties. Consequently, SSS has no legal personality to own, possess, and occupy the property. The dispositive portion thereof reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered as follows:<br><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">a) </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">Declaring [DDII] as the true and absolute owner of the properties covered by TCT Nos.

The RTC likewise noted that the June 8, 1982 Memorandum included a provision on automatic cancellation of its supposed acceptance of Dalisay's offer if, for any reason, the offsetting cannot be implemented. Correlating this with SSS' non-receipt of the certificates of title to the property, the RTC ruled that SSS' supposed acceptance was thereby automatically cancelled effective June 8, 1982—the date of the Memorandum containing the provision on automatic cancellation. This being the case, the trial court held, SSS' occupation of the property on July 24, 1982, a month after its acceptance was automatically cancelled, has no leg to stand on.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> It was, therefore, only by mere tolerance which tolerance ended when DDII made a demand for SSS to vacate the premises on June 6, 2002.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Its motion for reconsideration having been denied by the RTC in its September 20, 2010 Order,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> SSS appealed the case to the CA.<br><br><center><b>CA Ruling</b><br></center><br>Finding merit in the appeal, the CA reversed the RTC's ruling, disposing of the appeal in this wise:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed Decision of the [RTC], Branch 14, Davao City, in Civil Case No. 29,353-02 is <b>REVERSED</b> and <b>SET ASIDE</b> insofar as it granted the complaint for quieting of title, recovery of possession and damages in favor of [DDII], and the said complaint is hereby <b>DISMISSED</b> for lack of merit. No pronouncement as to costs.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br></blockquote>According to the CA, the pivotal issue in the appeal is whether there was a perfected dation in payment, in which it ruled in the affirmative.<br><br>The CA held that the records establish that DGC has an outstanding obligation in favor of SSS that it proposed to pay the amount via <i>dacion en pago</i>, said offer was categorically accepted by SSS, and the agreement was consummated by DDII's delivery of the property to SSS.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>As to DDII's argument that the acceptance by SSS included certain conditions, this, according to the appellate court, is inconsequential because its acceptance was unequivocal and absolute. In this respect, it held that <i>dacion</i> in payment being in the nature of a contract of sale, the principle that a deed of sale is considered absolute where there is neither a stipulation in the deed that title to the property sold is reserved in the seller until full payment thereof, nor one giving the vendor the right to unilaterally resolve the contract the moment the buyer fails to pay within a fixed period, applies to the instant dispute. The CA, thus, concluded that applying said principle, the contract of sale or <i>dacion</i> between the parties is absolute, not conditional. To be sure, the CA said, there is no reservation of ownership of the subject property or a stipulation providing for unilateral rescission by either party. In fact, according to the CA, the sale was consummated upon the delivery of the subject property to SSS.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Anent the stipulations in the June 17, 1982 letter of the SSS according to the CA, the conditions were not of a nature that would affect the efficacy of the contract of sale. It, the CA said, merely provided the manner by which the full consideration is to be applied to DDII's liability and the implication of the payment vis-a-vis the pending criminal cases filed against DDII.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>The CA, thus, ruled that all the requisites for a valid dation are present. The sale and transfer of the subject property in favor of SSS are valid and binding against DDII.<br><br>The CA went on to state that even assuming that the dation is defective, said defect is immaterial due to DDII's inaction which lasted for 20, years.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Applying the principle of laches, DDII's failure to assert its rights over the property against SSS for 20 years since its consummation bars it from recovering the subject property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>With respect to the award of attorney's fees, the CA held that such is improper,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> there being no factual, legal, or equitable justification for the award of attorney's fees in favor of DDII. As regards the award of litigation expenses, the CA likewise deleted such for lack of factual or legal justification therefor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>Its Motion for Reconsideration having been denied by the CA in its March 10,2017 Resolution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> DDII now comes before this Court for relief.<br><br><center><b>The Issues</b></center><blockquote><ol type="I"><li>Whether or not there was a perfected "<i>Dacion en Pago</i>"<br><br></li><li>Whether or not the fact that the Transfer Certificates of Title over the subject properties remained in the name of the petitioner is a strong indicium that the parties remained in the preparatory stage of contract-making<br><br></li><li>Whether or not the prescriptive period to file the action had already prescribed<br><br></li><li>Whether or not petitioner slept on its rights that would warrant the imposition of laches.</li></ol></blockquote>The pivotal issue in the instant case is whether or not there was a perfected <i>dacion en pago</i>; and if answered in the affirmative, whether or not SSS validly acquired title or interest over the subject properties. This is so since if there was a perfected <i>dacion</i> and if title or interest over the property was transferred to SSS, then an action for quieting of title filed by DDII would not prosper since SSS has a legitimate interest and claim over the properties subject of the case.<br><br>In the present petition, DDII argues that its offer to SSS contained in the December 15, 1981 letter was never categorically accepted by the latter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> For DDII, the seemingly unambiguous language of the SSS' Memorandum is, in truth, a rejection of its offer, it being a qualified acceptance thereof. It maintains that for there to be an acceptance of the offer, it should be identical in all respects and must not contain any modification or variation from the terms of the offer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>Furthermore, petitioner claims, no document or instrument proving that it accepted SSS' counter-offer exists, as it, in fact, remains unaddressed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>Moreover, DDII points out that in SSS' Brief, it admitted that it indeed made a counter-offer to DDII, although it insists that DDII accepted said counter-offer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> In this respect, DDII maintains that contrary to SSS' position that it impliedly accepted the counter-offer by turning over to SSS the possession and occupation of the property, said turnover was done not because it is accepting the counter-offer but to show goodwill in the negotiations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>To further bolster its claim, DDII argues that the fact that the TCTs over the property remain in the name of the original owner clearly indicates that no dation in payment ever occurred.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>As to the CA's ruling that DDII's claim is barred by laches, it posits that the cause of action did not arise when the possession of the property was transferred to SSS.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> According to it, the transfer being a show of goodwill, there was, at that time, no threat against its title over the property that would prompt DDII to seek redress from the courts and commence the running of the prescriptive period. DDII maintains that the reason why it took a long time before it sought the removal of a cloud in its title is because it was under the impression that no offsetting took place and that SSS was merely in physical possession thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>In our January 31, 2018 Resolution, We required SSS to file its Comment on the petition within a non-extendible period of 10 days. But as of this date, the SSS has yet to file said Comment. In view of the fact that the previous pleadings of the SSS sufficiently allow Us to decide the instant dispute, We resolve to dispense with the SSS' Comment and decide the case based on the records.<br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b><br></center><br>We resolve to deny the petition.<br><br>Article 476 of the Civil Code provides:<br><blockquote>Art. 476. Whenever there is a cloud on title to real property or any interest therein, by reason of any instrument, record, claim, encumbrance or proceeding which is apparently valid or effective but is in truth and in fact invalid, ineffective, voidable, or unenforceable, and may be prejudicial to said title, an action may be brought to remove such cloud or to quiet the title.<br><br>An action may also be brought to prevent a cloud from being cast upon title to real property or any interest therein.<br></blockquote>For an action to quiet title to prosper, two indispensable requisites must concur, namely: (1) the plaintiff or complainant has a legal or an equitable title to or interest in the real property subject of the action; and (2) the deed, claim, encumbrance, or proceeding claimed to be casting cloud on his title must be shown to be in fact invalid or inoperative despite its prima facie appearance of validity or legal efficacy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>Here, the presence or absence of these two requisites is hinged on the question of whether or not the proposed <i>dacion en pago</i> was indeed perfected, thereby vesting unto SSS a legitimate title and interest over the properties in question. In other words, if it can be proved that the proposed <i>dacion</i> was perfected, or even consummated, then SSS' claim which allegedly casts a cloud on DDII's title is valid and operative, and consequently, the action for quieting of title filed by DDII will not prosper.<br><br><b><i>Dacion en pago</i></b><br><br>Among other modes, an obligation is extinguished by payment or performance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> There is payment when there is delivery of money or performance of an obligation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> Corollary thereto, Article 1245 of the Civil Code provides for a special mode of payment called <i>dacion</i> in payment (<i>dacion en pago</i>).<br><br>In <i>dacion en pago</i>, property is alienated to the creditor in satisfaction of a debt in money.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> The debtor delivers and transmits to the creditor the former's ownership over a thing as an accepted equivalent of the payment or performance of an outstanding debt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> In such cases, Article 1245 provides that the law on sales shall apply, since the undertaking really partakes—in one sense—of the nature of sale; that is, the creditor is really buying the thing or property of the debtor, the payment for which is to be charged against the debtor's obligation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>As a mode of payment, <i>dacion en pago</i> extinguishes the obligation to the extent of the value of the thing delivered, either as agreed upon by the parties or as may be proved, unless the parties by agreement—express or implied, or by their silence—consider the thing as equivalent to the obligation, in which case the obligation is totally extinguished.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> It requires delivery and transmission of ownership of a thing owned by the debtor to the creditor as an accepted equivalent of the performance of the obligation. There is no <i>dacion</i> in payment when there is no transfer of ownership in the creditor's favor, as when the possession of the thing is merely given to the creditor by way of security.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>In the case at hand, in order to determine whether or not there was indeed a perfected, or even consummated, <i>dacion</i> in payment, it is necessary to review and assess the evidence and events that transpired and see whether these correspond to the three stages of a contract of sale. This is so since, as previously mentioned, <i>dacion en pago</i> agreements are governed, among others, by the law on sales.<br><br><b><i>Stages of a contract of sale</i></b><br><br>Briefly, the stages of a contract of sale are: (1) <i>negotiation</i>, covering the period from the time the prospective contracting parties indicate interest in the contract to the time the contract is perfected; (2) <i>perfection</i>, which takes place upon the concurrence of the essential elements of the sale, which is the meeting of the minds of the parties as to the object of the contract and upon the price; and (3) <i>consummation</i>, which begins when the parties perform their respective undertakings under the contract of sale, culminating in the extinguishment thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> Each shall hereinafter be discussed <i>in seriatim</i>.<br><br><b>First Stage: Negotiation Offer validly reduced</b><br><br>To recall, the negotiation stage covers the period from the time the prospective contracting parties indicate interest in the contract to the time the contract is perfected. This then includes the making of an offer by one party to another and ends when both parties agree on the object and the price.<br><br>In the instant case, the late Desiderio Dalisay, on March 11, 1977, offered to SSS that they partially settle their obligations to the latter via <i>dacion</i>. Dalisay offered several properties for P3,500,000 in favor of SSS to partially extinguish petitioner's obligation which amounted to P4,421,321.62.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>Then, years later or on May 27, 1982, the SSS' Committee met with the corporation, represented by Atty. Cabarroguis. During said meeting, Atty. Cabarroguis explained that he has "the authority to offer [the properties] in the amount of 2 million pesos."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> He also gave them an assurance that that they will turn the properties over to SSS free of liens and encumbrances,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> and that his clients are ready to vacate the premises and you can have it occupied anytime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br>In this respect, petitioner argues that Atty. Cabarroguis did not have the requisite authority to make said representations and thereby bind the corporation. DDII thus maintains that the offer to SSS remained at P3,500,000. We beg to disagree.<br><br>While petitioner is correct that there is no evidence of Atty. Cabarroguis' authority to represent the company in said meeting, this however is outweighed by the fact that no one questioned Atty. Cabarroguis' representations and authority after the conclusion of the negotiations; and that a few days after the said meeting, the company immediately arranged for the property's turnover through Dalisay-Tirol, Acting President and General Manager, and eventually delivered possession thereof to SSS.<br><br>What makes matters worse for petitioner is that it was well aware of what transpired during the meeting and the agreements reached. In fact, after the SSC issued Resolution No. 849 - s. 82 where it accepted DDII's proposed <i>dacion en pago</i> at P2,000,000,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> it sent a Letter dated June 17, 1982, communicating that:<br><blockquote>We are pleased to inform you that pursuant to Resolution No. 849 dated June 9, 1982, the Social Security Commission approved and confirmed the acceptance of the offer of your client, the Dalisay Group of Companies, that they be allowed to offset their outstanding liabilities with the SSS with their property (lot and building), as described in the offer, at Davao City valued at P2 million, subject to the following terms and conditions:<br><blockquote><ol><li>The P2 million consideration in this transaction shall be applied first to the premium contribution in arrears which amounts to P1.5 million, more or less, and whatever amount in excess of the P2 million after premium contribution shall then be applied to the payment of penalties.<br><br></li><li>Part of the P2 million shall also be applied to its outstanding education/salary loan obligations.<br><br></li><li>The criminal cases against the Dalisay Group of Companies shall not be withdrawn as the penalties have not as yet been valid (sic) in full and it is up to them to make the necessary representations with the Fiscal's Office.<br></li></ol></blockquote>May we invite you, therefore, to sit down with us for the preparation of the documents preparatory to the final transfer of the titles of the properties to the SSS.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br></blockquote>We emphasize that it is only now, in this action for quieting of title filed decades after the conclusion of the 1982 Meeting, that DDII questioned Atty. Cabarroguis' authority to represent the corporation. If it were true that Atty. Cabarroguis did not possess the requisite authority to represent the company in said Meeting, then it could have opposed such, contested his presence thereat, or even deny that the corporation is reducing its offer to P2,000,000. Unfortunately for petitioner, despite knowledge thereof, there is no evidence manifesting any opposition thereto.<br><br>This acquiescence to Atty. Cabarroguis' representations and authority to do so is strengthened by the fact that a few days after the conclusion of the meeting, the company's Vice-President at that time, Dalisay-Tirol, sent a Letter dated July 8, 1982, informing the SSS that they will be vacating the premises offered and will turn over the possession thereof to SSS, consistent with what was agreed upon during said meeting. Thus:<br><blockquote>We are pleased to advise you that by August 15, 1982, we will already transfer to the next building. Desidal Building will already be available for you to prepare for your own transfer. The delay is caused by the preparation we have to make for the transfer of our office equipment and records.<br><br>Kindly, send somebody on August 15<sup>th</sup>, so we can effect the proper turnover of the building to you.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br></blockquote>Without an iota of evidence of any opposition to the offered P2,000,000 price coming from the company when it could have communicated such to the SSS after the conclusion of the 1982 Meeting, plus the fact that its Vice-President even informed SSS that they will be turning over the property to the latter, We are sufficiently convinced that, contrary to petitioner's claim, Atty. Cabarroguis acted within the scope of the authority given him, which includes offering the properties at P2,000,000.<br><br>It may be argued that the absence of the written document embodying Atty. Cabarroguis' authority prevents the courts from unearthing what indeed the extent of said authority is. Nevertheless, We are of the view that the aforementioned events that transpired thereafter and the absence of opposition coming from the company are sufficient proof that they tacitly ratified Atty. Cabarroguis' acts during the meeting, assuming he went beyond his authority in so doing. Thus, Article 1910 of the Civil Code provides:<br><blockquote><b>Art. 1910.</b> The principal must comply with all the obligations which the agent may have contracted within the scope of his authority.<br><br><b>As for any obligation wherein the agent has exceeded his power, the principal is not bound except when he ratifies it expressly or tacitly.</b> (emphasis ours)<br></blockquote>These, plus the absence of any allegation or proof that the SSS relied upon Atty. Cabarroguis' actions in bad faith, convince Us that the corporation bound itself to said representations and agreements reached during the meeting via implied ratification.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br>Accordingly, We conclude that DDII's offer was validly reduced from P3,500,000 to P2,000,000.<br><br>We shall now discuss whether SSS' acceptance of the new offer perfects the agreement on dation.<br><br><b>Second Stage: Perfection Acceptance absolute and unqualified</b><br><br>As regards the question whether the parties were able to perfect the agreement on <i>dacion en pago</i>, the RTC ruled that they did not. According to the trial court, SSS' "acceptance" was qualified which is tantamount to a counter-offer, and not an absolute acceptance which perfects the contract. Thus, said the RTC, there being no evidence to show that petitioner accepted SSS' counter-offer, there was no dation to speak of.<br><br>The CA was of a different view. According to the CA, SSC Resolution No. 849 — s. 82 constitutes an absolute and unequivocal acceptance which perfected the offered <i>dacion</i>. Thus, when possession of the subject property was delivered to SSS, this signified a transfer of ownership thereon, consistent with the supposedly perfected agreement.<br><br>We agree with the CA that there was perfected dation in payment. <br><br>Article 1319 of the New Civil Code reads:<br><blockquote>Art. 1319. Consent is manifested by the meeting of the offer and the acceptance upon the tiling and the cause which are to constitute the contract. The offer must be certain and the acceptance absolute. A qualified acceptance constitutes a counter-offer.<br><br>Acceptance made by letter or telegram does not bind the offerer except from the time it came to his knowledge. The contract, in such a case, is presumed to have been entered into in the place where the offer was made.<br></blockquote>Relevant thereto are the following principles, as summarized by the Court in <i>Traders Royal Bank v. Cuison Lumber Co., Inc.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> thus:<br><blockquote>Under the law, a contract is perfected by mere consent, that is, from the moment that there is a meeting of the offer and the acceptance upon the thing and the cause that constitutes the contract. The law requires that the offer must be certain and <i>the acceptance absolute and unqualified</i>. An acceptance of an offer may be express and implied; a qualified offer (sic) constitutes a counter-offer. Case law holds that an offer, to be considered certain, must be definite, while <i>an acceptance is considered absolute and unqualified when it is identical in all respects with that of the offer so as to produce consent or a meeting of the minds</i>. We have also previously held that the ascertainment of whether there is a meeting of minds on the offer and acceptance depends on the circumstances surrounding the case.<br><br>The offer must be certain and definite with respect to the cause or consideration and object of the proposed contract, while the <i>acceptance of this offer - express or implied - must be unmistakable, unqualified, and identical in all respects to the offer</i>. x x x (Italics supplied)<br></blockquote>Also, in <i>Manila Metal Container Corporation v. Philippine National Bank</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> the Court ruled:<br><blockquote>A qualified acceptance or one that involves a new proposal constitutes a counter-offer and a rejection of the original offer. A counter­offer is considered in law, a rejection of the original offer and an attempt to end the negotiation between the parties on a different basis. Consequently, <i>when something is desired which is not exactly what is proposed in the offer, such acceptance is not sufficient to guarantee consent because any modification or variation from the terms of the offer annuls the offer</i>. The acceptance must be identical in all respects with that of the offer so as to produce consent or meeting of the minds. (Italics supplied)<br></blockquote>Within the purview of the law on sales, a contract of sale is perfected by mere consent, upon a meeting of the minds on the offer and the acceptance thereof based on subject matter, price and terms of payment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> It is perfected at the moment there is a meeting of the minds uponi the thing which is the object of the contract and upon the price.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br>Applying said principles to the case at bar convinces us that SSS' acceptance of the offer at P2,000,000 resulted in a perfected dation. As discussed earlier, the offer was validly reduced from P3,500,000 to P2,000,000. Consequently, SSS' agreement to the P2,000,000 offer was not a counter-offer as petitioner would have it, but an acceptance of the new reduced offer communicated by the company's representative, Atty. Cabarroguis, which acceptance perfected the proposed dation in payment. DDII has the onus of proving that the P2,000,000 offer made to SSS was invalid which would result in SSS' acceptance at said amount to be different from the price offered. Petitioner, however, failed to discharge said burden.<br><br>As regards petitioner's contention that the following conditions set forth in the SSS' Letter dated June 17, 1982<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> make its acceptance a qualified one, We find otherwise. To recall, said conditions are as follows:<br><blockquote>We are pleased to inform you that pursuant to Resolution No. 849 dated June 9, 1982, the Social Security Commission approved and confirmed the acceptance of the offer of your client, the Dalisay Group of Companies, that they be allowed to offset their outstanding liabilities with the SSS with their property (lot and building), as described in the offer, at Davao City valued at P2 million, subject to the following terms and conditions:<br><blockquote><ol><li>The P2 million consideration in this transaction shall be applied first to the premium contribution in arrears which amounts to P1.5 million, more or less, and whatever amount in excess of the P2 million after premium contribution shall then be applied to the payment of penalties.<br><br></li><li>Part of the P2 million shall also be applied to its outstanding education/salary loan obligations.<br><br></li><li>The criminal cases against the Dalisay Group of Companies shall not be withdrawn as the penalties have not as yet been valid (sic) in full and it is up to them to make the necessary representations with the Fiscal's Office.<br></li></ol></blockquote>May we invite you, therefore, to sit down with us for the preparation of the documents preparatory to the final transfer of the titles of the properties to the SSS.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br></blockquote>A reading of the transcript of the 1982 Meeting reveals that the procedure in applying the proceeds of the <i>dacion en pago</i> actually came from the company, through Atty. Cabarroguis, and not from SSS. Thus:<br><blockquote>Atty. Cabarroguis: We only pray that in order that the penalties will not continue to run, on the unpaid remittance premiums, we only request tha the amount of 2 million be applied first to the premiums, unremitted premiums, the excess would be part of the penalty so that what will remain will be the penalties themselves.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup><br></blockquote>This to Us clearly shows that the SSS simply agreed to saicl proposal when it included such in its Resolution. It is not a new condition imposed by the SSS as petitioner argues.<br><br>Having settled that the parties were in agreement as to the price and that the acceptance by SSS was, in fact, unqualified, We are convinced that the parties indeed have a perfected contract. We shall now determine whether said contract was consummated, thereby solidifying SSS' title, interest, and claim over the properties.<br><br><b>Third Stage: Consummation Transfer of possession to SSS tantamount to "delivery"</b><br><br>Agreeing with SSS, the CA held that the agreement on <i>dacion en pago</i> was consummated by DDII's delivery of the property to SSS.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> We agree.<br><br>The third stage of a contract of sale is consummation which begins when the parties perform their respective undertakings under the contract of sale, culminating in the extinguishment thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br>While a contract of sale is perfected by mere consent, ownership of the thing sold is acquired only upon its delivery to the buyer. Upon the perfection of the sale, the seller assumes the obligation to transfer ownership and to deliver the thing sold, but the real right of ownership is transferred only "by tradition" or delivery thereof to the buyer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup><br><br>In this regard, reference must be made to Article 1496 of the Civil Code, which reads:<br><blockquote>ARTICLE 1496. The ownership of the thing sold is acquired by the vendee from the moment it is delivered to him in any of the ways specified in Articles 1497 to 1501, or in any other manner signifying an agreement that the possession is transferred from the vendor to the vendee. (n)<br></blockquote>Material to the case at bar is tradition by <b>real or actual delivery</b> contemplated Article 1497 of the same Code. Thus:<br><blockquote>ARTICLE 1497. The thing sold shall be understood as delivered, when it is placed in the control and possession of the vendee. (1462a)<br></blockquote>In <i>Cebu Winland Development Corporation v. Ong Siao Hua</i>, We explained that:<br><blockquote>Under the Civil Code, ownership does not pass by mere stipulation but only by delivery. Manresa explains, "<b>the delivery of the thing . . . signifies that title has passed from the seller to the buyer</b>." According to Tolentino, the purpose of delivery is not only for the enjoyment of the thing but also a mode of acquiring dominion and determines the transmission of ownership, the birth of the real right. The delivery under any of the forms provided by Articles 1497 to 1505 of the Civil Code <b>signifies that the transmission of ownership from vendor to vendee has taken place</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Here, petitioner DDII insists that its delivery of the property to SSS was only to show its goodwill in the negotiations. The records, however, reveal otherwise.<br><br>It is well to emphasize that <b>nowhere in their communications or during the discussions at the meeting is it stated that the company will turn over possession of the property to SSS to show its goodwill while the negotiations were pending</b>.<br><br>Too, consider the following turn of events:<br><ol><li>During the 1982 Meeting, the following discussions took place:<br><br>Atty.

In the absence of such legal or equitable title, or interest, there is no cloud to be prevented or removed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup><br><br>Here, DDII having divested itself of any claim over the property in favor of SSS by means of sale via <i>dacion en pago</i>, petitioner has lost its title over the property which would give it legal personality to file said action.<br><br>Thus, the CA did not err in dismissing the complaint for lack of merit.<br><br>A necessary consequence of this ruling is the recomputation of DDII's obligations to SSS as a result of the application of the P2,000,000 amount agreed upon in the <i>dacion</i>. Thus, SSS shall recompute said outstanding obligations by deducting from the total obligations as of June 17, 1982 the amount of P2,000,000, following the terms and conditions agreed upon.

While it is true that the value of the property has definitely significantly increased over the years compared to the P2,000,000 amount for which it was offered to SSS, still, such is not sufficient justification for DDII to turn its back on its obligations under the <i>dacion en pago</i> agreement.
