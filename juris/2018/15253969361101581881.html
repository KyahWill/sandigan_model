CR No. 33630 finding petitioner guilty of attempted rape. The assailed CA Decision modified the Decision dated August 23, 2010 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> of Quezon City, Branch 94 which, in turn, found petitioner guilty of rape by sexual assault as charged. <p align="center"> <b>The Antecedents</b> </p><p> Petitioner was charged in an Information the accusatory portion of which reads: </p><blockquote> <p> That on or about the 27<sup>th</sup> day of April 2004 in Quezon City, Philippines, the said accused by means of force, threats and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously commit acts of sexual assault upon the person of [AAA],<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> 6 year[s] of age, a minor, by then and [there] inserting his finger into complainant's genital organ against her will and without her consent, to the damage and prejudice of said offended party. </p> <p> <strong>CONTRARY TO LAW.</strong><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> Upon petitioner's plea of not guilty, pre-trial and trial on the merits ensued.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> </p><p> The prosecution presented as witnesses private complainant AAA, her younger brother BBB, her mother DDD and P/SUPT. Ruby Grace Sabino-Diangson. The evidence for the prosecution tends to establish the following facts: </p><p> At the time of the incident, AAA was only six (6) years old having been born on September 11, 1997.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Petitioner, who was also known as "Egay", frequently visits the house of AAA's family, being the best friend of AAA's father. Around 6:30 o'clock in the evening of April 27, 2004, AAA and her younger siblings, BBB and CCC, were watching television in their <em>sala</em>, together with petitioner. Meanwhile, their mother DDD was cooking dinner in the kitchen separated only by a concrete wall from the <em>sala</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> </p><p> AAA was then wearing short pants<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> and was sitting on the floor with her legs spread apart while watching television and playing with "text cards." BBB, on the other hand, was seated on a chair beside CCC, some five steps away from AAA. Petitioner was seated on the sofa which was one foot away from AAA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> </p><p> Petitioner then touched AAA's vagina.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> AAA reacted by swaying off his hand. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> </p><p> BBB saw petitioner using his middle finger in touching AAA's vagina.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Upon seeing this, BBB said "<i>Kuya Egay, bad iyan, wag mong kinikiliti ang pepe ni Ate</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> BBB then went to where DDD was cooking and told her that petitioner is bad because he is tickling AAA's vagina.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> DDD then called AAA, brought her inside the room and asked her if it were true that petitioner tickled her vagina. AAA answered, "but I swayed his hand, Mama." DDD again asked AAA how many times have petitioner tickled her vagina and AAA answered, "many times in [petitioner's] house" and that he also "let her go on the bed, remove her panty, open her legs and lick her vagina."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> </p><p> As such, DDD confronted petitioner and asked why he did that to AAA. Petitioner said that it was because AAA's panty was wet and that he was sorry.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> </p><p> The next day, or on April 28, 2004, DDD brought AAA to Camp Crame for medical examination but because the doctor was not available, AAA was examined only on April 30, 2004.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> </p><p> In defense, petitioner denied the accusations against him. Petitioner testified that he merely pacified AAA and BBB who were quarreling over the text cards. When petitioner separated the children, BBB then said, "<i>bad yan, bad</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> After which, DDD talked to her two children in the kitchen and when she came out, she asked petitioner if he touched AAA. Petitioner denied having touched AAA and suggested that AAA be examined.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> </p><p> The testimony of Melba Garcia, a Purok Leader, was also presented to the effect that she personally knows petitioner and that the latter enjoys a good reputation. DDD, on the other hand, was the subject of several complaints from the neighbors.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> </p><p> The RTC found petitioner guilty as charged. The RTC gave full credit to AAA's and BBB's candid testimonies that petitioner inserted his finger in the vagina of AAA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> The RTC emphasized that BBB graphically demonstrated the act committed by petitioner by moving his middle finger constantly. To prove its point, the RTC cited the following excerpt from BBB's testimony: </p><blockquote> <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="15%"><div align="justify">COURT: </div></td> <td width="85%"><div align="justify">I want to clarify.

Accused-appellant Edmisael Lutap y Cuspao is found <b>GUILTY of Attempted Rape</b>, and is <b>SENTENCED</b> to suffer the indeterminate imprisonment of SIX (6) MONTHS of arresto mayor, as minimum, to FOUR (4) YEARS and TWO (2) MONTHS of prision correccional medium, as maximum. </p> <p> Also, the accused-appellant is ordered to indemnify the victim in the sum of P30,000.00 as civil indemnity, P25,000.00 as moral damages and P10,000.00 as exemplary damages, and to pay the costs.</p> <p> <b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> Petitioner's motion for reconsideration was similarly denied by the CA. Hence, the instant recourse. </p><p align="center"> <b>The Issue</b> </p><p> Petitioner questions the CA's finding that the crime of attempted rape was committed considering that there is absolutely no showing in this case that petitioner's sexual organ had ever touched the victim's vagina nor any part of her body.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Petitioner likewise argues that there is no clear, competent, convincing and positive evidence that petitioner touched the vagina of the victim with the intention of forcefully inserting his finger inside. Petitioner directs the Court's attention to the fact that at the time of the alleged incident, AAA was well clothed, her vagina fully covered as she was then wearing a panty and a short pants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> </p><p> Thus, the core issue tendered in this petition is whether or not the CA erred in convicting petitioner for the crime of attempted rape on the basis of the evidence thus presented. </p><p align="center"> <b>Our Ruling</b> </p><p> The petition is partly meritorious. </p><p> We agree with the CA's ruling that the fact of insertion of petitioner's finger into AAA's sexual organ was not established beyond reasonable doubt to support petitioner's conviction of rape by sexual assault. We also agree with the CA that there was sexual molestation by petitioner's established act of touching AAA's vagina. Be that as it may, the act of touching a female's sexual organ, standing alone, is not equivalent to rape, not even an attempted one.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> At most, therefore, petitioner's act of touching AAA's sexual organ demonstrates his guilt for the crime of acts of lasciviousness, an offense subsumed in the charge of rape by sexual assault.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> </p><p> Rape, under Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 8353 or the "Anti-Rape Law of 1997" can be committed in two ways: Article 266-A paragraph 1<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> refers to rape through sexual intercourse, the central element of which is carnal knowledge which must be proven beyond reasonable doubt; and Article 266-A paragraph 2<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> refers to rape by sexual assault which must be attended by any of the circumstances enumerated in sub-paragraphs (a) to (d) of paragraph 1.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> </p><p> The direct examination of AAA and BBB, as well as the clarificatory questions interposed by the RTC, while convincingly prove that there was malicious touching of AAA's sexual organ, nevertheless invite doubts as to whether petitioner indeed inserted his finger inside AAA's vagina. </p><p> On point is the direct examination of AAA yielding the following: </p><blockquote> <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="4%"><div align="justify">Q:</div></td> <td width="96%"><div align="justify">While you were playing text, what happened, if any?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A:</div></td> <td><div align="justify"><b>Tito Egay touched my vagina.</b></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">What were you wearing during that time?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Shorts, ma'am.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="4%"><div align="justify">Q:</div></td> <td><div align="justify"><b>Where did he touch you?</b></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A:</div></td> <td><div align="justify"><b>My vagina, ma'am.</b></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Did you say anything when your Tito Egay touched your vagina?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A:</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">I swayed off his hands.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote> <p>That the act done by petitioner was mere "touching" of AAA's sexual organ was further corroborated by BBB whose testimony is as follows: </p> <blockquote> <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="4%"><div align="justify">Q</div></td> <td width="96%"><div align="justify">On that particular day, April 27, 2004, you saw the accused and your Ate AAA.

Mendoza</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> explains that for a charge of rape by sexual assault with the use of one's fingers as the assaulting object, as in the instant case, to prosper, there should be evidence of at least the slightest penetration of the sexual organ and not merely a brush or a graze of its surface, being that rape by sexual assault requires that the assault be specifically done through the insertion of the assault object into the genital or anal orifices of the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> </p><p> Applying by analogy the treatment of "touching" and "entering" in penile rape as explained in <em>People v. Campuhan</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> <em>Mendoza</em> states: </p><blockquote> <p> The touching of a female's sexual organ, standing alone, is not equivalent to rape, not even an attempted one. With regard to penile rape, <i>People v. Campuhan</i> explains: </p> <blockquote> <p> xxx Thus, t<i>ouching</i> when applied to rape cases does not simply mean mere epidermal contact, stroking or grazing of organs, a slight brush or a scrape of the penis on the external layer of the victim's vagina, or the <i>mons pubis</i>, as in this case. There must be sufficient and convincing proof that the penis indeed <em>touched</em> the <em>labias </em>or <em>slid</em> into the female organ, and <i>not merely stroked the external surface thereof</i>, for an accused to be convicted of consummated rape. xxx</p> <p> xxx Jurisprudence dictates that the <em>labia majora</em> must be <em>entered</em> for rape to be consummated and not merely for the penis to stroke the surface of the female organ. Thus, a grazing of the surface of the female organ or touching the <em>mons pubis</em> of the<em> pudendum</em> is not sufficient to constitute consummated rape. Absent any showing of the slightest penetration of the female organ,<em> i.e.</em>, touching of either<em> labia</em> of the <em>pudendum</em> by the penis, there can be no consummated rape; at most, it can only be attempted rape, if not acts of lasciviousness. (Italics in the original.)</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> What was established beyond reasonable doubt in this case  was that petitioner touched, using his middle finger, AAA's sexual 
organ which was then fully covered by a panty and a short pants. 
However, such is insufficient to hold petitioner liable for attempted 
rape by sexual assault. As above intimated, the mere touching of a 
female's sexual organ, by itself, does not amount to rape nor does it 
suffice to convict for rape at its attempted stage.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></p><p> The Court's explanation of attempted penile rape in <i>Cruz v. People</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> is instructive:
  </p><blockquote>
    <p> In attempted rape, therefore, the concrete felony is rape, but 
the offender does not perform all the acts of execution of having carnal
 knowledge. If the slightest penetration of the female genitalia 
consummates rape, and rape in its attempted stage requires the 
commencement of the commission of the felony directly by overt acts 
without the offender performing all the acts of execution that should 
produce the felony, the only means by which the overt acts performed by 
the accused can be shown to have a causal relation to rape as the 
intended crime is to make a clear showing of his intent to lie with the 
female. Accepting that intent, being a mental act, is beyond the sphere 
of criminal law, that showing must be through his overt acts directly 
connected with rape. He cannot be held liable for attempted rape without
 such overt acts demonstrating the intent to lie with the female. In 
short, the State, to establish attempted rape, must show that his overt 
acts, should his criminal intent be carried to its complete termination 
without being thwarted by extraneous matters, would ripen into rape, 
for, as succinctly put in <em>People v. Dominguez, Jr.</em>: "The gauge 
in determining whether the crime of attempted rape had been committed is
 the commencement of the act of sexual intercourse,<i> i.e.</i>, penetration of
 the penis into the vagina, before the interruption." (Italics and 
citations omitted.)</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> Applying by analogy the above pronouncements to attempted rape by 
sexual assault, petitioner's direct overt act of touching AAA's vagina 
by constantly moving his middle finger cannot&nbsp; convincingly be 
interpreted as demonstrating an intent to actually insert his finger 
inside AAA's sexual organ which, to reiterate, was still then 
protectively covered, much less an intent to have carnal knowledge with 
the victim. An inference of attempted rape by sexual intercourse or 
attempted rape by sexual assault cannot therefore be successfully 
reached based on petitioner's act of touching AAA's genitalia and upon 
ceasing from doing so when AAA swayed off his hand.</p><p> Instead, 
petitioner's lewd act of fondling AAA's sexual organ consummates the 
felony of acts of lasciviousness. The slightest penetration into one's 
sexual organ distinguishes an act of lasciviousness from the crime of 
rape. <i>People v. Bonaagua</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> discussed this distinction:
  </p><blockquote>
    <p> It must be emphasized, however, that like in the crime of rape 
whereby the slightest penetration of the male organ or even its 
slightest contact with the outer lip or the<i> labia majora</i> of the 
vagina already consummates the crime, in like manner, if the tongue, in 
an act of cunnilingus, touches the outer lip of the vagina, the act 
should also be considered as already consummating the crime of rape 
through sexual assault, not the crime of acts of lasciviousness. 
Notwithstanding, in the present case, such logical interpretation could 
not be applied. <strong>It must be pointed out that the victim testified
 that Ireno only touched her private part and licked it, but did not 
insert his finger in her vagina. This testimony of the victim, however, 
is open to various interpretation, since it cannot be identified what 
specific part of the vagina was defiled by Ireno. Thus, in conformity 
with the principle that the guilt of an accused must be proven beyond 
reasonable doubt, the statement cannot be the basis for convicting Ireno
 with the crime of rape through sexual assault.</strong><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> Since there was neither an insertion nor an attempt to insert 
petitioner's finger into AAA's genitalia, petitioner can only be held 
guilty of the lesser crime of acts of lasciviousness following the 
variance doctrine enunciated under Section 4<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> in relation to Section 5<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>
 of Rule 120 of the Rules on Criminal Procedure. Acts of lasciviousness,
 the offense proved, is included in rape, the offense charged.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> </p><p>
 Pursuant to Article 336 of the RPC, acts of lasciviousness is 
consummated when the following essential elements are present: (a) the 
offender commits any act of lasciviousness or lewdness upon another 
person of either sex; and (b) the act of lasciviousness or lewdness is 
committed either (i) by using force or intimidation; or (ii) when the 
offended party is deprived of reason or is otherwise unconscious; or 
(iii) when the offended party is under 12 years of age.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>
 As thus used, lewd is defined as obscene, lustful, indecent, lecherous;
 it signifies that form of immorality that has relation to moral 
impurity; or that which is carried on a wanton manner.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> All of these elements are present in the instant case. </p><p>
 It is likewise undisputed that at the time of the commission of the 
lascivious act, AAA was six (6) years old which calls for the 
application of Section 5(b) of Republic Act No. 7610 defining sexual 
abuse of children and prescribing the penalty therefor, as follows:
  </p><blockquote>
    <p> Section 5. Child Prostitution and Other Sexual Abuse. - 
Children, whether male or female, who for money, profit, or any other 
consideration or due to the coercion or influence of any adult, 
syndicate or group, indulge in sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct,
 are deemed to be children exploited in prostitution and other sexual 
abuse. </p>
    <p> The penalty of reclusion temporal in its medium period to reclusion perpetua shall be imposed upon the following: </p>
    <p> xxxx </p>
    <p> (b) Those who commit the act of sexual intercourse or lascivious
 conduct with a child exploited in prostitution or subject to other 
sexual abuse; Provided, That when the [victim] is under twelve (12) 
years of age, the perpetrators shall be prosecuted under Article 335, 
paragraph 3, for rape and Article 336 of Act No. 3815, as amended, the 
Revised Penal Code, for rape or lascivious conduct, as the case may be: 
Provided, That the penalty for lascivious conduct when the victim is 
under twelve (12) years of age shall be reclusion temporal in its medium
 period; xxx</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> <i>Apropos</i>, Section 2(h) of the rules implementing R.A. 7610 defines lascivious conduct as: 
  </p><blockquote>
    <p> [T]he <b>intentional touching, either directly or through clothing, of the genitalia</b>,
 anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks, or the introduction of 
any object into the genitalia, anus or mouth, of any person, whether of 
the same or opposite sex, with an intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, 
degrade, or arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person, 
bestiality, masturbation, lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic
 area of a person. (Emphasis supplied) </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> In <i>Quimvel v. People</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup>, the Court <i>En Banc</i>
 pronounced that Section 5(b) covers not only a situation where a child 
is abused for profit but also one in which a child, through coercion, 
intimidation or influence, engages in sexual intercourse or lascivious 
conduct. Further, <em>Quimvel </em>instructs that the term "coercion and influence" as appearing under the law is broad enough to cover "'force and intimidation".
  </p><p> In this case, the Information specifically stated that: (a) 
AAA was a 6-year old minor at the time of the commission of the 
offense; (b) that petitioner inserted his finger into AAA's genitalia; 
and (c) petitioner employed force, threats and intimidation. At the 
trial it was established that petitioner committed a lewd act by 
fondling AAA's vagina who, at the time of the incident, was alleged and 
proved to be only 6 years old. Here, it was also established that AAA, 
being of tender age, knew and trusted petitioner who frequents their 
house being the best friend of her father, thus, satisfying the element 
of "influence" exerted by an adult which led AAA to indulge in 
lascivious conduct. Petitioner's defense of denial, apart from being 
inherently weak,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> is demolished by AAA's and BBB's testimonies which the RTC and the CA unanimously regarded as straightforward and credible. </p><p>
 Conclusively, the elements of acts of lasciviousness under Article 336 
of the RPC and of lascivious conduct under R.A. 7610 were established in
 the present case. Following <i>People v. Caoili</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup>,
 petitioner should be convicted of the offense designated as acts of 
lasciviousness under Article 336 of the RPC in relation to Section 5 of 
R.A. 7610 since the minor victim in this case is below 12 years old and 
the imposable penalty is <i>reclusion temporal</i> in its medium period. </p><p>
 Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law (ISL), and in the absence of 
mitigating or aggravating circumstances, the minimum term shall be taken
 from the penalty next lower to <i>reclusion temporal</i> medium, which is <i>reclusion temporal</i>
 minimum, which ranges from twelve (12) years and one (1) day to 
fourteen (14) years and eight (8) months. The maximum term shall be 
taken from the medium period of the imposable penalty,<i> i.e.,</i> <i>reclusion temporal</i>
 in its medium period, which ranges from fifteen (15) years, six (6) 
months and twenty (20) days to sixteen (16) years, five (5) months and 
nine (9) days.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> </p><p> Accordingly, the prison term is modified to twelve (12) years and one (1) day of <i>reclusion temporal</i>
 in its minimum period as minimum, to fifteen (15) years, six (6) months
 and twenty (20) days of<i> reclusion temporal </i>in its medium period as 
maximum. </p><p> Further, in line with recent jurisprudence, petitioner 
is ordered to pay AAA moral damages, exemplary damages and fine in the 
amount of PhP15,000.00 each and civil indemnity in the amount of 
PhP20,000.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup></p><p> </p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>PARTLY GRANTED</b>.
