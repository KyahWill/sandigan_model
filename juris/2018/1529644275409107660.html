				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an appeal from the 14 March 2014 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (<i>CA</i>) in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 05989, which affirmed the 12 December 2012 Judgment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court, <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">xxxxxxxxxxx</span> Camarines Norte (<i>RTC</i>), in Criminal Case No. 12249, finding accused-appellant Mauricio Cabajar Vibar (<i>Vibar</i>) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Rape defined and penalized under Article 266-B(l) of the Revised Penal Code (<i>RPC</i>).<br><br><center><b>THE FACTS</b><br></center><br>In an Information dated 23 December 2004, Vibar was charged with the Crime of Rape committed against <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">xxxxxxxxxxx</span> AAA<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>. The accusatory portion reads:<br><blockquote>That on or about 11:00 in the morning of August 4, 2002 at <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</span> Province of Camarines Norte, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above named accused, with lewd design, motivated by bestial lust and by means of force and intimidation, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously had carnal knowledge <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</span> with AAA, 15 years old, against her will and to her damage.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br></blockquote>During his arraignment on 7 March 2005, Vibar, with the assistance of his counsel, pleaded "Not Guilty."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br><b><i>Evidence for the Prosecution</i></b><br><br>The prosecution presented AAA and Dr. Raul Alcantara (<i>Dr. Alcantara</i>) as witnesses. Their combined testimonies tended to establish the following:<br><br>On 4 August 2002, at around 11:00 A.M., while AAA was cooking lunch outside their nipa hut in Camarines Norte, Vibar came and asked her to get his gloves from inside the house. When AAA refused to do so, he carried her inside and laid her on the floor,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> removed her shorts and panty, zipped open his pants, placed himself on top of her, and made push and pull movements.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> During this time, AAA felt Vibar's penis enter her vagina causing her pain.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>That same day, AAA reported the incident to the police. After executing an affidavit at the police station, she appeared before the judge of the Municipal Circuit Trial Court (<i>MCTC</i>) of San Lorenzo Ruiz for preliminary investigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> AAA's first complaint for rape, however, was dismissed because she refused to speak during that time. She did not cooperate with the preliminary investigation because she was afraid of <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">xxxxxxxxxxx</span> who had threatened to kill her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Further, AAA was hesitant because she did not have the support of her mother, who initially chose to side with Vibar.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>After the incident, AAA left Camarines Norte and went to Antipolo to work. On 7 July 2004, she returned to Camarines Norte to study. Unfortunately, AAA was constantly harassed by Vibar; he would touch her breast and kiss her. This prompted her to file anew the complaint for rape <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> On 20 August 2004, AAA was subjected to a medical examination where it was discovered that she had an elastic hymen that could be penetrated by a penis without causing any lacerations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br><b><i>Evidence for the Defense</i></b><br><br>The defense presented Vibar as its lone witness, whose testimony sought to prove the following:<br><br>On 4 August 2002, at around 11:00 A.M., Vibar went home after attending Sunday worship. Once home, he asked AAA why she did not prepare lunch, and the latter retorted in a disrespectful manner. Because he was hungry and had an earlier misunderstanding with his wife BBB, Vibar scolded her and uttered other unsavory remarks. After the verbal confrontation, AAA went to the police station and accused him of attempted rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>In 2004, however, AAA re-filed the case against Vibar with the prodding of BBB, Arlene Rosinto (<i>Arlene</i>), and a certain Shirley: Arlene and Shirley belonged to the same religious sect as Vibar. They conspired against him and used AAA to exact vengeance upon him: BBB had a paramour and wanted to elope with him but could not do so because she was still living with Vibar; Arlene had an axe to grind against him after he did not vote for her husband, a candidate chosen by their sect, during the elections; Shirley got mad at Vibar when he distanced himself from the sect after refusing to vote for Arlene's husband.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>While in detention, Vibar received a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> from AAA in 2006 wherein she alleged that she was merely coerced to re-file the complaint for rape and that she regretted her decision to do so. Relevant portions of the letter read:<br><blockquote><span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">xxx</span><span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">xx</span><span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">x</span><i> patawarin mo po ako.

The trial court ruled that the prosecution was able to prove that AAA was indeed sexually abused&nbsp; <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</span> noting that AAA's straightforward testimony trumped Vibar's defenses of denial and alibi. The RTC averred that no family member would fabricate a case of rape against another family member and undergo public prosecution if it were untrue. The dispositive portion reads:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the prosecution having proven the guilt of accused Mauricio Vibar y Cabajar beyond reasonable doubt for the crime of Rape, he is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua without eligibility of parole and to pay offended party the following:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;a. P75,000.00 by way of civil indemnity;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;b. P75,000.00 by way of moral damages;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;c. P30,000.00 by way of exemplary damages<br><br>with interest of 6% per annum on all the aforesaid damages from the date of finality of this judgment until fully paid.<br><br><b>With costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br></blockquote>Aggrieved, Vibar appealed before the CA. <br><br><b><i>The CA Ruling</i></b><br><br>In its assailed decision, the CA affirmed the RTC judgment. The appellate court upheld AAA's testimony, which was found credible by the trial court after having directly observed her demeanor and behavior on the witness stand. It highlighted that the physical evidence corroborated her testimony. The CA brushed aside Vibar's imputation of conspiracy for being self-serving. Finally, the appellate court disregarded AAA's purported letter for lack of authentication. It ruled:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of the foregoing, the instant appeal is hereby <b>DENIED</b>. The assailed Judgment dated December 12, 2012 of the Daet, Camarines Norte RTC, Branch 40, in Criminal Case No. 12249 for Rape is hereby <b>AFFIRMED</b> <i>in toto</i>.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br></blockquote>Hence, this appeal raising the following:<br><blockquote><b><center>ISSUE</center><br>WHETHER THE ACCUSED IS GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF RAPE.</b><br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b>THE COURT'S RULING</b><br></div><br>The appeal has no merit.<br><br>Rape is a peculiar crime in that it is shrouded in mystery. More often than not, the victim is left alone at the hand of the assailant with no one to corroborate her claims; sometimes physical evidence to suggest she was defiled is even lacking. It becomes a battle of credibility where the courts are left to decide whether to believe in the victim's narration of her harrowing experience or to accept the abuser's plea of innocence.<br><br>Thus, in deciding rape cases, the Court is guided by the following well-established principles: (1) an accusation of rape can be made with facility and while the accusation is difficult to prove, it is even more difficult for the accused, though innocent, to disprove; (2) considering that in the nature of things, only two persons are usually involved in the crime of rape, the testimony of the complainant should be scrutinized with great caution; and (3) the evidence of the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merits and cannot be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> The Court is duty bound to conduct a thorough and exhaustive evaluation of a judgment of conviction for rape considering the grave consequences for both the accused and the complainant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br><b><i>Credible and categorical testimony of the victim sufficient to convict accused for rape</i></b><br><br>The Court has consistently observed the rule that the assessment by the trial courts of a witness' credibility is accorded great weight and respect. This is so as trial court judges have the advantage of directly observing a witness on the stand and determining whether one is telling the truth or not.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Such findings of the trial courts are generally upheld absent any showing that they have overlooked substantial facts and circumstances which would materially affect the result of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Vibar bewails that the courts <i>a quo</i> erred in lending credibility to AAA's testimony claiming that it was against human nature for a young girl to fabricate a story that would expose herself to ridicule and place a family member behind bars. Truly, the Court in past rulings has held that testimonies of female or child victims should be given full weight and credence because when they say they have been raped, they are saying in effect all that is necessary to show that rape has indeed been committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>In <i>People v. Amarela</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> however, the Court cautioned against the over-reliance on the presumption that no woman would spin a tale of sexual abuse if it were untrue because it would tarnish her honor:<br><blockquote>More often than not, where the alleged victim survives to tell her story of sexual depredation, rape cases are solely decided based on the credibility of the testimony of the private complainant. <b>In doing so, we have hinged on the impression that no young Filipina of decent repute would publicly admit that she has been sexually abused, unless that is the truth, for it is her natural instinct to protect her honor.</b> However, this misconception, particularly in this day and age, not only puts the accused at an unfair disadvantage, but creates a travesty of justice.<br><br>x x x x<br><br><b>This opinion borders on the fallacy of <i>non sequitor</i>. And while the factual setting back then would have been appropriate to say it is natural for a woman to be reluctant in disclosing sexual assault; today, we simply cannot be stuck to the Maria Clara stereotype of a demure and reserved Filipino woman.</b> We, should stay away from such mindset and accept the realities of a woman's dynamic role in society today; she who has over the years transformed into a strong and confidently intelligent and beautiful person, willing to fight for her rights.<br><br>In this way, we can evaluate the testimony of a private complainant of rape without gender bias or cultural misconception. <b>It is important to weed out these unnecessary notions because an accused may be convicted solely on the testimony of the victim, provided of course, that <u>the testimony is credible, natural, convincing and consistent with human nature and the normal course of things</u>.</b> (emphases and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Nevertheless, when AAA's testimony is taken in a vacuum and examined devoid of any preconceptions or presumption, it stands sufficient to convict Vibar of Rape, thus:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td colspan="2"><div align="justify"><u><em>Direct Examination </em></u></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td colspan="2"><div align="justify">FISCAL MANLAPAZ:</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q: </div></td><td><div align="justify">You will agree with me that it is normal <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">xxxxxxxxxxxxxx</span> to enter the nipa hut during that time?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A: </div></td><td><div align="justify">I was outside the nipa hut that time because our kitchen is outside.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q: </div></td><td><div align="justify">So, what is this untoward incident that happened?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A: </div></td><td><div align="justify">He came and then he asked me to get his glo[v]es but I do not want to enter the house, so what he did is he forced me to enter and he almost carried me and put me on the floor.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q: </div></td><td> <div align="justify">When you say he forced you and almost carried you, can you describe it to me?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A: </div></td><td><div align="justify">He carried me up in going inside.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td colspan="2"><div align="justify">x x x x</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q: </div></td><td><div align="justify">So, after he managed to carry you and laid you to the floor, what happened next?

It did not matter that the penetration lasted only for a short period of time because carnal knowledge means sexual bodily connection between persons; and the slightest penetration of the female genitalia consummates the crime of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Moreover, it is noteworthy that AAA immediately sought help from the authorities when she was defiled <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">xxxxxxxxxxxxx</span> in August 2002. Unfortunately, the case was dismissed during the preliminary investigation stage due to her reluctance to speak before the investigating MCTC judge.<br><br>AAA's hesitation, nonetheless, was caused by the initial lack of support of her mother, who sided with Vibar, and the threats of the accused towards her. It should not diminish her urgency to report the gruesome incident to the police. If the delay in reporting incidents of rape may cast doubt upon the courts as to the veracity of the alleged crime,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> then the swift desire to achieve justice should strengthen the victim's claims. In this case, AAA's minority coupled with her immediate action to seek redress for the wrong committed against her, tend to support her testimony that indeed she was raped <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</span>.<br><br><b><i>Medical reports corroborative evidence in rape.</i></b><br><br>Vibar also laments that there was no physical evidence of penetration to support AAA's claims of defilement, noting that there were no medical reports that indicated even the slightest of penetration. It must be remembered, however, that medical reports are merely corroborative in character and are not essential for a conviction because the credible testimony of a victim would suffice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Nevertheless, in the case at bench, the findings from AAA's medical examination actually support her testimony. Dr. Alacantara explained the findings as follows:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td colspan="2"><div align="justify">FISCAL BOADO:</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q: </div></td><td><div align="justify">Doctor, in the conclusions of Dr. Jane Perpetua F.

As characterized by Dr. Alcantara, AAA's elastic hymen made it possible for an erect adult penis to penetrate her vagina without causing lacerations or rupture of the hymen.<br><br><b><i>Lack of authentication of private documents renders them inadmissible.</i></b><br><br>As a last-ditch effort to convince the courts of his innocence, Vibar claimed that he received a letter from AAA sometime in 2006 wherein the latter explained that she was merely coerced to re-file the complaint for rape and she very much regretted doing so. He stated the while it was not AAA herself who gave the letter, he was sure that it was AAA who wrote it because no one else by AAA's name would call her <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">xxxxxx</span> and that he was familiar with her handwriting.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Section 20, Rule 132 of the Rules of Court provides that in order for any private document offered as authentic to be admitted as evidence, its due execution and authenticity must be proved either: (1) by anyone who saw the document executed or written; or (2) by evidence of the genuineness of the signature or handwriting of the maker. The authentication of private document before it is received in evidence is vital because during such process, a witness positively identifies that the document is genuine and has been duly executed or that the document is neither spurious nor counterfeit nor executed by mistake or under duress.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>In order to bolster his claim of innocence, Vibar testified:<br><blockquote> <table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify"><u><em>Cross-examination</em></u></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td width="95%"><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">FISCAL BOADO:</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">You also presented, Mr. witness, a letter allegedly written by AAA the private complainant in this case addressed to you, is that correct?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, ma'am.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">But you do not have any proof to substantiate your claim that this letter was really prepared by <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">xxxxxxxxxxxxx</span> AAA aside from your bare allegation?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">She is the one, ma'am, because no other AAA would call me <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">xxxxx</span> and all the contents of the letter speak [to] all the incidents involving our case, ma'am.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">But you cannot present any documents written by AAA to prove that this penmanship belongs to AAA, is that correct?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A:</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">I do not have, ma'am.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">x x x x </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">Court</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Mr. witness, when did you receive the letter allegedly coming from AAA?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A:</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">On May 2006, Your Honor.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Can you not remember the date of May?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">More or less May 24, 2006, Your Honor.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">And when you received the said alleged letter, AAA [had] already testified in court?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, Your Honor.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Who handed to you the letter?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">It was given to me by the one who visited me in jail, he said that it was given to him by AAA, Your Honor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>A plain reading of Vibar's testimony immediately reveals that he miserably failed to comply with the authentication requirement set forth under the Rules. Neither was there any witness who could testify that the alleged letter was voluntarily and personally made by AAA nor was there any document from which her handwriting could have been compared. Curiously, the person who purportedly handed to Vibar AAA's letter was not presented in court to testify as to the genuineness of the document.<br><br>Vibar merely relies on his self-serving testimony that he was sure that the letter was AAA's doing. Such hollow assurance, however, in no way proves that AAA had indeed voluntarily executed the said document. He could have easily fabricated the letter and feigned that it was made <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">xxxxxxxxxxxxxx</span> As such, AAA's professed letter is but a mere scrap of paper with no evidentiary value for lack of proper authentication.<br><br>With this in mind, the Court agrees that all the elements of rape are present in the case at bar. Under Article 266-A(l) of the RPC, Rape is committed by a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances: (a) Through force, threat or intimidation; (b) When the offended party is deprived of reason or is otherwise unconscious; (c) By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority; and (d) When the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age or is demented, even though none of the circumstances mentioned above is present. Here, AAA categorically testified that Vibar had carnal knowledge with her after the latter lay on top of her and inserted his penis into her vagina. In addition, force and intimidation were present <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br><b><i>Modification of damages to conform to recent jurisprudence</i></b><br><br>In convicting Vibar, the RTC ordered that he pay AAA P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P75,000.00 as moral damages and P30,000.00 as exemplary damages.
