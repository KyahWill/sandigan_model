				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This administrative case arose from a verified complaint<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> for undue delay in rendering an order amounting to gross dereliction of duty and violation of Administrative Matter (A.M.) No. 99-10-05-0<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> relative to Civil Case No. 10-27-MY, entitled "<em>Estate of Danilo Y. Uy (deceased) and Thelma D. Uy and Heirs v. Boston Finance and Investment Corporation</em>," filed by Boston Finance and Investment Corporation (complainant) against Presiding Judge Candelario V. Gonzalez (respondent) of the Regional Trial Court of Bais City, Negros Occidental, Branch 45 (RTC). <p align="center"><b>The Facts</b> </p><p>Complainant alleged that on November 19, 2010, the plaintiffs in Civil Case No. 10-27-MY, the Estate of Danilo Y. Uy and Thelma D. Uy, <em>et al.</em> (plaintiffs), filed a Petition with Application for Preliminary Injunction and/or Temporary Restraining Order (TRO)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> before the RTC, praying for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction/TRO to enjoin the sale at public auction of the properties that served as collateral for the loans they obtained from complainant. Respondent issued an Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> of even date directing complainant to show cause why an injunctive writ should not be issued. In the same order, however, respondent also directed the Clerk of Court, as <em>Ex-Officio</em> Sheriff, and her Deputy Sheriff <em>"to cease and desist from conducting the scheduled public auction on November 19, 2010 pending the resolution of the instant petition</em>"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> without, however, specifying the duration of its effectivity. </p><p> On December 2, 2010, complainant filed its Compliance,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> maintaining that no injunctive writ should issue in favor of the plaintiffs, and that the petition should be dismissed on the grounds of forum shopping and <em>litis pendentia</em>. It appears that the plaintiffs had instituted a similar case before the Municipal Trial Court in Cities (MTCC) of Bacolod City seeking the enjoinment of the foreclosure sale.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Subsequently, complainant also filed its Answer,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> praying for the dismissal of the petition and reiterating the affirmative defenses in its Compliance. Furthermore, in a Manifestation with Motion<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> dated June 14, 2011, complainant alleged that there were other pending incidents in the case that respondent needed to resolve. </p><p> Unfortunately, respondent failed to resolve all pending incidents in connection with the case for a relatively long time. The scheduled hearings were also postponed several times for various reasons, one of which was the information given to the court by plaintiffs' counsel that the parties were in the process of negotiations for a final settlement.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> </p><p> Thereafter, or on March 18, 2013, complainant again moved<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> for the prompt resolution of all pending incidents in the case. Although it denied that the parties were currently undergoing amicable settlement,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> complainant nonetheless expressed its willingness to enter into a compromise agreement with plaintiffs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> However, no compromise agreement was reached for failure of the plaintiffs to cooperate with complainant. Finally, in an Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> dated July 24, 2013, respondent suspended the proceedings in and archived Civil Case No. 10-27-MY "pending resolution of the other related case in Bacolod City."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> </p><p>In his defense,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> respondent claimed that he issued the July 24, 2013 Order in the honest belief that the parties were in the process of finalizing an amicable settlement, especially since complainant's counsel did not object thereto.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> He explained that the suspension of the proceedings was not intended to delay the resolution of the case, but to facilitate the parties' negotiations preparatory to a compromise agreement.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> </p><p>In rebuttal,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> complainant maintained that respondent's failure to promptly resolve all pending incidents in the case, <em>i.e</em>., the motion to lift the cease and desist order and the motion to dismiss Civil Case No. 10-27-MY, despite repeated pleas for their immediate resolution, constituted gross dereliction of duty and violation of A.M. No. 99-10-05-0.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Likewise, complainant pointed out that its several manifestations and motions praying for the early resolution of the pending incidents should have been sufficient to apprise respondent that it was no longer willing to enter into a compromise agreement with plaintiffs. As such, respondent had no basis to assume that the parties were close to having an amicable settlement.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> </p><p> Finally, although respondent admitted<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> that there were several incidents which remained unacted upon, he insisted that it was because the preliminary hearing on complainant's affirmative defenses has not yet been terminated due to the latter's failure to appear. He claimed that complainant actively participated in the similar case pending before the MTCC in Bacolod City, where the parties were allegedly negotiating for an amicable settlement.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></p><p align="center"> <b>The OCA's Report and Recommendation</b> </p><p> In a Memorandum<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> dated June 28, 2017, the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) recommended, <em>inter alia</em>, that respondent be found guilty of: (<em>a</em>) gross ignorance of the law and be fined in the amount of P30,000.00; and (<em>b</em>) undue delay in resolving pending incidents in Civil Case No. 10-27-MY and violation of Sections 3 and 5, Canon 6 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct for the Philippine Judiciary,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> and additionally be fined in the amount of P11,000.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> </p><p> Citing the provisions of Section 5,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Rule 58 of the Rules of Court on the issuance of a preliminary injunction, the OCA found that since respondent issued the "cease and desist" Order dated November 19, 2010 – which was in the nature of a TRO – without any justification or any indication of its effectivity, and that he also failed to conduct a summary hearing within seventy-two (72) hours from its issuance to determine whether the same should be extended, he should therefore be found guilty of gross ignorance of the law and procedure.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> The OCA held that while there was no finding of malice or bad faith against respondent, the rules that the latter violated were so basic that all magistrates are presumed to know.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> </p><p> Gross ignorance of the law is a serious charge punishable by either dismissal from service, suspension from office without salary and other benefits for more than three (3) months but not exceeding six (6) months, or a fine of more than P20,000.00, but not exceeding P40,000.00. Considering that this is respondent's first offense, the OCA recommended that he be meted the penalty of a fine in the amount of P30,000.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></p><p> Similarly, the OCA observed that respondent's failure to expeditiously resolve the pending incidents in the case resulted in the undue and inordinate delay in the resolution thereof. Moreover, although a judge may order that a civil case be archived under several circumstances,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> the prescribed period should not exceed ninety (90) days after which, the case should immediately be included in the trial calendar. In this case, a period of two (2) years had already lapsed, displaying respondent's lackadaisical treatment of the case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></p><p> Under Item No. 1, Section 9,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Rule 140 of the Rules of Court, undue delay in rendering an order is a less serious charge punishable by suspension from office without salary and other benefits for not less than one (1) month nor more than three (3) months, or a fine of more than P10,000.00, but not exceeding P20,000.00. Citing jurisprudence, the OCA recommended that respondent be fined in the amount of P11,000.00 for this particular offense.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></p><p align="center"> <b>The Issue Before the Court</b> </p><p> The sole issue for the Court's determination is whether or not respondent should be held administratively liable. </p><p align="center"> <b>The Court's Ruling</b> </p><p> After a punctilious review of this case, the Court finds respondent guilty of gross ignorance of the law and undue delay in rendering an order. </p><p> "To be able to render substantial justice and maintain public confidence in the legal system, judges should be embodiments of competence, integrity [,] and independence. Judges are also expected to exhibit more than just a cursory acquaintance with statutes and procedural rules and to apply them properly in all good faith. Judges are likewise expected to demonstrate mastery of the principles of law, keep abreast of prevailing jurisprudence, and discharge their duties in accordance therewith."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></p> <p> In this case, respondent's "cease and desist" Order issued on November 19, 2010 was, as the OCA had correctly pointed out, in the nature of a TRO. However, the aforesaid order failed to justify the necessity for its issuance, as it merely issued the directive to the Clerk of Court, acting as <em>Ex-Officio </em>Sheriff, and the Deputy Sheriff without stating the reasons therefor. Likewise, it did not specify any period for its effectivity, in essence making the same indefinite. These omissions on respondent's part are contrary to the provisions of Section 5, Rule 58 of the Rules of Court, which provides: </p><blockquote> <p> Section 5. <i>Preliminary injunction not granted without notice; exception</i>. — No preliminary injunction shall be granted without hearing and prior notice to the party or person sought to be enjoined. If it shall appear from facts shown by affidavits or by the verified application that <strong>great or irreparable injury would result to the applicant before the matter can be heard on notice</strong>, the court to which the application for preliminary injunction was made, <strong>may issue a temporary restraining order to be effective only for a period of twenty (20) days from service</strong> on the party or person sought to be enjoined, except as herein provided. Within the said twenty-day period, the court must order said party or person to show cause, at a specified time and place, why the injunction should not be granted, determine within the same period whether or not the preliminary injunction shall be granted, and accordingly issue the corresponding order. (See Resolution dated February 17, 1998 in Bar Matter No. 803 entitled "RE: CORRECTION OF CLERICAL ERRORS IN THE 1997 RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE WHICH WERE APPROVED ON APRIL 8, 1997, EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 1997.)</p> <p> However, and subject to the provisions of the preceding sections, if the matter is of extreme urgency and the applicant will suffer grave injustice and irreparable injury, the executive judge of a multiple-<em>sala</em> court or the presiding judge of a single sala court may issue <em>ex parte</em> a temporary restraining order effective for only seventy-two (72) hours from issuance but he shall immediately comply with the provisions of the next preceding section as to service of summons and the documents to be served therewith. Thereafter, within the aforesaid seventy-two (72) hours, the judge before whom the case is pending shall conduct a summary hearing to determine whether the temporary restraining order shall be extended until the application for preliminary injunction can be heard.<b> In no case shall the total period of effectivity of the temporary restraining order exceed twenty (20) days, including the original seventy-two hours provided herein.</b></p> <p> In the event that the application for preliminary injunction is denied or not resolved within the said period, the temporary restraining order is deemed, automatically vacated. The effectivity of a temporary restraining order is not extendible without need of any judicial declaration to that effect and no court shall have authority to extend or renew the same on the same ground for which it was issued.</p> <p> However, if issued by the Court of Appeals or a member thereof, the temporary restraining order shall be effective for sixty (60) days from service on the party or person sought to be enjoined. A restraining, order issued by the Supreme Court or a member thereof shall be effective until further orders. (Emphases supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> In issuing an indefinite cease and desist order, respondent clearly failed to observe the rules and restrictions regarding the issuance of a TRO, which are basic tenets of procedure, and hence, renders him administratively liable for gross ignorance of the law. Case law states that "when a law or a rule is basic, judges owe it to their office to simply apply the law."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> It is of no moment that he was motivated by good faith or acted without malice, as these affect his competency and conduct as a judge in the discharge of his official functions. According to jurisprudence, gross ignorance of the law or incompetence cannot be excused by a claim of good faith.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></p><p> Similarly, the Court finds respondent guilty of undue delay in rendering an order for his failure to expeditiously resolve the pending incidents in Civil Case No. 10-27-MY despite complainant's repeated motions for early resolution. In fact, it was only when the case was transferred to another judge that it was finally acted upon.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Likewise, his explanation for archiving the case on the ground that the parties were in the process of entering into an amicable settlement does not justify the prolonged inaction thereon, in light of the provisions of Administrative Circular No. 7-A-92 or the "Guidelines in the Archiving of Cases," which provides that a case may be archived only for a period not exceeding ninety (90) days, after which, it shall be immediately included in the trial calendar after the lapse thereof. Respondent's failure to perform his judicial duty with reasonable promptness in this respect clearly contravenes the provisions of Sections 3 and 5, Canon 6 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct for the Philippine Judiciary, to wit: </p><blockquote> <p> Section 3. Judges shall take reasonable steps to maintain and enhance their knowledge, skills and personal qualities necessary for the proper performance of judicial duties, taking advantage for this purpose of the training and other facilities which should be made available, under judicial control, to judges.</p> <p> Section 5. Judges shall perform all judicial duties, including the delivery of reserved decisions, efficiently, fairly and with reasonable promptness.</p> </blockquote> <p> Under Rule 140 of the Revised Rules of Court, as amended, <em>gross ignorance of the law or procedure</em> is a serious charge<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> punishable by either: (a) dismissal from service, forfeiture of all or part of the benefits as the Court may determine, and disqualification from reinstatement or appointment to any public office, including government-owned and controlled corporation; or (b) suspension from office without salary and other benefits for more than three (3) months, but not exceeding six (6) months; or (c) a fine of more than P20,000.00 but not exceeding P40,000.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> On the other hand,<em> undue delay in rendering a decision or order</em> is a less serious charge<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> punishable by either: (a) suspension from office without salary and other benefits for not less than one (1) month nor more than three (3) months; or (b) a fine of more than P10,000.00, but not exceeding P20,000.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> </p><p> Considering that this is the first time that respondent has been found administratively liable for both offenses, and in light of relevant jurisprudence<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> where separate penalties had been imposed on a respondent judge who is found guilty of two (2) or more offenses, the Court metes upon respondent in this case the penalty of a fine in the amount of P30,000.00 for gross ignorance of the law, as well as a fine of P11,000.00 for undue delay in resolving pending incidents in Civil Case No. 10-27-MY. Further, respondent is sternly warned that a repetition of the same or similar acts shall be dealt with more severely.</p><p> At this juncture, it may be ruminated: <em>is not Section 50, Rule 10 of the Revised Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service</em> (RRACCS)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> — which provides that "[<u>i]f the respondent is found guilty of two (2) or more charges or counts, the penalty to be imposed should be that corresponding to the most serious charge and the rest shall be considered as aggravating circumstances</u>" — <em>applicable in meting out the penalties on herein respondent"?</em> </p><p> The Court is aware that in previous cases,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> it had indeed applied Section 50, Rule 10 of the RRACCS in imposing penalties on erring judges who were found guilty of multiple administrative charges or counts. In <em>Hipe v. Literato</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> the Court found Judge Rolando T. Literato liable for two (2) offenses, particularly gross ignorance of the law and undue delay in rendering a decision. Applying Section 50, Rule 10 of the RRACCS, it imposed a penalty of fine in the amount of P30,000.00, which corresponds to the penalty for the most serious charge, while undue delay in deciding a case was considered only as an aggravating circumstance.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> In <em>Spouses Crisologo v. Omelio</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> respondent judge was found guilty of four (4) counts of gross ignorance of the law, for which the Court imposed the penalty for the offense "in its maximum, due to the presence of aggravating circumstances."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> <em>In Re: Anonymous Complaints Against Bandong</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> retired Judge Dinah Evangeline B. Bandong was found liable for gross misconduct, conduct prejudicial to the best interest of service, and violation of Supreme Court rules but the penalty imposed on her was a single fine of P40,000.00, based on her most serious charge of gross misconduct, while the rest were only considered as aggravating circumstances.</p><p> In contrast, in another set of cases (which were above-cited and applied herein),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> the Court had imposed <u>separate penalties</u> on respondent judges who were found guilty of two (2) or more offenses. In R<em>e: Evaluation of Administrative Liability of Lubao</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> the Court found Judge Antonio C. Lubao guilty of various offenses<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> under Rule 140 of the Rules of Court and separately penalized the judge for each violation. In <em>Medina v. Canoy</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Judge Victor A. Canoy was found guilty of gross ignorance of the law and undue delay in rendering a decision under Rule 140 of the Rules of Court, and accordingly, was meted separate fines for each offense.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Similarly, in <em>Reyes v. Paderanga</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> Judge Rustico D. Paderanga was found guilty of two (2) offenses under Rule 140 of the Rules of Court and was separately fined for each offense.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup></p><p> Recognizing these diverging strands of jurisprudence, the Court finds it opportune to herein settle the conflict by resolving that henceforth, <b>in administrative cases involving judges and justices of the lower courts, the respondent shall be charged and penalized under Rule 140 of the Rules of Court, and accordingly, separate penalties shall be imposed for every offense.</b> The penalty provisions under the RRACCS shall not apply in such cases. To avoid any confusion, the underlying considerations therefor shall be explicated below.</p><p> Fundamentally, the setting of parameters pertaining to the discipline of all court personnel, including judges and justices, clearly fall within the sole prerogative of the Court. The Supreme Court's exclusive authority to set these parameters is based on no other than the 1987 Constitution, which provides:</p><p align="center"> ARTICLE VIII </p><blockquote> <p> Section 6. The Supreme Court shall have <b>administrative supervision over all courts and the personnel</b> thereof. (Emphases supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> In this relation, Section 11, Article VIII of the Constitution particularly states that "[t]he Supreme Court <em>en banc</em> shall have the <b><u>power to discipline judges of lower courts</u></b>, or order their dismissal x x x."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup></p> <p> Anchored on these constitutional mandates, the Court issued two (2) separate body of rules to govern judicial discipline cases, to wit: (<em>a</em>) <b>Rule 140 of the Rules of Court to apply to judges and justices of lower courts</b>; and (<em>b</em>) <b>the Code of Conduct for Court Personnel (CCCP)</b>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> which incorporates the RRACCS, <b>to apply to all judiciary personnel "who are not justices or judges</b>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> Each shall be discussed in turn.</p><p> In its present form, Rule 140<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> of the Rules of Court is entitled "Discipline of Judges of Regular and Special Courts and Justices of the Court of Appeals and the <em>Sandiganbayan</em>." As its titular heading denotes, Rule 140 was crafted to specifically govern the discipline of judges and justices of the lower courts, providing therein not only a distinct classification of charges but also the applicable sanctions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> A perusal of the offenses listed therein shows that they are broad enough to cover all kinds of administrative charges related to judicial functions, as they even <b><u>include violations of the codes of conduct for judges, as well as of Supreme Court directives</u></b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> It is likewise apparent that the list of offenses therein includes even violations of the civil service rules, such as acts of dishonesty,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> gambling in public,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> and engaging in partisan political activities.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> The Court therefore holds that violations of civil service laws and rules are subsumed under the charges enumerated in Rule 140 of the Rules of Court. On this score, it is highly-instructive to echo the observations of retired Associate Justice Presbitero J. Velasco, Jr. in his Separate Opinion in the case of <em>OCA v. Chavez</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> explaining the "non-application of administrative offenses under the ordinary civil service rules with respect to judges by reason of them being covered by another set of rules or law that specially deals with the grounds for their discipline," viz.: </p><blockquote> <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="3%"><div align="justify">1.</div></td> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify"> <div align="justify">The RRACCS is intended to govern administrative proceedings in the entire civil service, in general.

It must be pointed out that the CCCP <u>explicitly incorporates civil service rules</u>, <i>viz</i>.: </p><blockquote> <p align="center"> INCORPORATION OF OTHER RULES</p> <p> Section 1. All provisions of law, <strong>Civil Service rules</strong>, and issuances of the Supreme Court governing or regulating the conduct of public officers and employees applicable to the Judiciary <strong>are deemed incorporated</strong> into this Code.

However, considering that the CCCP does not specify the sanctions for those violations, the Court has, <b><u>in the exercise of its discretion</u></b>, adopted the penalty provisions under existing civil service rules, such as the RRACCS, including Section 50 thereof.</p><p> Accordingly, in cases where a respondent court personnel had committed multiple infractions, the Court has applied Section 50 of the RRACCS. To illustrate, in the recent case of <em>Paduga v. Dimson</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> a sheriff was found guilty of three (3) offenses amounting to conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service, less serious dishonesty, and simple neglect of duty under the RRACCS. Since there were multiple violations, the Court applied Sections 50 of the RRACCS in imposing the penalty of suspension for one (1) year. Similarly, in <em>Anonymous Complaint Against Camay, Jr.</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> a utility worker of the Judiciary was found guilty of various serious offenses, and applying Section 50 of the RRACCS, the Court dismissed him from service.</p><p> Consistent with these cases, the Court resolves that in administrative cases wherein <b>the respondent court personnel commits multiple administrative infractions, the Court, adopting Section 50 of the RRACCS, shall impose the penalty corresponding to the most serious charge, and consider the rest as aggravating circumstances.</b> </p><p> Thus, to summarize the foregoing discussion, the following guidelines shall be observed: </p><blockquote> <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="4%"><div align="justify"><strong>(a)</strong></div></td> <td width="96%"><div align="justify">Rule 140 of the Rules of Court shall exclusively govern administrative cases involving <strong>judges or justices of the lower courts</strong>.

Within the said twenty-day period, the court must order said party or person to show cause, at a specified time and place, why the injunction should not be granted, determine within the same period whether or not the preliminary injunction shall be granted, and accordingly issue the corresponding order.

Thereafter, within the aforesaid seventy-two (72) hours, the judge before whom the case is pending shall conduct a summary hearing to determine whether the temporary restraining order shall be extended until the application for preliminary injunction can be heard.
