<i>(b) </i>it and its predecessors-in-interest have been in open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession and occupation of the same; and <i>(c) </i>the possession is under a bona fide claim of ownership since June 12, 1945, or earlier.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Verily, the applicant has the burden of overcoming the presumption that the State owns the land applied for, and proving that the land has already been <b>classified as alienable and disposable as of the time of the </b><b>filing of the application.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> To prove the alienability and disposability of the land sought to be registered, an application for original registration must be accompanied by two (2) documents, <i>i.e., </i>(1) a copy of the <u>original </u><u>classification</u> approved by the DENR Secretary and certified as a true copy by the legal custodian of the DENR's official records; and (2) a <u>certificate of </u><u>land classification status</u> issued by the CENRO or the Provincial Environment and Natural Resources Office (PENRO) of the DENR based on the land classification approved by the DENR Secretary.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>In the present case, petitioner maintains that SPPI failed to prove that the subject land is within the alienable and disposable portion of the public domain since DAO 97-37 was never properly identified in court, and the MCTC should not have taken judicial notice of the record of other cases even when the said other cases have been heard or pending in the same court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>Judicial notice is the cognizance of certain facts which judges may properly take and act on without proof because they already know them.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Section 3, Rule 129 of the Rules of Court pertinently provides:<br><br><blockquote>Section 3. <i>Judicial notice, when hearing necessary. </i>— During the trial, the court, on its own initiative, or on request of a party, may announce its intention to take judicial notice of any matter and allow the parties to be heard thereon.</blockquote><br><br>"As a general rule, courts are not authorized to take judicial notice of the contents of the records of other cases, even when such cases have been tried or are pending in the same court, and notwithstanding the fact that both cases may have been tried or are actually pending before the same judge. However, this rule is subject to the exception that <u>in the absence of objection </u><u>and as a matter of convenience to all parties, a court may properly treat all or any part of the original record of the case filed in its archives as read into the </u><u>records of a case pending before it, when with the knowledge of the </u><u>opposing party, reference is made to it, by name and number or in some </u><u>other manner by which it is sufficiently designated</u>. Thus, for said exception to apply, the party concerned must be given an opportunity to object before the court could take judicial notice of any record pertaining to other cases pending before it."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>As correctly ruled by the CA, the conditions necessary for the exception to be applicable were established in this case. Notably, the handling Government Prosecutor <i>(a) </i>did not object to the dispensation of the testimony of the DENR legal custodian of official records, Ms. Bautista, in view of the similar stipulation between him and the same counsel of SPPI in LRC No. N-127 previously heard and decided by the MCTC,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> and <i>(b) </i>satisfied himself that the copy of DAO 97-37 presented was duly certified by Ms. Bautista. Only then was the photocopy of the certified copy duly marked as exhibit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Moreover, contrary to petitioner's protestation,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> the land sought to be registered need not have been declared alienable and disposable since June 12, 1945 or earlier in order for the applicant for registration to secure the judicial confirmation of its title. Such contention had already been declared as absurd and unreasonable in <i>Republic v. Naguit.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> <b>Registration under Section 14 (1) of PD 1529 is based on possession and occupation of the </b><b>alienable and disposable land of the public domain since June 12, 1945 or earlier, <i>without regard to whether the land was susceptible to private </i></b><i><b>ownership at that time. </b></i>"The applicant needs only to show that the land had already been declared alienable and disposable at any time prior to the filing of the application for registration,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> which SPPI was able to do.<br><br>However, notwithstanding the alienability and disposability of the subject land, the Court finds that SPPI failed to present convincing evidence that its alleged possession and occupation were of the nature and duration required by law.<br><br><b>For purposes of land registration under Section 14 (1) of PD 1529, </b><b>proof of specific acts of ownership must be presented to substantiate the </b><b>claim of open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession and </b><b>occupation of the land subject of the application. </b>Actual possession consists in the manifestation of acts of dominion over it of such a nature as a party would actually exercise over his own property.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Possession is: <i>(a) <b>open</b> </i>when it is patent, visible, apparent, notorious, and not clandestine; <i>(b) </i><i><b>continuous </b></i>when uninterrupted, unbroken, and not intermittent or occasional; <i>(c) <b>exclusive</b> </i>when the adverse possessor can show exclusive dominion over the land and an appropriation of it to his own use and benefit; and <i>(d) </i><i><b>notorious </b></i>when it is so conspicuous that it is generally known and talked of by the public or the people in the neighborhood.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>To prove that it and its predecessors-in-interest have been in possession and occupation of the subject land since June 12, 1945 or earlier, SPPI presented, among others, the testimony of Nelia Linatoc-Cabalda (Nelia). Nelia, who was born in 1936, claimed to have known of Gervacio's ownership and cultivation of the subject land when she was about seven (7) years old, or around 1943, as she and other children her age would frequent the subject land where they played and gathered fruits.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> However, such testimony was insufficient to establish possession in the nature and character required by law that would give right to ownership. In a number of cases, the Court has repeatedly held that to prove open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession and occupation in the concept of owner, the claimant must show the nature<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> and extent of cultivation<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> on the subject land, or the number of crops planted or the volume of the produce harvested from the crops supposedly planted thereon;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> failing in which, the supposed planting and harvesting of crops in the land being claimed only amounted to mere casual cultivation which is not the nature of possession and occupation required by law. Consequently, SPPI failed to satisfy the requisite exclusivity and notoriety of its claimed possession and occupation of the subject land because exclusive dominion and conspicuous possession thereof were not established.<br><br>Furthermore, SPPFs evidence were insufficient to prove that its possession and occupation were for the duration required by law. The earliest tax declaration in Gervacio's name presented by SPPI, <i>i.e., </i>Tax Declaration (TD) No. 6243, dates back to 1955<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> only, short of the requirement that possession and occupation under a bona fide claim of ownership should be since June 12, 1945 or earlier. That TD No. 6243 cancels a prior tax declaration, <i>i.e., </i>TD 1052, would not help SPPI's cause in view of the absence of any evidence <i>(a) </i>identifying Gervacio or any other prior possessor as the declared owner under TD 1052, and <i>(b) </i>indicating its effectivity date. Thus, the Court cannot subscribe to the CA's conclusion that it can be "reasonably assumed that before the issuance of [TD] No. 6243, the subject [land] had already been occupied by [Gervacio] or other prior claimants."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> The payment of realty taxes and declaration of the subject land in the name of Gervacio in 1955 gives rise to the presumption that he claimed ownership and possession thereof only in that year.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>In sum, the Court finds that SPPI's unsubstantiated and self-serving assertions of possession and occupation do not constitute the well-nigh incontrovertible evidence of possession and occupation of the subject land of the nature and duration required by Section 14 (1) of PD 1529. Accordingly, the CA erred in affirming the MCTC's grant of SPPI's application for original registration of its imperfect title over the subject land.<br><br><br><b>WHEREFORE, </b>the petition is <b>GRANTED. </b>A new judgment is hereby <b>entered REVERSING and SETTING ASIDE </b>the Decision dated October 12, 2017 and the Resolution dated February 9, 2018 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

This is not borne out by the plain meaning of Section 14 (1). "Since June 12, 1945," as used in the provision, qualifies its antecedent phrase "under a bona fide claim of ownership." Generally speaking, qualifying words restrict or modify only the words or phrases to which they are immediately associated, and not those distantly or remotely located. <i><u>Ad proximum antecedents fiat relation nisi impediatur sentencia</u></i><i>.</i><br><br>Besides, we are mindful of the absurdity that would result if we adopt petitioner's position. Absent a legislative amendment, the rule would be, adopting the OSG's view, that all lands of the public domain which were not declared alienable or disposable before June 12, 1945 would not be susceptible to original registration, no matter the length of unchallenged possession by the occupant. Such interpretation renders paragraph (1) of Section 14 virtually inoperative and even precludes the government from giving it effect even as it decides to reclassify public agricultural lands as alienable and disposable. The unreasonableness of the situation would even be aggravated[,] considering that before June 12, 1945, the Philippines was not yet even considered an independent state.<br><br>Instead, the more reasonable interpretation of Section 14 (1) is that it merely requires the property sought to be registered as already alienable and disposable at the time the application for registration of title is filed. If the State, at the time the application is made, has not yet deemed it proper to release the property for alienation or disposition, the presumption is that the government is still reserving the right to utilize the property; hence, the need to preserve its ownership in the State irrespective of the length of adverse possession even if in good faith. However, if the property has already been classified as alienable and disposable, as it is in this case, then there is already an intention on the part of the State to abdicate its exclusive prerogative over the property.</blockquote><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> <i>Republic v.
