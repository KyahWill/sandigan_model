No. 178083 to a new Member-in-Charge.<br><br>Resolving the issues raised by Atty. Mendoza in behalf of PAL, as well as the issues raised against the recall of the resolution of September 7, 2011, the Court <i>En Banc</i> promulgated its resolution in A.M. No. 11-10-1-SC on March 13, 2012,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> in which it summarized the intricate developments involving G.R. No. 178083, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>To summarize all the developments that brought about the present dispute-expressed in a format that can more readily be appreciated in terms of the Court <i>en banc's</i> ruling to recall the September 7, 2011 ruling - the FASAP case, as it developed, was attended by special and unusual circumstances that saw:<br><br>(a) the confluence of the successive retirement of three Justices (in a Division of five Justices) who actually participated in the assailed Decision and Resolution;<br><br>(b) the change in the governing rules-from the A.M.s to the IRSC regime-which transpired during the pendency of the case;<br><br>(c) the occurrence of a series of inhibitions in the course of the case (Justices Ruben Reyes, Leonardo-De Castro, Corona, Velasco, and Carpio), and the absences of Justices Sereno and Reyes at the critical time, requiring their replacement; notably, Justices Corona, Carpio, Velasco and Leonardo-De Castro are the four most senior Members of the Court;<br><br>(d) the three re-organizations of the divisions, which all took place during the pendency of the case, necessitating the transfer of the case from the Third Division, to the First, then to the Second Division;<br><br>(e) the unusual timing of Atty. Mendoza's letters, made after the ruling Division had issued its Resolution of September 7, 2011, but before the parties received their copies of the said Resolution; and<br><br>(f) finally, the time constraint that intervened, brought about by the parties' receipt on September 19, 2011 of the Special Division's Resolution of September 7, 2011, and the consequent running of the period for finality computed from this latter date; and the Resolution would have lapsed to finality after October 4, 2011, had it not been recalled by that date.<br><br>All these developments, in no small measure, contributed in their own peculiar way to the confusing situations that attended the September 7, 2011 Resolution, resulting in the recall of this Resolution by the Court <i>en banc</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br></blockquote>In the same resolution of March 13, 2012, the Court <i>En Banc</i> directed the re-raffle of G.R. No. 178083 to the remaining Justices of the former Special Third Division who participated in resolving the issues pursuant to Section 7, Rule 2 of the <i>Internal Rules of the Supreme Court</i>, explaining:<br><blockquote>On deeper consideration, the majority now firmly holds the view that Section 7, Rule 2 of the IRSC should have prevailed in considering the raffle and assignment of cases after the 2nd MR was accepted, as advocated by some Members within the ruling Division, as against the general rule on inhibition under Section 3, Rule 8. The underlying constitutional reason, of course, is the requirement of Section 4(3), Article VIII of the Constitution already referred to above.<br><br>The general rule on statutory interpretation is that apparently conflicting provisions should be reconciled and harmonized, as a statute must be so construed as to harmonize and give effect to all its provisions whenever possible. Only after the failure at this attempt at reconciliation should one provision be considered the applicable provision as against the other.<br><br>Applying these rules by reconciling the two provisions under consideration, <b>Section 3, Rule 8 of the IRSC should be read as the general rule applicable to the inhibition of a Member-in-Charge.This general rule should, however, yield where the inhibition occurs at the late stage of the case when a decision or signed resolution is assailed through an MR</b>. At that point, when the situation calls for the <b><i>review of the merits</i></b> of the decision or the signed resolution made by a <i>ponente</i> (or writer of the assailed ruling), Section 3, Rule 8 no longer applies and must yield to <b>Section 7, Rule 2 of the IRSC which contemplates a situation when the <i>ponente</i> is no longer available, and calls for the referral of the case for raffle among the remaining Members of the Division who acted on the decision or on the signed resolution</b>. This latter provision should rightly apply as it gives those who intimately know the facts and merits of the case, through their previous participation and deliberations, the chance to take a look at the decision or resolution produced with their participation.<br><br>To reiterate, Section 3, Rule 8 of the IRSC is the general rule on inhibition, but it must yield to the more specific Section 7, Rule 2 of the IRSC where the obtaining situation is for the review <i>on the merits</i> of an already issued decision or resolution and the <i>ponente</i> or writer is no longer available to act on the matter. On this basis, the <i>ponente</i>, on the merits of the case on review, should be chosen from the remaining participating Justices, namely, Justices Peralta and Bersamin.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br></blockquote>This last resolution impelled FASAP to file the <i>Motion for Reconsideration [Re: The Honorable Court's Resolution dated 13 March 2012]</i>, praying that the September 7, 2011 resolution in G.R. No. 178083 be reinstated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>We directed the consolidation of G.R. No. 178083 and A.M.

that whether or not its supposed "stand-alone" rehabilitation indicated its ability to recover on its own was a technical issue that the SEC was tasked to determine in the rehabilitation proceedings; that at any rate, the supposed track to recovery in 1999 and the capital infusion of $200,000,000.00 did not disprove the enormous losses it was sustaining; that, on the contrary, the capital infusion accented the severe financial losses suffered because the capital infusion was a condition precedent to the approval of the amended and restated rehabilitation plan by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with the conformity of PAL's creditors; and that PAL took nine years to exit from rehabilitation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>As regards the implementation of the retrenchment program in good faith, PAL argues that it exercised sound management prerogatives and business judgment despite its critical financial condition; that it did not act in due haste in terminating the services of the affected employees considering that FASAP was being consulted thereon as early as February 17, 1998; that it abandoned "Plan 14" due to intervening events, and instead proceeded to implement "Plan 22" which led to the recall/rehire of some of the retrenched employees;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> and that in selecting the employees to be retrenched, it adopted a fair and reasonable criteria pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) where performance efficiency ratings and inverse seniority were basic considerations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>With reference to the Court's resolution of October 2, 2009, PAL maintains that:<br><blockquote><center>I<br></center><br>PAL HAS NOT CHANGED ITS POSITION THAT THE REDUCTION OF PAL'S LABOR FORCE OF ABOUT 5,000 EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING THE 1,423 FASAP MEMBERS, WAS THE RESULT OF A CONFLUENCE OF EVENTS, THE EXPANSION OF PAL'S FLEET, THE ASIAN FINANCIAL CRISIS OF 1997, AND ITS CONSEQUENCES ON PAL'S OPERATIONS, AND THE PILOT'S STRIKE OF JUNE 1998, AND THAT PAL SURVIVED BECAUSE OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ITS REHABILITATION PLAN (LATER "AMENDED AND RESTATED REHABILITATION PLAN") WHICH INCLUDED AMONG ITS COMPONENT ELEMENTS, THE REDUCTION OF LABOR FORCE<br><br><center>II<br></center><br>THE HONORABLE COURT SHOULD HAVE UPHELD PAL'S REDUCTION OF THE NUMBER OF CABIN CREW IN ACCORD WITH ITS ENTRY INTO REHABILITATION AND THE CONSEQUENT TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT OF CABIN CREW PERSONNEL AS A VALID EXERCISE OF MANAGEMENT PREROGATIVE<br><br><center>III<br></center><br>PAL HAS SUFFICIENTLY ESTABLISHED THE SEVERITY OF ITS FINANCIAL LOSSES, SO AS TO JUSTIFY THE ENTRY INTO REHABILITATION AND THE CONSEQUENT REDUCTION OF CABIN CREW PERSONNEL<br><br><center>IV<br></center><br>THE HONORABLE COURT ERRED IN HOLDING THAT THERE WAS NO SUFFICIENT BASIS FOR PAL TO IMPLEMENT THE RETRENCHMENT OF CABIN CREW PERSONNEL<br><br><center>V<br></center><br>UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE PRIOR IMPLEMENTATION OF LESS DRASTIC COST-CUTTING MEASURES WAS NO LONGER POSSIBLE AND SHOULD NOT BE REQUIRED FOR A VALID RETRENCHMENT;

It denies having changed its theory, however, and maintains that the reduction of its workforce had resulted from a confluence of several events, like the flight expansion; the 1997 Asian financial crisis; and the ALPAP pilots' strike.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> PAL explains that when the pilots struck in June 1998, it had to decide quickly as it was then facing closure in 18 days due to serious financial hemorrhage; hence, the strike came as the final blow. <br><br>PAL posits that its business decision to downsize was far from being a hasty, knee-jerk reaction; that the reduction of cabin crew personnel was an integral part of its corporate rehabilitation, and, such being a management decision, the Court could not supplant the decision with its own judgment' and that the inaccurate depiction of the strike as a temporary disturbance was lamentable in light of its imminent financial collapse due to the concerted action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>PAL submits that the Court's declaration that PAL failed to prove its financial losses and to explore less drastic cost-cutting measures did not at all jibe with the totality of the circumstances and evidence presented; that the consistent findings of the Labor Arbiter, the NLRC, the CA and even the SEC, acknowledging its serious financial difficulties could not be ignored or disregarded; and that the challenged rulings of the Court conflicted with the pronouncements made in <i>Garcia v.

Corona who later on inhibited from G.R. No. 178083 had further voided the proceedings; that the 1987 Constitution did not require that a case should be raffled to the Members of the Division who had previously decided it; and that there was no error in raffling the case to Justice Brion, or, even granting that there was error, such error was merely procedural.<br><br>The issues are restated as follows:<br><blockquote><center><b>Procedural</b><br></center><br><center>I<br></center><br>IS THE RESOLUTION DATED OCTOBER 4, 2011 IN A.M.

No. 11-10-1-SC for not citing any legal basis in recalling the September 7, 2011 resolution of the Second Division.<br><br>The urging of the petitioner is gravely flawed and mistaken.<br><br>The requirement for the Court to state the legal and factual basis for its decisions is found in Section 14, Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution, which reads:<br><blockquote>Section 14. <b>No decision</b> shall be rendered by any court without expressing therein clearly and distinctly the facts and the law on which it is based.<br></blockquote>The constitutional provision clearly indicates that it contemplates only a <i>decision</i>, which is the judgment or order that <i>adjudicates on the merits of a case</i>. This is clear from the text and tenor of Section 1, Rule 36 of the <i>Rules of Court</i>, the rule that implements the constitutional provision, to wit:<br><blockquote>Section 1. <i>Rendition of judgments and final orders</i>. <b>A judgment or final order determining the merits of the case</b> shall be in writing personally and directly prepared by the judge, <b>stating clearly and distinctly the facts and the law on which it is based</b>, signed by him, and filed with the clerk of court.<br></blockquote>The October 4, 2011 resolution did not adjudicate on the merits of G.R. No. 178083. We explicitly stated so in the resolution of March 13, 2012. What we thereby did was instead to exercise the Court's inherent power to recall orders and resolutions before they attain finality. In so doing, the Court only exercised prudence in order to ensure that the Second Division was vested with the appropriate legal competence in accordance with and under the Court's prevailing internal rules to review and resolve the pending motion for reconsideration. We rationalized the exercise thusly:<br><blockquote>As the narration in this Resolution shows, <b>the Court acted on its own pursuant to its power to recall its own orders and resolutions before their finality. The October 4, 2011 Resolution was issued to determine the propriety of the September 7, 2011 Resolution given the facts that came to light after the ruling Division's examination of the records. To point out the obvious, the recall was not a ruling on the merits and did not constitute the reversal of the substantive issues already decided upon by the Court in the FASAP case in its previously issued Decision (of July 22, 2008) and Resolution (of October 2, 2009)</b>. In short, the October 4, 2011 Resolution was not meant and was never intended to favor either party, but to simply remove any doubt about the validity of the ruling Division's action on the case. The case, in the ruling Division's view, could be brought to the Court <i>en banc</i> since it is one of "sufficient importance"; at the very least, it involves the interpretation of conflicting provisions of the IRSC with potential jurisdictional implications.<br><br>At the time the Members of the ruling Division went to the Chief Justice to recommend a recall, there was no clear indication of how they would definitively settle the unresolved legal questions among themselves. The only matter legally certain was the looming finality of the September 7, 2011 Resolution if it would not be immediately recalled by the Court <i>en banc</i> by October 4, 2011. No unanimity among the Members of the ruling Division could be gathered on the unresolved legal questions; thus, they concluded that the matter is best determined by the Court <i>en banc</i> as it potentially involved questions of jurisdiction and interpretation of conflicting provisions of the IRSC. To the extent of the recommended recall, the ruling Division was unanimous and the Members communicated this intent to the Chief Justice in clear and unequivocal terms.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> (Bold underscoring for emphasis)<br></blockquote>It should further be clear from the same March 13, 2012 resolution that the factual considerations for issuing the recall order were intentionally omitted therefrom in obeisance to the prohibition against public disclosure of the internal deliberations of the Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>Still, FASAP assails the impropriety of the recall of the September 7, 2011 resolution. It contends that the raffle of G.R. No. 178083 to the Second Division had not been erroneous but in "<i>full and complete consonance with Section 4(3) Article VIII of the Constitution</i>;"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> and that any error thereby committed was only procedural, and thus a mere "<i>harmless error</i>" that did not invalidate the prior rulings made in G.R. No. 178083.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>The contention of FASAP lacks substance and persuasion.<br><br>The Court carefully expounded in the March 13, 2012 resolution on the resulting jurisdictional conflict that arose from the raffling of G.R. No. 178083 resulting from the successive retirements and inhibitions by several Justices who at one time or another had been assigned to take part in the case. The Court likewise highlighted the importance of referring the case to the <i>remaining</i> Members who had actually participated in the deliberations, for not only did such participating Justices intimately know the facts and merits of the parties' arguments but doing so would give to such Justices the opportunity to review their decision or resolution in which they had taken part. As it turned out, only Justice Diosdado M. Peralta and Justice Lucas P. Bersamin were the <i>remaining</i> Members of the Special Third Division, and the task of being in charge procedurally fell on either of them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> As such, it is fallacious for FASAP to still insist that the previous raffle had complied with Section 4(3), Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution just because the Members of the Division actually took part in the deliberations.<br><br>FASAP is further wrong to insist on the application of the <i>harmless error</i> rule. The rule is embodied in Section 6, Rule 51 of the <i>Rules of Court</i>, which states:<br><blockquote>Section 6. <i>Harmless error</i>. No error in either the admission or the exclusion of evidence and no error or defect in any ruling or order or in anything done or omitted by the trial court or by any of the parties is ground for granting a new trial or for setting aside, modifying, or otherwise disturbing a judgment or order, unless refusal to take such action appears to the court inconsistent with substantial justice. The court at every stage of the proceedings must disregard any error or defect which does not affect the substantial rights of the parties.<br></blockquote>The <i>harmless error</i> rule obtains during review of the things done by either the trial court or by any of the parties themselves in the course of trial, and any error thereby found does not affect the substantial rights or even the merits of the case. The Court has had occasions to apply the rule in the correction of a misspelled name due to clerical error;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> the signing of the decedents' names in the notice of appeal by the heirs;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> the trial court's treatment of the testimony of the party as an adverse witness during cross­-examination by his own counsel;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> and the failure of the trial court to give the plaintiffs the opportunity to orally argue against a motion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> All of the errors extant in the mentioned situations did not have the effect of altering the dispositions rendered by the respective trial courts. Evidently, therefore, the rule had no appropriate application herein.<br><br>The Court sees no justification for the urging of FASAP that the participation of the late Chief Justice Corona voided the recall order. The urging derives from FASAP's failure to distinguish the role of the Chief Justice as the Presiding Officer of the <i>Banc</i>. In this regard, we advert to the March 13, 2012 resolution, where the Court made the following observation:<br><blockquote>A final point that needs to be fully clarified at this juncture, in light of the allegations of the Dissent is the role of the Chief Justice in the recall of the September 7, 2011 Resolution. <b>As can be seen from the xxx narration, the Chief Justice acted only on the recommendation of the ruling Division, since he had inhibited himself from participation in the case long before. The confusion on this matter could have been brought about by the Chief Justice's role as the Presiding Officer of the Court <i>en banc</i> (particularly in its meeting of October 4, 2011), and the fact that the four most senior Justices of the Court (namely, Justices Corona, Carpio, Velasco and Leonardo-De Castro) inhibited from participating in the case. In the absence of any clear personal malicious participation, it is neither correct nor proper to hold the Chief Justice personally accountable for the collegial ruling of the Court en banc.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> (Bold underscoring supplied for emphasis)<br></blockquote>To reiterate, the Court, whether sitting <i>En Banc</i> or in Division, acts as a collegial body. By virtue of the collegiality, the Chief Justice alone cannot promulgate or issue any decisions or orders. In <i>Complaint of Mr. Aurelio Indencia Arrienda Against SC Justices Puna, Kapunan, Pardo, Ynares­ Santiago</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> the Court has elucidated on the collegial nature of the Court in relation to the role of the Chief Justice, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>The complainant's vituperation against the Chief Justice on account of what he perceived was the latter's refusal "to take a direct positive and favorable action" on his letters of appeal overstepped the limits of proper conduct. It betrayed his lack of understanding of a fundamental principle in our system of laws. Although the Chief Justice is <i>primus inter pares</i>, he cannot legally decide a case on his own because of the Court's nature as a collegial body. Neither can the Chief Justice, by himself, overturn the decision of the Court, whether of a division or the <i>en banc</i>.<br><br>There is only one Supreme Court from whose decisions all other courts are required to take their bearings. While most of the Court's work is performed by its three divisions, the Court remains one court-single, unitary, complete and supreme. Flowing from this is the fact that, while individual justices may dissent or only partially concur, when the Court states what the law is, it speaks with only one voice. Any doctrine or principle of law laid down by the court may be modified or reversed only by the Court <i>en banc</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br></blockquote>Lastly, any lingering doubt on the validity of the recall order should be dispelled by the fact that the Court upheld its issuance of the order through the March 13, 2012 resolution, whereby the Court disposed:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, <b>we hereby confirm that the Court <i>en banc</i> has assumed jurisdiction over the resolution of the merits of the motions for reconsideration of Philippine Airlines, Inc., addressing our July 22, 2008 Decision and October 2, 2009 Resolution; and that the September 7, 2011 ruling of the Second Division has been effectively recalled</b>.

Although Section 2, Rule 52 of the <i>Rules of Court</i> disallows the filing of a second motion for reconsideration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> the <i>Internal Rules of the Supreme Court</i> (IRSC) allows an exception, to wit:<br><blockquote>Section 3. <i>Second motion for reconsideration</i>. The Court shall not entertain a second motion for reconsideration, and <b>any exception to this rule can only be granted in the higher interest of justice by the Court <i>en banc</i> upon a vote of at least two-thirds of its actual membership</b>. There is reconsideration "in the higher interest of justice" when the assailed decision is not only legally erroneous, but is likewise patently unjust and potentially capable of causing unwarranted and irremediable injury or damage to the parties. <b>A second motion for reconsideration can only be entertained before the ruling sought to be reconsidered becomes final by operation of law or by the Court's declaration.</b><br><br>In the Division, a vote of three Members shall be required to elevate a second motion for reconsideration to the Court en banc.<br></blockquote>The conditions that must concur in order for the Court to entertain a second motion for reconsideration are the following, namely:<br><blockquote><ol><li>The motion should satisfactorily explain why granting the same would be in the higher interest of justice;<br><br></li><li>The motion must be made before the ruling sought to be reconsidered attains finality;<br><br></li><li>If the ruling sought to be reconsidered was rendered by the Court through one of its Divisions, at least three members of the Division should vote to elevate the case to the Court <i>En Banc</i>; and<br><br></li><li>The favorable vote of at least two-thirds of the Court <i>En Banc</i>'s actual membership must be mustered for the second motion for reconsideration to be granted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote>Under the IRSC, a second motion for reconsideration may be allowed to prosper upon a showing by the movant that a reconsideration of the previous ruling is necessary in the higher interest of justice.

It cannot be gainsaid that there were other businesses undergoing rehabilitation that would also be bound or negatively affected by the July 22, 2008 decision. This was the higher interest of justice that the Court sought to address, which the dissent by Justice Leonen is adamant not to accept.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> Hence, we deemed it just and prudent to allow PAL's <i>Second Motion for Reconsideration of the Decision of July 22, 2008</i>.<br><br>It is timely to note, too, that the July 22, 2008 decision did not yet attain finality. The October 4, 2011 resolution recalled the September 7, 2011 resolution denying PAL's first motion for reconsideration. Consequently, the July 22, 2008 decision did not attain finality.<br><br>The dissent by Justice Leonen nonetheless proposes a contrary view that both the July 22, 2008 decision and the October 2, 2009 resolution had become final on November 4, 2009 upon the lapse of 15 days following PAL's receipt of a copy of the resolution. To him, the grant of leave to PAL to file the second motion for reconsideration only meant that the motion was no longer prohibited but it did not stay the running of the reglementary period of 15 days. He submits that the Court's grant of the motion for leave to file the second motion for reconsideration did not stop the October 2, 2009 resolution from becoming final because a judgment becomes final by operation of law, not by judicial declaration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>The proposition of the dissent is unacceptable.<br><br>In granting the motion for leave to file the second motion for reconsideration, the Court could not have intended to deceive the movants by allowing them to revel in some hollow victory. The proposition manifestly contravened the basic tenets of justice and fairness.<br><br>As we see it, the dissent must have inadvertently ignored the procedural effect that a second motion for reconsideration based on an allowable ground <i>suspended</i> the running of the period for appeal from the date of the filing of the motion until such time that the same was acted upon and granted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> Correspondingly, granting the motion for leave to file a second motion for reconsideration has the effect of <i>preventing</i> the challenged decision from attaining finality. This is the reason why the second motion for reconsideration should present extraordinarily persuasive reasons. Indeed, allowing <i>pro forma</i> motions would indefinitely avoid the assailed judgment from attaining finality.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>By granting PAL's motion for leave to file a second motion for reconsideration, the Court effectively averted the July 22, 2008 decision and the October 2, 2009 resolution from attaining finality. Worthy of reiteration, too, is that the March 13, 2012 resolution expressly recalled the September 7, 2011 resolution.<br><br>Given the foregoing, the conclusion stated in the dissent that the Banc was divested of the jurisdiction to entertain the second motion for reconsideration for being a "third motion for reconsideration;"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> and the unfair remark in the dissent that "<i>[t]he basis of the supposed residual power of the Court En Banc to, take on its own, take cognizance of Division cases is therefore suspect</i>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> are immediately rejected as absolutely legally and factually unfounded.<br><br>To start with, there was no "third motion for reconsideration" to speak of. The September 11, 2011 resolution denying PAL's second motion for reconsideration had been recalled by the October 4, 2011 resolution. Hence, PAL's motion for reconsideration remained unresolved, negating the assertion of the dissent that the Court was resolving the second motion for reconsideration "for the second time."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>Also, the dissent takes issue against our having assumed jurisdiction over G.R. No. 178083 despite the clear reference made in the October 4, 2011 resolution to Sections 3(m) and (n), Rule 2 of the IRSC. Relying largely on the Court's construction of Section 4(3), Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution in <i>Fortich v.

Corona</i>, which has expounded on the authority of the Banc to accept cases from the Divisions, is still the prevailing jurisprudence regarding the construction of Section 4(3), Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution. However, <i>Fortich v. Corona</i> does not apply herein. It is notable that <i>Fortich v. Corona</i> sprung from the results of the voting on the motion for reconsideration filed by the Sumilao Farmers. The vote ended in an equally divided Division ("two-two"). From there, the Sumilao Farmers sought to elevate the matter to the <i>Banc</i> based on Section 4(3), Article VIII because the required three-member majority vote was not reached. However, the factual milieu in <i>Fortich v. Corona</i> is not on all fours with that in this case.<br><br>In the March 13, 2012 resolution, the Court recounted the exigencies that had prompted the <i>Banc</i> to take cognizance of the matter, to wit:<br><blockquote>On September 28, 2011, the Letters dated September 13 and 20, 2011 of Atty. Mendoza to Atty. Vidal (asking that his inquiry be referred to the relevant Division Members who took part on the September 7, 2011 Resolution) were "NOTED" by the regular Second Division. The Members of the ruling Division also met to consider the queries posed by Atty. Mendoza. Justice Brion met with the Members of the ruling Division (composed of Justices Brion, Peralta, Perez, Bersamin, and Mendoza), rather than with the regular Second Division (composed of Justices Carpio, Brion, Perez, and Sereno), as the former were the active participants in the September 7, 2011 Resolution.<br><br>In these meetings, some of the Members of the ruling Division saw the problems pointed out above, some of which indicated that the ruling Division might have had no authority to rule on the case. Specifically, their discussions centered on the application of A.M. No. 99-8-09-SC for the incidents that transpired prior to the effectivity of the IRSC, and on the conflicting rules under the IRSC - Section 3, Rule 8 on the effects of inhibition and Section 7, Rule 2 on the resolution of MRs.<br><br>A.M. No. 99-8-09-SC indicated the general rule that the re-raffle shall be made among the other Members of the same Division who participated in rendering the decision or resolution and who concurred therein, which should now apply because the ruling on the case is no longer final after the cast had been opened for review on the merits. In other words, after acceptance by the Third Division, through Justice Velasco, of the 2nd MR, there should have been a referral to raffle because the excepting qualification that the Clerk of Court cited no longer applied; what was being reviewed were the merits of the case and the review should be by the same Justices who had originally issued the original Decision and the subsequent Resolution, or by whoever of these Justices are still left in the Court, pursuant to the same A.M. No. 99-8-09-SC.<br><br>On the other hand, the raffle to Justice Brion was made by applying AC No. 84-2007 that had been superseded by Section 3, Rule 8 of the IRSC. Even the use of this IRSC provision, however, would not solve the problem, as its use still raised the question of the provision that should really apply in the resolution of the MR: should it be Section 3, Rule 8 on the inhibition of a Member-in-Charge, or Section 7, Rule 2 of the IRSC on the inhibition of the <i>ponente</i> when an MR of a decision and a signed resolution was filed. xxx<br><br><center>xxxx&nbsp; xxxx&nbsp; xxxx<br></center><br>A comparison of these two provisions shows the semantic sources of the seeming conflict: Section 7, Rule 2 refers to a situation where the <i>ponente</i> has retired, is no longer a Member of the Court, is disqualified, or has inhibited himself from acting on the case; while Section 3, Rule 8 generally refers to the inhibition of a Member-in-Charge who does not need to be the writer of the decision or resolution under review.<br><br>Significantly, Section 7, Rule 2 expressly uses the word <i>ponente</i> (not Member-in-Charge) and refers to a specific situation where the <i>ponente</i> (or the writer of the Decision or the Resolution) is no longer with the Court or is otherwise unavailable to review the decision or resolution he or she wrote. Section 3, Rule 8, on the other hand, expressly uses the term Member-in-Charge and generally refers to his or her inhibition, without reference to the stage of the proceeding when the inhibition is made.<br><br>Under Section 7, Rule 2, the case should have been re-raffled and assigned to anyone of Justices Nachura (who did not retire until June 13, 2011), Peralta, or Bersamin, either (1) after the acceptance of the 2nd MR (because the original rulings were no longer final); or (2) after Justice Velasco's inhibition because the same condition existed, <i>i.e.</i>, the need for a review by the same Justices who rendered the decision or resolution. As previously mentioned, Justice Nachura participated in both the original Decision and the subsequent Resolution, and all three Justices were the remaining Members who voted on the October 2, 2009 Resolution. On the other hand, if Section 3, Rule 8 were to be solely applied after Justice Velasco's inhibition, the Clerk of Court would be correct in her assessment and the raffle to Justice Brion, as a Member outside of Justice Velasco's Division, was correct.<br><br>These were the legal considerations that largely confronted the ruling Division in late September 2011 when it deliberated on what to do with Atty. Mendoza's letters.<br><br>The propriety of and grounds for the recall of the September 7, 2011 Resolution<br><br>Most unfortunately, the above unresolved questions were even further compounded in the course of the deliberations of the Members of the ruling Division when they were informed that the parties received the ruling on September 19, 2011, and this ruling would lapse to finality after the 15th day, or after October 4, 2011.<br><br>Thus, on September 30, 2011 (a Friday), the Members went to Chief Justice Corona and recommended, as a prudent move, that the September 7, 2011 Resolution be recalled at the very latest on October 4, 2011, and that the case be referred to the Court <i>en banc</i> for a ruling on the questions Atty. Mendoza asked. The consequence, of course, of a failure to recall their ruling was for that Resolution to lapse to finality. After finality, any recall for lack of jurisdiction of the ruling Division might not be understood by the parties and could lead to a charge of flip-flopping against the Court. The basis for the referral is Section 3(n), Rule 2 of the IRSC, which provides:<br><br><center>RULE 2. <br><br>OPERATING STRUCTURES</center><blockquote>Section 3. <i>Court en banc matters and cases.</i> - The Court <i>en banc</i> shall act on the following matters and cases:<br><br>xxxx<br><br>(n) cases that the Court <i>en banc</i> deems of sufficient importance to merit its attention[.]<br></blockquote>Ruling positively, the Court en banc duly issued its disputed October 4, 2011 Resolution recalling the September 7, 2011 Resolution and ordering the re-raffle of the case to a new Member-in-Charge. Later in the day, the Court received PAL's Motion to Vacate (the September 7, 2011 ruling) dated October 3, 2011. This was followed by FASAP's MR dated October 17, 2011 addressing the Court Resolution of October 4, 2011. The FASAP MR mainly invoked the violation of its right to due process as the recall arose from the Court's <i>ex parte</i> consideration of mere letters from one of the counsels of the parties.<br><br>As the narration in this Resolution shows, the Court acted on its own pursuant to its power to recall its own orders and resolutions before their finality. The October 4, 2011 Resolution was issued to determine the propriety of the September 7, 2011 Resolution given the facts that came to light after the ruling Division's examination of the records. To point out the obvious, the recall was not a ruling on the merits and did not constitute the reversal of the substantive issues already decided upon by the Court in the FASAP case in its previously issued Decision (of July 22, 2008) and Resolution (of October 2, 2009). In short, the October 4, 2011 Resolution was not meant and was never intended to favor either party, but to simply remove any doubt about the validity of the ruling Division's action on the case. The case, in the ruling Division's view, could be brought to the Court <i>en banc</i> since it is one of "sufficient importance"; at the very least, it involves the interpretation of conflicting provisions of the IRSC with potential jurisdictional implications.<br><br>At the time the Members of the ruling Division went to the Chief Justice to recommend a recall, there was no clear indication of how they would definitively settle the unresolved legal questions among themselves. The only matter legally certain was the looming finality of the September 7, 2011 Resolution if it would not be immediately recalled by the Court <i>en banc</i> by October 4, 2011. No unanimity among the Members of the ruling Division could be gathered on the unresolved legal questions; thus, they concluded that the matter is best determined by the Court <i>en banc</i> as it potentially involved questions of jurisdiction and interpretation of conflicting provisions of the IRSC. To the extent of the recommended recall, the ruling Division was unanimous and the Members communicated this intent to the Chief Justice in clear and unequivocal terms.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> (Bold scoring supplied for emphasis)<br></blockquote>It is well to stress that the <i>Banc</i> could not have assumed jurisdiction were it not for the initiative of Justice Arturo V. Brion who consulted the Members of the ruling Division as well as Chief Justice Corona regarding the jurisdictional implications of the successive retirements, transfers, and inhibitions by the Members of the ruling Division. This move by Justice Brion led to the referral of the case to the <i>Banc</i> in accordance with Section 3(1), Rule 2 of the IRSC that provided, among others, that <i>any Member</i> of the Division could request the Court <i>En Banc</i> to take cognizance of cases that fell under paragraph (m). This referral by the ruling Division became the basis for the <i>Banc</i> to issue its October 4, 2011 resolution.<br><br>For sure, the <i>Banc</i>, by assuming jurisdiction over the case, did not seek to act as appellate body in relation to the acts of the ruling Division, contrary to the dissent's position.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> The Banc's recall of the resolution of September 7, 2011 should not be so characterized, considering that the <i>Banc</i> did not thereby rule on the merits of the case, and did not thereby reverse the July 22, 2008 decision and the October 2, 2009 resolution. The referral of the case to the <i>Banc</i> was done to address the conflict among the provisions of the IRSC that had potential jurisdictional implications on the ruling made by the Second Division.<br><br>At any rate, PAL constantly raised in its motions for reconsideration that the ruling Division had seriously erred not only in ignoring the consistent findings about its precarious financial situation by the Labor Arbiter, the NLRC, the CA and the SEC, but also in disregarding the pronouncements by the Court of its serious fiscal condition. To be clear, because the serious challenge by PAL against the ruling of the Third Division was anchored on the Third Division's having ignored or reversed settled doctrines or principles of law, only the <i>Banc</i> could assume jurisdiction and decide to either affirm, reverse or modify the earlier decision. The rationale for this arrangement has been expressed in <i>Lu v. Lu Ym</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> thuswise:<br><blockquote>It is argued that the assailed Resolutions in the present cases have already become final, since a <i>second</i> motion for reconsideration is prohibited except for extraordinarily persuasive reasons and only upon express leave first obtained; and that once a judgment attains finality, it thereby becomes immutable and unalterable, however unjust the result of error may appear.<br><br>The contention, however, misses an important point. The doctrine of <i>immutability of decisions</i> applies only to <u>final and executory decisions</u>. Since the present cases may involve a modification or reversal of a Court­-ordained doctrine or principle, the judgment rendered by the Special Third Division may be considered unconstitutional, hence, it can never become final. It finds mooring in the deliberations of the framers of the Constitution:<br><blockquote>On proposed Section 3(4), Commissioner Natividad asked what the effect would be of a decision that violates the proviso that "no doctrine or principle of law laid down by the court in a decision rendered <i>en banc</i> or in division may be modified or reversed except by the court <i>en banc</i>." The answer given was that <b>such a decision would be invalid</b>. Following up, Father Bernas asked <u>whether the decision, if not challenged, could become final and binding at least on the parties</u>. Romulo answered that, <u><b>since such a decision would be <u>in excess of jurisdiction</u>, the decision on the case could be <u>reopened anytime</u></b></u>.

No. 178083 in view of FASAP's admission of PAL having sustained serious losses; and that PAL's having been placed under rehabilitation sufficiently indicated the financial distress that it was suffering.<br><br>It is quite notable that the matter of PAL's financial distress had originated from the complaint filed by FASAP whereby it raised the sole issue of "<i>Whether or not respondents committed Unfair Labor Practice</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> FASAP believed that PAL, in terminating the 1,400 cabin crew members, had violated Section 23, Article VII and Section 31, Article IX of the 1995-2000 PAL-FASAP CBA. Interestingly, FASAP averred in its position paper therein that it was not opposed to the retrenchment program because it understood PAL's financial troubles; and that it was only questioning the <i>manner and lack of standard</i> in carrying out the retrenchment, thus:<br><blockquote>At the outset, it must be pointed out that complainant was never opposed to the retrenchment program itself, as it understands respondent PAL's financial troubles. In fact, complainant religiously cooperated with respondents in their quest for a workable solution to the company-­threatening problem. Attached herewith as Annexes "A" to "D" are the minutes of its meetings with respondent PAL's representatives showing complainant's active participation in the deliberations on the issue.<br><br>What complainant vehemently objects to are the manner and the lack of criteria or standard by which the retrenchment program was implemented or carried out, despite the fact that there are available criteria or standard that respondents could have utilized or relied on in reducing its workforce. In adopting a retrenchment program that was fashioned after the evil prejudices and personal biases of respondent Patria Chiong, respondent PAL grossly violated at least two important provisions of its CBA with complainant - Article VII, Section 23 and Article IX, Sections 31 and 32.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup><br></blockquote>These foregoing averments of FASAP were echoed in its reply<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> and memorandum<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> submitted to the Labor Arbiter.<br><br>Evidently, FASAP's express recognition of PAL's grave financial situation meant that such situation no longer needed to be proved, the same having become a judicial admission<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> in the context of the issues between the parties. As a rule, indeed, admissions made by parties in the pleadings, or in the course of the trial or other proceedings in the same case are conclusive, and do not require further evidence to prove them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> By FASAP's admission of PAL's severe financial woes, PAL was relieved of its burden to prove its dire financial condition to justify the retrenchment. Thusly, PAL should not be taken to task for the non-submission of its audited financial statements in the early part of the proceedings inasmuch as the non-submission had been rendered irrelevant.<br><br>Yet, the July 22, 2008 decision ignored the judicial admission and unfairly focused on the lack of evidence of PAL's financial losses. The Special Third Division should have realized that PAL had been discharged of its duty to prove its precarious fiscal situation in the face of FASAP's admission of such situation. Indeed, PAL did not have to submit the audited financial statements because its being in financial distress was not in issue at all.<br><br>Nonetheless, the dissent still insists that PAL should be faulted for failing to prove its substantial business losses, and even referred to several decisions of the Court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> wherein the employers had purportedly established their serious business losses as a requirement for a valid retrenchment.<br><br>Unfortunately, the cases cited by the dissent obviously had no application herein because they originated from either simple complaints of illegal retrenchment, or unfair labor practice, or additional separation pay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup><br><br><i>LVN Pictures</i> originated from a complaint for unfair labor practice (ULP) based on Republic Act No. 874 (<i>Industrial Peace Act</i>). The allegations in the complaint concerned interference, discrimination and refusal to bargain collectively. The Court pronounced therein that the employer (LVN Pictures) did not resort to ULP because it was able to justify its termination, closure and eventual refusal to bargain collectively through the financial statements showing that it continually incurred serious financial losses. Notably, the Court did not interfere with the closure and instead recognized LVN's management prerogative to close its business and dismiss its employees.<br><br><i>North Davao Mining</i> was a peculiar case, arising from a complaint for additional separation pay, among others. The Court therein held that separation pay was not required if the reason for the termination was due to serious business losses. It clarified that Article 283 (now Art. 298) governed payment of separation benefits in case of closure of business not due to serious business losses. When the reason for the closure was serious business losses, the employer shall not be required to grant separation pay to the terminated employees.<br><br>In <i>Manatad</i>, the complaint for illegal dismissal was based on the allegation that the retrenchment program was illegal because the employer was gaining profits. Hence, the core issue revolved around the existence (or absence) of grave financial losses that would justify retrenchment.<br><br>In the cited cases, the employers had to establish that they were incurring serious business losses because it was the very issue, if not intricately related to the main issue presented in the original complaints. In contrast, the sole issue herein as presented by FASAP to the Labor Arbiter was the "manner of retrenchment," not the basis for retrenchment. FASAP itself, in representation of the retrenched employees, had admitted in its position paper, as well as in its reply and memorandum submitted to the Labor Arbiter the fact of serious financial losses hounding PAL. In reality, PAL was not remiss by not proving serious business losses. FASAP's admission of PAL's financial distress already established the latter's precarious financial state.<br><br><b>Judicial notice could be taken of the financial losses incurred; the presentation of audited financial statements was not required in such circumstances</b><br><br>The July 22, 2008 decision recognized that PAL underwent corporate rehabilitation. In seeming inconsistency, however, the Special Third Division refused to accept that PAL had incurred serious financial losses, observing thusly:<br><blockquote><b>The audited financial statements should be presented before the Labor Arbiter who is in the position to evaluate evidence.</b> They may not be submitted belatedly with the Court of Appeals, because the admission of evidence is outside the sphere of the appellate court's certiorari jurisdiction. Neither can this Court admit in evidence audited financial statements, or make a ruling on the question of whether the employer incurred substantial losses justifying retrenchment on the basis thereof, as this Court is not a trier of facts. Even so, this Court may not be compelled to accept the contents of said documents blindly and without thinking.<br><br>xxxx<br><br>In the instant case, PAL failed to substantiate its claim of actual and imminent substantial losses which would justify the retrenchment of more than 1,400 of its cabin crew personnel. <b>Although the Philippine economy was gravely affected by the Asian financial crisis, however, it cannot be assumed that it has likewise brought PAL to the brink of bankruptcy.

Incidentally, the SEC's order of approval came a week after PAL had sent out notices of termination to the affected employees. It is thus difficult to ignore the fact that PAL had then been experiencing difficulty in meeting its financial obligations long before its rehabilitation.<br><br>Moreover, the fact that airline operations were capital intensive but earnings were volatile because of their vulnerability to economic recession, among others.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> The Asian financial crisis in 1997 had wrought havoc among the Asian air carriers, PAL included.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> The peculiarities existing in the airline business made it easier to believe that at the time of the Asian financial crisis, PAL incurred liabilities amounting to P90,642,933,919.00, which were way beyond the value of its assets that then only stood at P85,109,075,351.<br><br>Also, the Court cannot be blind and indifferent to current events affecting the society<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> and the country's economy,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> but must take them into serious consideration in its adjudication of pending cases. In that regard, Section 2, Rule 129 of the <i>Rules of Court</i> recognizes that the courts have discretionary authority to take judicial notice of matters that are of public knowledge, or are capable of unquestionable demonstration, or ought to be known to judges because of their judicial functions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup> The principle is based on convenience and expediency in securing and introducing evidence on matters that are not ordinarily capable of dispute and are not <i>bona fide</i> disputed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup><br><br>Indeed, the Labor Arbiter properly took cognizance of PAL's substantial financial losses during the Asian financial crisis of 1997.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup> On its part, the NLRC recognized the grave financial distress of PAL based on its ongoing rehabilitation/receivership.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup> The CA likewise found that PAL had implemented a retrenchment program to counter its tremendous business losses that the strikes of the pilot's union had aggravated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup> Such recognitions could not be justly ignored or denied, especially after PAL's financial and operational difficulties had attracted so much public attention that even President Estrada had to intervene in order to save PAL as the country's flag carrier.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup><br><br>The Special Third Division also observed that PAL had submitted a "stand-alone" rehabilitation program that was viewed as an acknowledgment that it could "undertake recovery on its own and that it possessed enough resources to weather the financial storm." The observation was unfounded considering that PAL had been constrained to submit the "stand-alone" rehabilitation plan on December 7, 1998 because of the lack of a strategic partner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup><br><br>We emphasize, too, that the presentation of the audited financial statements should not the sole means by which to establish the employer's serious financial losses. The presentation of audited financial statements, although convenient in proving the unilateral claim of financial losses, is not required for all cases of retrenchment. The evidence required for each case of retrenchment really depends on the particular circumstances obtaining. The Court has cogently opined in that regard:<br><blockquote>That petitioners were not able to present financial statements for years prior to 2005 should not be automatically taken against them. Petitioner BEMI was organized and registered as a corporation in 2004 and started business operations in 2005 only. <b>While financial statements for previous years may be material in establishing the financial trend for an employer, these are not indispensable in all cases of retrenchment. The evidence required for each case of retrenchment will still depend on its particular circumstances.</b> In fact, in <i>Revidad v. National Labor Relations Commission</i>, the Court declared that <b>"proof of actual financial losses incurred by the company is not a condition <i>sine qua non</i> for retrenchment," and retrenchment may be undertaken by the employer to prevent even future losses</b>:<br><blockquote>In its ordinary connotation, the phrase "to prevent losses" means that retrenchment or termination of the services of some employees is authorized to be undertaken by the employer sometime before the anticipated losses are actually sustained or realized. It is not, in other words, the intention of the lawmaker to compel the employer to stay his hand and keep all his employees until after losses shall have in fact materialized. If such an intent were expressly written into the law, that law may well be vulnerable to constitutional attack as unduly taking property from one man to be given to another.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup> (Bold underscoring supplied for emphasis)<br></blockquote></blockquote>In short, to require a distressed corporation placed under rehabilitation or receivership to still submit its audited financial statements may become unnecessary or superfluous.<br><br>Under P.D. No. 902-A, the SEC was empowered during rehabilitation proceedings to thoroughly review the corporate and financial documents submitted by PAL. Hence, by the time when the SEC ordered PAL's rehabilitation, suspension of payments and receivership, the SEC had already ascertained PAL's serious financial condition, and the clear and imminent danger of its losing its corporate assets. To require PAL in the proceedings below to still prove its financial losses would only trivialize the SEC's order and proceedings. That would be unfortunate because we should not ignore that the SEC was then the competent authority to determine whether or not a corporation experienced serious financial losses. Hence, the SEC's order- presented as evidence in the proceedings below - sufficiently established PAL's grave financial status.<br><br>Finally, PAL argues that the Special Third Division should not have deviated from the pronouncements made in <i>Garcia v. Philippine Airlines, Inc., Philippine Airlines, Inc. v. Kurangking, Philippine Airlines v. Court of Appeals, Philippine Airlines v. Zamora, Philippine Airlines v. PALEA, and Philippine Airlines v. National Labor Relations Commission</i>, all of which judicially recognized PAL's dire financial condition.<br><br>The argument of PAL is valid and tenable.<br><br><i>Garcia v. Philippine Airlines, Inc.</i> discussed the unlikelihood of reinstatement pending appeal because PAL had been placed under corporate rehabilitation, explaining that unlike the ground of substantial losses contemplated in a retrenchment case, the state of corporate rehabilitation was judicially pre-determined by a competent court and not formulated for the first time by the employer, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>While reinstatement pending appeal aims to avert the continuing threat or danger to the survival or even the life of the dismissed employee and his family, it does not contemplate the period when the employer­-corporation itself is similarly in a <i>judicially monitored</i> state of being resuscitated in order to survive.<br><br>The parallelism between a judicial order of corporation rehabilitation as a justification for the non-exercise of its options, on the one hand, and a claim of actual and imminent substantial losses as ground for retrenchment, on the other hand, stops at the red line on the financial statements. Beyond the analogous condition of financial gloom, as discussed by Justice Leonardo Quisumbing in his Separate Opinion, are more salient distinctions. Unlike the ground of substantial losses contemplated in a retrenchment case, the state of corporate rehabilitation was judicially pre-determined by a competent court and not formulated for the first time in this case by respondent.<br><br>More importantly, there are legal effects arising from a judicial order placing a corporation under rehabilitation. Respondent was, during the period material to the case, effectively deprived of the alternative choices under Article 223 of the Labor Code, not only by virtue of the statutory injunction but also in view of the interim relinquishment of management control to give way to the full exercise of the powers of the rehabilitation receiver. Had there been no need to rehabilitate, respondent may have opted for actual physical reinstatement pending appeal to optimize the utilization of resources. Then again, though the management may think this Wise, the rehabilitation receiver may decide otherwise, not to mention the subsistence of the injunction on claims.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup><br></blockquote>In <i>Philippine Airlines v. Kurangking, Philippine Airlines v. Court of Appeals, Philippine Airlines v. PALEA and Philippine Airlines v. National Labor Relations Commission</i>, the Court uniformly upheld the suspension of monetary claims against PAL because of the SEC's order placing it under receivership. The Court emphasized the need to suspend the payment of the claims pending the rehabilitation proceedings in order to enable the management committee/receiver to channel the efforts towards restructuring and rehabilitation. <i>Philippine Airlines v. Zamora</i> reiterated this rule and deferred to the prior judicial notice taken by the Court in suspending the monetary claims of illegally dismissed employees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup><br><br>Through these rulings, the Court consistently recognized PAL's financial troubles while undergoing rehabilitation and suspension of payments. Considering that the ruling related to conditions and circumstances that had occurred during the same period as those obtaining in G.R. No. 178083, the Court cannot take a different view.<br><br>It is also proper to indicate that the Court decided the other cases long before the promulgation of the assailed July 22, 2008 decision. Hence, the Special Third Division should not have regarded the financial losses as an issue that still required determination. Instead, it should have just simply taken judicial notice of the serious financial losses being suffered by PAL.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup> To still rule that PAL still did not prove such losses certainly conflicted with the antecedent judicial pronouncements about PAL's dire financial state.<br><br>As such, we cannot fathom the insistence by the dissent that the Court had not taken judicial notice but merely "recognized" that PAL was under corporate rehabilitation. Judicial notice is the cognizance of certain facts that judges may properly take and act on without proof because they already know them. It is the manner of recognizing and acknowledging facts that no longer need to be proved in court. In other words, when the Court "recognizes" a fact, it inevitably takes judicial notice of it.<br><br>For sure, it would not have been the first time that the Court would have taken judicial notice of the findings of the SEC and of antecedent jurisprudence recognizing the fact of rehabilitation by the employer.

Retrenchment is one of the economic grounds to dismiss employees, which is resorted to by an employer primarily to avoid or minimize business losses. The law recognize this under Article 283 of the Labor Code xxx<br><br>xxxx<br><br>In its ordinary connotation, the phrase "to prevent losses" means that retrenchment or termination of the services of some employees is authorized to be undertaken by the employer sometime before the anticipated losses are, actually sustained or realized. It is not, in other words, the intention of the lawmaker to compel the employer to stay his hand and keep all his employees until after losses shall have in fact materialized. If such an intent were expressly written into the law, that law may well be vulnerable to constitutional attack as unduly taking property from one man to be given to another.<br><br>At the other end of the spectrum, it seems equally clear that not every asserted possibility of loss is sufficient legal warrant for the reduction of personnel. In the nature of things, the possibility of incurring the losses is constantly present, in greater or lesser degree, in the carrying on of business operations, since some, indeed many, of the factors which impact upon the profitability or viability of such operations may be substantially outside the control of the employer.<br><br>On the bases of these consideration, it follows that the employer bears the burden to prove his allegation of economic or business reverses with clear and satisfactory evidence, it being in the nature of an affirmative defense.

Such observations sufficed to show that retrenchment became a last resort, and was not the rash and impulsive decision that FASAP would make it out to be now.<br><br>As between maintaining the number of its flight crew and PAL's survival, it was reasonable for PAL to choose the latter alternative. This Court cannot legitimately force PAL as a distressed employer to maintain its manpower despite its dire financial condition.

PAL's compliance with the basic requirements under Article 298 of the Labor Code prior to laying-off its affected employees.

Its finances were improving and additional planes were flying. Because of the Company's steady recovery, necessity dictated more employees to man and service the additional planes and flights. Thus, instead of taking in new hires, the Company first offered employment to employees who were previously retrenched. A recall/rehire plan was initiated.<br><br>The recall/rehire plan was a success. A majority of retrenched employees were recalled/rehired and went back to work including the members of petitioner union. In the process of recall/rehire, many employees who could not be recalled for various reasons (such as, among others, being unfit for the job or the employee simply did not want to work for the Company anymore) decided to accept separation benefits and executed, willingly and voluntarily, valid quitclaims. Those who received separation packages included a good number of the members of the petitioner union.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[133]</sup><br></blockquote>Contrary to the statement in the dissent that the implementation of Plan 22 instead of Plan 14 indicated bad faith,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[134]</sup> PAL reasonably demonstrated that the recall was devoid of bad faith or of an attempt on its part to circumvent its affected employees' right to security of tenure. Far from being tainted with bad faith, the recall signified PAL's reluctance to part with the retrenched employees. Indeed, the prevailing unfavorable conditions had only compelled it to implement the retrenchment.<br><br>The rehiring of previously retrenched employees should not invalidate a retrenchment program, the rehiring being an exercise of the employer's right to continue its business. Thus, we pointed out in one case:<br><blockquote>We likewise cannot sustain petitioners' argument that their dismissal was illegal on the basis that Lapanday did not actually cease its operation, or that they have rehired some of the dismissed employees and even hired new set of employees to replace the retrenched employees.<br><br>The law acknowledges the right of every business entity to reduce its workforce if such measure is made necessary or compelled by economic factors that would otherwise endanger its stability or existence. In exercising its right to retrench employees, the firm may choose to close all, or a part of, its business to avoid further losses or mitigate expenses. In <i>Caffco International Limited v. Office of the Minister-Ministry of Labor and Employment</i>, the Court has aptly observed that -<br><blockquote>Business enterprises today are faced with the pressures of economic recession, stiff competition, and labor unrest. Thus, businessmen are always pressured to adopt certain changes and programs in order to enhance their profits and protect their investments. Such changes may take various forms. Management may even choose to close a branch, a department, a plant, or a shop.<br></blockquote>In the same manner, when Lapanday continued its business operation and eventually hired some of its retrenched employees and new employees, it was merely exercising its right to continue its business. The fact that Lapanday chose to continue its business does not automatically make the retrenchment illegal. We reiterate that in retrenchment, the goal is to prevent impending losses or further business reversals - it therefore does not require that there is an actual closure of the business. Thus, when the employer satisfactorily proved economic or business losses with sufficient supporting evidence and have complied with the requirements mandated under the law to justify retrenchment, as in this case, it cannot be said that the subsequent acts of the employer to rehire the retrenched employees or to hire new employees constitute bad faith. It could have been different if from the beginning the retrenchment was illegal and the employer subsequently hired new employees or rehired some of the previously dismissed employees because that would have constituted bad faith. Consequently, when Lapanday continued its operation, it was merely exercising its prerogative to streamline its operations, and to rehire or hire only those who are qualified to replace the services rendered by the retrenched employees in order to effect more economic and efficient methods of production and to forestall business losses. The rehiring or reemployment of retrenched employees does not necessarily negate the presence or imminence of losses which prompted Lapanday to retrench.<br><br>In spite of overwhelming support granted by the social justice provisions of our Constitution in favor of labor, the fundamental law itself guarantees, even during the process of tilting the scales of social justice towards workers and employees, "the right of enterprises to reasonable returns of investment and to expansion and growth." To hold otherwise would not only be oppressive and inhuman, but also counter-productive and ultimately subversive of the nation's thrust towards a resurgence in our economy which would ultimately benefit the majority of our people. Where appropriate and where conditions are in accord with law and jurisprudence, the Court has authorized valid reductions in the workforce to forestall business losses, the hemorrhaging of capital, or even to recognize an obvious reduction in the volume of business which has rendered certain employees redundant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[135]</sup><br></blockquote>Consequently, we cannot pass judgment on the motive behind PAL's initiative to implement "Plan 22" instead of "Plan 14." The prerogative thereon belonged to the management alone due to its being in the best position to assess its own financial situation and operate its own business. Even the Court has no power to interfere with such exercise of the prerogative.<br><br><center><b>C<br><br>PAL used fair and reasonable criteria in selecting the employees to be retrenched pursuant to the CBA</b><br></center><br>The July 22, 2008 decision agreed with the holding by the CA that PAL was not obligated to consult with FASAP on the standards to be used in evaluating the performance of its employees. Nonetheless, PAL was found to be unfair and unreasonable in selecting the employees to be retrenched by doing away with the concept of seniority, loyalty, and past efficiency by solely relying on the employees' 1997 performance rating; and that the retrenchment of employees due to "other reasons," without any details or specifications, was not allowed and had no basis in fact and in law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[136]</sup><br><br>PAL contends that it used fair and reasonable criteria in accord with Sections 23, 30 and 112 of the 1995-2000 CBA;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[137]</sup> that the NLRC's use of the phrase "other reasons" referred to the varied grounds (<span style="font-style: italic;">i.e.</span> excess sick leaves, previous service of suspension orders, passenger complains, tardiness, etc.) employed in conjunction with seniority in selecting the employees to be terminated;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[138]</sup> that the CBA did not require reference to performance rating of the previous years, but to the use of an efficiency rating for a single year;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[139]</sup> and that it adopted both efficiency rating and inverse seniority as criteria in the selection pursuant to Section 112 of the CBA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[140]</sup><br><br>PAL's contentions are meritorious.<br><br>In selecting the employees to be dismissed, the employer is required to adopt fair and reasonable criteria, taking into consideration factors like: (<i>a</i>) preferred status; (<i>b</i>) efficiency; and (<i>c</i>) seniority, among others.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[141]</sup> The requirement of fair and reasonable criteria is imposed on the employer to preclude the occurrence of arbitrary selection of employees to be retrenched.

As the NLRC keenly pointed out, the "ICCD Masterank 1997 Ratings - Seniority Listing" submitted by PAL sufficiently established the criteria for the selection of the employees to be laid off. To insist on seniority as the sole basis for the selection would be unwarranted, it appearing that the applicable CBA did not establish such limitation. This counters the statement in the dissent that the retrenchment program was based on unreasonable standards without regard to service, seniority, loyalty and performance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[154]</sup><br><br>In this connection, we adopt the following cogent observations by the CA on the matter for being fully in accord with law and jurisprudence:<br><blockquote>FASAP insists that several CBA provisions have been violated by the retrenchment. They are the provisions on seniority, performance appraisal, reduction in personnel and downgrading and permanent OCARs. Seniority and performance stand out because these were the main considerations of PAL in selecting workers to be retrenched. Under the CBA, seniority is defined "<i>to mean a measure of a regular Cabin Attendant's claim in relation to other regular Cabin Attendants holding similar positions, to preferential consideration whatever the Company exercises its right to promote to a higher paying position of lay-off of any Cabin Attendant</i>." <b>Seniority, however, is not the sole determinant of retention. This is clear under Article XIII on performance appraisal of the CBA provisions.</b><br><br><b>Under the CBA, several factors are likewise taken into consideration like performance and professionalism in addition to the seniority factor. However, the criteria for performance and professionalism are not indicated in the CBA but are to be formulated by PAL in consultation with FASAP. Where there is retrenchment, cabin attendants who fail to attain at least 85% of the established criteria shall be demoted progressively. Domestic cabin attendants, the occupants of lowest rung of the organizational hierarchy, are to be retrenched once they fail to meet the required percentage.</b><br><br><b>We have painstakingly examined the records and We find no indication that these provisions have been grossly disregarded as to taint the retrenchment with illegality. PAL relied on specific categories of criteria, such as merit awards, physical appearance, attendance and <i>checkrides</i>, to guide its selection of employees to be removed. We do not find anything legally objectionable in the adoption of the foregoing norms. On the contrary, these norms are most relevant to the nature of cabin attendant's work.</b><br><br><b>However, the contention of FASAP that these criteria required its prior conformity before adoption is not supported by Section 30, Article VIII of the CBA. Note should be taken that this provision only mandates PAL to "<i>meet and consult</i>" the Association (FASAP) in the formulation of the Performance and Professionalism Appraisal System. By the ordinary import of this provision, PAL is only required to confer with FASAP; it is not at all required to forge an addendum to the CBA, which will concretize the appraisal system as basis for retrenchment or retention.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[155]</sup><br></blockquote>To require PAL to further limit its criteria would be inconsistent with jurisprudence and the principle of fairness. Instead, we hold that for as long as PAL followed a rational criteria defined or set by the CBA and existing laws and jurisprudence in determining who should be included in the retrenchment program, it sufficiently met the standards of fairness and reason in its implementation of its retrenchment program.<br><br><center><b>D<br><br>The retrenched employees signed valid quitclaims</b><br></center><br>The July 22, 2008 decision struck down as illegal the quitclaims executed by the retrenched employees because of the mistaken conclusion that the retrenchment had been unlawfully executed.<br><br>We reverse.<br><br>In <i>EDI Staffbuilders International, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Commission</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[156]</sup> we laid down the basic contents of valid and effective quitclaims and waivers, to wit:<br><blockquote>In order to prevent disputes on the validity and enforceability of quitclaims and waivers of employees under Philippine laws, said agreements should contain the following:<br><blockquote>1. A <b>fixed amount</b> as full and final compromise settlement;<br><br>2. The <b>benefits</b> of the employees if possible with the corresponding amounts, <b>which the employees are giving up in consideration of the fixed compromise amount</b>;<br><br>3. A <b>statement that the employer has dearly explained to the employee in English, Filipino, or in the dialect known to the employees</b> - that by signing the waiver or quitclaim, they are forfeiting or relinquishing their right to receive the benefits which are due them under the law; and<br><br>4. A statement that the <b>employees signed and executed the document voluntarily, and had fully understood the contents of the document and that their consent was freely given</b> without any threat, violence, duress, intimidation, or undue influence exerted on their person.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[157]</sup> (Bold supplied for emphasis)<br></blockquote></blockquote>The release and quitclaim signed by the affected employees substantially satisfied the aforestated requirements. The consideration was clearly indicated in the document in the English language, including the benefits that the employees would be relinquishing in exchange for the amounts to be received. There is no question that the employees who had occupied the position of flight crew knew and understood the English language. Hence, they fully comprehended the terms used in the release and quitclaim that they signed.<br><br>Indeed, not all quitclaims are <i>per se</i> invalid or against public policy. A quitclaim is invalid or contrary to public policy only: (1) where there is clear proof that the waiver was wrangled from an unsuspecting or gullible person; or (2) where the terms of settlement are unconscionable on their face.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[158]</sup> Based on these standards, we uphold the release and quitclaims signed by the retrenched employees herein.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court:<br><br>(a) <b>GRANTS</b> the <i>Motion for Reconsideration of the Resolution of October 2, 2009 and Second Motion for Reconsideration of the Decision of July 22, 2008</i> filed by the respondents Philippine Airlines, Inc. and Patria Chiong;<br><br>(b) <b>DENIES</b> the <i>Motion for Reconsideration (Re: The Honorable Court's Resolution dated March 13, 2012)</i> filed by the petitioner Flight Attendants and Stewards Association of the Philippines;<br><br>(c) <b>SETS ASIDE</b> the decision dated July 22, 2008 and resolution dated October 2, 2009; and <br><br>(d) <b>AFFIRMS</b> the decision of the Court of Appeals dated August 23, 2006.<br><br>No pronouncement on costs of suit.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Sereno</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">C.

The present <i>ponencia</i> exists on the premise that the grant of leave to file the Second Motion for Reconsideration and the recall of the September 7, 2011 Resolution prevented the July 22, 2008 Decision and the October 2, 2009 Resolution denying Philippine Airlines' First Motion for Reconsideration from becoming final and executory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>This premise is false.

Allowing second and subsequent motions for reconsideration of the same decision prevents the resolution of judicial controversies. Rule 52, Section 2 of the Rules of Court explicitly prohibits second motions for reconsideration:<br><blockquote>Section 2. <i>Second motion for reconsideration</i>. - No second motion for reconsideration of a judgment or final resolution by the same party shall be entertained.<br></blockquote>The rationale of the prohibition is further explained in <i>Ortigas and Company Limited Partnership v. Judge Velasco</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><blockquote>A second motion for reconsideration is forbidden except for extraordinarily persuasive reasons, and only upon express leave first obtained. The propriety or acceptability of such a second motion for reconsideration is not contingent upon the averment of "new" grounds to assail the judgment, i.e., grounds other than those theretofore presented and rejected. Otherwise, attainment of finality of a judgment might be staved off indefinitely, depending on the party's ingeniousness or cleverness in conceiving and formulating "additional flaws" or "newly discovered errors" therein, or thinking up some injury or prejudice to the rights of the movant for reconsideration. "Piece-meal" impugnation of a judgment by successive motions for reconsideration is anathema, being precluded by the salutary axiom that a party seeking the setting aside of a judgment, act or proceeding must set out in his motion all the grounds therefor, and those not so included are deemed waived and cease to be available for subsequent motions.<br><br>For all litigation must come to an end at some point, in accordance with established rules of procedure and jurisprudence. As a matter of practice and policy, courts must dispose of every case as promptly as possible; and in fulfillment of their role in the administration of justice, they should brook no delay in the termination of cases by stratagems or maneuverings of parties or their lawyers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br></blockquote>As an exception, by leave of court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> a party may file a second motion for reconsideration of the decision. The second motion for reconsideration may be subsequently granted "in the higher interest of justice." Rule 15, Section 3 of our Internal Rules provides:<br><blockquote>Section 3. <i>Second motion for reconsideration</i>. - The Court shall not entertain a second motion for reconsideration, and any exception to this rule can only be granted in the higher interest of justice by the Court en banc upon a vote of at least two-thirds of its actual membership. There is reconsideration "in the higher interest of justice" when the assailed decision is not only legally erroneous, but is likewise patently unjust and potentially capable of causing unwarranted and irremediable injury or damage to the parties. A second motion for reconsideration can only be entertained before the ruling sought to be reconsidered becomes final by operation of law or by the Court's declaration.<br><br>In the Division, a vote of three Members shall be required to elevate a second motion for reconsideration to the Court En Banc.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br></blockquote>Nothing in Rule 15, Section 3 of the Internal Rules, however, states that the resolution denying the motion for reconsideration of a decision will not lapse into finality. The grant of leave to file a second motion for reconsideration only means that the second motion for reconsideration is no longer prohibited.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Regardless of the grant of leave to file a second motion<br><br>for reconsideration, the resolution denying the motion for reconsideration of the decision becomes final and executory by operation of law.

The vote was two-two.<br><br>The farmer-beneficiaries filed motions for reconsideration of the November 17, 1998 Opinion, effectively the second motions for reconsideration filed in <i>Fortich</i>. Citing Article VIII, Section 4(3) of the Constitution, the farmer-beneficiaries argued that the two-two vote in the first motions for reconsideration fell short of the minimum of three (3) votes required to carry a decision or resolution of the Court. Since the required number of votes was not obtained, the case, insisted by the farmer­-beneficiaries, should be elevated to the en banc.<br><br>In the Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> dated August 19, 1999, the Court in <i>Fortich</i> rejected the farmer-beneficiaries' argument and denied the second motions for reconsideration. Examining the word choices in and syntax of Article VIII, Section 4(3) of the Constitution, the Court held that only "cases" that have not obtained the required number of votes may be elevated to and "decided" by the Court <i>en banc</i>. Using the statutory construction rule of <i>reddendo singula singulis</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> the Court said that "decided" in the first sentence of Section 4(3), Article VIII corresponded to "cases," and "resolved" corresponded to "matters." The word "matters," however, no longer appeared in the second sentence of Article VIII, Section 4(3). According to the Court, this omission was expressly made so that only a "case" that has not obtained the required number of votes in the Division, not "matters" such as motions for reconsideration, may be elevated to and "decided" by the Court <i>En Banc</i>. When a "matter" such as a motion for reconsideration does not obtain the required number of votes, it means that the motion for reconsideration must be denied for lack of the necessary votes, not elevated to the Court <i>En Banc</i> for resolution. The assailed decision previously rendered by the Division must, therefore, stand. In this Court's own words:<br><blockquote>A careful reading of [Section 4(3), Article VIII of the Constitution], however, reveals the intention of the framers to draw a distinction between cases, on the one hand, and matters, on the other hand, such that cases are "decided" while <i>matters</i>, which include motions, are "resolved". Otherwise put, the word "decided" must refer to "cases"; while the word "resolved" must refer to "matters", applying the rule <i>reddendo singula singulis</i>. This is true not only in the interpretation of the above-quoted [Section 4(3), Article VIII], but also of the other provisions of the Constitution where these words appear.<br><br>With the aforesaid rule of construction in mind, it is clear that only cases are referred to the Court <i>en banc</i> for decision whenever the required number of votes is not obtained. Conversely, the rule does not apply where, as in this case, the required three votes is not obtained in the resolution of a motion for reconsideration. Hence, the second sentence of the aforequoted provision speaks only of "case" and not "matter".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br></blockquote>The reason for the rule, said this Court, is "simple."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Continued this Court:<br><blockquote>The above-quoted [Article VIII, Section 4(3)] pertains to disposition of cases by a division. If there is a tie in the voting, there is no decision. The only way to dispose of the case is then refer it to the Court <i>en banc</i>. On the other hand, if a case has already been decided by the decision and the losing party files a motion for reconsideration, the failure of the division to resolve the motion because of a tie in the voting does not leave the case undecided. There is still the decision which must stand in view of the failure of the members of the division to muster the necessary vote for its reconsideration. Quite plainly, if the voting results in a tie, the motion for reconsideration is lost. The assailed decision is not reconsidered and must therefore be deemed affirmed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br></blockquote>Voting two-two on the first motion for reconsideration, the Members of the Second Division failed to muster the minimum number of votes required to reconsider the April 24, 1998 Decision in <i>Fortich</i>. Therefore, the first motions for reconsideration were deemed denied for failure to obtain the required number of votes, and the case was not elevated <i>en banc</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> The April 24, 1998 Decision in <i>Fortich</i>, unanimously voted by the Members of the Second Division, was deemed affirmed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br><i>Fortich</i> highlighted how a decision by any of the Divisions of this Court is a decision of <i>the</i> Supreme Court of the Philippines.

The Court <i>En Banc</i> has no residual power to assume jurisdiction over a Division case just because it deems it "of sufficient importance or interest."<br><br>To summarize, a case is considered decided and a decision rendered by the Supreme Court of the Philippines when a majority of the Members of the Division who actually took part in the deliberations on the issues in the case voted to concur in the decision. In no case shall the concurrence be less than three (3). When a Division already rendered a final decision or resolution in a case, the Court <i>En Banc</i> cannot set this final decision or resolution aside, even if it deems the case "of sufficient importance to merit its attention." The Court <i>En Banc</i> is not an appellate court to which decisions or resolutions rendered by a Division are appealed. Hence, when a decision or resolution of a Division is already final, the matter of referring the case to the Court <i>En Banc</i> must be favorably voted by at least three (3) Members of the Division who actually took part in the deliberations on the issues in the case.<br><br>Applying the foregoing here, the Court <i>En Banc</i> has no jurisdiction to take cognizance of the present case.<br><br>The July 22, 2008 Decision of the Third Division, unanimously voted by the Members of the Third Division, is a Decision of the Supreme Court of the Philippines.

In case of termination due to the installation of labor-saving devices or redundancy, the worker affected thereby shall be entitled to a separation pay equivalent to at least his one (1) month pay or to at least one (1) month pay for every year of service, whichever is higher. In case of retrenchment to prevent losses and in cases of closures or cessation of operations of establishment or undertaking not due to serious business losses or financial reverses, the separation pay shall be equivalent to one (1) month pay or at least one-half (1/2) month pay for every year of service, whichever is higher. A fraction of at least six (6) months shall be considered one (1) whole year.<br></blockquote>In contrast with the "just causes" for terminating employment brought about by an employee's acts, "authorized causes" such as retrenchment are undertaken by the employer. Retrenchment or "<i>lay-off</i>" is the cessation of employment commenced by the employer, devoid of any fault on the part of the workers and without prejudice to them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> It is "resorted to by management during periods of business recession, industrial depression, or seasonal fluctuations or during lulls occasioned by lack of orders, shortage of materials, conversion of the plant for a new production program or the introduction of new methods or more efficient machinery, or of automation."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br>Since retrenchment is commenced by the employer, the burden of proving that the termination was founded on an authorized cause necessarily rests with the employer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> The employer has the duty to clearly and satisfactorily prove the elements of a valid retrenchment, which, as established in <i>Lopez Sugar Corp. v. Federation of Free Workers</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> are the following:<br><blockquote><u>Firstly</u>, the losses expected should be substantial and not merely <i>de minimis</i> in extent. If the loss purportedly sought to be forestalled by retrenchment is clearly shown to be insubstantial and inconsequential in character, the <i>bonafide</i> nature of the retrenchment would appear to be seriously in question. <u>Secondly</u>, the substantial loss apprehended must be reasonably imminent, as such imminence can be perceived objectively and in good faith by the employer. There should, in other words, be a certain degree of urgency for the retrenchment, which is after all a drastic recourse with serious consequences for the livelihood of the employees retired or otherwise laid-off. Because of the consequential nature of retrenchment, it must, <u>thirdly</u>, be reasonably necessary and likely to effectively prevent the expected losses. The employer should have taken other measures prior or parallel to retrenchment to forestall losses, i.e., cut other costs than labor costs. An employer who, for instance, lays off substantial numbers of workers while continuing to dispense fat executive bonuses and perquisites or so-called "golden parachutes," can scarcely claim to be retrenching in good faith to avoid losses. To impart operational meaning to the constitutional policy of providing "full protection" to labor, the employer's prerogative to bring down labor costs by retrenching must be exercised essentially as a measure of last resort, after less drastic means - e.g., reduction of both management and rank-and-file bonuses and salaries, going on reduced time, improving manufacturing efficiencies, trimming of marketing and advertising costs, etc. - have been tried and found wanting.<br><br><u>Lastly</u>, but certainly not the least important, alleged losses if already realized, and the expected imminent losses sought to be forestalled, must be proved by sufficient and convincing evidence. The reason for requiring this quantum of proof is readily apparent: any less exacting standard of proof would render too easy the abuse of this ground for termination of services of employees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> (Underscoring provided)<br></blockquote>These "four standards of retrenchment"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup>-that the losses be substantial and not de minimis; that the substantial loss be imminent; that the retrenchment be reasonably necessary and would likely and effectively prevent the substantial loss; and that the loss, if already incurred, be proved by sufficient and convincing evidence-are reiterated in <i>Central Azucarera De La Carlota v.

Besides, this offer can hardly be considered to be borne of good faith, considering that it was premised on the condition that, if accepted, all existing CBA's between PAL and its employees would have to be suspended for 10 years. When the offer was rejected by the employees, PAL ceased its operations on September 23, 1998. It only resumed business when the CBA's suspension clause was ratified by the employees in a referendum subsequently conducted. Moreover, this stock distribution scheme does not do away with PAL's expenditures or liabilities, since it has for its sole consideration the commitment to suspend CBAs with its employees for 10 years.

The truth, however, is that it was unfair for PAL to have made such a move; it was capricious and arbitrary, considering that several thousand employees who had long been working with PAL had lost their jobs, only to be recalled but assigned to lower positions (i.e. demoted), and worse, some as new hires, without due regard for their long years of service with the airline.<br><br>The irregularity of PAL's implementation of Plan 14 becomes more apparent when it rehired 140 probationary cabin attendants whose services it had previously terminated, and yet proceeded to terminate the services of its permanent cabin crew personnel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[138]</sup> (Emphasis provided)<br></blockquote>Additionally, the retrenchment program was based on <i>unreasonable standards</i> without any regard to each cabin crew's corresponding service record, thus discounting "seniority and loyalty in the evaluation of overall employee performance."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[139]</sup><br><br>There is no question that employers have the management prerogative to resort to retrenchment in times of legitimate business reverses.

Douglas' Dissenting Opinion in <i>Johnson v. Louisiana</i>, 406 U.S. 356, 383 (1972) [Per J. White, United States Supreme Court]. The issue in <i>Johnson</i> was whether a less than unanimous vote of the jury is sufficient to convict an accused under the Sixth Amendment. The United States Supreme Court ruled in the affirmative with Justice Douglas, among other Justices, dissenting. Justice Douglas was of the view that unanimity should be required for convictions because they involve the right to liberty the deprivation of which should be based on the same strict standard required for depriving the right to property, i.e., unanimous vote of a jury. Justice Douglas explained the reasons why a mere plurality vote "diminishes the reliability of a jury":<br><blockquote>The plurality approves a procedure which diminishes the reliability of a jury. First, it eliminates the circumstances in which a minority of jurors (a) could have rationally persuaded the entire jury to acquit, or (b) while unable to persuade the majority to acquit, nonetheless could have convinced them to convict only a lesser included offense. Second, it permits prosecutors in Oregon and Louisiana to enjoy a conviction-acquittal ratio substantially greater than that ordinarily returned by unanimous juries.<br><br>The diminution of verdict reliability flows from the fact that nonunanimous juries need not debate and deliberate as fully as must unanimous juries. As soon as the requisite majority is attained, further consideration is not required either by Oregon or by Louisiana, even though the dissident jurors might, if given the chance, be able to convince the majority. . . .<br></blockquote>Although <i>Johnson</i> involved jury voting, this Court, like a jury, is a collegial body that decides collectively through the votes of its Members. Therefore, the advantages and disadvantages of different electoral systems, such as plurarity or majoritarian systems, must equally apply to a collegial body such as this Court.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> CONST., art.

This is precisely what the case at bar presents, as the Court is yet again faced with the dilemma of whether or not requirements historically perpetuated as indispensable could reasonably be put aside in light of the factual circumstances surrounding the controversy.<br><br>Yet, before one delves into the factual circumstances and the merit of the Second Motion for Reconsideration (2<sup>nd</sup> MR) filed by Philippine Airlines, Inc. (PAL), it is but necessary that the procedural issues raised by the Petitioner and J.

As the <i>ponencia</i> explained "<b><u><i>any doubt on the validity of the recall order was removed because the Court upheld its issuance through the March 13, 2012 resolution</i></u></b>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> of the Court <i>en banc</i>.<br><br><i>a. <u>Timeline</u></i><br><br>The specific dates and incidents that led to the Court <i>en banc</i> assuming jurisdiction over this case are narrated and clarified in the Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> dated March 13, 2012 (March 2012 Resolution) of the Court <i>en banc</i> in A.M. No. 11-10-1-SC. <u><b>These dates and incidents are no longer in dispute as they have already been settled and discussed by the Court <i>en banc</i> through its March 2012 Resolution</b></u>, which highlighted the following incidents:<br><br>(1) On July 22, 2008, the Court's Third Division ruled to grant the petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> filed by the Flight Attendants and Stewards Association of the Philippines (FASAP), finding PAL guilty of illegal dismissal (July 2008 Decision). PAL subsequently filed a Motion for Reconsideration (MR) seeking to reverse the July 2008 Decision rendered by the Court's Third Division.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>(2) Due to the inhibition and retirement of several justices, PAL's MR was handled by the Court's Special Third Division which, in turn, denied the MR with finality in a Resolution dated October 2, 2009 (October 2009 Resolution).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>(3) On November 3, 2009, PAL filed a <i>Motion for Leave to File and Admit Motion for Reconsideration of the Resolution dated 2 October 2009 and 2<sup>nd</sup> Motion for Reconsideration of Decision dated 22 July 2008</i> (<i>Motion for Leave</i>).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>(4) On January 20, 2010, PAL's <i>Motion for Leave</i> was granted by a newly constituted regular Third Division.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> As noted by the Court's March 2012 Resolution, "[t]his grant [by the regular Third Division] opened both the [July 2008] Decision and the [October 2009] Resolution xxx for review [and] effectively opened the whole case for review on the merits."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>(5) After the inhibition of Justice Velasco on January 17, 2011, the case was raffled to the Second Division. As narrated in the March 2012 Resolution, "[o]n September 7, 2011, the Court - through its Second Division as then constituted-resolved to deny with finality PAL's 2<sup>nd</sup> MR through an unsigned resolution."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>(6) Because of the series of changes and movement from one division to the other, PAL's counsel, Atty. Estelito Mendoza, wrote four letters addressed to the Clerk of Court specifically inquiring about which division acted on PAL's 2<sup>nd</sup> MR, the identity of the <i>ponente</i> and the rationale/basis for the designation of the <i>ponente</i> and the handling division - in view of the retirement of the previous <i>ponente</i> and the members of the Second Division and Special Second Division.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>(7) The legal considerations and issues raised as a result of Atty. Mendoza's letter are, to reiterate, extensively discussed in the March 2012 Resolution. As the Court <i>en banc</i> noted therein, the "unresolved questions were even further compounded in the course of the deliberations of the Members of the ruling Division when they were informed that the parties received the ruling on September 19, 2011, and this ruling would lapse to finality after the 15<sup>th</sup> day, or after October 4, 2011."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Thus, out of prudence, the Members of the ruling Division on September 30, 2011 recommended to the Chief Justice that (a) the September 7, 2011 Resolution (September 2011 Resolution) be recalled; and (b) the case be referred to the Court <i>en banc</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>(8) On October 4, 2011, the Court <i>en banc</i> issued a Resolution (October 2011 Resolution) recalling the September 2011 Resolution and ordering the re-raffle of the case. As explained by the Court <i>en banc</i> in the March 2012 Resolution:<br><blockquote>As the narration in this Resolution shows, the Court acted on its own pursuant to its power to recall its own orders and resolutions before their finality. The October 4, 2011 Resolution was issued to determine the propriety of the September 7, 2011 Resolution given the facts that came to light after the ruling Division's examination of the records. xxx<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br></blockquote>With the foregoing narration serving as the backdrop and context, it is easier now to see that the procedural issues raised by J. Leonen in his dissent have all been amply addressed by the March 2012 Resolution of the Court <i>en banc</i>.<br><br><i>b. <u>Nature of the March 2012 Resolution in A.M No. 11-10-1-SC</u></i><br><br>One of the preliminary objections that has been raised with respect to the March 2012 Resolution is that this was docketed as an administrative matter. Being an administrative matter, it is somewhat argued that such cannot affect and override whatever disposition the Court may have in a regular case. This argument, however, is belied by the March 2012 Resolution itself.<br><br>To be sure, while the March 2012 Resolution was docketed as an administrative matter, the whole intent behind it - as established through its narration and discussion - was precisely to extensively explain the circumstances under which the Court <i>en banc</i> (a) recalled the September 2011 Resolution; and (b) assumed jurisdiction over the case through the issuance of the October 2011 Resolution. And, in connection with the latter, it should be emphasized that this October 2011 Resolution was promulgated in relation to this present case or under G.R. No. 178083 - and not through a resolution of an administrative matter.<br><br>Stated otherwise, it is inaccurate to assert that the Court <i>en banc</i> assumed jurisdiction over the case via a disposition made in an administrative matter. To the contrary, the Court <i>en banc</i> already assumed jurisdiction through the October 2011 Resolution that was promulgated in G.R. No. 178083 and which recalled the September 2011 Resolution denying PAL's 2<sup>nd</sup> MR. <u><b>Thus, there is no mystery nor was it anomalous for the Court <i>en banc</i> to issue its March 2012 Resolution as this administrative matter was but an avenue to explain the Court <i>en banc</i>'s actions in the present case.</b></u> This is patently evident from the dispositive portion of the March 2012 Resolution, which provides:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, <u><b><i>we hereby confirm</i></b></u> that the Court <i>en banc</i> has assumed jurisdiction over the resolution of the merits of the motions for reconsideration of Philippine Airlines, Inc., addressing our July 22, 2008 Decision and October 2, 2009 Resolution; and that the September 7, 2011 ruling of the Second Division has been effectively recalled. xxx<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br></blockquote>Clearly, based on the March 2012 Resolution and its detailed narration of the events that transpired within the Court, the Court's disposition in A.M. No. 11-10-1-SC did not override, but merely clarified, the Court <i>en banc's</i> actions and issuances in the present case (<i>i.e.</i>, G.R. No. 178083).<br><br><i>c. <u>Finality of the 2008 Decision and 2009 Resolution</u></i><br><br>The primordial procedural concern, however, appears to be whether or not PAL's 2<sup>nd</sup> MR should be entertained considering that the Court's 2008 Decision and 2009 Resolution already attained finality (as insisted by the Petitioner and the dissent) and hence can no longer be entertained, modified, annulled or vacated by the Court <i>en banc</i>. This concern has been clearly addressed by the foregoing Timeline - meaning, that the Court <i>en banc</i> had already unequivocally declared and confirmed in the March 2012 Resolution that it had "assumed jurisdiction over the resolution of the merits of the motions for reconsideration of Philippine Airlines, Inc., addressing our July 22, 2008 Decision and October 2, 2009 Resolution; and that the September 7, 2011 ruling of the Second Division has been effectively recalled."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>As admitted by the dissenting opinion, "[a]s an exception, by leave of court, a party may file a second motion for reconsideration of the decision. The second motion for reconsideration may be subsequently granted 'in the higher interest of justice'"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> This has long been affirmed by the Supreme Court in a long line of cases as exemplified by the Court <i>en banc's</i> pronouncement in <i>McBurnie v. Ganzon</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>:<br><blockquote>At the outset, the Court emphasizes that second and subsequent motions for reconsideration are, as a general rule, prohibited. Section 2, Rule 52 of the Rules of Court provides that "[n]o second motion for reconsideration of a judgment or final resolution by the same party shall be entertained." The rule rests on the basic tenet of immutability of judgments. "At some point, a decision becomes final and executory and, consequently, all litigations must come to an end."<br><br>The general rule, however, against second and subsequent motions for reconsideration admits of settled exceptions. For one, the present Internal Rules of the Supreme Court, particularly Section 3, Rule 15 thereof, provides:<br><blockquote><b>Sec. 3. Second motion for reconsideration.</b> - The Court shall not entertain a second motion for reconsideration, and <b>any exception to this rule can only be granted in the higher interest of justice</b> by the Court <i>En Banc</i> upon a vote of at least two-thirds of its actual membership. There is reconsideration "in the higher interest of justice" <b>when the assailed decision is not only legally erroneous, but is likewise patently unjust and potentially capable of causing unwarranted and irremediable injury or damage to the parties</b>. A second motion for reconsideration can only be entertained before the ruling sought to be reconsidered becomes final by operation of law or by the Court's declaration.<br><br>xxxx (Emphasis ours)<br></blockquote>In a line of cases, the Court has then entertained and granted second motions for reconsideration "in the higher interest of substantial justice," as allowed under the Internal Rules when the assailed decision is "legally erroneous," "patently unjust" and "potentially capable of causing unwarranted and irremediable injury or damage to the parties." In <i>Tirazona v. Philippine EDS Techno-Service, Inc. (PET, Inc.)</i>, we also explained that a second motion for reconsideration may be allowed in instances of "extraordinarily persuasive reasons and only after an express leave shall have been obtained." In <i>Apo Fruits Corporation v. Land Bank of the Philippines</i>, we allowed a second motion for reconsideration as the issue involved therein was a matter of public interest, as it pertained to the proper application of a basic constitutionally-guaranteed right in the government's implementation of its agrarian reform program. In <i>San Miguel Corporation v. NLRC</i>, the Court set aside the decisions of the LA and the NLRC that favored claimants-security guards upon the Court's review of San Miguel Corporation's second motion for reconsideration. In <i>Vir-Jen Shipping and Marine Services, Inc. v. NLRC, et al.</i>, the Court <i>en banc</i> reversed on a third motion for reconsideration the ruling of the Court's Division on therein private respondents' claim for wages and monetary benefits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br></blockquote>In this instance, PAL received a copy of the October 2009 Resolution denying its Motion for Reconsideration of the 2008 Decision on October 20, 2009. On November 3, 2009, PAL asked for leave of court to file (a) an MR of the October 2009 Resolution; and (b) a 2<sup>nd</sup> MR of the 2008 Decision. On January 20, 2010, the Court, through the Third Division, granted PAL's <i>Motion for Leave</i>.<br><br>The fact that the Court granted PAL's motion for leave to file its 2<sup>nd</sup> MR means exactly that -that the 2<sup>nd</sup> MR is no longer prohibited and may be granted "in the higher interest of substantial justice" and for "extraordinarily persuasive reasons." Thus, with the Court admitting the 2<sup>nd</sup> MR, this meant that the 2008 Decision and the 2009 Resolution were <b><u>not</u></b> rendered executory and could not have been implemented. <u><b>To hold otherwise would be to render nugatory and illusory the Court <i>en banc's</i> action of allowing and accepting the 2<sup>nd</sup> MR.</b></u><br><br>I am not unaware that there has been an instance where the Court has declared that the "grant of leave to file the Supplemental Motion for Reconsideration xxx did not prevent [a] Resolution from becoming final and executory."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> I do not share the same view and believe that this declaration runs counter to the logic and very rationale of the Court's action of allowing the filing of a 2<sup>nd</sup> MR. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the Court in the same case admits that a second motion for reconsideration may still be granted and an entry of judgment lifted notwithstanding that the resolution has been deemed final and executory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Thus, the lone fact that a decision and/or a resolution has attained finality does not negate the Court's power, in the higher interest of substantial justice, to entertain and grant subsequent motions for reconsideration filed by the parties. In fact, as this Court, in an <i>en banc</i> Resolution, lengthily explained:<br><blockquote>As a rule, a final judgment may no longer be altered, amended or modified, even if the alteration, amendment or modification is meant to correct what is perceived to be an erroneous conclusion of fact or law and regardless of what court, be it the highest Court of the land, rendered it. In the past, however, we have recognized exceptions to this rule by reversing judgments and recalling their entries in the interest of substantial justice and where special and compelling reasons called for such actions.<br><br>Notably, in <i>San Miguel Corporation v. National Labor Relations Commission, Galman v. Sandiganbayan, Philippine Consumers Foundation v. National Telecommunications Commission</i>, and <i>Republic v. de los Angeles</i>, we reversed our judgment on the <u><b>second</b></u> motion for reconsideration, while in <i>Vir-Jen Shipping and Marine Services v. National Labor Relations Commission</i>, we did so on a <u><b>third</b></u> motion for reconsideration. In <i>Cathay Pacific v. Romillo</i> and <i>Cosio v. de Rama</i>, we modified or amended our ruling on the second motion for reconsideration. More recently, in the cases of <i>Munoz v. Court of Appeals, Tan Tiac Chiong v. Hon. Cosico, Manotok IV v. Barque</i>, and <i>Barnes v. Padilla</i>, we <b>recalled entries of judgment</b> after finding that doing so was in the interest of substantial justice. In <i>Barnes</i>, we said:<br><blockquote>xxx Phrased elsewise, a final and executory judgment can no longer be attacked by any of the parties or be modified, directly or indirectly, even by the highest court of the land.<br><br>However, this Court has relaxed this rule in order to serve substantial justice considering (a) <b>matters of life, liberty, honor or property</b>, (b) <b>the existence of special or compelling circumstances</b>, (c) <b>the merits of the case</b>, (d) a cause not entirely attributable to the fault or negligence of the party favored by the suspension of the rules, (e) a lack of any showing that the review sought is merely frivolous and dilatory, and (f) the other party will not be unjustly prejudiced thereby.<br><br>Invariably, rules of procedure should be viewed as mere tools designed to facilitate the attainment of justice. Their strict and rigid application, which would result in technicalities that tend to frustrate rather than promote substantial justice, must always be eschewed. Even the Rules of Court reflects this principle. The power to suspend or even disregard rules can be so pervasive and compelling as to alter even that which this Court itself had already declared to be final. [Emphasis supplied.]<br></blockquote>That the issues posed by this case are of transcendental importance is not hard to discern from these discussions. A constitutional limitation, guaranteed under no less than the all-important Bill of Rights, is at stake in this case: how can compensation in an eminent domain be "just" when the payment for the compensation for property already taken has been unreasonably delayed? To claim, as the assailed Resolution does, that only private interest is involved in this case is to forget that an expropriation involves the government as a necessary actor. It forgets, too, that under eminent domain, the constitutional limits or standards apply to government who carries the burden of showing that these standards have been met. Thus, to simply dismiss this case as a private interest matter is an extremely shortsighted view that this Court should not leave uncorrected.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br></blockquote>Thus, the power of the Court to entertain PAL's 2<sup>nd</sup> MR (and even a Third Motion for Reconsideration) and to grant such motion should the interest of substantial justice so warrant is undoubtedly clear and unequivocal. Accordingly, even on the assumption that this is PAL's Third Motion for Reconsideration (which, as explained, it is not), the power of the Court to grant PAL's motion is not negated.<br><br><i>d. <u>Jurisdiction of the Court <i>en banc</i> to assume jurisdiction of the case</u></i><br><br>The next crucial issue that needs to be addressed is whether or not the Court <i>en banc</i> has the jurisdiction to resolve PAL's 2<sup>nd</sup> MR. Again, the answer has already been answered and explained in the March 2012 Resolution to be in the affirmative.<br><br>In this case, the dissent questions the transfer of this case to the Court <i>en banc</i> considering that no formal resolution was issued by the Second Division referring PAL's 2<sup>nd</sup> MR to the Court <i>en banc</i> pursuant to the Internal Rules of the Supreme Court (IRSC). However, as already stated, this issue regarding the Court <i>en banc's</i> jurisdiction was already directly traversed by the Court <i>en banc</i> in its March 2012 Resolution in A.M. No. 11-10-1-SC.<br><br>First, as highlighted in the March 2012 Resolution, the Court <i>en banc</i> may act on matters and cases that it deems of sufficient importance to merit its attention as provided in Section 3(m), Rule 2 of the IRSC. PAL's 2<sup>nd</sup> MR and the interpretation of the conflicting provisions of the IRSC appears to have been considered by the Court <i>en banc</i> to be of sufficient importance - such that the Court <i>en banc</i> assumed jurisdiction over the case.<br><br>In assailing Section 3(m), Rule 2 of the IRSC, the dissent relies on the dissenting opinion of J. Gonzaga-Reyes in <i>Firestone Ceramics v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> in concluding that the residual power of the Court <i>en banc</i> to, on its own, take cognizance of Division cases is suspect. However, and with all due respect to J. Leonen, the dissenting opinion of J. Gonzaga-Reyes finds no application here. In <i>Firestone</i>, the Court <i>en banc</i> relied on a Resolution dated November 18, 1993 which, as pointed out by J. Gonzaga-Reyes, is an amendment to Sections 15 and 16, Rule 136 of the Rules of Court which deals with the form ("unglazed paper," margins, number of copies, etc.) of unprinted and printed papers to be filed with this Court. Thus, as concluded by J. Gonzaga-Reyes, the Resolution dated November 18, 1993 was clearly not intended to lay down new guidelines or rules for referral to the court <i>en banc</i> of cases assigned to a Division.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>However, in the case at hand, <u><b>Section 3, Rule 2 of the IRSC was clearly meant to lay down and establish the instances when a Court en banc may act on any case or matter</b></u> - unlike in <i>Firestone</i> where the Resolution relied upon essentially deals with the format of the pleadings filed before the Supreme Court. As explicitly provided in Section 3(m), Rule 2, the Court <i>en banc</i> may act on cases that it deems of sufficient importance to merit its attention. And at the risk of belaboring the point, the March 2012 Resolution rendered six (6) years ago clearly established that the Court <i>en banc</i> had made a judicious determination at that time that PAL and FASAP's case was of sufficient importance for it to assume jurisdiction.<br><br>More importantly, the March 2012 Resolution likewise establishes that it was the members of the Division (which rendered the recalled September 7, 2011 Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> that referred the matter to the Court <i>en banc - albeit</i> no formal resolution was issued. As explicitly narrated in the March 2012 Resolution, since there was "[n]o unanimity among the Members of the ruling Division xxx on the unresolved legal questions[,] they concluded that the matter is best determined by the Court <i>en banc</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> It should be noted that the members of the Second Division, which issued the recalled September 7, 2011 ruling, unanimously concurred in the March 2012 Resolution and did not dispute the categorical declaration that they referred the matter on hand to the Court <i>en banc</i>. <u><b>Such referral by the members of the Ruling Division coupled with the Court <i>en banc's</i> decision to exercise its power to assume jurisdiction of a case with sufficient importance should be sufficient legal basis for the Court <i>en banc</i> of today to decide the merits of the case now.</b></u><br><br>Finally, it should be stressed anew that the Court <i>en banc</i> already assumed jurisdiction through the October 2011 Resolution that was promulgated in G.R. No. 178083 (<i>i.e.</i>, recalling the September 2011 Resolution denying PAL's 2<sup>nd</sup> MR). This was "confirmed" by the Court <i>en banc's</i> March 2012 Resolution, the dispositive portion of which is again quoted below:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, <u><b><i>we hereby confirm</i></b></u> that the Court <i>en banc</i> has assumed jurisdiction over the resolution of the merits of the motions for reconsideration of Philippine Airlines, Inc., addressing our July 22, 2008 Decision and October 2, 2009 Resolution; and that the September 7, 2011 ruling of the Second Division has been effectively recalled. xxx<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> (Emphasis in the original omitted; emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Thus, for the Court of today, or more specifically, the dissent, to question what has clearly and already been resolved at least six (6) years ago, is to second guess the wisdom of what, for all intents and purposes, is already a final disposition of this issue. In this sense, it can be rightly said that the October 2011 Resolution and March 2012 Resolution have become immutable.<br><br><i>e. <u>Unanimous vote of the Court en banc</u></i><br><br>Anent the assertion that the unanimous vote of the Court sitting <i>en banc</i> must be required to grant PAL's motion for reconsideration (whether second or third), there is absolutely no legal or jurisprudential basis for such. Moreover, even applying <i>Fortich v. Corona</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> by analogy as the dissent suggests<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> will not lead one to the conclusion that a unanimous vote is required. As the dissent itself narrated, it was only because the voting for the motion for reconsideration amounted to a tie (two-two) that the Decision of the Division was deemed upheld. Nowhere in <i>Fortich</i> did the Court even allude to requiring a unanimous vote.<br><br>Considering the foregoing, I agree with the <i>ponencia</i> that PAL's 2<sup>nd</sup> MR is not a prohibited pleading. Moreover, and as underscored by him, PAL's arguments in its 2<sup>nd</sup> MR sufficiently show that the assailed decision might have contravened established jurisprudence - clearly highlighting that the higher interests of substantial justice will be served if the 2008 Decision and the 2009 Resolution were to be revisited.<br><br><b><i>Substantial Issue: PAL's financial losses</i></b><br><br>There appears to be a question on the sufficiency of PAL's compliance with the substantiation requirements imposed by law for a valid retrenchment. To recall, PAL invoked substantial business losses as the reason behind its decision to downsize. To this end, it presented its petition for suspension of payments, as well as the June 23, 1998 Order of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving the said petition for suspension of payments as proof of the same.<br><br>I agree with the <i>ponencia</i> when he points out that Petitioner's categorical admission of PAL's dire financial condition had discharged the burden to prove financial losses. As has been consistently held by this Court, a judicial admission no longer requires proof. An admission made in a pleading cannot be controverted by the party making such admission, and is conclusive as to such party. As succinctly explained by the Court in <i>Alfelor v. Halasan</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>:<br><blockquote>xxx To the Court's mind, this <u>admission constitutes a "deliberate, clear and unequivocal" statement; made as it was in the course of judicial proceedings, such statement qualifies as a judicial admission</u>. A party who judicially admits a fact cannot later challenge that fact as judicial admissions are a waiver of proof; production of evidence is dispensed with. A judicial admission also removes an admitted fact from the field of controversy. Consequently, <u>an admission made in the pleadings cannot be controverted by the party making such admission and are conclusive as to such party, and all proofs to the contrary or inconsistent therewith should be ignored, whether objection is interposed by the party or not</u>. The allegations, statements or admissions contained in a pleading are conclusive as against the pleader. A party cannot subsequently take a position contrary of or inconsistent with what was pleaded.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>The records amply show that Petitioner had categorically admitted PAL's grave financial condition during this time, as follows:<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">[A.] </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">At the outset, it must be pointed out that complainant was never opposed to the retrenchment program itself, as it understands respondent PAL's financial troubles.

This has been amply discussed in the case of <i>Blue Eagle Management, Inc. v. Naval</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> citing <i>Revidad v. National Labor Relations Commission</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> where it was declared that "proof of actual financial losses incurred by the company is not a condition <i>sine qua non</i> for retrenchment," and retrenchment may be undertaken by the employer to prevent even future losses. Said the Court:<br><blockquote><b>In its ordinary connotation, the phrase "to prevent losses" means that retrenchment or termination of the services of some employees is authorized to be undertaken by the employer sometime before the anticipated losses are actually sustained or realized. It is not, in other words, the intention of the lawmaker to compel the employer to stay his hand and keep all his employees until after losses shall have in fact materialized.</b> If such an intent were expressly written into the law, that law may well be vulnerable to constitutional attack as unduly taking property from one man to be given to another.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Given the foregoing, it would truly be derisive of this Court to maintain the necessity of presenting financial statements showing actual loss prior to a valid exercise of retrenchment.<br><br>Inasmuch as financial statements paint a clear picture of a company's finances, other clear indicators of substantial losses - if not more compelling evidence thereof - exist. Verily, <b>as clearly as financial statements demonstrate financial distress, a company's submission to corporate rehabilitation and receivership equally attests to, if not represents a more tangible manifestation of, financial reverses</b>.<br><br>The Court has, in fact, recognized corporate receivership and rehabilitation as a veritable indicator of substantial business losses that justifies retrenchment of employees. In <i>Clarion Printing House Inc. v. National Labor Relations Commission</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> for instance, the Petitioners therein argued that when a company is under receivership and a receiver is appointed to take control of its management and corporate affairs, one of the evident reasons is to prevent further losses of said company and protect its remaining assets from being dissipated; and that the submission of financial reports/statements prepared by independent auditors had been rendered moot and academic, the company having shut down its operations and having been placed under receivership by the SEC due to its inability to pay or comply with its obligations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>The Court, in deciding the issue of whether undergoing receivership suffices as acceptable proof of financial losses, ruled as follows:<br><blockquote>From the above-quoted provisions of P.D. No. 902-A, as amended, <b>the appointment of a receiver or management committee by the SEC presupposes a finding that, <i>inter alia</i>, a company possesses sufficient property to cover all its debts but "foresees the impossibility of meeting them when they respectively fall due" and "there is imminent danger of dissipation, loss, wastage or destruction of assets of other properties or paralization of business operations</b><span style="font-weight: bold;">."</span><br><br><b>That the SEC</b>, mandated by law to have regulatory functions over corporations, partnerships or associations, <b>appointed <i>an interim</i> receiver for the EYCO Group of Companies on its petition in light of, as quoted above, the therein enumerated "factors beyond the control and anticipation of the management" rendering it unable to meet its obligation as they fall due, and thus resulting to "complications and problems ... to arise that would impair and affect [its] operations..." <u>shows that CLARION, together with the other member-companies of the EYCO Group of Companies, was suffering business reverses justifying, among other things, the retrenchment of its employees</u>.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>In finding that receivership suffices as proof of severe financial reverses, it was therefore decided that retrenchment was justified and that there was no illegal dismissal despite Clarion's failure to present the necessary financial statements before the Labor Arbiter.<br><br>Given the foregoing, it is therefore clear that proof of losses is not exclusively limited to the presentation of financial statements, as equally compelling evidence such as having undergone rehabilitation is similarly acceptable. In this light, it should be noted that, in the current case, PAL has proffered similar evidence on its behalf, as it has more than once asserted and proved that the SEC has approved its petition for rehabilitation and has in fact appointed a receiver on two occasions by virtue of its financial condition, not to mention that Petitioner has similarly judicially admitted and recognized PAL's financial losses at that time. All these show that PAL had indeed been besieged by and suffered severe financial losses, which justify its resort to drastic cuts in personnel.<br><br>In addition, the Court has, in fact, recognized PAL's financial conditions on various occasions, and it has consequently ruled in the latter's favor, as it recognized that PAL was undergoing receivership. Consequently, claims filed against it were either rejected or shelved in view thereof, as in the cases of <i>Philippine Airlines, Inc. v. Philippine Airlines Employees Association</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> <i>Philippine Airlines, Inc. v.

Disregarding such facts and blindly insisting on the timely presentation of financial statements would only be a superfluity given the confluence of all the above. This Court should not be so unreasonable as to turn a blind eye to the factual circumstances surrounding the controversy, if only to uphold the "general rule."
