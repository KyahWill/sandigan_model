				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The exoneration of public officers by the Ombudsman in a charge alleging grave misconduct and a violation of Republic Act No. 3019, Section 3(g) is generally unappealable. Furthermore, any appeal to the Supreme Court from such a case cannot be initiated by one who does not stand to be benefited or injured by the results of the suit.<br><br>This resolves a Petition for Review on Certiorari<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, assailing the Court of Appeals August 11, 2011 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and November 29, 2011 Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> in CA-G.R.

(R-II) executed a Joint Venture Agreement to implement the Smokey Mountain Development and Reclamation Project (the Project), with the former as government implementing agency and the latter as developer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>The Project sought to convert the former Smokey Mountain Dumpsite into habitable housing with commercial and industrial development and to reclaim the property adjacent to Smokey Mountain as its enabling component.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> The Manila Harbour Centre Port Terminal, Inc. (Harbour Centre) is covered by the Project.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Aside from being the developer, R-II was also responsible for sourcing the funding for the Project's Phase 1 through securitization, or the issuance of secured instruments backed by assets. To support the Project's securitization and to make the security instruments more appealing to investors, National Housing Authority and R-II engaged Home Guaranty Corporation (Home Guaranty) to act as guarantor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Home Guaranty is a government-owned and -controlled corporation duly organized and existing by virtue of Republic Act No. 8763.

The Trust Agreement was amended many times until June 9, 2000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>In the Trust Agreement, the parties agreed to employ the "asset­-backed securitization method" to finance the Project.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Under this method, Philippine National Bank, as the trustee of the asset pool, would issue to investors Regular Smokey Mountain Asset Pool Participation Certificates (Participation Certificates). These Participation Certificates were subject to government redemption and interest, and were guaranteed by Home Guaranty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> The assets in the asset pool were used as securities for the Participation Certificates.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>On the same day they executed the Trust Agreement, the parties also executed a Contract of Guaranty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Under the Contract of Guaranty, the trustee of the asset pool was authorized to execute a Deed of Assignment and Conveyance of the entire asset pool in favor of Home Guaranty should the latter be called to pay the total outstanding value of the matured Participation Certificates.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>On October 24, 2002, the Participation Certificates matured. At this point, Planters Development Bank (Planters Bank) had become the trustee.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Because of the asset pool's inability to pay for the Participation Certificates, Planters Bank called on Home Guaranty's guaranty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>On February 6, 2003, Home Guaranty's Board of Directors approved the call. R-II did not object to it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Thus, on July 30, 2004,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Planters Bank transferred the entire asset pool properties to Home Guaranty through a Deed of Assignment and Conveyance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>To recover its exposure, Home Guaranty published a Notice of Sale<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> on July 21, 2006 in the Philippine Daily Inquirer, seeking to sell the properties in the asset pool.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>In response to this Notice of Sale, Alfred Wong King Wai (Wong) proposed to purchase two (2) lots in the asset pool located in Manila Harbour Centre, covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) Nos. 233421 and 233422 with a combined area of 28,926 square meters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Wong offered to pay P14,000.00 per square meter. However, this price was reduced to P13,300.00 per square meter because Home Guaranty allowed a 5% cash discount as an incentive for spot cash purchases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Home Guaranty's Board of Directors deferred action on Wong's proposal. It again published another Notice of Sale on October 22, 2006.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> However, no one else came forward with a proposal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Home Guaranty referred Wong's proposal for review to the Office of the Government Corporate Counsel, which gave a favorable opinion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Thus, on July 21, 2008, Home Guaranty sold<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> the lots to Wong for P384,715,800.00, or P13,300.00 per square meter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Wong designated La Paz Milling Corporation (La Paz) as his agent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> TCT Nos. 283618 and 283619 were issued in place of TCT Nos. 233421 and 233422, respectively.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>On October 16, 2009, Canlas filed a Complaint-Affidavit<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> before the Office of the Ombudsman against Home Guaranty's officers, namely, President Gonzalo Benjamin A.

Delos Santos (Delos Santos), Vice President of Corporate Services Corazon G. Corpuz (Corpuz), Vice President of Legal Danilo C. Javier (Javier), and Vice President of Management Services Jimmy B. Sarona (Sarona) (collectively Home Guaranty Officers).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Canlas claimed that the Home Guaranty Officers were guilty of grave misconduct and of entering into a contract grossly disadvantageous to the government under Section 3(g) of Republic Act No. 3019.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> He alleged that the lots were sold below their actual or appraised fair market value,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> and that the government suffered damages in the amount ranging from P121,489,200.00 to P309,508,200.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>Canlas compared the purchase price of the sold lots to the prices of other properties in the same area.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> He alleged that in 1999, Philippine National Bank sold an adjoining 20,000-square-meter lot for P440,000,000.00, or for P22,000.00 per square meter. Based on this, the sold lots allegedly should have been worth at least P636,372,000.00 as of January 1999.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>Canlas also cited that in 2001, National Housing Authority sold an adjoining 15,000-square-meter lot for P262,500,000.00, or for P17,500.00 per square meter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Based on this, Canlas asserted that the sold lots should have been worth at least P506,205,000.00 as of August 2001.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>Canlas emphasized that in 2009, Planters Bank offered to sell three (3) adjacent lots for P20,000.00 per square meter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Moreover, Canlas presented an Appraisal Report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> dated July 2008 prepared by EValue Philippines, Inc. (EValue), which concluded that four (4) adjoining lots inside Harbour Centre had a fair market value of P24,000.00 per square meter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Based on this, he asserted that the sold lots should have been worth at least P694,224,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>Canlas claimed that these prices were substantially higher than the purchase price of P384,715,800.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>In determining responsibility, Canlas asserted that the Home Guaranty Officers should be particularly liable. Bongolan allegedly "arranged, facilitated, authorized, and approved the execution of the [D]eed of [S]ale."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Javier and Delos Santos signed the Deed of Sale for and in behalf of Home Guaranty. The rest of the Home Guaranty Officers facilitated the execution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, the Home Guaranty Officers, in their respective counter-affidavits, argued that Home Guaranty acted within its mandate to guaranty loans and investment projects related to housing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> They explained that when Home Guaranty acquired the asset backing or collateral of the loan, it disposed of it to recover its payment, replenish its funds, and maintain its financial stability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>The Home Guaranty Officers contended that the disposition of these properties was covered by Home Guaranty's Office Order No. 66,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> or the Revised Disposition Guidelines (Disposition Guidelines).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> They argued that they followed the Disposition Guidelines when they published the Notice of Sale twice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> They also sought the favorable opinion of the Office of the Government Corporate Counsel before executing the sale.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>They asserted that the sale was not grossly disadvantageous to the government because the purchase price exceeded the latest zonal valuation of the property, which was P9,750.00 per square meter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> The purchase price also allegedly exceeded its Minimum Disposition Value under the Effective Return Method and the Severity of Loss Method, which was the benchmark used by Home Guaranty under the Disposition Guidelines.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>Corpuz, Sarona, and Adriano also compared the sale price to other sales in the Manila Harbour Centre area and argued that the purchase price was at par with or was even higher than other sales. Other sales allegedly sold properties for P6,072.44 per square meter in 2002, P6,000.00 per square meter in 2004, and P8,000.00 per square meter in 2007. They pointed out that the property sold at P8,000.00 per square meter was bought for a price of P16,450.00 per square meter in 1997. They insisted that the offer to sell at P20,000.00 per square meter cited by Canlas was merely an asking price which was still subject to negotiations. They further claimed that the Appraisal Report by EValue was not sufficient basis for the purchase price because it was based on asking prices, interviews, or consensus which were unsubstantiated opinions, unsupported by documents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>Corpuz, Sarona, and Adriano further pointed out that Canlas was an officer of R-II and Harbour Centre, which had been filing unfounded cases against Home Guaranty to prevent it from recovering its exposure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>Javier and Delos Santos argued that Home Guaranty was fortunate enough to have sold he properties despite lack of interested buyers, Harbour Centre's illegal stocking of iron and coal piles in the area, and R-II's failure to deliver road concreting and complete electrical facilities. They also showed that Harbour Centre offered to purchase the property for only P12,000.00 per square meter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>For their individual defenses, Bongolan argued that he was not a signatory to the sale.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> Cadano argued that he did not participate in the sale because he only joined Home Guaranty on September 1, 2008, which was after the sale's execution on July 21, 2008.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> Corpuz, Sarona, and Adriano asserted that the sale was a corporate act and that they had no authority to bind Home Guaranty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> Javier and Delos Santos contended that although they signed the Deed of Sale, they did so pursuant to Home Guaranty's Board of Directors' Resolution No. 55-2006, which authorized them to sign the document in case of the absence of Home Guaranty's President.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>In the Office of the Ombudsman's October 12, 2010 Decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> the complaint was dismissed for lack of proof that the questioned transaction was disadvantageous to the government. It found that the Home Guaranty Officers were not directly responsible for the sale, as it was the Board of Directors that was liable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> It noted that there was no evidence showing that any other offer was made for the purchase of the properties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> Thus, the fair market value of the adjacent properties alleged by Canlas was merely speculative.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br>Canlas elevated the matter to the Court of Appeals<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> after the Office of the Ombudsman denied his Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> in its December 29, 2010 Order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>In its August 11, 2011 Decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> the Court of Appeals affirmed the finding of the Office of the Ombudsman and dismissed the appeal.<br><br>The Court of Appeals found that it was Home Guaranty's Board of Directors, which approved the sale. Thus, the Home Guaranty Officers were duty bound to implement and execute this action. It also ruled that Home Guaranty was a juridical entity with a legal personality separate and distinct from those acting on its behalf.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals also noted that two (2) notices of sale were published. Only Wong made an offer after the first notice. No similar offer was made after the second notice. Home Guaranty then referred the matter to the Office of the Government Corporate Counsel and only after the latter allowed the sale to Wong did Home Guaranty approve the proposal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br><br>It also noted that the latest zonal value of the lots was only P9,750.00 per square meter, and were worth P11,668.49 per square meter using the Net Effective Return Method and P5,273.76 using the Severity of Loss Method.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><br>It also ruled that there was no evidence showing that Home Guaranty was impelled by bad faith when it agreed to the proposed purchase price.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> Likewise, it held that "[c]ourts cannot interfere with executive or legislative discretion exercised within constitutional limits."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br><br>It also found that Canlas was a stranger to the contract and had no right to dictate the parameters under which the contracting parties may determine price.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br>Thus, the Court of Appeals denied Canlas' appeal and thereafter, his Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> in its November 29, 2011 Resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br><br>Canlas then filed this Petition before this Court on February 8, 2012.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br>Canlas reiterates his claim that the purchase price of P384,715,800.00 was significantly below the properties' fair market value, which allegedly amounted to around P506,205,000.00 to P694,224,000.00. He again uses as basis the purchase prices in the years 1999 and 2001 of adjacent properties, the current sale offers, and the independent appraisal of EValue.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup><br><br>Canlas insists that the contract was grossly disadvantageous to the government considering that the government suffered damages in at least P121,489,200.00 to P309,508,200.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> He argues that the Bureau of Internal Revenue's zonal valuation is not the proper basis to determine the properties' fair market value.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup><br><br>He further argues that respondents' lack of bad faith, malice, or profit is immaterial to prove a violation under Section 3(g) of Republic Act No. 3019.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup><br><br>Canlas further insists that respondents are guilty of misconduct as they admitted to directly participating in the implementation and execution of the sale on behalf of Home Guaranty, despite knowing that it was grossly disadvantageous to the government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup><br><br>Canlas further claims that although a corporation has a separate and distinct personality from its stockholders, directors, and officers, those who participated in the commission of the corporation's crime may be held liable for the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup><br><br>Respondents filed their Comments.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup><br><br>They question the standing of Canlas to file the Petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> They emphasize that the decision of the Ombudsman is unappealable as exoneration is included under Section 27 of Republic Act No. 6770 and Rule III, Section 7 of Administrative Order No. 07, as amended by Administrative Order No. 17-03.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup><br><br>They further argue that the purchase price was reasonable and the contract was not grossly disadvantageous to the government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> They insist that the government did not suffer any loss in the sale of the properties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup><br><br>The also allege that the sale was within the powers of Home Guaranty and that it was necessary to maintain its financial stability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> They aver that since Home Guaranty had the authority to sell the properties to recover its guaranty exposure, it had the discretion to determine whether or not the proposed purchase price was fair and reasonable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> It follows then that courts cannot interfere with the discretion of other branches of government exercised within constitutional limits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup><br><br>Respondents further assert that the sale enjoys the presumption of regularity and that Canlas failed to rebut this presumption.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> They point out that the acts of the Board of Directors are presumed regular as the directors were appointed by the President of the Philippines, and they act as the latter's alter ego.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup><br><br>In any case, the sale was an act of Home Guaranty's Board of Directors.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> Respondents merely implemented and acted in accordance with a lawful directive of the Board of Directors.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup><br><br>Furthermore, they assert that the procedure they followed in selling the properties was in accordance with Home Guaranty's mandate, function, and the requirements of due diligence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup><br><br>They also insist that they cannot be held liable for gross misconduct as Canlas failed to prove their bad faith.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup><br><br>They further claim that the suit is a harassment suit at the instance of R-II, which has been filing cases to protect its interest in the asset pool and in the sold properties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup><br><br>Canlas filed a Consolidated Reply.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup><br><br>Thereafter, the parties submitted their respective Memoranda.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup><br><br>For resolution are the following issues:<br><br>First, whether or not Jerome R.

Canlas is allegedly not a party to the sale and is just a mere witness to an alleged offense against the government. They insist that only the involved government agency has the standing to appeal the Ombudsman's decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup><br><br>They further emphasize that while Canlas belatedly admitted that he is an officer of R-11 and Harbour Centre, these two (2) corporations are not parties to the proceedings, and Canlas did not present any authority from these corporations to file the complaint. Moreover, these corporations are barred by <i>res judicata</i> from questioning the sale as an indirect contempt proceeding, in which the sale was already questioned and in which the properties' restoration in the asset pool had been prayed for, had already been ruled upon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup><br><br>They also assert that the companies wherein Canlas is an officer did not participate in the public sale. Thus, they cannot collaterally attack it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, Canlas argues that he has legal standing to file the Petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup> He admits that he is R-II's Vice President for Legal, and Harbour Centre's Corporate Secretary. Both corporations are holders of subordinated Participation Certificates and are the administrators or property managers of Harbour Centre pursuant to the Trust Agreement. Thus, they both have an interest in the Smokey Mountain Asset Pool and are allegedly injured by the illegal sale. Canlas insists that he stands to be benefited or injured by the judgment in this case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup><br><br>Canlas does not have the standing to appeal this case.<br><br>The Ombudsman was given the power to evaluate an administrative complaint even though the complainant does not have a personal interest in the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup><br><br>Under Article XI, Section 12 of the 1987 Constitution, the Ombudsman has the power to act on any complaint against those in public service:<br><blockquote>Section 12. The Ombudsman and his Deputies, as protectors of the people, shall act promptly on complaints filed in any form or manner against public officials or employees of the Government, or any subdivision, agency or instrumentality thereof, including government­-owned or controlled corporations, and shall, in appropriate cases, notify the complainants of the action taken and the result thereof.<br></blockquote>In line with this constitutional mandate, Section 15(1) of Republic Act No. 6770 states:<br><blockquote>Section 15. <i>Powers, Functions and Duties</i>. - The Office of the Ombudsman shall have the following powers, functions and duties: <br>&nbsp;<br><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(1) </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">Investigate and prosecute <u><strong>on its own or on complaint by any person</strong></u>, any act or omission of any public officer or employee, office or agency, when such act or omission appears to be illegal, unjust, improper or inefficient.

The power of the Ombudsman to act on an administrative complaint by a person without any personal interest in the case is, thus, discretionary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup><br><br>In <i>Bueno v. Office of the Ombudsman</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup><br><blockquote>Petitioners are mistaken in asserting that Section 20 (4) is a bar to the Ombudsman's investigation into their acts or omissions in the case of Ranchez based on the supposed lack of personal interest on the part of private respondents who are the complainants in OMB-C-A-0065-B.<br><br>In <i>Office of the Ombudsman v. Court of Appeals</i>, the Court noted that Section 20 of RA 6770 has been clarified by Administrative Order No. 17 (AO 17), which amended Administrative Order No. 07 (AO 07), otherwise known as the Rules of Procedure of the Office of the Ombudsman. Section 4, Rule III of the amended Rules of Procedure of the Office of the Ombudsman, reads:<br><blockquote>Section 4. Evaluation. - Upon receipt of the <b>complaint</b>, the same shall be evaluated to determine whether the same <b>may be</b>:<br><br><b>a) dismissed outright for <u>any grounds stated under Section 20</u> of Republic Act No. 6770, provided, however, that <u>the dismissal thereof is not mandatory and shall be discretionary</u> on the part of the Ombudsman or the Deputy Ombudsman concerned;</b><br><br>b) treated as a grievance/request for assistance which may be referred to the Public Assistance Bureau, this Office, for appropriate action under Section 2, Rule IV of this Rules;<br><br>c) referred to other disciplinary authorities under paragraph 2, Section 23, R.A. 6770 for the taking of appropriate administrative proceedings;<br><br>d) referred to the appropriate office/agency or official for the conduct of further fact-finding investigation; or<br><br>e) docketed as an administrative case for the purpose of administrative adjudication by the Office of the Ombudsman. (Emphasis in the original; underscoring supplied.)<br></blockquote>Thus, even if the ground raised is the supposed lack of sufficient personal interest of complainants in the subject matter of the grievance under Section 20 (4), the dismissal on that ground is not mandatory and is discretionary on the part of the Ombudsman or Deputy Ombudsman evaluating the administrative complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Thus, the Ombudsman may prosecute or investigate the complaint with or without the complainant's personal interest in the outcome of the case.<br><blockquote>There is clearly no question on the legal standing of private respondents to file the administrative complaint against petitioners before the Ombudsman. Indeed, the Office of the Ombudsman is mandated to "investigate and prosecute on its own or <b>on complaint by any person</b>, any act or omission of any public officer or employee, office or agency, when such act or omission appears to be illegal, unjust, improper or inefficient." The Ombudsman can act on anonymous complaints and <i>motu proprio</i> inquire into alleged improper official acts or omissions from whatever source, <i>e.g.</i>, a newspaper. Thus, any complainant may be entertained by he Ombudsman for the latter to initiate an inquiry and investigation for alleged irregularities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup> (Emphasis in the original, citation omitted)<br></blockquote>The Ombudsman's power stems from its role as the "protector of the people," constitutionally vested with a duty to enforce laws against graft and corrupt practices committed by public officials and employees. In <i>Uy v. Sandiganbayan</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[121]</sup><br><blockquote>In September 1989, Congress passed RA 6770 providing for the functional and structural organization of the Office of the Ombudsman. As in the previous laws on the Ombudsman, RA 6770 gave the present Ombudsman not only the duty to receive and relay the people's grievances, but also the duty to investigate and prosecute for and in their behalf, civil, criminal and administrative offenses committed by government officers and employees as embodied in Sections 15 and 11 of the law.<br><br>Clearly, the Philippine Ombudsman departs from the classical Ombudsman model whose function is merely to receive and process the people's complaints against corrupt and abusive government personnel. The Philippine Ombudsman, as protector of the people, is armed with the power to prosecute erring public officers and employees, giving him an active role in the enforcement of laws on anti-graft and corrupt practices and such other offenses that may be committed by such officers and employees. The legislature has vested him with broad powers to enable him to implement his own actions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup><br></blockquote>The State interest being upheld here is the principle that public office is a public trust.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup> Public officers and employees are given duties and powers pertinent to sovereignty, which they hold in trust for, and exercise in behalf of the public.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[124]</sup> Thus, they are expected to uphold public interests. As such, they are held to higher standards not usually required of ordinary citizens to keep the faith of the people in the State.<br><br>That is why in case of administrative offenses, it is the character of the public officers or employees that is looked into. The objective is not so much as to penalize an erring officer or employee, but to improve public service and preserve the trust and confidence of the people in our government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[125]</sup><br><br>Thus, the law allows the filing of cases to the Ombudsman against public officers by any complainant. The Ombudsman is a tool to maintain this faith.<br><br>However, this particular State interest must also be balanced with two (2) other State interests, which arise after the filing of a case against a public officer or employee: (i) the State interest in affording due process to all persons; and (ii) the State interest in assuring efficiency of government functions, particularly through the protection of its officers from harassment.<br><br>While public office is a public trust, public officers must not be exposed to continued and persistent lawsuits that can derail their ability to discharge their duties once it has been found that there is no substantial evidence of their guilt. The effective administration of the State's policies is of paramount importance, which should not be hampered by time­ consuming, baseless, and repetitive suits. Thus, if there is a clear finding, supported by substantial evidence, that the public officer is not guilty of the charges, this finding must be given great weight and must be respected.<br><br>Therefore, not all may appeal to question a decision of the Ombudsman.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[126]</sup><br><br>In administrative cases filed under the Civil Service Law, an allowed appeal may only be brought by the party adversely affected by the decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[127]</sup><br><br>For administrative cases filed with the Ombudsman, Rule III of Administrative Order No. 07, as amended, states:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[128]</sup><br><blockquote>Section 7. <i>Finality and Execution of Decision</i>. - <i>Where the respondent is absolved of the charge</i>, and in case of conviction where the penalty imposed is public censure or reprimand, suspension of not more than one month, or a fine equivalent to one month salary, <i>the decision shall be final, executory and unappealable</i>.

The complainant, therefore, is not entitled to any cdrrective recourse, whether by motion for reconsideration in the Office of the Ombudsman, or by appeal to the courts, to effect a reversal of the ekoneration.

However, such SPA is unavailing for petitioner. For one, petitioner's principal, Faustino Mercado, is an agent himself and as such cam1ot further delegate his agency to another. Otherwise put, an agent cannot delegate to another the same agency.... For another, a re­ delegation of the agency would be detrimental to the principal as the second agent has no privity of contract with the former.

He did not claim to own any of the properties in the asset pool, or to have any claim in the properties covered by the contract of sale between Home Guaranty and Wong.<br><br>Thus, Canlas has no standing to file the instant appeal.<br><br><center><b>II</b><br></center><br>Assuming Canlas has the legal standing to question the ruling of the Ombudsman, he may only do so if the Ombudsman acted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. Generally, a decision by the Ombudsman absolving respondents is unappealable. However, if it is shown that the Ombudsman acted with grave abuse of discretion, then the complainant may file a Rule 65 Petition with the proper court. In <i>Dagan v. Office of the Ombudsman</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[143]</sup><br><blockquote>However, petitioner is not left without any remedy. In <i>Republic v. Francisco</i>, we ruled that decisions of administrative or quasi­ administrative ag ncies which are declared by law final and unappealable are subject to judicial review if they fail the test of arbitrariness, or upon proof of gross abuse of discretion, fraud or error of law. When such administrative or quasi-judicial bodies grossly misappreciate evidence of such nature as to compel a contrary conclusion, the Court will not hesitate to reverse the factual findings. <i>Thus, the decision of the Ombudsman may be reviewed, modified or reversed via petition for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, on a finding that it had no jurisdiction over the complaint, or of grave abuse of discretion amounting to excess or lack of jurisdiction.</i><br><br>....<br><br>Basic is the rule that the findings of fact of the Office of the Ombudsman are conclusive when supported by substantial evidence and are accorded due respect and weight, especially when, as in this case, they are affirmed by the Court of Appeals. It is only when there is grave abuse of discretion by the Ombudsman that a review of factual findings may aptly be made. In reviewing administrative decisions, it is beyond the province of this Court to weigh the conflicting evidence, determine the credibility of witnesses, or otherwise substitute its judgment for that of the administrative agency with respect to the sufficiency of evidence. It is not the function of this Court to analyze and weigh the parties' evidence all over again except when there is serious ground to believe that a possible miscarriage of justice would thereby result.<br><br>Grave abuse of discretion implies a capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment tantamount to lack of jurisdiction. The Ombudsman's exercise of power must have been done in an arbitrary or despotic manner - which must be so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of a positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined or to act at all in contemplation of law - in order to exceptionally warrant judicial intervention.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[144]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>It is incumbent upon Canlas to prove that the Ombudsman gravely abused her discretion such that she acted whimsically, arbitrarily, or grossly as to amount to a refusal to perform her duty.<br><br>However, Canlas did not argue that the Ombudsman committed grave abuse of discretion in the case at bar.
