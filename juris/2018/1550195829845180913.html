Indeed, the office of a petition for certiorari is not to correct simple errors of judgment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Grave abuse of discretion arises when there is a capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of a positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law, such as when the power is exercised in an arbitrary and despotic manner by reason of passion or hostility. It occurs when a court or tribunal violates the Constitution, the law, or existing jurisprudence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>The will of the voters is embodied in the ballots.

In relation to the aforesaid, the findings of the COMELEC, which exercises original and appellate jurisdiction over election protests involving elective officials in the regional, provincial, city, municipal, and <i>barangay </i>levels, are accorded great respect, if not finality by the Court. In fact, the documents and evidence upon which the COMELEC relies for its resolution as well as the manner it appreciates the sufficiency of said documents and evidence are ordinarily beyond the scrutiny of the Court for the COMELEC is an independent constitutional body of a level higher than statutory administrative bodies. However, the COMELEC is not infallible, such that if it is shown to have issued findings that are not supported by evidence or are contrary to the evidence, then it is deemed to have acted capriciously and whimsically. At such point in time, the Court will not hesitate to step in and correct the grave abuse of discretion committed by the COMELEC.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Given the abovementioned, petitioner has the burden of showing caprice and arbitrariness on the part of the COMELEC En Banc whose exercise of discretion is being assailed.

However, after carefully evaluating the facts and evidence in this case, the Court fails to find any action on the part of the COMELEC En Banc that constitutes grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.<br><br>A thorough review of the evidence on record reveals that there is no cogent reason to disturb the factual findings of the COMELEC En Banc. In the instant case, the Resolution of the COMELEC En Banc dated 13 October 2016 denying petitioner's motion for reconsideration of the Resolution of the COMELEC First Division dated 17 September 2015 was based on the evidence on record and the ballots were appreciated in accordance with the applicable provisions under Batas Pambansa Blg. 881 or the Omnibus Election Code of the Philippines (Omnibus Election Code) as well as existing jurisprudence. Thus, the Court does not find any ground to disturb the COMELEC En Banc's findings as the same are in consonance with law and jurisprudence.<br><br>It is important to emphasize that factual findings of the COMELEC which are supported by substantial evidence are generally binding on the Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> As held in the case of <i> Typoco v.

The Court's function, as mandated by the Constitution, is merely to check whether or not the governmental branch or agency has gone beyond the constitutional limits of its jurisdiction, not that it simply erred or has a different view. Time and again, the Court has held that a petition for <i> certiorari </i>against actions of the COMELEC is confined only to instances of grave abuse of discretion amounting to patent and substantial denial of due process, because the COMELEC is presumed to be most competent in matters falling within its domain.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote><br><br>Petitioner contends that the intention to vote for private respondent was absent in the ballot marked as Exhibit "I" and hence, should be considered as a stray vote.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> The Court begs to differ. The COMELEC En Banc correctly credited the contested ballot in favor of private respondent based on the <i>Idem Sonans </i>Rule.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> The aforesaid rule states that when a name or surname incorrectly written which, when read, has a sound similar to the name or surname of a candidate when correctly written shall be counted in such candidate's favor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> The <i>Idem Sonans </i>Rule is particularly provided for under Section 211(7) of the Omnibus Election Code, <i> viz:</i><br><br><blockquote>Section 211. <i>Rules for the appreciation of ballots. </i>– In the reading and appreciation of ballots, every ballot shall be presumed to be valid unless there is clear and good reason to justify its rejection.

"Nanie" undoubtedly sounds like the name of private respondent, <i>i.e., </i>"Ranie". Moreover, the surname of private respondent, <i>i.e., </i>Gupit, starts with a G. While the Court notes that there was a candidate for <i>Barangay Kagawad </i>under the name of "Nanie" Ballangca y Gubat, such fact alone is insufficient to invalidate the ballot. As pointed out by the COMELEC First Division, counting the questioned ballot in favor of private respondent is in line more with the basic principle that the primary objective of ballot appreciation is to discover and give effect to, rather than frustrate, the intention of the voter.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>With respect to the ballot marked as Exhibit "F," petitioner alleges that it should have been counted in his favor based on the Neighborhood and Intent Rules.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> The Neighborhood Rule states that, where the name of a candidate is not written in the proper space in the ballot, but is preceded by the name of the office for which he is a candidate, the vote should be counted as valid for said candidate.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> On the other hand, the Intent Rule originates from the principle that, in the appreciation of the ballot, the objective should be to ascertain and carry into effect the intention of the voter, if it could be determined with reasonable certainty.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> The COMELEC En Banc rightly ruled that both the Neighborhood and Intent Rules find no application in the present case, considering that there was a name written in the space provided for <i>Punong Barangay </i>and regardless of the fact that such name does not belong to any candidate vying for the said position. Section 211(19) of the Omnibus Election Code states that any vote in favor of a person who has not filed a certificate of candidacy or in favor of a candidate for an office for which he did not present himself shall be considered as a stray vote. Hence, the vote was properly considered by the COMELEC En Banc as a stray vote.<br><br>Petitioner alleges that the ballot marked as Exhibit "R-4" should have been appreciated in his favor, because such was accomplished by only one person.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> The applicable rule, with respect to the contested ballot, is the Written by Two Rule. According to the aforesaid rule, ballots which clearly appeared to have been filled by two persons before being deposited in the ballot box are null and void, in the absence of evidence <i>aliunde </i>that the second handwriting was placed on the ballot after it was deposited in the ballot box, since the presumption is that the entries on the ballot were made prior to the casting of the vote. It further holds that, where it appears that there is a marked disparity or dissimilarity between the handwriting in one part of the ballot and the handwriting in another part and that the votes had clearly not been written by the same hand, the ballot will be rejected.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Contrary to the stand of petitioner, a review of the contested ballot clearly shows that such was written by two different persons. As properly held by the COMELEC En Banc, the penmanship for <i>Punong Barangay </i>was distinctly different from the penmanship of those written for <i>Barangay Kagawad. </i>The COMELEC En Banc rightly ruled that such glaring dissimilarity can be seen by the fact that the name of the candidate for <i>Punong Barangay </i>was in all caps and straightly written, except for the last name, while those for <i>Barangay Kagawad </i>was written in italics and not in all caps.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Hence, the COMELEC En Banc rightly did not credit the subject ballot in favor of petitioner.<br><br><b><i> Issuance of a Writ of Preliminary Injunction in SPR (BRGY) No. 70-2014</i></b><br><br>Petitioner posits once more the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction by the COMELEC First Division in another case involving the same parties, <i> i.e., </i> SPR (BRGY) No. 70-2014. The Court, however, agrees with the ruling of the COMELEC En Banc that such is immaterial, because the issues involved in the present case are distinct and different from the issues in the other mentioned case.<br><br><center><b><i> Application for Provisional Injunctive Relief</i></b></center><br><br>In an application for provisional injunctive relief, it is incumbent on the applicant to establish the actual and existing right sought to be protected. The applicant must likewise prove that there is an urgent need for the writ to be issued, in order to prevent grave and irreparable injury. Failure to establish the aforementioned requisites will warrant the Court's denial of the application. In the present case, petitioner failed to establish such requisites.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>To support his application for provisional injunctive relief, petitioner stresses that only one vote separates the parties and thus, "the victory of private respondent and the loss of petitioner are certainly not convincingly clear."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Petitioner further alleges that, because the issues raised in the instant petition are of a serious character, the interest of justice and equity will not be served if such issues will be rendered moot and academic by the premature execution of the Resolution of the COMELEC First Division dated 17 September 2015 and the Resolution of the COMELEC En Banc dated 13 October 2016.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Petitioner merely relies on the aforesaid bare allegations to support his application for provisional injunctive relief. He has not shown that he has a clear and unmistakable right to be protected or a right <i> in esse </i> much less that there is a material and substantial invasion of such right and that there is an urgent and paramount necessity for the writ to prevent the infliction of irreparable injury. The Court notes that the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction is regarded as an "extraordinary event," being a "strong arm of equity or a transcendent remedy."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> The power to issue such a writ "should be exercised sparingly, with utmost care, and with great caution and deliberation."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br><center><b><i> Conclusion</i></b></center><br><br>In summary, the Court holds that the COMELEC En Banc did not commit grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in crediting the ballot marked as Exhibit "I" in favor of private respondent and not crediting the ballots marked as Exhibits "F" and "R-4" in favor of petitioner. To reiterate, grave abuse of discretion connotes a capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, or an arbitrary and despotic exercise of power because of passion or personal hostility. The grave abuse of discretion must be so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of a positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law. The aforementioned does not obtain in the present case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petition for certiorari is <b>DISMISSED.</b> The Resolution of the COMELEC First Division dated 17 September 2015 and the Resolution of the COMELEC En Banc dated 13 October 2016 are <b>AFFIRMED.</b><br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Peralta, Bersamin, Del Castillo, Perlas-Bernabe, Leonen, Caguioa, A.
