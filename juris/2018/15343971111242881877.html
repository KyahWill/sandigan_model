CR HC No. 01742 affirming, with modification as to the award of damages, the 5 September 2012 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court (<em>RTC</em>), <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</span> Bohol, finding him guilty of Rape as defined and penalized under Article (<em>Art.</em>) 266-A of the Revised Penal Code (<em>RPC</em>).<p align="center"> <b>THE FACTS</b> </p><p> The accused-appellant was charged with Rape in an information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> docketed as Crim. Case No. 06-1748, the accusatory portion of which reads: </p><blockquote> <p> That on or about the 15th day of December 2005, in the Municipality of ZZZ, Province of Bohol, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, acting as Family Court, the above-named accused with lewd designs, grab AAA, a minor, she being born on November 27, 1992, while she was about to walk away from the accused, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully, and feloniously drag the victim towards a nearby coconut plantation and with the use of force, threat, and intimidation and thereafter said accused inserted his erect penis into the vagina of said AAA, thus, the accused succeeded in having carnal knowledge with the said victim without her consent and against her will, to the damage and prejudice of the said offended party. </p> <p> Acts committed contrary to the provisions of Article 335<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> of the Revised Penal Code as amended by R.A. No. 7659<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> and R.A. No. 8353.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> When arraigned, accused-appellant pleaded not guilty<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> thus, trial proceeded with the prosecution presenting AAA,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> BBB who is the mother of AAA, and Dr. Analita N. Auza.</p><p> To prove his defense, the accused-appellant took the witness stand. </p><p> <b><i>The Version of the Prosecution</i></b> </p><p> At around 7:00 a.m. on 15 December 2005, AAA, a thirteen-year-old high school student, was at her school preparing decorations for her school's Christmas party when her classmate told her that somebody was looking for her at the waiting shed. When she went there, AAA saw accused-appellant who told her that her mother sent her P100.00 for her exchange gift but that she needed to have the hundred-peso bill changed because he used the P50.00 for his fare. AAA got the money but because she still had classes, the accusedÂ­ appellant had to return later to get the P50.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></p><p> At about 1:00 p.m., accused-appellant returned to the waiting shed. AAA was handing him the P50.00, he pulled the handle of her bag, detaching it. Accused-appellant then pulled her towards the coconut plantation, pushed her to the ground, removed her underwear, raised her skirt, and mounted her. While AAA was crying, accused-appellant inserted his penis into her vagina and then made a push-and-pull movement, kissed her lips, and touched her breasts. After having carnal knowledge of AAA, accused-appellant told her not to tell BBB what happened, otherwise he would kill BBB and her siblings. Afraid that accused-appellant would make good his threat, AAA did not tell her mother what happened to her. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> </p><p> In the afternoon of 2 January 2006, accused-appellant chased AAA as she alighted from a jeep on her way home to CCC, BBB's sister, with whom AAA was then staying as CCC's house was nearer her school. AAA ran when she noticed that accused-appellant was behind her and stopped only when she saw him take another direction. When the bystanders who saw accused-appellant chase AAA told CCC about it she, together with a barangay tanod, proceeded to BBB's house and informed her what accused-appellant had done.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> </p><p> When BBB arrived at CCC's house, she inquired from AAA if she was raped. Because AAA refused to answer, the barangay tanod advised BBB to submit AAA to a medical examination. AAA agreed but requested that the examination be done the following day as it was already late. At around 11:00 p.m., AAA confided to BBB that she was raped twice by accused-appellant; once, when she was nine years old and the second, on 15 December 2005. AAA admitted that she never told her about it as she was afraid of his threat that he would kill her and AAA's siblings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> </p><p> On 4 January 2006, AAA<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> and BBB<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> went to the police station to submit their statements regarding the 15 December 2005 incident. In her statement, AAA narrated that accused-appellant started raping her since she was nine years old and that these had taken place more than ten times.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></p><p> On 9 January 2006, AAA was physically examined by Dr. Auza, the municipal health officer. AAA told Dr. Auza that she was raped several times since she was nine years old. Dr. Auza arrived at the following findings and remarks after a perineal examination of AAA: </p><blockquote> <table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="11%">Findings: </td> <td width="89%">Nulliparous, scanty pubic hair. <br> Presence of healed lacerated wound at 2, 7 and 11 o'clock sites of the vaginal opening.</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td height="40">Remarks: </td> <td>Hymen not intact <br> Vaginal penetration is evident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote> <p>In her analysis, Dr. Auza remarked that the laceration at the vaginal opening could have been caused by the forcible entry of a hard object, possibly, a male genitalia.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></p> <p> <b><i>The Version of the Defense</i></b> </p><p> Accused-appellant is the husband of DDD, BBB's sister; thus, AAA calls him "manong." Sometime in 2005, DDD confirmed to accused-appellant that she had quarrelled with BBB when BBB called her daughter a prostitute. Accused-appellant was ashamed that BBB and DDD were quarrelling despite being siblings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></p><p> One morning until 3:00 p.m. on 15 December 2005, the accused-appellant and his two children cleaned the garden outside their house, which was just across the house of AAA. Accused-appellant rested thereafter inside the house and, at about 4:00 p.m., fetched water from the barangay deepwell. After he was done, he stayed home until he went to sleep.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> </p><p> Alleging he did not commit any offense, accused-appellant did not execute any counter-affidavit when arrested in 2006 by the police.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></p><p> <b><i>The Ruling of the RTC</i></b></p><p> The RTC held that AAA's testimony was straightforward and believable, coming from a child who had neither reason to tell a lie nor motive to falsely charge accused-appellant. While the RTC took note of the fact that there were only the medical certificate and the testimony of the physician to corroborate AAA's testimony, these, however, did not weaken the case since she was able to sufficiently prove that accused-appellant raped her on 15 December 2005. The RTC stressed that jurisprudence provides that great weight is given to the testimony of a child who was a rape victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></p><p> On the one hand, the RTC found weak accused-appellant's defense of denial compared to AAA's positive testimony. Moreover, accused-appellant's alibi was not only unbelievable but was also uncorroborated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></p><p> Finding that the elements of Art. 266-A of the RPC was successfully proven by the prosecution, the RTC rendered its decision the decretal portion of which reads as follows: </p><blockquote> <p> WHEREFORE, considering the foregoing, the court hereby finds accused Pedro Rupal GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt for the crime of Rape. In accordance with the penalty set forth under Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code, this court hereby sentences him to suffer the penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA. He is likewise sentenced to pay civil indemnity to the victim AAA in the amount of FIFTY THOUSAND PESOS (P50,000.00), Philippine Currency.</p> <p> As it appears on record that the accused is under detention at the BJMP, <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">xxxxxxx</span> Bohol, said accused shall be credited with the full period of his detention subject to an assessment by the jail warden on his demeanour while in said detention center.</p> <p> SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Believing that the RTC erred in its decision, accused-appellant appealed to the CA.</p><p> <b><i>The Ruling of the CA</i></b></p><p> The CA found no merit in the appeal. The CA sustained the RTC's evaluation as to AAA's credibility since the trial judge had the advantage of examining the real and testimonial evidence before it as well as the demeanor of the witnesses. The CA ruled that AAA positively, candidly, and categorically narrated the gruesome and terrifying ordeal she experienced in the hands of accused-appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></p><p> The CA did not find merit in accused-appellant's contention that there was inconsistency between AAA's testimony that she was raped by him since she was nine years old until she turned thirteen, with that of BBB who claimed that AAA admitted to her that she was raped only twice. The CA ruled that AAA's young and fragile mind, and with the accused-appellant's threat still existing, made her disclose that she was raped only twice. With the ongoing trial and knowing that she and her family could no longer be harmed by accused-appellant, she had the courage to reveal that the sexual assaults took place even before she was nine years old. Additionally, the CA held that the filing of only one criminal charge against accused-appellant does not in any way belie that she was raped by accused-appellant on 15 December 2005.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></p><p> Finding that all the elements of rape had been established by the prosecution, the CA affirmed the RTC decision convicting accused-appellant but modified the award of damages, <em>viz</em>: </p><blockquote> <p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the foregoing premises considered, the appeal is <strong>DENIED</strong>.

No. 8353 to prosper, it must be proved that: (1) the offender had carnal knowledge of a woman, and (2) he accomplished such act through force or intimidation, or when she was deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious, or when she was under 12 years of age or was demented.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> The gravamen of rape under Art. 266-A (1) is carnal knowledge of "a woman against her will or without her consent."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> In this case where it was alleged to have been committed by force, threat or intimidation, "it is imperative for the prosecution to establish that the element of voluntariness on the part of the victim be absolutely lacking.

Moreover, he claimed that it was not shown that he threatened AAA from the waiting shed until the alleged rape was consummated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></p> <p> In any rape case, the law does not impose a burden on the rape victim to prove resistance because it is not an element of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> That AAA did not offer any resistance to accused-appellant or did not shout for help does not find that she voluntarily submitted to his hideous acts considering that there is no uniform behavior that can be expected from those who had the misfortune of being sexually molested.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> It is important to state the enlightened teaching that the workings of the human mind placed under emotional stress are unpredictable, and people react differently: some may shout, others may faint, and still others may be shocked into insensibility even if there may be a few who may openly welcome the intrusion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></p><p> The absence of any threat to AAA from accused-appellant at the waiting shed does not disprove the fact that he had carnal knowledge of her. It will be noted that pursuant to Art. 266-A of the RPC, rape is committed when a man has carnal knowledge of a woman either through force, or threat, or intimidation, among other circumstances. Thus, proof that the offense was committed either through any of the three means, i.e., force, threat, or intimidation, will suffice to warrant a conviction as long as this is satisfactorily proven by the prosecution.</p><p> "Force, as an element of rape, must be sufficient to consummate the purposes which the accused had in mind. On the other hand, intimidation must produce fear that if the victim does not yield to the bestial demands of the accused, something would happen to her at that moment or even thereafter as when she is threatened with death if she reports the incident."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> In this case, AAA was able to credibly narrate that it was through force that accused-appellant was able to carry out his evil desire by dragging her from the shed to the coconut plantation and there pushing her to the ground to abuse her. In the same vein, the circumstance of intimidation was demonstrated by accused-appellant's threat that he would kill her mother and her siblings once she revealed to BBB what he did to her.</p><p> Accused-appellant fustigates the alleged disturbing and contradicting claims of AAA that she was repeatedly raped by him since she was nine years old until she reached thirteen, yet, she had intimated to BBB that she was raped only twice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> </p><p> Noteworthily, whether AAA was raped twice or for several more times by accused-appellant is immaterial to this case considering that this is neither an issue nor a material element for the successful prosecution of the offense of rape. Notwithstanding this, the Court is convinced by the CA's findings on the alleged inconsistency as to the number of times AAA had been raped by accused-appellant, viz: </p><blockquote> <p> x x x It is eminently probable that at the time AAA was confronted by her mother on January 2, 2006, she was in state of disarray and confusion. She was possibly perplexed on what to do and on what to say to her mother as she was afraid that the accused-appellant might carry out his prior threats to kill her mother and siblings. Such threats, gravely intimidating and instilling tremendous fear in her young and fragile mind, probably caused AAA to disclose to her mother that she was raped only twice. However, during the trial proper, knowing that she and her family could no longer be harmed by the accused-appellant, took courage and narrated that the sexual assaults occurred even before when she was only nine years of age.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Apparently, that same degree of courage manifested by AAA before the trial court when she claimed that she was raped several times by accused-appellant was previously exhibited before the police station when she filed her complaint against him, viz: </p><blockquote> <p> x x x</p> <p> Q. Why are you here before the office of Trinidad police station x x x? <br> A. I am here to file a formal complaint against PEDRO RUPAL <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">xxxxxxxxx</span> for raping me. </p> <p>Q. When and where did this happen? <br> A, The last incident was on December 15, 2005 at 1:00 in the afternoon more or less at the barangay YYY, ZZZ, Bohol particularly at the coconut plantation. </p> <p>Q. How many times did this incident happen?<br> A. More than ten times. </p> <p>Q. Can you please narrate the incident? <br> A. When I was 9 years old, he (Pedro Rupal) raped me at the kitchen of our neighbor and uttered some threatening words saying that he would kill my mother, brothers, and sisters if I reveal or report what he did to me. So I decided not to report to anybody about the incident. That the evil desire of my uncle was repeated more than ten times but the last incident happened on December 15, 2005 in the morning the same date at barangay YYY, ZZZ, Bohol where I am studying.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p>Likewise, feeling that she was already safe and protected by the authorities, AAA thereafter confided to Dr. Auza that she was raped several times starting when she was nine years old.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> </p><p> To stress, inconsistencies on minor details and collateral matters do not affect the substance, truth, or weight of the victim's testimonies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Even granting that there were inconsistencies in AAA's claim as to the number of times accused-appellant had carnal knowledge of her, jurisprudence instructs that "when the offended party is of tender age and immature, courts are inclined to give credit to her account of what transpired, considering not only her relative vulnerability but also the shame to which she would be exposed if the matter to which she testified is not true. Youth and immaturity are generally badges of truth and sincerity."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Courts generally give leeway to minor witnesses when relating traumatic incidents of the past.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></p><p> Accused-appellant futilely asserts that what further taints AAA's credibility was that, despite her claim that he had carnal knowledge of her for several times, only one case of rape was filed against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> </p><p> Accused-appellant failed to consider that the established rule is that it is the task of the prosecutor, and not the victim, to file a criminal case before the court. Moreover, the fact that there was only one case filed against accusedÂ­ appellant cannot translate to a finding that he did not have carnal knowledge of AAA on 15 December 2005, especially considering that the evidence on record firmly established the elements of the offense as proven by the prosecution.</p><p> Significantly, AAA's testimony that she was raped finds support in Dr. Auza's medical findings that the lacerations in AAA's vaginal opening could have been caused by the forcible entry of a hard object, possibly a male genitalia, and that her hymen was no longer intact.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> It is emphasized that when a rape victim's allegation is corroborated by a physician's finding of penetration, "there is sufficient foundation to conclude the existence of the essential requisite of carnal knowledge."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Such medico-legal findings bolster the prosecution's testimonial evidence. Together, these pieces of evidence produce a moral certainty that the accused-appellant indeed raped the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> The "[p]hysical evidence is evidence of the highest order. It speaks more eloquently than a hundred witnesses."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Moreover, a young girl's revelation that she had been raped, coupled with her voluntary submission to medical examination and willingness to undergo public trial where she could be compelled to give out the details of an assault on her dignity, cannot be so easily dismissed as mere concoction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></p><p> The legal teaching trenchantly maintained in our jurisprudence is that when the decision hinges on the credibility of witnesses and their respective testimonies, the trial court's observations and conclusions deserve great respect and are accorded finality, unless the records show facts or circumstances of material weight and substance that the lower court overlooked, misunderstood or misappreciated and which, if properly considered, would alter the result of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> The Court explained the reason for this teaching as follows: </p><blockquote> <p> x x x The trial judge has the advantage of observing the witness' deportment and manner of testifying. x x x The trial judge, therefore, can better determine if witnesses are telling the truth, being in the ideal position to weigh conflicting testimonies. Unless certain facts of substance and value were overlooked which, if considered, might affect the result of the case, its assessment must be respected for it had the opportunity to observe the conduct and demeanor of the witnesses while testifying and detect if they were lying. The rule finds an even more stringent application where said findings are sustained by the Court of Appeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> It must be stressed that the Court had conscientiously observed in this case the three principles that had consistently guided it in reviewing rape cases, <em>viz</em>: (a) an accusation of rape can be made with facility, and while the accusation is difficult to prove, it is even more difficult for the person accused, although innocent, to disprove; ( b) considering the intrinsic nature of the crime, only two persons being usually involved, the testimony of the complainant should be scrutinized with great caution; and ( c) the evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merit, and cannot be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense; but found nothing to depart from the ruling of the trial court that AAA's testimony was credible and straightforward, especially that this was sustained by the CA. "In rape cases, the credibility of the victim is almost always the single most important issue. If the testimony of the victim passes the test of credibility, which means it is credible, natural, convincing and consistent with human nature and the normal course of things, the accused may be convicted solely on that basis."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> On the one hand, records will confirm that the accused-appellant miserably failed to show in his appeal that the RTC and the CA overlooked a material fact that would have changed the outcome of the case or misunderstood a circumstance of consequence in their evaluation of AAA's credibility. </p><table width="50%" border="0" cellpadding="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><b><i>The defenses of denial and alibi of the accused-appellant were weak.</i></b></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>To extricate himself from liability, accused-appellant proffers the defense that during the time material to the case he was fetching water from the well and that thereafter he stayed home. </p><p> Nothing is more settled in criminal law jurisprudence than that alibi and denial cannot prevail over the positive and categorical testimony and identification of the complainant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> For the defense of alibi to prosper, the accused must prove that he was somewhere else when the offense was committed and that he was so far away that it was not possible for him to have been physically present at the place of the crime or at its immediate vicinity at the time of its commission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> On the one hand, denial is an inherently weak defense and constitutes self-serving negative evidence, which cannot be accorded greater evidentiary weight than the positive declaration by a credible witness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> </p><p> The Court takes note of the fact that, notwithstanding the grave charge against accused-appellant, not one of his children took the witness stand to fortify his defense that he was at home the whole day of 15 December 2005. Likewise, despite accused-appellant's claim that there were several people who saw him fetching water from the well in the afternoon of that day,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> not one of them testified to reinforce his claim. Clearly, petitioner's alibi easily crumbled in the absence of any evidence to prove that it was improbable for him to be at the scene of the crime.</p><p> In his hopeless effort to prove the implausibility that he had carnal knowledge of AAA, he asserts that he saw her only after 15 December 2005.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> AAA was the niece of accused-appellant, she being the daughter of his wife's sister.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Additionally, accused-appellant admitted that he had been residing in Bohol since 1975 and that his nearest neighbor was AAA's family.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> More significant is accused-appellant's acknowledgement that his daughter and AAA were classmates and friends, and they went to school and back to their respective homes together.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> These facts, confirmed by accused-appellant, himself, compellingly demolish his incredible assertion that he could not have committed the offense charged because he saw AAA only after 15 December 2005.</p><p> Accused-appellant's averment that the instant case was filed against him because of the conflict between his wife and BBB<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> likewise fails to convince. </p><p> It was incredible that BBB would allow AAA to report to the authorities, submit to medical examination, and undergo a humiliating public trial anchored on an allegedly trumped-up charge if her sole purpose was to get even with her sister. The Court takes note of the fact that based on the testimony of the accused-appellant, it was BBB who started the alleged feud with DDD when BBB called DDD's daughter a prostitute. Since BBB had already offended the accused-appellant's family, it was incredible that she would be on the offensive again by making it appear that accused-appellant had carnal knowledge of AAA. For sure, what convinces the Court of the speciousness of the alleged conflict between BBB and her sister was AAA's credible narration of the horrid details on what happened on 15 December 2005, which she could have not known due to her tender age. Simply put, these details were known to AAA because these were the truth. Finding significance here is the jurisprudence that alleged motives of family feuds, resentment or revenge are not uncommon defenses, and have never swayed the Court from lending full credence to the testimony of a complainant who remains steadfast throughout direct and cross-examinations, especially a minor, as in this case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup></p><p> <b><i>The penalty and the award of damages</i></b> </p><p> Under Art. 266-B of R.A.
