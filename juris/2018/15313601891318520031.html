CR HC No. 06009, which affirmed the 17 December 2012 Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court (<em>RTC</em>), Branch 219, Quezon City, finding him guilty of Murder for the death of Reggie Tan y Arañes (<em>Reggie</em>).
<p align="center"> <b>THE FACTS</b>
</p><p> Accused-appellant was charged with murder in an Information 
docketed as Criminal Case No. Q05-136086, the accusatory portion of 
which reads:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> That on or about the 4th day of August 2005 in Quezon City, 
Philippines, the above-named accused, with intent to kill, qualified by 
evident premeditation and treachery, did then and there willfully, 
unlawfully, and feloniously attack, assault, and employ personal 
violence upon the person of REGGIE TAN y ARANES, by then and there 
stabbing him with a bladed weapon hitting him on the different parts of 
his body, thereby inflicting upon him serious and mortal wounds which 
were the direct and immediate cause of his untimely death, to the damage
 and prejudice of the heirs of said offended party.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> </p>
  </blockquote>
<p>After the accused-appellant pleaded not guilty to the charge against him,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> trial proceeded.</p>
<p> <b><i>Version of the Prosecution</i></b></p>
<p> To fortify its case against the accused-appellant, the prosecution called to the witness stand Rollane Enriquez (<i>Rollane</i>) who testified that: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>On 4 August 2005, at about 6:00 p.m., while Rollane, Reggie, and Joseph delos Santos (<em>Joseph</em>)
 were at a store talking, the accused-appellant suddenly sneaked from 
Reggie's back, grabbed Reggie's neck with his left arm, and drove a 
knife at Reggie's side. Reggie was able to push away the 
accused-appellant causing both of them to fall down. Reggie got to his 
feet and ran away but when he stumbled the accused-appellant caught up 
with him and stabbed him twice in his chest while he was in a supine 
position. Reggie was brought to the hospital where he was pronounced 
dead on arrival.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></p>
  </blockquote>
<p> The other witnesses of the prosecution were no longer called to the 
witness stand after the parties agreed as to the nature of their 
testimony, <em>viz</em>: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>SPO1 Salvador Casanova Buenviaje (<em>Buenviaje</em>) – (a) that he
 was the investigating officer of the case; (b) that it was in the 
performance of his duty that he .investigated the case; (c) that he 
caused the preparation of the necessary documents; (d) that he took the 
testimonies of the private complainant and the complaining witnesses;

  </blockquote>
<p><b><i>Version of the Defense</i></b></p>
<p> The accused-appellant was at home in the afternoon of 4 August 2005,
 when Reggie, armed with a kitchen knife, entered the living room and 
threatened to stab the accused-appellant's two siblings – one a 
mongoloid and the other mentally ill. When Reggie saw the 
accused-appellant, he scampered away and went to a nearby store.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> </p>
<p>The accused-appellant followed Reggie to the store intending to hurt 
him because of the threats he made. Accused-appellant tried to grab the 
knife from Reggie but while they grappled for its possession, the 
accused-appellant got hold of it and stabbed the right side of Reggie's 
body.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></p>
<p> <b><i>The RTC ruling</i></b>
</p><p> The RTC held that Rollane categorically and positively 
identified the accused-appellant as the one who stabbed Reggie with a 
knife, which the arresting officers confiscated. The RTC further ruled 
that treachery and evident premeditation attended the killing of Reggie;
 thus, it concluded that the accused-appellant should be held liable for
 murder.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> 
</p><p>The dispositive portion of the RTC decision reads: 
</p><blockquote>
  <p>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered finding the accused Rodolfo 
Advincula y Mondano GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of 
Murder and is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of<em> reclusion perpetua</em> for the death of Reggie Tan y Arañes. </p>
  <p>Accused Rodolfo Advincula y Mondano is further adjudged to pay the 
heirs of Reggie Tan y Arañes, represented by his mother, Teresita A. 
Tan, the following amounts:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> 1) Php75,000.00 as civil indemnity;<br> 
      2) Php50,000.00 as moral damages; <br>
      3) Php30,000.00 as exemplary damages; <br>
      4) Php67,460.00 as actual damages; and <br>
      5) Php413,070.00 by way of lost earnings, plus costs of suit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p> Not contented with the RTC resolution of the case, the accused-appellant appealed before the CA.
</p><p> <b><i>The Ruling of the CA</i></b>
</p><p> The CA sustained the position of the accused-appellant that the 
qualifying circumstance of evident premeditation was absent in this case
 since the prosecution failed to show that the accused-appellant planned
 to kill Reggie. Notwithstanding the absence of evident premeditation, 
the CA maintained the finding of the RTC that treachery attended the 
assault upon Reggie; thus, it held the accused-appellant liable for 
murder. The CA found that the penalty imposed by the RTC was in 
accordance with law and the award of damages was in conformity with 
jurisprudence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> 
</p><p>The <i>fallo</i> of the CA decision reads: 
</p><blockquote>
  <p><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the instant appeal is <b>DENIED</b>. The Decision
 dated 17 December 2012 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, 
Branch 219, in Criminal Case No. Q-05-136086 is hereby <b>AFFIRMED</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> </p>

<p>Jurisprudence emphatically maintains that when the issues involve 
matters of credibility of witnesses, the findings of the trial court, 
its calibration of the testimonies, and its assessment of the probative 
weight thereof, as well as its conclusions anchored on said findings, 
are accorded high respect, if not conclusive effect.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>
 Hence, unless some facts or circumstances of weight were overlooked, 
misapprehended, or misinterpreted as to materially affect the 
disposition of the case,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> factual findings of the RTC are accorded the highest degree of respect especially if the CA has adopted and confirmed them.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>

</p><p> Both the RTC and the CA found the testimony of Rollane credible 
and straightforward compared to the accused-appellant's claim that he 
acted in defense of his relatives. The Court found no reason to deviate 
from this finding considering that the records failed to prove that the 
RTC and the CA had overlooked a material fact that otherwise would 
change the outcome of the case or had misunderstood a circumstance of 
consequence in their evaluation of the credibility of the witnesses.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> 
</p><p>The record is bereft of any showing that Rollane had ill motive 
to testify against the accused-appellant; thus, justifying the 
application of the well-established jurisprudence that when there is no 
evidence to show any improper motive on the part of the witness to 
testify falsely against the accused or to pervert the truth, the logical
 conclusion is that no such motive exists and that the former's 
testimony is worthy of full faith and credit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> 
</p><p>Equally important was that the testimony of Rollane as to the 
number of Reggie's wounds an how he sustained these found support in the
 medico-legal report<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> and the diagram<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>
 of Dr. Palmero. Rollane testified that the accused-appellant used his 
left arm to put a headlock on Reggie, and that with his right hand 
stabbed Reggie's side. Two more stab blows were delivered by the 
accused-appellant to Reggie's chest while he was already in a supine 
position after he stumbled. Dr. Palmero's report indicated that Reggie 
sustained the following fatal wounds which coincided with Rollane's 
narration, to wit:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> Stab wound, left anterior chest-midclavicular line, measuring 3.2 cm x 1cm, 6 cm from the AML; </p>
  <p>Stab wound, left anterior chest-anterior axillary line, measuring 3.2 cm x 1.2 cm, 11 cm from the AML; and </p>
  <p>Stab wound, abdomen-right upper quadrant, measuring 4 [cm] x 1.5 cm, 17 cm from the AML.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p> Dr. Palmero's findings readily disprove the contention of the 
accused-appellant that he stabbed Reggie only once. Hence, the legal 
teaching that where the physical evidence on record runs counter to the 
testimonies of witnesses and the primacy of the physical evidence must 
be upheld,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> finds its significance in this case. 
</p><p>On the one hand, Dr. Palmero's findings strengthen Rollane's 
testimony that Reggie stumbled after he ran away from the 
accused-appellant, <em>viz</em>: 
</p><blockquote>
  <p>Scrapped (sic) wound, right palm, measuring 1 cm x 0.8 cm <br>
    Area of multiple abrasions, right knee, 7 cm x 4 cm <br>
    Area of multiple abrasions, left knee, 8 cm x 4 cm<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p> It must be remembered that an accused who pleads a justifying circumstance 	under 	Article 	(<i>Art.</i>) 11<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> 	of 	the 	Revised 	Penal 	Code (<i>RPC</i>) admits to the commission of acts, which would otherwise engender criminal liability.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>
 If the accused admits the killing, the burden of evidence, as 
distinguished from burden of proof, is shifted on him to prove with 
clear and convincing evidence the essential elements of the justifying 
circumstance of defense of a relative,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> <i>viz</i>:
 (1) unlawful aggression by the victim; (2) reasonable necessity of the 
means employed to prevent or repel the aggression; and (3) in case the 
provocation was given by the person attacked, that the person making the
 defense took no part in the provocation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>
 The justification for the shift in the assumption of the burden is that
 the accused, having admitted the killing, is required to rely on the 
strength of his own evidence, not on the weakness of the prosecution's 
evidence which, even if it were weak, could not be disbelieved in view 
of his admission.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> 
</p><p>The presence of unlawful aggression, which is a condition <i>sine qua non</i> for upholding self-defense,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> has been described as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> Unlawful aggression on the part of the victim is the primordial 
element of the justifying circumstance of self-defense. Without unlawful
 aggression, there can be no justified killing in defense of oneself. 
The test for the presence of unlawful aggression under the circumstances
 is whether the aggression from the victim put in real peril the life or
 personal safety of the person defending himself; the peril must not be 
an imagined or imaginary threat. Accordingly, the accused must establish
 the concurrence of three elements of unlawful aggression, namely: (a) 
there must be a physical or material attack or assault; (b) the attack 
or assault must be actual, or, at least, imminent; and (c) the attack or
 assault must be unlawful.</p>
  <p> Unlawful aggression is of two kinds: (a) actual or material 
unlawful aggression; and (b) imminent unlawful aggression. Actual or 
material unlawful aggression means an attack with physical force or with
 a weapon, an offensive act that positively determines the intent of the
 aggressor to cause the injury. Imminent unlawful aggression means an 
attack that is impending or at the point of happening; it must not 
consist in a mere threatening attitude, nor must it be merely imaginary,
 but must be offensive and positively strong (like aiming a revolver at 
another with intent to shoot or opening a knife and making a motion as 
if to attack). Imminent unlawful aggression must not be a mere 
threatening attitude of the victim, such as pressing his right hand to 
his hip where a revolver was holstered, accompanied by an angry 
countenance, or like aiming to throw a pot.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p> The prosecution was able to establish from the testimony of Rollane,
 which the Court holds as convincing and forthright, that there was no 
unlawful aggression on the part of Reggie when he was stabbed by the 
accused-appellant. Records will confirm that the attack by the 
accused-appellant on Reggie was swift and deliberate and was not 
preceded by any provocation on the part of the latter.</p><p> The 
accused-appellant contends that the safety of his siblings was 
compromised because the threat to harm them was not a mere stance but a 
positively strong act of real danger considering that Reggie has already
 entered his house.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></p><p>
 Even granting for the sake of argument that the defense's version of 
the events be ruled as credible, the Court still cannot find any valid 
justification to declare that there existed unlawful aggression on the 
part of Reggie when he was stabbed by the accused-appellant. Unlawful 
aggression, as defined in the RPC, contemplates assault or at least 
threatened assault of an immediate and imminent kind.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>
 The test therefore for the presence of unlawful aggression under the 
circumstances is whether the aggression from the victim put in real 
peril the life or personal safety of the person defending himself; the 
peril must not be imagined or an imaginary threat.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>
</p><p> The accused-appellant admitted that no confrontation between him
 and Reggie took place inside the house, nor did they talk to each 
other,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> and nor were his siblings hurt by Reggie.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>
 These admissions readily negate unlawful aggression on the part of 
Reggie. But even assuming for the sake of argument that initially there 
was unlawful aggression on Reggie's part, such unlawful aggression 
ceased to exist when he left the accused-appellant's house and proceeded
 to a nearby store.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> At 
that point, too, it was obvious that there was no longer any aggression 
from Reggie that put in peril the life of the accused-appellant and his 
siblings.
</p><p> Worse, accused-appellant confessed that he followed Reggie to the store with the specific intention of hurting Reggie;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>
 thus, controverting his claim that he was only defending himself or his
 siblings from the alleged threats of Reggie. Corollarily, when the 
accused-appellant stabbed Reggie, the former was already the unlawful 
aggressor retaliating to the alleged earlier unlawful aggression of the,
 latter. Jurisprudence dictates, however, that a person making a defense
 has no more right to attack an aggressor when the unlawful aggression 
has ceased,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> as is true in this case. Aggression, if not continuous, does not constitute aggression warranting defense of one's self.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></p><p>
 Retaliation is not the same as self-defense. In retaliation, the 
aggression that was begun by the injured party already ceased when the 
accused attacked him, while in self-defense the aggression still existed
 when the aggressor was injured by the accused.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>
 When unlawful aggression ceases, the defender no longer has any right 
to kill or wound the former aggressor, otherwise, retaliation and not 
self-defense is committed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>
 As case law puts it, there can be no self-defense unless the victim 
committed unlawful aggression against the person who resorted to 
self-defense.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></p><p> 
Suffice it to say that a plea of self-defense is belied by the nature, 
number, and location of the wounds inflicted on the victim since the 
gravity of said wounds is indicative of a determined effort to kill and 
not just to defend.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> The 
stab blows delivered by the accused-appellant to Reggie resulted in 
three fatal wounds that pierced his heart, lung, and liver. These wounds
 unmistakably support the conclusion as to accused-appellant's intent to
 kill Reggie.</p><p> The claim of the accused-appellant that Reggie 
entered his house armed with a knife and threatened his siblings 
miserably failed in view of the absence of evidence, documentary or 
testimonial, to fortify it. It must be stressed that self-defense, 
cannot be justifiably appreciated when uncorroborated by independent and
 competent evidence or when it is extremely doubtful by itself.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup>
</p><p> There can be no self-defense, whether complete or incomplete, 
unless the victim had committed unlawful aggression against the person 
who resorted to self-defense.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>
 The absence of any unlawful aggression on the part of Reggie renders 
ineffectual the accused-appellant's alibi of defense of a relative. 
Consequently, the two other essential elements of self-defense would 
have no factual and legal bases without any unlawful aggression to 
prevent or repel.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> For this reason, it becomes immaterial to further discuss the two other elements of defense of a relative.

    <td><div align="justify"><b><i>The crime committed by the accused-appellant was murder.</i></b></div></td>

</tbody></table>
<p>The accused-appellant was charged with and convicted of murder under Art. 248<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> of the RPC.
</p><p> To warrant a conviction for the crime of murder, the following 
essential elements must be present: (1) that a person was killed; (2) 
that the accused killed him or her; (3) that the killing was attended by
 any of the qualifying circumstances mentioned in Article 248 of the 
RPC; and (4) that the killing is not parricide or infanticide.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup></p><p>
 There is no issue that the first, second, and fourth elements are 
present in this case. On the third element, while the CA upheld the 
finding of the RTC that treachery attended the killing of Reggie by the 
accused-appellant, it ruled against the presence of evident 
premeditation.</p><p> Jurisprudence maintains that there is treachery 
when a victim is set upon by the accused without warning, as when the 
accused attacks the victim from behind, or when the attack is sudden and
 unexpected and without the slightest provocation on the part of the 
victim or is, in any event, so sudden and unexpected that the victim is 
unable to defend himself, thus insuring the execution of the criminal 
act without risk to the assailant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup>
 "A finding of the existence of treachery should be based on clear and 
convincing evidence. Such evidence must be as conclusive as the fact of 
killing itself and its existence cannot be presumed. In the absence of 
proof  beyond reasonable doubt that treachery attended the killing of 
the victim, the crime is homicide, not murder."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>
 But regardless of whether it is murder or homicide, the offender must 
have the intent to kill the victim; otherwise, the offender shall be 
liable only for physical injuries.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup>
 The evidence to prove intent to kill may consist of, inter alia, the 
means used; the nature, location, and number of wounds sustained by the 
victim; and the conduct of the malefactors before, at the time of, or 
immediately after the killing of the victim.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup></p><p>
 In order for treachery to be properly appreciated, two elements must be
 present: (1) at the time of the attack, the victim was not in a 
position to defend himself; and (2) the accused consciously and 
deliberately adopted the particular means, methods, or forms of attack 
employed by him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup>
</p><p> The prosecution was able to prove beyond doubt that the accused­
 appellant had consciously and deliberately adopted the means of 
execution to ensure his success in killing Reggie, i.e., the 
accused-appellant surreptitiously sneaked behind Reggie and gave him a 
headlock that restrained his movement, thus denying him the chance to 
defend himself or to parry the stab blows the accused-appellant would 
deliver. It is noteworthy that despite the fact that Reggie tried to 
escape further aggression by running, he failed because the 
accused-appellant caught up with him when he stumbled. Obviously, 
Reggie, who was then bleeding, was no longer in a position to protect 
himself when the accused-appellant delivered two more fatal blows.
</p><p> Considering that the elements of treachery attended the killing 
of Reggie, the CA was correct in convicting the accused-appellant of 
murder. 
</p><p><b><i>The 	penalty 	to 	be 	imposed upon the accused-appellant</i></b> 
</p><p>Article 248 of the RPC provides that the penalty for murder is<em> reclusion perpetua</em> to death. By applying Art. 63(2)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> of the RPC, the lesser of the two indivisible penalties, i.e., <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, shall be imposed upon the accused-appellant in view of the absence of any mitigating or aggravating circumstances.
</p><p> Following jurisprudence in <i>People v. Jugueta</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup>

P67,400.00 for the wake and burial of Reggie. Records reveal that only

is that documentary evidence should be presented to substantiate the 
claim for damages for loss of earning capacity except in the following
