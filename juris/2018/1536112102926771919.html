				<BR><STRONG>LEONEN, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">To determine the nature of an action, whether or not its subject matter is capable or incapable of pecuniary estimation, the nature of the principal action or relief sought must be ascertained. If the principal relief is for the recovery of a sum of money or real property, then the action is capable of pecuniary estimation. However, if the principal relief sought is not for the recovery of sum of money or real property, even if a claim over a sum of money or real property results as a consequence of the principal relief, the action is incapable of pecuniary estimation.<br><br>This resolves the Petition for Review<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> filed by First Sarmiento Property Holdings, Inc.

Scandia</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> instructed that to determine whether the subject matter of an action is incapable of pecuniary estimation, the nature of the principal action or remedy sought must first be established. This finds support in this Court's repeated pronouncement that jurisdiction over the subject matter is determined by examining the material allegations of the complaint and the relief sought.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> <i>Heirs of Dela Cruz v. Heirs of Cruz</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> stated, thus:<br><blockquote>It is axiomatic that the jurisdiction of a tribunal, including a quasi-judicial officer or government agency, over the nature and subject matter of a petition or complaint is determined by the material allegations therein and the character of the relief prayed for, irrespective of whether the petitioner or complainant is entitled to any or all such reliefs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup><br></blockquote>However, <i>Lapitan</i> stressed that where the money claim is only a consequence of the remedy sought, the action is said to be one incapable of pecuniary estimation:<br><blockquote>A review of the jurisprudence of this Court indicates that in determining whether an action is one the subject matter of which is not capable of pecuniary estimation, this Court has adopted the criterion of first ascertaining the nature of the principal action or remedy sought. If it is primarily for the recovery of a sum of money, the claim is considered capable of pecuniary estimation, and whether jurisdiction is in the municipal courts or in the courts of first instance would depend on the amount of the claim. However, where the basic issue is something other than the right to recover a sum of money, or where the money claim is purely incidental to, or a consequence of, the principal relief sought like in suits to have the defendant perform his part of the contract (specific performance) and in actions for support, or for annulment of a judgment or to foreclose a mortgage, this Court has considered such actions as cases where the subject of the litigation may not be estimated in terms of money, and are cognizable exclusively by courts of first instance. The rationale of the rule is plainly that the second class cases, besides the determination of damages, demand an inquiry into other factors which the law has deemed to be more within the competence of courts of first instance, which were the lowest courts of record at the time that the first organic laws of the Judiciary were enacted allocating jurisdiction (Act 136 of the Philippine Commission of June 11, 1901).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> (Citation omitted)<br></blockquote><i>Heirs of Sebe v. Heirs of Sevilla</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> likewise stressed that if the primary cause of action is based on a claim of ownership or a claim of legal right to control, possess, dispose, or enjoy such property, the action is a real action involving title to real property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup><br><br>A careful reading of petitioner's Complaint convinces this Court that petitioner never prayed for the reconveyance of the properties foreclosed during the auction sale, or that it ever asserted its ownership or possession over them. Rather, it assailed the validity of the loan contract with real estate mortgage that it entered into with respondent because it supposedly never received the proceeds of the P100,000,000.00 loan agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> This is evident in its Complaint, which read:<br><blockquote><center>GROUNDS FOR THE APPLICATION OF PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER<br></center><br>7. Defendant PBCOM knows fully well that plaintiff did not receive from it the loan it (PBCOM) alleged to have granted in its favor.<br><br>8. Despite this, defendant PBCOM has filed with the Ex-Officio Sheriff of Bulacan, a petition for extra judicial foreclosure of real estate mortgage, bent on foreclosing the real estate properties of plaintiff, photocopy of the petition is hereto attached as Annex "F".<br><br>9. The auction sale of the properties is set on December 29, 2011.<br><br>10. Defendant PBCOM, well knowing the facts narrated above and willfully disregarding the property rights of plaintiff, wrongfully filed an extra judicial foreclosure of real estate mortgage and pursuant to said petition, the Ex-Officio Sheriff now does offer for sale, the real estate properties of the plaintiff as set forth in its (PBCOM) said petition.<br><br>11. Unless defendants PBCOM and Ex-Officio Sheriff are restrained by this Honorable Court, they will infringe the property rights of the plaintiff in the manner herein before related.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup><br></blockquote><i>Far East Bank and Trust Company v. Shemberg Marketing Corporation</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> stated that an action for cancellation of mortgage has a subject that is incapable of pecuniary estimation:<br><blockquote>Here, the primary reliefs prayed for by respondents in Civil Case No. MAN-4045 is the cancellation of the real estate and chattel mortgages for want of consideration. In <i>Bumayog v. Tumas</i>, this Court ruled that where the issue involves the validity of a mortgage, the action is one incapable of pecuniary estimation. In the more recent case of <i>Russell v. Vestil</i>, this Court, citing <i>Bumayog</i>, held that an action questioning the validity of a mortgage is one incapable of pecuniary estimation. Petitioner has not shown adequate reasons for this Court to revisit <i>Bumayog</i> and <i>Russell</i>. Hence, petitioner's contention [cannot] be sustained. Since respondents paid the docket fees, as computed by the clerk of court, consequently, the trial court acquired jurisdiction over Civil Case No. MAN-4045.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup><br></blockquote>It is not disputed that even if the Complaint were filed a few days after the mortgaged properties were foreclosed and sold at auction to respondent as the highest bidder, the certificate of sale was only issued to respondent after the Complaint was filed.<br><br>Section 6 of Act No. 3135,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> as amended, provides that a property sold through an extrajudicial sale may be redeemed "at any time within the term of one year from and after the date of the sale":<br><blockquote>Section 6. In all cases in which an extrajudicial sale is made under the special power hereinbefore referred to, the debtor, his successors in interest or any judicial creditor or judgment creditor of said debtor, or any person having a lien on the property subsequent to the mortgage or deed of trust under which the property is sold, may redeem the same at any time within the term of one year from and after the date of the sale; and such redemption shall be governed by the provisions of sections four hundred and sixty-four to four hundred and sixty-six, inclusive, of the Code of Civil Procedure, in so far as these are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Act.<br></blockquote><i>Mahinay v. Dura Tire &amp; Rubber Industries Inc.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> clarified that "[t]he date of the sale' referred to in Section 6 is the date the certificate of sale is registered with the Register of Deeds. This is because the sale of registered land does not 'take effect as a conveyance, or bind the land' until it is registered."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup><br><br>The registration of the certificate of sale issued by the sheriff after an extrajudicial sale is a mandatory requirement; thus, if the certificate of sale is not registered with the Registry of Deeds, the property sold at auction is not conveyed to the new owner and the period of redemption does not begin to run.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, the Ex-Officio Sheriff of the City of Malolos, Bulacan was restrained from registering the certificate of sale with the Registry of Deeds of Bulacan and the certificate of sale was only issued to respondent after the Complaint for annulment of real estate mortgage was filed. Therefore, even if the properties had already been foreclosed when the Complaint was filed, their ownership and possession remained with petitioner since the certificate of sale was not registered with the Registry of Deeds. This supports petitioner's claim that it never asked for the reconveyance of or asserted its ownership over the mortgaged properties when it filed its Complaint since it still enjoyed ownership and possession over them.<br><br>Considering that petitioner paid the docket fees as computed by the clerk of court, upon the direction of the Executive Judge, this Court is convinced that the Regional Trial Court acquired jurisdiction over the Complaint for annulment of real estate mortgage.<br><br>Furthermore, even if it is assumed that the instant case were a real action and the correct docket fees were not paid by petitioner, the case should not have been dismissed; instead, the payment of additional docket fees should have been made a lien on the judgment award. The records attest that in filing its complaint, petitioner readily paid the docket fees assessed by the clerk of court; hence, there was no evidence of bad faith or intention to defraud the government that would have rightfully merited the dismissal of the Complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup><br><br><center><b>III</b><br></center><br>Although not raised in the Petition, this Court nonetheless deems it proper to pass upon the legality of the Regional Trial Court January 4, 2012 Order, which directed the parties to observe the status quo ante,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> effectively extending indefinitely its 72-hour ex-parte temporary restraining order issued on January 2, 2012.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup><br><br>Rule 58, Section 5 of the Rules of Court provides the instances when a temporary restraining order may be issued:<br><blockquote>Section 5. Preliminary injunction not granted without notice; exception. — No preliminary injunction shall be granted without hearing and prior notice to the party or person sought to be enjoined. If it shall appear from facts shown by affidavits or by the verified application that great or irreparable injury would result to the applicant before the matter can be heard on notice, the court to which the application for preliminary injunction was made, may issue a temporary restraining order to be effective only for a period of twenty (20) days from service on the party or person sought to be enjoined, except as herein provided. Within the said twenty-day period, the court must order said party or person to show cause, at a specified time and place, why the injunction should not be granted, determine within the same period whether or not the preliminary injunction shall be granted, and accordingly issue the corresponding order.<br><br>However, and subject to the provisions of the preceding sections, if the matter is of extreme urgency and the applicant will suffer grave injustice and irreparable injury, the executive judge of a multiple-sala court or the presiding judge of a single-sala court may issue ex-parte a temporary restraining order effective for only seventy-two (72) hours from issuance but he shall immediately comply with the provisions of the next preceding section as to service of summons and the documents to be served therewith. Thereafter, within the aforesaid seventy-two (72) hours, the judge before whom the case is pending shall conduct a summary hearing to determine whether the temporary restraining order shall be extended until the application for preliminary injunction can be heard. In no case shall the total period of effectivity of the temporary restraining order exceed twenty (20) days, including the original seventy-two hours provided herein.<br><br>In the event that the application for preliminary injunction is denied or not resolved within the said period, the temporary restraining order is deemed automatically vacated. The effectivity of a temporary restraining order is not extendible without need of any judicial declaration to that effect and no court shall have authority to extend or renew the same on the same ground for which it was issued.<br><br>However, if issued by the Court of Appeals or a member thereof, the temporary restraining order shall be effective for sixty (60) days from service on the party or person sought to be enjoined. A restraining order issued by the Supreme Court or a member thereof shall be effective until further orders.<br></blockquote>It is clear that a temporary restraining order may be issued by a trial court in only two (2) instances: <i>first</i>, when great or irreparable injury would result to the applicant even before the application for writ of preliminary injunction can be heard; and <i>second</i>, if the matter is of extreme urgency and the applicant will suffer grave injustice and irreparable injury. The executive judge of a multi-sala court or the presiding judge of a single-sala court may issue a 72-hour temporary restraining order.<br><br>In both instances, the temporary restraining order may be issued <i>ex parte</i>. However, in the first instance, the temporary restraining order has an effectivity of only 20 days to be counted from service to the party sought to be enjoined. Likewise, within those 20 days, the court shall order the enjoined party to show why the injunction should not be granted and shall then determine whether or not the injunction should be granted.<br><br>In the second instance, when there is extreme urgency and the applicant will suffer grave injustice and irreparable injury, the court shall issue a temporary restraining order effective for only 72 hours upon issuance. Within those 72 hours, the court shall conduct a summary hearing to determine if the temporary restraining order shall be extended until the application for writ of preliminary injunction can be heard. However, in no case shall the extension exceed 20 days.<br><br>If the application for preliminary injunction is denied or not resolved within the given periods, the temporary restraining order is automatically vacated and the court has no authority to extend or renew it on the same ground of its original issuance.<br><br>Despite the clear wording of the rules, the Regional Trial Court issued a status quo ante order dated January 4, 2012, indefinitely extending the temporary restraining order on the registration of the certificate of sale with the Registry of Deeds.<br><br>Petitioner applied for a writ of preliminary injunction, yet the Regional Trial Court did not conduct any hearing for that purpose and merely directed the parties to observe the status quo ante.<br><br><i>Miriam College Foundation, Inc v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> explained the difference between preliminary injunction and a restraining order as follows:<br><blockquote>Preliminary injunction is an order granted at any stage of an action or proceeding prior to the judgment or final order, requiring a party or a court, agency or a person to perform to refrain from performing a particular act or acts. As an extraordinary remedy, injunction is calculated to preserve or maintain the status quo of things and is generally availed of to prevent actual or threatened acts, until the merits of the case can be heard. A preliminary injunction persists until it is dissolved or until the termination of the action without the court issuing a final injunction.<br><br>The basic purpose of restraining order, on the other hand, is to preserve the status quo until the hearing of the application for preliminary injunction. Under the former A§5, Rule 58 of the Rules of Court, as amended by A§5, Batas Pambansa Blg. 224, a judge (or justice) may issue a temporary restraining order with a limited life of twenty days from date of issue. If before the expiration of the 20-day period the application for preliminary injunction is denied, the temporary order would thereby be deemed automatically vacated. If no action is taken by the judge on the application for preliminary injunction within the said 20 days, the temporary restraining order would automatically expire on the 20th day by the sheer force of law, no judicial declaration to that effect being necessary. In the instant case, no such preliminary injunction was issued; hence, the TRO earlier issued automatically expired under the aforesaid provision of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>A temporary restraining order cannot be extended indefinitely to take the place of a writ of preliminary injunction, since a temporary restraining order is intended only to have a limited lifespan and is deemed automatically vacated upon the expiration of 72 hours or 20 days, as the case may be. As such, the temporary restraining order has long expired and, in the absence of a preliminary injunction, there was nothing to stop the sheriff from registering the certificate of sale with the Registry of Deeds.<br><br>This Court has repeatedly expounded on the nature of a temporary restraining order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> and a preliminary injunction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> Yet lower courts consistently interchange these ancillary remedies and disregard the sunset clause<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> inherent in a temporary restraining order by erroneously extending it indefinitely. Such ignorance or defiance of basic remedial measures is a gross disservice to the public, who look towards the court for legal guidance and legal remedy. More importantly, this cavalier attitude towards these injunctive reliefs might even be construed as a deliberate effort to look the other way to favor a party, which will then sully the image of the entire judiciary. Henceforth, this Court will demand stricter compliance with the rules from the members of the bench as regards their issuances of these injunctive reliefs.<br><br><center><b>IV</b><br></center><br>Finally, there is a need to reassess the place of <i>Home Guaranty v. R-II Builders</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> in our jurisprudence.<br><br>In <i>Home Guaranty</i>, R-II Builders, Inc. (R-II Builders) filed a Complaint for the rescission of the Deed of Assignment and Conveyance it entered into with Home Guaranty Corporation and National Housing Authority. The Complaint was initially determined to have a subject that is incapable of pecuniary estimation and the docket fees were assessed and paid accordingly.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup><br><br>R-II Builders later filed a motion to admit its Amended and Supplemental Complaint, which deleted its earlier prayer for the resolution of its Deed of Assignment and Conveyance, and prayed for the conveyance of title to and/or possession of the entire Asset Pool. The Regional Trial Court ruled that the Amended and Supplemental Complaint involved a real action and directed R-II Builders to pay the correct docket fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup><br><br>Instead of paying the additional docket fees, R-II Builders withdrew its Amended and Supplemental Complaint and instead filed a motion to admit its Second Amended Complaint, which revived the prayer in its original Complaint to resolve the Deed of Assignment and Conveyance and deleted the causes of action for conveyance of title to and/or possession of the entire Asset Pool in its Amended and Supplemental Complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup> The Regional Trial Court granted the motion to admit the Second Amended Complaint, ratiocinating that the docket fees to the original Complaint had been paid; that the Second Amended Complaint was not intended to delay the proceedings; and that the Second Amended Complaint was consistent with R-II Builders' previous pleadings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals upheld the ruling of the Regional Trial Court and reiterated that the case involved a subject that was incapable of pecuniary estimation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup> However, <i>Home Guaranty</i> reversed the Court of Appeals Decision, ruling that the Complaint and the Amended and Supplemental Complaint both involved prayers for the conveyance and/or transfer of possession of the Asset Pool, causes of action which were undoubtedly real actions. Thus, the correct docket fees had not yet been paid:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup><br><blockquote>Although an action for resolution and/or the nullification of a contract, like an action for specific performance, fall squarely into the category of actions where the subject matter is considered incapable of pecuniary estimation, we find that the causes of action for resolution and/or nullification of the [Deed of Assignment and Conveyance] was erroneously isolated by the [Court of Appeals] from the other causes of action alleged in R-II Builders' original complaint and Amended and Supplemental Complaint which prayed for the conveyance and/or transfer of possession of the Asset Pool. In Gochan v. Gochan, this Court held that an action for specific performance would still be considered a real action where it seeks the conveyance or transfer of real property, or ultimately, the execution of deeds of conveyance of real property.<br><br>....<br><br>Granted that R-II Builders is not claiming ownership of the Asset Pool because its continuing stake is, in the first place, limited only to the residual value thereof, the conveyance and/or transfer of possession of the same properties sought in the original complaint and Amended and Supplemental Complaint both presuppose a real action for which appropriate docket fees computed on the basis of the assessed or estimated value of said properties should have been assessed and paid. . . .<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote><i>Home Guaranty</i> stated that to determine whether an action is capable or incapable of pecuniary estimation, the nature of the principal action or remedy prayed for must first be determined.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup> Nonetheless, in citing <i>Ruby Shelter Builders v. Formaran, Home Guaranty</i> looked beyond R-II Builder's principal action for annulment or rescission of contract to purportedly unmask its true objective and nature of its action, which was to recover real property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup><br><br>In a dissenting opinion in the <i>Home Guaranty</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup> June 22, 2011 Resolution that dismissed R-II Builders' motion for reconsideration, Associate Justice Presbitero Velasco, Jr. stressed that one must first look at the principal action of the case to determine if it is capable or incapable of pecuniary estimation:<br><blockquote>Whether or not the case is a real action, and whether or not the proper docket fees were paid, one must look to the main cause of action of the case. In all instances, in the original Complaint, the Amended and Supplemental Complaint and the Amended Complaint, it was all for the resolution or rescission of the [Deed of Assignment and Conveyance], with the prayer for the provisional remedy of injunction and the appointment of a trustee and subsequently a receiver. In the Second Amended Complaint, the return of the remaining assets of the asset pool, if any, to respondent R-II Builders would only be the result of the resolution or rescission of the [Deed of Assignment and Conveyance].<br><br>Even if real property in the Asset Pool may change hands as a result of the case in the trial court, the fact alone that real property is involved does not make that property the basis of computing the docket fees. <i>De Leon v. Court of Appeals</i> has already settled the matter. That case, citing <i>Bautista v, Lim</i>, held that a case for rescission or annulment of contract is not susceptible of pecuniary estimation. On the other hand, in the Decision We rendered on July 25, 2005 in <i>Serrano v. Delica</i>, We ruled that the action for cancellation of contracts of sale and the titles is a real action. Similarly, on February 10, 2009, We ruled in <i>Ruby Shelter Builders and Realty Development Corporation v. Formaran III (Ruby Shelter)</i> that an action for nullification of a Memorandum of Agreement which required the lot owner to issue deeds of sale and cancellation of the. Deeds of Sale is a real action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Whatever confusion there might have been regarding the nature of actions for nullity of contracts or legality of conveyances, which would also involve recovery of sum of money or real property, was directly addressed by <i>Lu v. Lu Ym</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> <i>Lu</i> underscored that "where the basic issue is something other than the right to recover a sum of money, the money claim being only incidental to or merely a consequence of, the principal relief sought, the action is incapable of pecuniary estimation."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup><br><br>This finds support in numerous decisions where this Court proclaimed that the test to determine whether an action is capable or incapable of pecuniary estimation is to ascertain the nature of the principal action or relief sought. Thus, if the principal relief sought is the recovery of a sum of money or real property, then the action is capable of pecuniary estimation. However, if the principal relief sought is not for the recovery of money or real property and the money claim is only a consequence of the principal relief, then the action is incapable of pecuniary estimation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup><br><br>Considering that the principal remedy sought by R-II Builders was the resolution of the Deed of Assignment and Conveyance, the action was incapable of pecuniary estimation and <i>Home Guaranty</i> erred in treating it as a real action simply because the principal action was accompanied by a prayer for conveyance of real property.<br><br>It is clear that subject matter jurisdiction cannot be dependent on the supposed ultimate motive or true objective of the complaint because this will require the judge to speculate on the defenses of the plaintiff beyond the material allegations contained in the complaint. Likewise, in attempting to pinpoint the true objective of the complaint at the initial stages of trial, the judge might end up dictating the result outside of the evidence still to be presented during the trial, opening up the judge to charges of partiality and even impropriety. Furthermore, the judge is not aware of the evidence to be presented by either party when the complaint is filed; thus, there is no reliable basis that can be used to infer the true objective of the complaint. It is imperative then that the competing claims as basis of subject matter jurisdiction be textually based, finding its basis in the body of the complaint and the relief sought without reference to extraneous facts not alleged or evidence still to be presented.<br><br>Nonetheless, if subject matter jurisdiction is assailed during the course of the trial and evidence is presented to prove the defense's allegation of lack of jurisdiction, this will lead to an anomaly where the defense's evidence, instead of the complaint, will effectively determine the remedy and cause of action.<br><br>In the case at bar, petitioner contends that its complaint prayed for the annulment of the real estate mortgage it entered into with respondent and not for the recovery or reconveyance of the mortgaged properties because it was still the registered owner when it filed its complaint. The evidence on record supports petitioner's claim; hence, there was no reason for the dismissal of its Complaint for lack of jurisdiction.<br><br><i>Home Guaranty</i> likewise erred in dismissing the action because of non-payment of the correct filing fees. <i>Fedman Development Corporation v. Agcaoili</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup> reiterated that where the assessed docket fees have been paid and the assessment turns out to be insufficient, the court still acquires jurisdiction over the case, subject to payment of the deficiency assessment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup> The only exception is when the deficiency in docket fees is accompanied with bad faith and an intention to defraud the government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup> It is not disputed that R-II Builders paid the assessed docket fees when it filed its Complaint, negating bad faith or intent on its part to defraud the government.<br><br>In light of the foregoing, this Court reaffirms that the nature of an action is determined by the principal relief sought in the complaint, irrespective of the other causes of actions that may also crop up as a consequence of the principal relief prayed for.
