No. 07934, which affirmed the Joint Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated August 7, 2015 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of San Fernando City, Pampanga, Branch 44 in Criminal Case Nos. 15510 and 15511, which convicted Emma T. Pagsigan (accused-appellant) for violation of Sections 5 and 11, Article II of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9165,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> otherwise known as the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002.<br><br>Accused-appellant was charged with the sale and possession of dangerous drugs, as follows:<br><br><blockquote><center>Criminal Case No. 15510</center><br><br>That on or about the 27<sup>th</sup> day of July, 2007, in Barangay San Nicolas, City of San Fernando, (P) (sic), Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named [accused-appellant], without having been lawfully permitted and/or authorized, did then and there wil[l]fully, unlawfully and feloniously have in her possession, custody and control one (1) heat sealed transparent plastic sachet containing TWO HUNDRED SIX TENTH THOUSANDTH of a gram (0.0206 gms), which when subjected for laboratory examination was found positive for Meth[yl]amphetamine Hydrochloride, a prohibited drug.<br><br>Contrary to Law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br><center>Criminal Case No. 15511</center><br><br>That on or about the 27<sup>th</sup> day of July, 2007, in Barangay San Nicolas, City of San Fernando, (P) Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named [accused-appellant], not being authorized nor permitted by the law, did then and there wil[l]fully, unlawfully and feloniously sell, convey and deliver meth[yl]amphetamine hydrochloride (Shabu), weighing more or less TWO HUNDRED TWENTY ONE TENTH THOUSANDTH of a gram (0.0221 grams), to a poseur buyer for and in consideration of THREE HUNDRED PESOS (P300.00), Philippine Currency, which when subjected for laboratory examination was found positive for meth[yl]amphetamine hydrochloride, a prohibited drug.<br><br>Contrary to Law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></blockquote><br><br>During trial, the prosecution established that it received information from a confidential informant (CI) that accused-appellant was selling <i>shabu </i>in Barangay San Nicolas, San Fernando City, Pampanga. A buy-bust team was then formed with Police Officer 2 Jayson Constantino (PO2 Constantino) as poseur-buyer and PO2 Gerald Pediglorio (PO2 Pediglorio) as back up and the buy-bust money was marked.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>PO2 Constantino, PO2 Pediglorio and the CI first went to Barangay San Nicolas for coordination and for the buy-bust operation to be "blottered" before proceeding to the target area.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>PO2 Constantino and the CI approached accused-appellant while PO2 Pediglorio positioned himself at a distance of three meters away. The CI introduced PO2 Constantino as the person interested to buy <i>shabu. </i>PO2 Constantino handed to accused-appellant the marked money and in exchange, she handed to him one plastic sachet containing <i>shabu. </i>PO2 Pediglorio then rushed to the scene after PO2 Constantino executed the pre-arranged signal of taking off his hat.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>When asked to empty her pockets, another plastic sachet of <i>shabu </i>and the marked money were recovered from accused-appellant. She was then brought to the barangay hall where the seized plastic sachets were marked by PO2 Constantino in the presence of barangay officials. The seized drugs were then turned over to the assigned investigator, PO3 Randy Santos (PO3 Santos), who prepared the request for laboratory examination. PO3 Santos also delivered the plastic sachets to the Regional Crime Laboratory Office for forensic examination which were received by a certain PO2 Villar. The examination yielded positive results for methylamphetamine hydrochloride, or <i>shabu.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>On cross-examination, PO2 Constantino testified that the seized items were marked at the barangay hall because the place of arrest is a critical place but they did not execute any inventory confiscation receipt. He also testified that they did not coordinate with the Department of Justice (DOJ) and media representatives.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>On re-direct examination, PO2 Pediglorio testified that the conduct of the buy bust operation was conducted in a short period of time to prevent the escape of accused-appellant and that they were unable to take photographs because they had no camera, cellular phone and no resources to list evidence. He claimed that they did not have time to grab a piece of paper, pen and camera.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant, for her part, testified that she accompanied her friend Ana to the house of spouses Josie and Vando in Barangay San Nicolas, San Femando City. Accused-appellant stayed at the back of the house while Ana talked to the spouses out front. Suddenly, they were arrested by police officers. She was forced to go with the policemen where she was brought to a dark place. A gun was pointed at her and was repeatedly asked about Ana's whereabouts. Spouses Josie and Vando were later allowed to go but she was left detained.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>In a Joint Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> dated August 7, 2015, the RTC found that the prosecution has proven its cases against accused-appellant for violation of Sections 5 and 11, Article II of R.A. No. 9165 beyond reasonable doubt. It disposed, thus:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Court finds [accused-appellant] <b>guilty beyond reasonable doubt</b> of violation of Sec. 11, Art. II of R.A. 9165 in Crim. Case No. 15510 and imposes upon her the penalty of imprisonment for twelve (12) years and one (1) day as minimum to fourteen (14) years as maximum, and to pay a <b>FINE</b> of Three Hundred Thousand Pesos (P300,000.00).<br><br>Said [accused-appellant] is also <b>found guilty beyond reasonable doubt</b> of violation of Sec. 5, Art. II of R.A. 9165 in Crim. Case No. 15511 and imposes upon her the penalty of <b>LIFE IMPRISONMENT</b> and to pay a <b>FINE</b> of Five Hundred Thousand Pesos (P500,000.00).<br><br>The prohibited dangerous drugs, subject of these cases, are ordered <b>CONFISCATED</b> in favor of the government.<br><br>The OIC-Branch Clerk of Court is directed to prepare the Mittimus for the immediate transfer of the herein [accused-appellant] to the Correctional Institute (sic) for Women and to immediately turn over the specimens subject of these cases to the Director, PDEA, Region III, Camp Olivas, City of San Fernando, Pampanga, for proper disposition.<br><br>Furnish all concerned parties with copies of this Joint Decision.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></blockquote><br><br>On appeal, the CA, in its Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> dated January 11, 2017 sustained the accused-appellant's conviction. It cited that the non-compliance with Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165 does not <i>ipso facto </i>render the evidence inadmissible especially when there are justifiable grounds and proof that the integrity and evidentiary value of the evidence have been preserved. It ruled that the integrity of the seized drugs in the case remained unscathed. It dismissed accused-appellant's denials and unsubstantiated allegations. The dispositive portion of the Decision reads:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the <i>Appeal </i>is hereby <b>DENIED.</b> The Joint Decision dated 7 August 2015 of the [RTC], Third Judicial Region, San Fernando City, Pampanga, Branch 44, in Criminal Case Nos. 15510 and 15511, is <b>AFFIRMED.</b><br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></blockquote><br><br>Hence, this appeal.<br><br>Accused-appellant questions her conviction and submits that the prosecution failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt the <i>corpus delicti</i> of the crime on account of substantial gaps in the chain of custody and points out the various non-compliance with Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165, <i>i.e., </i>failed to have any inventory, confiscation receipt or photographs of the drugs allegedly seized, failed to present evidence to prove that they contacted any member of the media and the DOJ to witness the marking. She stresses that no justifiable ground to explain their failure to comply with the law was offered.<br><br>The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) counters that the identity and integrity of the seized illegal drug were duly established. It also insists that the failure of the police officers to photograph the seized drugs and conduct the physical inventory thereof did not compromise the integrity of the illegal drugs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br><center><b>Ruling of the Court</b></center><br><br>The appeal is meritorious.<br><br>We have ruled that non-compliance with the requirements of Section 21 of R.A.

In <i> Lescano v. People,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> We "underscored that the mere marking of seized paraphernalia, unsupported by a physical inventory and taking of photographs, and in the absence of the persons required by Section 21 to be present, does not suffice."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>The Court acknowledges that the strict compliance with the requirements of Section 21, Article II of R.A. No. 9165 may not always be possible. In <i>People of the Philippines v. Jesus Dumagay y Suacito,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> We have stated that:<br><br><blockquote>Failure to strictly comply with rules of procedure, however, does not <i>ipso facto </i>invalidate or render void the seizure and custody over the items as long as the prosecution is able to show that "(a) there is justifiable ground for non-compliance; and (b) the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote><br><br>However, in case of non-compliance, the prosecution must be able to "explain the reasons behind the procedural lapses,and that the integrity and value of the seized evidence had nonetheless been preserved x x x because the Court cannot presume what these grounds are or that they even exist."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Also, "the justifiable ground for non-compliance must be proven as a fact, because the Court cannot presume what these grounds are or that they even exist."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Here, We cannot accept the grounds or reasons cited by the police officers as justifiable to explain their non-compliance. We note that both police officers have been members of the force for more than five years and have stated that they are familiar with the rules set forth in R.A. No. 9165. Despite the same, the glaring non-compliance and seemingly nonchalant attitude in their attempts to comply with the said requirements appalls the Court. Had these police officers truly understood the utmost significance of the said requirements and what it seeks to protect, they would surely have found time to bring provisions to prepare an inventory, take photographs and ensure the presence of the insulating witnesses.<br><br>Considering the absence of a justifiable explanation as to the non-compliance with the rules, We find that the prosecution failed to show that the seized substance from the accused-appellant was the same substance offered in Court, especially since the amount involved in this case is minuscule. In <i>Mallillin v. People,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> this court said that "the likelihood of tampering, loss or mistake with respect to an exhibit is greatest when the exhibit is small and is one that has physical characteristics fungible in nature and similar in form to substances familiar to people in their daily lives."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> The integrity then of the <i>corpus delicti </i>cannot be said to have been properly established.
