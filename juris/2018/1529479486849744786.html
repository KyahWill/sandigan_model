In particular, the RTC found that the subject dangerous drugs had been marked, had been photographed, and presented in court; that the buy-bust money had been produced and identified; that there was no evidence of tampering or alteration of the subject dangerous drugs; and that an inventory thereof was made, and a receipt therefor issued.</p><p> Regarding appellant's uncorroborated claim that the subject dangerous drugs had been '"planted" to incriminate him, the RTC declared that there was no reason why the policemen would do that; that PO2 Bugtai had no ill motive to testify falsely against appellant; that PO2 Bugtai's testimony was straightforward; and that appellant's allegation that his male date, Mark, set him up, was not believable. </p><p> The RTC added that the prosecution had sufficiently proved the presence of all the elements of both crimes of selling and possession of dangerous drugs, because the seller and the buyer had been identified, and because the object evidence and the buy-bust money had been presented in court, as indeed, there was a clear exchange of money between the appellant and PO2 Bugtai for packets of <em>shabu</em>. The RTC likewise noted that there was also a search incidental to a lawful arrest; that the police found two heat-sealed transparent plastic sachets of white crystalline substance in one of appellant's pockets; that these plastic sachets had been marked prior to their delivery to the PNP Crime Laboratory; that these were moreover presented in court and were admitted as evidence; and that intent to possess can be gathered from the fact that the two sachets were found in one of appellant's pockets. </p><p><b><i>Ruling of the Court of Appeals</i></b> </p><p> In its October 22, 2014 Decision,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> the CA disposed as follows: </p><blockquote> <p> WHEREFORE, the appeal is hereby DENIED.

What is important is that the sale transaction of drugs actually took place and that the object of the transaction is properly presented as evidence in court and is shown to be the same drugs seized from the accused.</p> <p> On the other hand, for illegal possession of dangerous drugs, the following elements must be established: '[1] the accused was in possession of dangerous drugs; [2] such possession was not authorized by law; and [3] the accused was freely and consciously aware of being in possession of dangerous drugs.'</p> <p> In cases of illegal sale and illegal possession of dangerous drugs, the dangerous drug seized from the accused constitutes the <i>corpus delicti</i> of the offense. Thus, it is of <b>utmost importance</b> that the integrity and identity of the seized drugs must be shown to have been duly preserved. 'The <b>chain of custody </b>rule performs this function as it <b>ensures that unnecessary doubts concerning the identity of the evidence are removed</b>.'<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)</p> </blockquote> <p> The term chain of custody pertains to the "duly recorded authorized movements and custody of seized drugs or controlled chemicals or plant sources of dangerous drugs or Laboratory equipment of each stage, from the time of seizure/confiscation to receipt in the forensic laboratory to safekeeping, to presentation in court for destruction."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> "In prosecuting both illegal sale and illegal possession of dangerous drugs, conviction <b>cannot</b> be sustained <b>if doubt persists</b> on the identity of said drugs."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> In this connection, it is settled that: </p><blockquote> <p> xxx The identity of the dangerous drug must be established with moral certainty. Apart from showing that the elements of possession or sale are present, the fact that the dangerous drug illegally possessed and sold is the same drug offered in court as exhibit must likewise be established with the same degree of certitude as that needed to sustain a guilty verdict.</p> <p> Because it is <b>indispensable</b> that the substance confiscated from the accused be the very same substance offered in. court, the Court has adopted the chain of custody rule, a method of authenticating evidence which requires that the admission of an exhibit be preceded by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what the proponent claims it to be.</p> <p> The chain of custody is established by testimony about every link in the chain, from the moment the item was picked up to the time it is offered in evidence, in such a way that every person who touched the exhibit would be able to describe how and from whom it was received, where it was and what happened to it while in the witness' possession, the condition in which it was received, and the condition in which it was delivered to the next link in the chain. These witnesses would then describe the precautions taken to ensure that there had been no change in the condition of the item and no opportunity for someone not in the chain to have possession of the same.</p> <p> As a general rule, the prosecution must endeavour to establish four links in the chain of custody of the confiscated item: first, the seizure and marking, if practicable, of the illegal drug recovered from the accused by the apprehending officer; second, the turnover of the illegal drug seized by the apprehending officer to the investigating officer; third, the turnover by the investigating officer of the illegal drug to the forensic chemist for laboratory examination; and fourth, the turnover and submission of the marked illegal drug seized from the forensic chemist to the court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)</p> </blockquote> <p> In the case under review, this Court finds that the CA erred in affirming the RTC's finding that appellant is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crimes charged. Indeed, this Court finds that the prosecution miserably failed to establish an unbroken chain of custody of the confiscated items.</p><p> To start with, in regard to the first link in the chain of custody in the instant case, PO2 Bugtai testified that he seized the illegal drugs from appellant at the <i>locus criminis</i>, and did not mark them immediately, but marked the same only after he got to the police station. In fact, he suggested that the reason for the non-marking of the prohibited drugs at the crime scene was because he failed to bring a marking pen at the place of arrest and seizure, <em>viz</em>.: </p><blockquote> <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td colspan="2">[Pros.

Thus it has been held that:</p> <blockquote> <p> The first link in the chain is the marking of the seized drug. We have previously held that:</p> <blockquote> <p> xxx Marking after seizure is the starting point in the custodial link, thus it is vital that the seized contraband are immediately marked because succeeding handlers of the specimen will use the markings as reference. The marking of the evidence serves to separate the marked evidence from the<em> corpus </em>of all other similar or related evidence from the time they are seized from the accused until they are disposed of at the end of the criminal proceedings, obviating switching, 'planting,' or contamination of evidence.</p> </blockquote> <p> It is important that the seized drugs be immediately marked, if possible, as soon as they are seized from the accused.</p> <p> [The reason for this marking immediately upon arrest or seizure is set forth] in <i>People v. Gonzales</i>, [thus –] </p> <blockquote> <p> The first stage in the chain of custody rule is the marking of the dangerous drugs or related items. Marking, which is the affixing on the dangerous drugs or related items by the apprehending officer or the poseur-buyer of his initials or signature or other identifying signs, should be made in the presence of the apprehended violator <u>immediately</u> upon arrest. The importance of the prompt marking cannot be denied, because succeeding handlers of dangerous drugs or related items will use the marking as reference. Also, the marking operates to set apart as evidence the dangerous drugs or related items from other material from the moment they are confiscated until they are disposed of at the close of the criminal proceedings, thereby forestalling switching, planting or contamination of evidence. In short, the marking immediately upon confiscation or recovery of the dangerous drugs or related items is <u>indispensable</u> in the preservation of their integrity and evidentiary value.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup></p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> The inevitable consequences of failure to observe this unflagging strictness and rigor in the law is emphasized in the case of <i>People v.

The Congress laid it down as a safety precaution against potential abuses by law enforcement agents who might fail to appreciate the gravity of the penalties faced by those suspected to be involved in the sale, use or possession of illegal drugs. Only by such strict compliance may the grave mischiefs of planting or substitution of evidence and the unlawful and malicious prosecution of the weak and unwary that the law intended to prevent may be eliminated. Under the principle that penal laws are strictly construed against the government and liberally in favor of the accused, stringent compliance therewith is fully justified.</p> <p> Herein, the requirements of physical inventory and photograph-taking of the seized drugs were not observed, This noncompliance raises doubts whether the illegal drug items used as evidence in both the cases for violation of Section 5 and Section 13 of [RA] 9165 were the same ones that were allegedly seized from appellants.

In <i>People v. Gonzales</i>, this Court acquitted the accused based on reasonable doubt for failure of the police to conduct an inventory and to photograph the seized plastic sachet. We explained therein that 'the omission of the inventory and the photographing exposed another weakness of the evidence of guilt, considering that the inventory and photographing — to be made in the presence of the accused or his representative, or within the presence of any representative from the media, Department of Justice or any elected official, who must sign the inventory, or be given a copy of the inventory, were really significant stages of the procedures outlined by the law and its IRR.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> More than that, the defense registered its vigorous objections to the admission of the prosecution's exhibits, thus — </p><blockquote> <p> [PAO to the Court] x x x First of all, we object to Exhibit ["D",] Your Honor, the pieces of evidence, considering that there was no clear showing of the consummated transaction of record. So the alleged evidence recovered is considered by the defense, Your Honor, as fruits of the poisonous tree.</p> <p> We object.

That's all, Your Honor,</p> <p> COURT: </p> <p>ORDER: </p> <blockquote> <p>Exhibits "A" to "I" are all admitted in evidence.</p> <p> SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup></p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> We have held that: </p><blockquote> <p> [RA] 9165 and its implementing rules and regulations both state that non-compliance with the procedures thereby delineated and set would not necessarily invalidate the seizure and custody of the dangerous drugs provided there were justifiable grounds for the non-compliance, and provided that the integrity of the evidence of the <em>corpus delicti </em>was preserved. Herein, the proffered excuses were that it was night-time, there was no available camera and that the police officer who had initial custody of the seized drugs was new in the service and was not familiar with the inventory requirement. The Court finds that these explanations do not justify non-compliance with the required procedures of [RA] 9165. These will not do. It is well to recall that the informant first reported about appellant Miranda's illegal drug activities in the morning of the day of the alleged buy-bust operation and came back around five o'clock in the afternoon. The operation was set around 7:30-8:00 p.m. There were seven (7) men in the team, including the informant. There was sufficient time to obtain a camera and they had the human resources to scout for one. That PO1 Yang was new in the service does not excuse non-compliance as there were other members of the team who could have initiated the conduct of the inventory and photograph-taking. Besides, the team had been briefed before the entrapment operation which would reasonably include a run-through of the procedures, outlined in the law for the handling of the seized drugs. The excuses are lame if not downright unacceptable.</p> <p> Considering that the non-compliance with the requirements of Section 21 in the case at bar is inexcusable, the identity and integrity of the drugs used as evidence against appellants are necessarily tainted. <i>Corpus delicti </i> is the actual commission by someone of the particular crime charged. In illegal drugs cases, it refers to illegal drug itself. When the courts are given reason to entertain reservations about the identity of the illegal drug item alleged seized from the accused, the actual crime charged is put into serious question. Courts have no alternative but to acquit on the ground of reasonable doubt. Unexplained non-compliance with the procedures for preserving the chain of custody of the dangerous drugs has frequently caused the Court to absolve those found guilty by the lower courts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> RA 9165 and its IRR had been in effect since 2002 while the incident in the case at bar happened years after in 2010. In this light, it is judicious to conclude the possibility of seizure or arrest at nighttime and dawn had been anticipated including the likelihood of sudden receipt of information from confidential agents, hence it is reasonable for the persons charged with the implementation thereof to have put a system in place to ensure compliance with the pertinent laws and regulations during such situations. In this case, however, the prosecution failed to show that they even at least tried to contact "a representative from the media and the [DOJ], and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> as to signify that such physical inventory was done in their presence. Moreover, the prosecution failed to authenticate the alleged Inventory Receipt and photographs that it had presented. And the fact that the inventory and photographs are still required by RA 10640, which amended RA 9165, buttresses the indispensability of these requisites.</p><p> On the third and fourth links in the chain of custody, the Court notes that the RTC stated in its January 31, 2013 Decision that the testimony of the Forensic Chemist "was dispensed with because the defense admitted his expertise; that he was the one who examined the object evidence; and that in connection therewith, he issued a chemistry report".<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> The RTC mentioned that "the prosecution also admitted that [said] forensic chemical officer has no personal knowledge with respect to the origin and source of the dangerous drug he [had] examined".<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> Such stipulations with respect to the forensic chemical officer failed to help the prosecution. As held in <i>People v. Havana</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> Nor can the prosecution gain from the testimony of the forensic chemist PCI Salinas. The records show that there is nothing positive and convincingly clear from the testimony of PCI Salinas. She did not at all categorically and straightforwardly assert that the alleged chemical substance that was submitted for laboratory examination and thereafter presented in court was the very same substance allegedly recovered from the appellant. If anything, the sum and substance of her testimony is that the alleged pack of <em>shabu</em> submitted to her for laboratory examination showed that it was positive for methamphetylane hydrochloride or <em>shabu</em>. She never testified where the substance came from. Her testimony was limited only on the result of the examination she conducted and not on the source of the substance.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> In addition, it has been ruled that there is a gap or break in the fourth link of the chain of custody where there is absence of "evidence to show how the seized <em>shabu</em> were handled, stored, and safeguarded pending its presentation in court,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> as in this case. </p><p> We reiterate that "while this Court in certain cases has tempered the mandate of strict compliance with the requisite under Section 21 of RA 9165, such liberality, as stated in the Implementing Rules and Regulations can be applied only when the evidentiary value and integrity of the illegal drug are properly preserved x x x,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> which is, however, not present in the instant case.</p><p> "The campaign against drugs deserves the full support and encouragement from this Court.
