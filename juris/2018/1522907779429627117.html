				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">A.M. No. P-14-3230 stemmed from the continuous failure of respondent Alma P. Licay (Licay), Clerk of Court, to comply with the regular submission of the Monthly Financial Reports of the Municipal Circuit Trial Court of San Juan, La Union, while A.M. No. P-11-2959 arose from the shortages in the judiciary collections and undocumented withdrawal of cash bonds.<br><br>In its Resolution dated 10 July 2017,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> the Court consolidated A.M. No. P-14-3230 with A.M.

The Resolution fined Licay Five Hundred Pesos (P500.00) and ordered her to comply with the Resolutions dated 15 June 2011 and 14 December 2011, within ten (10) days from notice.<br><br>In its 23 October 2013 Resolution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> the Court imposed on Licay an additional fine of Five Hundred Pesos (P500.00) for failure to comply with the 13 February 2013 Resolution.

However, the 23 January 2014 Certification from the Accounting Division of the FMO showed that Licay had not submitted the following Monthly Financial Reports: (1) JDF for the months of July 2007 to December 2010, (2) SAJ for the months of July 2007 to December 2010, (3) FF for the months of July 2007 to December 2010, (4) STF from her date of assumption to December 2010 and (5) General Fund for the first quarter of 2009 to the fourth quarter of 2010.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>In its 7 April 2014 Memorandum, the OCA recommended the following:<br><blockquote>a) the administrative complaint be RE-DOCKETED as a regular administrative case against respondent Clerk of Court Alma P.

With her obstinate defiance and incessant refusal to submit her compliance to the Court despite the latter's repeated directives and stem admonitions, she displayed her insolence and disrespect for the lawful orders of the Court. A resolution of the Supreme Court should not be construed as a mere request, and should be complied with promptly and completely. Such failure to comply betrays not only a recalcitrant streak in character, but also a disrespect for the Court's lawful order and directive. Furthermore, this contumacious conduct of refusing to abide by the lawful directives issued by the Court has likewise been considered an utter lack of interest to remain with, if not contempt of, the system. Her transgression is highlighted even more by the fact that she is an employee of the Judiciary. More than an ordinary citizen, she should be aware of her duty to obey the orders and processes of the Supreme Court without delay. Her willful disobedience to and disregard for the directive of this Court constitute grave and serious misconduct which cannot be tolerated.<br><br>Insubordination or unwillingness to submit to authority and refusal to perform official duty are glaring in the actuations of Clerk of Court Licay. They are grave offenses with the corresponding penalty of suspension of six (6) months and one (1) day to one (1) year. The Revised Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service is instructive. If the respondent is found guilty of two (2) or more charges or counts, the penalty to be imposed should be that corresponding to the most serious charge and the rest shall be considered aggravating circumstances. Moreover, the maximum of the penalty shall be imposed where only aggravating and no mitigating circumstances are present. Thus, as insubordination and refusal to perform official duty are both grave offenses, the latter shall be considered as aggravating to impose the maximum penalty of suspension of one year.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br></blockquote>In its 7 July 2014 Resolution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> the Court redocketed the case as a regular administrative complaint against Licay.<br><br><i>A.M.

No. P-11-2959</i></b><br><br>In A.M.

The remaining unsettled matter is the submission of the supporting documents for the withdrawn cash bonds amounting to P872,175.00<br><br>Licay failed to comply fully with the Court's order to submit the required supporting documents. She partially complied by submitting some, but not all, of the supporting documents. Licay claims that she is suffering from stroke, diabetes, and asthma which prevent her from complying with the Court's directive to submit the required supporting documents. She further alleges that she could no longer locate her files because the court had transferred twice. She suggests that the amount of P413,500.00 computed in the List of Fiduciary Fund with lacking documents be deducted from her salary which was withheld since February 2008.<br><br>This Court commiserates with Licay for the ailments that she is presently suffering. However, these do not exonerate her from the consequences of her omissions that took place before she became ill. In the absence of any showing that her medical problems prevented her from working,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Licay had no valid excuse for not faithfully performing her duties and responsibilities as Clerk of Court. Accordingly, she must restitute the amount of the remaining undocumented withdrawn cash bonds, after a determination of the exact amount thereof taking into account that she submitted official receipts, orders, and acknowledgment receipts in partial compliance with the Court's 25 July 2011 Resolution in A.M. No. P-11-2959.<br><br><b><i>A.M. No. P-14-3230</i></b><br><br>In A.M. No. P-14-3230, the Court disagrees with the recommendation of the OCA. Licay is guilty of grave misconduct and gross neglect of duty.<br><br>Under Administrative Circular No. 3-2000,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> the duty of the clerk of court is to receive JDF collections in their respective courts, issue the proper receipts and maintain a separate cash book properly marked as "CASH BOOK FOR JUDICIARY DEVELOPMENT FUND." The clerk of court shall then deposit such collections every day and render the proper Monthly Report of Collections and Deposits for said Fund within ten (1 0) days after the end of every month. Section 3-C of the JDF and SAJ procedural guidelines in Administrative Circular No. 35-2004, as amended,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> provides that the daily remittance of JDF and SAJ collections is required.<br><br>OCA Circular No. 50-95<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> provides that all collections from bailbonds, rental deposits and other fiduciary collections shall be deposited with the Land Bank of the Philippines by the clerk of court concerned. The deposit must be made within 24 hours from receipt. In localities where there are no Land Bank of the Philippines branches, fiduciary collections shall be deposited by the clerk of court with the provincial, city or municipal treasurer.<br><br>To implement these circulars, OCA Circular No. 113-2004<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> requires clerks of court to submit monthly reports for three funds: JDF, SAJ, and FF.<br><br>In the present case, Licay not only failed to fully comply with her duty as Clerk of Court based on the provisions of law, but likewise continuously ignored the reminders and stern warnings of the OCA and the Court to submit the missing Monthly Financial Reports. Even if she partially complied on some months, the 15 June 2011, 14 December 2011, 13 February 2013 and 23 October 2013 Court Resolutions still went unheeded and she deliberately failed to submit the Monthly Financial Reports. Evidently, Licay committed the grave offense of grave misconduct for her obstinate refusal to comply with the repeated directives of the Court requiring her to submit the Monthly Financial Reports.<br><br>In <i>Office of the Court Administrator v. Ganzan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> the Court stated that a resolution of the Court should not be construed as a mere request and should be complied with promptly and completely.<br><br>In <i>Alday v.

Reyes</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> a clerk of court was dismissed for his propensity to defy the directives of the Court. The Court stated that such attitude betrays not only a recalcitrant streak of character, but also disrespect for the lawful orders and directives of the Court.<br><br>In <i>Grefaldeo v. Lacson</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> the Court held that respondent's obstinate refusal to abide by the lawful directives of the Court must similarly be taken to mean as her own utter lack of interest to remain with, if not her contempt of, the system to which she unfittingly belongs.<br><br>For her inexcusable non-submission&nbsp; of the Monthly Financial Reports, Licay is also guilty of gross neglect of duty.<br><br>As distinguished from simple neglect of duty, which is defined as the failure of an employee to give proper attention to a required task or to discharge a duty due to carelessness or indifference, gross neglect of duty is characterized by want of.even the slightest care, or by conscious indifference to the consequences, or by flagrant and palpable breach of duty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>In this case, Licay, despite repeated directives from the Court to submit the Monthly Financial Reports, deliberately ignored the Resolutions showing her manifest indifference to the serious repercussions of her omissions.

Reyes</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> the Court found a clerk of court guilty of gross neglect of duty for, among others, non-submission of financial reports, undeposited collections, and delayed remittances. The Court held that:<br><blockquote>The undeposited collections and delayed remittances resulted to loss of interests that should have accrued had the collections been deposited promptly to their respective fund accounts. x x x. Indubitably, Reyes violated the trust reposed in her as collecting officer of the judiciary. The Court cannot tolerate non-submission of financial reports, non-reporting and non-deposit of collections, undue delay in the deposit of collections, unauthorized withdrawal, and non-explanation of incurred shortages and undeposited collections. x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br></blockquote>The Court consistently reminds that those in the Judiciary serve as sentinels of justice, and any act of impropriety on their part immeasurably affects the honor and dignity of the Judiciary and the people's confidence in it. The Judiciary demands the best possible individuals in the service and it had never and will never tolerate nor condone any conduct which violates the norms of public accountability, and diminishes, or even tends to diminish, the faith of the people in the justice system. Thus, the Court will not hesitate to rid its ranks of undesirables who undermine its efforts towards an effective and efficient administration of justice, thus tainting its image in the eyes of the public.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>Accordingly, in A.M. No. P-14-3230, the Court finds Licay guilty of grave misconduct for her defiance and stubbornness to obey legitimate directives of this Court and gross neglect of duty for non-submission of the Monthly Financial Reports, both of which are classified as grave offenses under Section 46(A), Rule 10 of the Revised Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service with the corresponding punishment of dismissal from the service.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court finds respondent Alma P.
