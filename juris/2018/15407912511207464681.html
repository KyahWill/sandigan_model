				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>LEONEN, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">When a party assails a lower court's appreciation of the evidence, that party raises a question of fact that cannot be entertained in a petition for review filed under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.<br><br>This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> assailing January 31, 2008 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and March 31, 2008 Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Court of Appeals, which overturned the Regional Trial Court July 15, 2006 Decision. The Regional Trial Court found Performance Foreign Exchange Corporation (Performance Forex) solidarity liable with broker Rolando Hipol (Hipol) for unauthorized trade transactions he made on Belina Cancio (Cancio) and Jeremy Pampolina's (Pampolina) joint trading account. The Court of Appeals, however, absolved Performance Forex from any liability.<br><br>Performance Forex is a corporation operating as a financial broker/agent between market participants in foreign exchange transactions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Foreign currency exchange trading or forex trading is the speculative trade of foreign currency for the sole purpose of gaining profit from the change in prices.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> The forex market is a "global, decentralized," and essentially "an over-the-counter (OTC) market where the different currency trading locations around the globe electronically form a unified, interconnected market entity."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Unlike a stock exchange market where the opening and closing of trades rely on only one (1) or two (2) time zones, a forex market may have overlapping time zones. Foreign currency, due to its decentralized nature, may be traded in different financial markets.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> For instance, trading currency using US dollars would not depend on the business or banking hours only of financial institutions in the United States.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Traders are drawn to the forex market since the price of currency constantly fluctuates. The value of a foreign currency is determined by international capital flow or the "movement of money from one currency to another."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> International capital flow is caused by a number of factors, among which are "a country's interest rates, inflation situation, [Gross Domestic Product] growth, employment, trade balance, and other barometers of economic health."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Currencies are traded in pairs by speculating the value of one currency against another.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> One currency, usually the US dollar,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> is considered the "base currency" while the other currency is a "quote or counter currency."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> If a trader speculates that the base currency will be stronger than the counter currency, the trader will sell the base currency to buy more counter currency. If the trader speculates that the base currency will be weaker than the counter currency, then the trader will sell the counter currency to buy more of the base currency.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> For example, if a trader speculates that the US dollar will rise in value as against the Philippine peso, the trader will sell dollars to acquire more pesos. If the trader speculates that the dollar will weaken against the peso, the trader will sell pesos to acquire more dollars.<br><br>In a standard forex trade, a trader would "open a position" by buying or selling a certain amount of a particular currency based on its value against the US dollar. The trader would then hold on to this particular currency until its value appreciates or depreciates. Once the value changes, the trader then "closes position" by selling this currency at a higher price or buying it at a lower price; hence, earning a profit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> If the trader sells when the value depreciates or buys when the value appreciates, the trader suffers a loss. Losses, however, are only realized when the traders close their positions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>The participants in a forex market are banks, hedge funds, investment firms, and individual retail traders.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Unlike banks, hedge funds, and investment firms that have significant amounts of capital to engage in trade, individual retail traders often make use of brokers, who "serve as an agent of the customer in the broader [foreign currency exchange] market, by seeking the best price in the market for a retail order and dealing on behalf of the retail customer."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Individual retail traders also rely on "leverage trading," where traders can open margin accounts with a financial broker or agent to make use of that broker or agent's credit line to engage in trade.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>A margin account is an account where the broker-dealer lends money to the trader to purchase currency, using the same purchased currency as collateral.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Returns will be proportional to the amount deposited.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Leverage is determined by the amount that the trader is required to deposit. If a trader has to deposit US$1,000.00 into a margin account to trade US$100,000.00 in currency, the margin account has a leverage of 100 to 1.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> This system allows the trader to control more money in the market than what was originally deposited.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Individual retail traders make use of leverage trading and margin accounts since price movements are usually miniscule. A "pip" is "the smallest unit of price movement in the exchange rate of a currency pair."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> The goal of every trader in foreign currency exchange is to earn pips. To underscore how miniscule expected profits are, pips commonly refer to the price movement of the <i>fourth</i> decimal place of major currencies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Miniscule price movements, thus, require large amounts of capital for them to have significant impact on the profits to be earned.<br><br>For example, the current Philippine peso equivalent of one (1) Japanese yen is P0.4830.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> A pip would be a change from P0.4830 to 0.4831. A P0.0001 price movement in the purchase of one (1) Japanese yen may not exactly have a significant effect but when multiplied by a hundred, it will actually mean a P48.31 increase for every trader betting on the rise of the yen and a P48.31 decrease for those expecting a rise in peso prices. Leverage trading can substantially magnify profits. Considering, however, that leverage trading is essentially trade using borrowed money, leverage trading can magnify losses just as much. Forex trade is, thus, considered a lucrative but risky endeavor since every trade multiplies profit and loss by a much higher rate than what was originally invested.<br><br>Sometime in 2000, Cancio and Pampolina accepted Hipol's invitation to open a joint account with Performance Forex. Cancio and Pampolina deposited the required margin account deposit of US$10,000.00 for trading. The parties executed an application for the opening of a joint account,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> with a trust/trading facilities agreement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> between Performance Forex, and Cancio and Pampolina. They likewise entered into an agreement for appointment of an agent<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> between Hipol, and Cancio and Pampolina.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> They agreed that Cancio and Pampolina would make use of Performance Forex's credit line to trade in the forex market while Hipol would act as their commission agent and would deal on their behalf in the forex market.<br><br>The trust/trading facilities agreement between Performance Forex, and Cancio and Pampolina provided:<br><blockquote>6. Orders<br><br>You hereby irrevocably authorize us to act upon any instructions, whether in writing, by cable, telex, facsimile or telephone given or purported to be given by you or your agent or representative which appear whether on their respective faces (in the case of writing, cable, telex or facsimile) or otherwise to be bonafide. We shall not be responsible and you shall indemnify us for any losses incurred as a result of acting upon such instructions should there in fact be any error commission ambiguities or other irregularities therein or therewith.<br><br>....<br><br>Commission Agent<br><br>You acknowledge and agree that the commission agent (one Mr/Ms <u>Ronald (sic) M. Hipol</u>) who introduced you to us in connection with this Facility is your agent and we are in no way responsible for his actions or any warranties or representations he may have made (whether expressly on our behalf or not) and that pursuant to his having introduced you to us, we will (if you accept this Facility) pay him a commission based on your trading with us (details of which will be applied to you on request). Should you choose to also vest in him trading authority on your behalf please do so only after considering the matter carefully, for we shall not be responsible nor liable for any abuse of the authority you may confer on him. This will be regarded strictly as a private matter between you and him. You further acknowledge that for our own protection and commercial purpose you are aware of the terms of the trading agreement between the commission agent and ourselves where the commission agent is to trade for you.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br></blockquote>All parties agreed that the trading would only be executed by Cancio and Pampolina, or, upon instructions to their agent, Hipol. The trading orders to Hipol would be coursed through phone calls from Cancio and Pampolina.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>From March 9, 2000 to April 4, 2000, Cancio and Pampolina earned US$7,223.98. They stopped trading for more or less two (2) weeks, after which, however, Cancio again instructed Hipol to execute trading currency orders. When she called to close her position, Hipol told her that he would talk to her personally.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Cancio later found out that Hipol never executed her orders. Hipol confessed to her that he made unauthorized transactions using their joint account from April 5, 2000 to April 12, 2000. The unauthorized transactions resulted in the loss of all their money, leaving a negative balance of US$35.72 in their Statement of Account. Cancio later informed Pampolina about the problem.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Pampolina met with two (2) Performance Forex officers, Dave Almarinez and Al Reyes, to complain about Hipol's unauthorized trading on their account and to confront them about his past unauthorized trades with Performance Forex's other client,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Justine Dela Rosa.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> The officers apologized for Hipol's actions and promised to settle their account. However, they stayed quiet about Hipol's past unauthorized trading.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Performance Forex offered US$5,000.00 to settle the matter but Cancio and Pampolina rejected this offer. Their demand letters to Hipol were also unheeded.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Thus, they filed a Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> for damages against Performance Forex and Hipol before the Regional Trial Court of Mandaluyong City.<br><br>Hipol was declared in default. Since the parties were unable to come to a settlement, trial commenced.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>During trial, Performance Forex's General Manager for Sales and Marketing Jonathan Reyes Ocampo (Ocampo) testified that clients could trade through two (2) types of brokers. The first type is the independent broker, or one who is already experienced in trading and merely attends Performance Forex's orientation trainings to know its policies and regulations. The second type is an in-house broker or business relations officer, who is new to the business and has to be supervised by the sales and marketing managers. He stated that Hipol was an Investment Portfolio Manager, or an independent broker who not only provided information from financial experts but also executed orders on behalf of the clients.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>Performance Forex Senior Manager Gabriel Erazo (Erazo) added that in-house brokers usually cater to walk-in clients and are stationed in the company premises while independent brokers, like Hipol, seek clients and introduce them to the company.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>Ocampo likewise testified that clients must first sign a Purchase Order Form before Performance Forex could authorize an order transaction. Every transaction must have its own Purchase Order Form.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Erazo confirmed that dealings were still done manually at the time of the questioned transactions, and that clients or agents must submit an actual signed Purchase Order Form.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Ocampo confirmed that they paid a "goodwill offer," i.e. the return of the broker's commission, to their client Justine Dela Rosa for Hipol's alleged unauthorized transactions. He also testified that Hipol's accreditation had to be cancelled after Pampolina complained against him to protect the reputation of the company.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>On July 15, 2006, the Regional Trial Court rendered its Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> finding Performance Forex and Hipol solidarity liable to Cancio and Pampolina for damages.<br><br>According to the Regional Trial Court, Performance Forex should have disclosed to Cancio and Pampolina that Hipol made similar unauthorized trading activities in the past, which could have affected their consent to Hipol's appointment as their agent. It also noted that innocent third persons should not be prejudiced due to Performance Forex's failure to adopt the necessary measures to prevent unauthorized trading by its agents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> The dispositive portion of the Regional Trial Court July 15, 2006 Decision read:<br><blockquote>ACCORDINGLY, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the plaintiffs and against the defendants PERFORMANCE FOREIGN EXCHANGE CORPORATION and ROLANDO HIPOL. Both defendants are jointly and severally liable to pay the plaintiffs the following:<br><br>a. the amount of US$17,223.98 or its peso equivalent plus legal interest from the filing of the complaint until the whole obligation is fully paid.<br><br>b. the amount of Php50,000.00 as attorney's fees; Php100,000.00 moral damages and Php100,000.00 exemplary damages.<br><br>c. cost of suit<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br></blockquote>Performance Forex appealed this Decision to the Court of Appeals, arguing that it had adequate safeguards concerning dealings with commission agents, and that it was Cancio and Pampolina who vested Hipol with "broad powers to conduct trading on their behalf."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>On January 31, 2008, the Court of Appeals rendered its Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> granting the appeal.<br><br>According to the Court of Appeals, Performance Forex was a trading facility that acted only on whatever their clients or their representatives would order. It was not privy to anything that happened between its clients and their representatives.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> It found that Cancio admitted to giving Hipol pre-signed authorizations to trade; hence, Performance Forex relied on these orders and on Hipol's designation as their agent to facilitate the trades from April 5, 2000 to April 9, 2000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals likewise found that Performance Forex's non­ disclosure of Hi pol's prior unauthorized transactions with another client was irrelevant since he was an independent broker who was not employed with Performance Forex. Thus, Performance Forex had no legal duty to disclose any prior misconduct to its clients. It also noted that the trust/trading facilities agreement between Cancio and Pampolina, and Performance Forex contained a provision freeing itself from any liability from losses incurred by acting on the instructions of its clients or their authorized representatives. Thus, the Court of Appeals concluded that Cancio and Pampolina's action should only be against Hipol.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> The dispositive portion of the Court of Appeals January 31, 2008 Decision read:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the appeal is hereby GRANTED. Appellant Performance Foreign Exchange Corporation is hereby released from liability.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br></blockquote>Cancio and Pampolina moved for reconsideration but were denied by the Court of Appeals in its March 31, 2008 Resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Hence, this Petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> was filed before this Court.<br><br>Petitioners Cancio and Pampolina argue that bonafide transactions in respondent Performance Forex's facility depends on signed purchase order forms from clients. They allege that there were only 10 purchase order forms signed by petitioner Cancio and yet respondent executed 29 transactions on their account, in clear breach of its assurance that only bonafide transactions would be honored.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> They likewise point out that respondent was aware of similar unauthorized transactions by Hipol in the past and even settled the complaint against him, but respondent neglected to inform petitioners about them, thus, failing to observe the degree of care, precaution, and vigilance for the protection of petitioners' interests.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> They claim that in view of respondent's bad faith and breach of its contractual obligations, it is liable for actual damages, exemplary damages, and moral damages with attorney's fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>Respondent counters that it was unnecessary to examine other purchase order forms since "petitioners' cause of action against respondent is grounded on defendant Hipol's purported unauthorized trading transactions which occurred during the period 4 to 12 April 2000 <u><b>and no other</b></u>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> It likewise insists that it cannot be held liable for damages caused by Hipol considering that it is not Hipol's employer and that any losses suffered were due to "the very broad and vast powers"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> that petitioners gave him to transact on their behalf. It also points out that according to the trust/trading facilities agreement, petitioners agreed that respondent would not be responsible for any act, warranty, or representation made by their agent on their behalf; thus, it cannot be held liable for any damages claimed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>Respondent asserts that the Petition should be dismissed outright since petitioners failed to attach the necessary documents to support their Petition. It also submits that the Petition raises questions of fact by asking this Court to examine the probative value of the evidence introduced before the Regional Trial Court and the Court of Appeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>Petitioners, on the other hand, counter that there was substantial compliance by their subsequent submission of the required documents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> They claim that they only raise questions of law since the facts have been settled. What they argue is merely the Court of Appeals' application of the law given the facts of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>From the arguments of the parties, this Court is asked to resolve the issue of whether or not respondent Performance Forex Exchange Corporation should be held solidarity liable with petitioners Belina Cancio and Jeremy Pampolina's broker, Hipol, for damages due to the latter's unauthorized transactions in the foreign currency exchange trading market. Before this issue can be resolved, this Court must first pass upon the procedural issues of whether or not the Petition should be dismissed for petitioners' failure to attach necessary pleadings, and whether or not the Petition raises questions of fact.<br><br><center><b>I</b><br></center><br>The failure to attach material portions of the record will not necessarily cause the outright dismissal of the petition. While Rule 45, Section 4 of the Rules of Court requires that the petition "be accompanied by ... such material portions of the record as would support the petition,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> this Court may still give due course if there is substantial compliance with the Rules.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> Rule 45, Section 7 states:<br><blockquote>Section 7. Pleadings and documents that may be required; sanctions. - For purposes of determining whether the petition should be dismissed or denied pursuant to section 5 of this Rule, or where the petition is given due course under section 8 hereof, the Supreme Court may require or allow the filing of such pleadings, briefs, memoranda or documents as it may deem necessary within such periods and under such conditions as it may consider appropriate, and impose the corresponding sanctions in case of non-filing or unauthorized filing of such pleadings and documents or non-compliance with the conditions therefor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br></blockquote>In <i>E.I. Dupont Nemours v. Francisco</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> this Court stated that a petition for review under Rule 45 may still be given due course if the petitioner later submits the required documents, thus:<br><blockquote>[A] petition lacking an essential pleading or part of the case record may still be given due course or reinstated (if earlier dismissed) upon showing that petitioner later submitted the documents required, or that it will serve the higher interest of justice that the case be decided on the merits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br></blockquote>In this instance, petitioners submitted the assailed Court of Appeals January 31, 2008 Decision in their Petition,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> which quoted substantial portions of the Regional Trial Court June 15, 2006 Decision; the Regional Trial Court's records; and the Court of Appeals' <i>rollo</i>. They likewise attached in their Reply a copy of the Complaint,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> the Balance Ledger for Dealings,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> and the Purchase Order Forms<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> presented before the Regional Trial Court. These documents more than suffice to substantiate petitioners' claims.<br><br><center><b>II</b><br></center><br>This Court is not a trier of facts. Factual findings of the lower courts will not be disturbed by this Court if supported by substantial evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> Thus, Rule 45 of the Rules of Court requires that a petition for review on certiorari only raise questions of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br>The distinction between a question of fact and a question of law is settled. In <i>Century Iron Works v. Bañas</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br><blockquote>A question of law arises when there is doubt as to what the law is on a certain state of facts, while there is a question of fact when the doubt arises as to the truth or falsity of the alleged facts. For a question to be one of law, the question must not involve an examination of the probative value of the evidence presented by the litigants or any of them. The resolution of the issue must rest solely on what the law provides on the given set of circumstances. Once it is clear that the issue invites a review of the evidence presented, the question posed is one of fact.<br><br>Thus, the test of whether a question is one of law or of fact is not the appellation given to such question by the party raising the same; rather, it is whether the appellate court can determine the issue raised without reviewing or evaluating the evidence, in which case, it is a question of law; otherwise it is a question of fact.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br></blockquote>Appeal is not a matter of right but of sound judicial discretion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br>While questions of fact are generally not entertained by this Court, there are, of course, ce1iain permissible exceptions, summarized in <i>Medina v. Mayor Asistio, Jr.</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br><blockquote>(1) When the conclusion is a finding grounded entirely on speculation, surmises or conjectures ...; (2) When the inference made is manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible ...; (3) Where there is a grave abuse of discretion ...; (4) When the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts ...; (5) When the findings of fact are conflicting ...; (6) When the Court of Appeals, in making its findings, went beyond the issues of the case and the same is contrary to the admissions of both appellant and appellee ...; (7) The findings of the Court of Appeals are contrary to those of the trial court ...; (8) When the findings of fact are conclusions without citation of specific evidence on which they are based ...; (9) When the facts set forth in the petition as well as in the petitioners' main and reply briefs are not disputed by the respondents ...; and (10) The finding of fact of the Court of Appeals is premised on the supposed absence of evidence and is contradicted by the evidence on record ...<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>A case falling under any of these exceptions, however, does not automatically require this Court's review. In <i>Pascual v. Burgos</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> this Court explained that a party cannot merely claim that his or her case falls under any of the exceptions; he or she "must demonstrate and prove"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> that a review of the factual findings is necessary.<br><br>In this instance, petitioners do not plead that their case falls under any of the exceptions since their contention is that their Petition only raises questions of law. They claim that this Court "need not probe into the entirety of evidence on record, as the falsity or veracity of the facts, as stated in the assailed decision, [is] not in issue."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br>Petitioners, however, contradict this when they submit that while "[t]here is no doubt as to the existence of the ... facts," the Court of Appeals' legal conclusions were "contradictory to its very findings" and that the case was "differently ruled, and correctly so, by the [Regional Trial Court]."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> This argument, otherwise stated, assails the Court of Appeals' <i>appreciation</i> of the evidence and not merely its application of the law. This is clear when petitioners argue that:<br><blockquote>29. Despite finding only two (2) purchase order forms for the twelve (12) enumerated transactions, the [Court of Appeals] still found no badge of negligence or breach of contractual obligation on the part of respondent. This is very much contradictory to its very findings that all trading transactions must be accompanied by purchase order forms, being the obligation of respondent to secure the orders of petitioners.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br></blockquote>In <i>Pascual</i>, this Court stated that there is a question of fact "when the issue presented before this court is the correctness of the lower courts' appreciation of the evidence presented by the parties."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> To determine whether a lower court erred in the appreciation of evidence, this Court must also examine the records to see if there was evidence that was overlooked or if certain pieces of evidence were given undue weight. Thus, petitioners cannot evade having raised questions of fact before this Court by simply arguing that the facts are not disputed.<br><br>This Court has previously stated that "[n]egligence, that is, a failure to comply with some duty of care owed by one to another, is a mixed question of law and fact."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> There is a question of law as to the duty of care owed by a defendant to a plaintiff. The existence of negligence, however, is determined by facts and evidence, which makes it a question of fact.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup><br><br>The review of a finding of negligence involves a question of fact.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> It is evidentiary in nature. It requires an examination of the evidence presented by the parties to determine the basis of this negligence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> This Court has likewise held that determination of the existence of a breach of contract is a question of fact.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup><br><br>A petition for review filed under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court that assails the Court of Appeals' failure to find negligence or breach of contract based on the evidence presented is essentially raising questions of fact.

style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup> According to the Balance Ledger, commission was deducted from petitioners' account 15 times. Thus, commission was deducted for every successful <i>transaction</i>, not for every time a "buy" or "sell" was made.<br><br>Interestingly, the eleventh and twelfth transactions occurred when petitioners were still actively trading. This means that they executed more instructions to Hipol than what was covered by the signed purchase order forms that he held, without complaint. Petitioner Pampolina even testified that they were constantly aware of the status of their account when they were trading:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">Q</div></td><td width="95%"> <div align="justify">How did you get to know that you accumulated around $7,000.00 for your account?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A</div></td><td> <div align="justify">Because every time that we execute orders[,] we take a position[,] and at the same time[,] we monitor also the rate of the position that we are taking and we also relieve orders to take profit. So, as long as we relieve orders to take profit[,] we know that we are making money.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup><br></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>Petitioners would have been aware that respondent could execute instructions relayed by Hipol even without the required purchase order form. Otherwise, they would have stopped executing orders upon their tenth transaction. Even if this Court were to apply petitioners' argument that a "buy" and a "sell" is counted as one (1) transaction each, that would still mean that there were 23 transactions made when petitioners were actively trading. There would still be 13 orders that petitioners relayed to Hipol over and above the 10 pre-signed purchase order forms that he held.<br><br>Moreover, petitioners assail the alleged unauthorized transactions executed after April 4, 2000, when they allegedly stopped relaying instructions to Hipol. These alleged unauthorized transactions, they argue, breached respondent's contractual obligation to execute only bonafide instructions from petitioners. From the table above, these transactions would refer to the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth transactions.<br><br>Respondents, however, presented signed purchase order forms for the contested transactions occurring after April 4, 2000, namely, the purchase order forms dated April 4, 2000,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> April 5, 2000,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup> and April 9, 2000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup> If there was any breach committed by respondent, it occurred when petitioners actively traded and they would have been aware of this breach, not when they stopped trading.<br><br>Respondent likewise did not have the duty to disclose to petitioners any previous infractions committed by their agent.<br><br>Hipol, petitioners' agent, was not employed with respondent. He was categorized as an independent broker for commission. In <i>Behn, Meyer, and Co. v. Nolting</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup><br><blockquote>A broker is generally defined as one who is engaged, for others, on a commission, negotiating contracts relative to property with the custody of which he has no concern; the negotiator between other parties. never acting in his own name, but in the name of those who employed him; he is strictly a middleman and for some purposes the agent of both parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup><br></blockquote>When Hipol became petitioners' agent, he had committed only one (1) known prior infraction against a client of respondent. Respondent might have been construed this as an isolated incident that did not warrant heightened scrutiny. Hipol's infraction committed against petitioners was his second known infraction. Respondent cancelled his accreditation when petitioners informed them of his unauthorized transactions.<br><br>It would be different if Hipol committed a series of infractions and respondent continued to accredit him. In that instance, respondent would have been complicit to Hipol's wrongdoings. Respondent, not being Hipol's employer, had no power of discipline over him. It could only cancel his accreditation, which it did after a second incident was reported. This was the extent by which respondent was obligated to act on Hipol's infractions.<br><br>Moreover, petitioners and respondent signed and agreed to absolve respondent from actions, representations, and warranties of their agent made on their behalf, thus:<br><blockquote>Commission Agent<br><br>You acknowledge and agree that the commtssiOn agent (one Mr/Ms <u>Ronald (sic) M. Hipol</u>) who introduced you to us in connection with this Facility is your agent and we are in no way responsible for his actions or any warranties or representations he may have made (whether expressly on our behalf or not) and that pursuant to his having introduced you to us, we will (if you accept this Facility) pay him a commission based on your trading with us (details of which will be applied to you on request). Should you choose to also vest in him trading authority on your behalf please do so only after considering the matter carefully, for we shall not be responsible nor liable for any abuse of the authority you may confer on him. This will be regarded strictly as a private matter between you and him. You further acknowledge that for our own protection and commercial purpose you are aware of the terms of the trading agreement between the commission agent and ourselves where the commission agent is to trade for you.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioners conferred trading authority to Hipol. Respondent was not obligated to question whether Hipol exceeded that authority whenever he made purchase orders. Respondent was likewise not privy on how petitioners instructed Hipol to carry out their orders. It did not assign Hipol to be petitioners' agent. Hipol was the one who approached petitioners and offered to be their agent. Petitioners were highly educated<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup> and were "[a]lready knowledgeable in playing in this foreign exchange trading."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[121]</sup> They would have been aware of the extent of authority they granted to Hipol when they handed to him 10 pre-signed blank purchase order forms. Under Article 1900 of the Civil Code:<br><blockquote>Article 1900. So far as third persons are concerned, an act is deemed to have been performed within the scope of the agent's authority, if such act is within the terms of the power of attorney, as written, even if the agent has in fact exceeded the limits of his authority according to an understanding between the principal and the agent.<br></blockquote>Before a claimant can be entitled to damages, "the claimant should satisfactorily show the existence of the factual basis of damages and its causal connection to defendant's acts."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup> The acts of petitioners' agent, Hipol, were the direct cause of their injury. There is no reason to hold respondent liable for actual and moral damages. Since the basis for moral damages has not been established, there would likewise be no basis to recover exemplary damages<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup> and attorney's fees<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[124]</sup> from respondent. If there was any fault, the fault remains with petitioners' agent and him alone.<br><br>The State has already taken notice of the high risks involved in foreign exchange leverage trading. In the prior case of <i>Securities and Exchange Commission v. Performance Foreign Exchange Corporation</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[125]</sup> the Securities and Exchange Commission tried to issue a cease-and-desist order against respondent for trading foreign currency futures contracts without the proper license.<br><br>This Court invalidated the cease-and-desist order upon finding that it was improperly issued. It also took note that even the Securities and Exchange Commission was unsure of whether foreign currency exchange trading constituted futures commodity trading, and that it had to request the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas for its advice. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas' reply read:<br><blockquote>Dear Ms. Bautista,<br><br>This refers to your letter dated February 8, 2001 requesting for a definitive statement that the foreign currency leverage trading engage[d] in by private corporations, particularly, Performance Foreign Exchange Corporation (PFEC), is a financial derivatives transaction and that it can only be undertaken by banks or non-bank financial intermediaries performing quasi-banking functions and/or its subsidiaries/affiliates.<br><br>As indicated in your description of the transactions and the documents submitted, <i>the foreign currency leverage trading, subject of your query, is essentially similar in mechanics to currency future trading, particularly with respect to the margin requirements, standard contract size, and daily market-to-market of open position. However, it does not fall under the category of futures trading because it is not exchange­traded. Further, we can not classify it as being financial derivatives transactions as we consider the transaction as plain currency margin trading, which by its mechanics, involve the set-up of margin and non­delivery of the currencies involved</i>.<br><br>In view of the foregoing facts, the activities of the aforesaid corporation are not covered by [the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas'] guidelines on derivative licensing.<br><br>We hope we have satisfactorily clarified your concerns.<br><br>Very truly yours,<br>(Sgd.)<br>AMANDO M. TETANGCO, JR.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[126]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Nonetheless, the Securities and Exchange Commission persisted in regulating entities involved in foreign exchange leverage trading, issuing the following Advisory:<br><blockquote><center>SEC ADVISORY<br><br>20 October 2016<br><br>FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRADING<br></center><br>The advisory is prompted by the complaints of retail investors who lost their moneys to forex trading.<br><br>The public is advised that TRADING OF COMMODITIES FUTURES CONTRACTS IN THE PHILIPPINES (including Foreign Exchange Trading as consistently held by the Commission) and the pertinent RULES ARE STILL SUSPENDED pursuant to Paragraph 4 of Rule II of the Amended Rules and Regulations implementing the Securities Regulation Code.<br><br>Based on the reports, huge amount of money has been invested (usually in US dollars) in forex trading corporations where investors opened margin accounts to enable them to trade in foreign currency. The so-called "experts" of the forex trading corporations execute foreign trade positions in behalf of the investors on the representation that investors shall gain profit as in the stock market.<br><br>It has to be reiterated that under Section 11 of the Securities Regulation Code "no person shall offer, sell or enter into commodity futures contract except in accordance with rules and regulations and orders of the Commission may prescribe in the public interest".<br><br>The investors should also take the cue from the ruling laid down in <i>Onapal v. Court of Appeals</i> (G.R. No. 90707, February 3, 1993) where the Supreme Court stated in this wise: "xxx The payments made under said contract were payments of difference in prices arising out of the rise or fall in the market price above or below the contract price thus making it purely gambling and declared null and void by law."<br><br>The public is encouraged to report to the Commission entities operating Foreign Exchange Trading and those acting as agents of these operators.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[127]</sup><br></blockquote>Considering, however, that the legality of foreign exchange leverage trading is not in issue in this case, this Court will not delve further into the current regulations affecting it. It has been concluded that foreign exchange leverage trading is known to be risky and may lead to substantial losses for investors. Petitioners, who were experienced in this kind of trading, should have been more careful in the conduct of their affairs.<br><br>Currency trading adds no new good or service into the market that would be of use to real persons. Instead, it has the tendency to alter the price of real goods and services to the detriment of those who manufacture, labor, and consume products. It may alter the real value of goods and services on the basis of a rumor or anything else that will cause a herd of speculative traders to move one way or the other. Put in another way, those who participate in it must be charged with knowledge that getting rich in this way is accompanied with great risk. Given its real effects on the real economy and on real people, it will be unfair for this Court to provide greater warranties to the parties in currency trading. They should bear their own risks perhaps to learn that their capital is better invested more responsibly and for the greater good of society.<br><br>Be that as it may, to arrive at these conclusions, this Court has to extensively review the evidence submitted by the parties. If, as petitioners claim, the Petition only raised pure questions of law, there would have been no need to re-examine the evidence.
