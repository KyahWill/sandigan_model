The parties in this case as evidenced by the Promissory Note and other loan documents <i>have mutually agreed to the payment of interest, past due interest and penalties in case the borrowers defaulted to pay their loan obligation on the stipulated date. It is likewise stipulated therein that the interest rate is floating and reviewable monthly</i>. Considering that the (appellants) defaulted in their monthly amortization, their subsequent payments shall be first applied on the accrued interest and penalties and thereafter to the principal loan. If the debt produces interest, payment of the principal shall not be deemed to have been made until the interest have been covered (Art 1253 of the New Civil Code). x x x <i>(Appellants) have agreed with the (appellee) that the interest rate was subject to a possible escalation or deescalation without advanced notice to them in the event the law or the Monetary Board prescribed a change in the interest rate</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> The petitioners moved for reconsideration, but the CA denied their motion on May 9, 2012 because it had already passed upon.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> </p><p align="center"><b>Issues</b> </p><p>The issues being now presented by the petitioners for our consideration and resolution can be stated as follows: </p><ol><li> Whether or not the CA erred in declaring that the extrajudicial foreclosure sale was valid despite the failure to publish and post the notice of the rescheduled foreclosure sale; <br><br></li><li>Whether or not the petitioners were estopped from impugning the foreclosure sale by their effort to redeem the property; and<br><br></li><li>Whether or not the loan obligation had already been fully settled by the petitioners. </li></ol> <p> </p><p align="center"> <b>Ruling of the Court</b> </p><p> The appeal is partly meritorious. </p><p align="center"> <b>1. <br> The extrajudicial foreclosure sale held<br> on February 18, 2002 was void <i>ab initio</i></b> </p><p> Act No. 3135<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> prescribes the requirements of posting and publication of the notice for the extrajudicial foreclosure sale. The law specifically mandates the publication of the notice in a newspaper of general circulation for at least three consecutive weeks if the value of the property is more than P400,000.00. Its Section 3 states: </p><blockquote> <p> Section 3. Notice shall be given by posting notices of the sale for not less than twenty days in at least three public places of the municipality or city where the property is situated, and <b>if such property is worth more than four hundred pesos, such notice shall also be published once a week for at least three consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality or the city</b>. [Bold underscoring supplied for emphasis] </p> </blockquote> <p>The requirements for the posting and publication of the notice for the extrajudicial foreclosure sale set on January 15, 2002 were complied with by posting the notice in public places in Rizal and in the place where the property of the petitioners was located, and by publishing the notice in <i>The Challenger News</i>, a newspaper of general circulation in Rizal. However, the sale set on January 15, 2002 did not push through because the representative of Premiere Bank did not appear, and was rescheduled to February 18, 2002. Thereafter, the notice for the <i>rescheduled</i> foreclosure sale was not posted and published as required by Act No. 3135. </p> <p>We hold that the invalidity of the public sale of the petitioners' property sprang from such non-compliance with the requirements under Act No. 3135. </p> <p> In its decision, the CA, citing <i>Perez v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> to the effect that act of redemption was an implied admission of the regularity of the sale, declared the petitioners herein estopped from assailing the extrajudicial foreclosure sale held on February 18, 2002 by their act of redeeming the property and tendering the redemption price. Accordingly, Premiere Bank submits that the foreclosure sale held on February 18, 2002 should be upheld.</p><p> We cannot concur with the CA's decision. </p><p>To begin with, the reliance by the CA on <i>Perez v. Court of Appeals</i> was patently misplaced. The Court considered therein the respondents' pleas for extension of the time to redeem the foreclosed property as a waiver of the defects and irregularities that had attended the foreclosure proceedings. A careful reading of <i>Perez v. Court of Appeals</i> discloses, however, that the defects and irregularities during the foreclosure proceedings adverted to therein were limited to the erroneous computation of the balance on the respondents' unsettled account and to the lack of notice of sale to the respondents prior to the conduct of the sale. The Court did not directly address and resolve therein whether or not the foreclosure sale was valid despite the failure to publish or to post the notice of the postponed sale. In contrast, the irregularity being assailed herein related to the non-compliance with the posting and publication requirements mandated by Act No. 3135. Clearly, the ruling in <i>Perez v. Court of Appeals</i> was not relevant and authoritative in this adjudication. </p><p> Secondly, the requirements for posting and publication under Act No. 3135 were mandatory and jurisdictional. . We have held that statutory provisions governing the publication of notice of mortgage foreclosure sales must be strictly complied with; hence, even slight deviations from the requirements would invalidate the notice and render the sale <i>at least</i> voidable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> The objective of the notice requirements is to achieve a "reasonably wide publicity" of the public sale so that whoever may be interested may know of and attend the public sale. This is the reason why the publication must be made in a newspaper of general circulation. The Court has previously taken judicial notice of the "far-reaching effects" of publishing the notice of sale in a newspaper of general circulation. As such, the publication of the notice of sale in a newspaper of general circulation is essential to the validity of the foreclosure proceedings.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> To allow the parties to waive the jurisdictional requirement can convert into a private sale what ought to be a public auction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> </p><p>In <i>Philippine National Bank v. Nepomuceno Productions, Inc</i>.,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> the Court has expounded on the significance and primary purpose of the requirements for the posting of the notice of the sale and its publication in a newspaper of general circulation, <em>viz</em>.: </p><blockquote> <p> The principal object of a notice of sale in a foreclosure of mortgage is not so much to notify the mortgagor as to inform the public generally of the nature and condition of the property to be sold, and of the time, place, and terms of the sale. <b>Notices are given to secure bidders and to prevent a sacrifice of the property. Clearly, the statutory requirements of posting and publication are mandated, not for the mortgagor's benefit, but for the public or third persons. In fact, personal notice to the mortgagor in extrajudicial foreclosure proceedings is not even necessary, unless stipulated. As such, it is imbued with public policy consideration and any waiver thereon would be inconsistent with the letter and intent of Act No. 3135.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> [Bold emphasis supplied]</p> </blockquote> <p> The petitioner in <i>Philippine National Bank v. Nepomuceno Productions Inc</i>. had sought the extrajudicial foreclosure of the respondents' mortgaged properties. The sheriff initially set the foreclosure sale on August 12, 1976, but the sale was rescheduled several times without publishing the notice of the rescheduled sale. The sale finally proceeded on December 20, 1976, and the petitioner turned out to be the highest bidder. The respondents sued to nullify the sale. The Court declared the sale void for non-compliance with the requirements under Act No. 3135 for the posting and publication of the notice of sale, ruling thusly: </p><blockquote> <p>We also cannot accept petitioner's argument that respondents should be held in <i>estoppel</i> for inducing the former to re-schedule the sale without need of republication and reposting of the notice of sale. </p> <p>Records show that respondents, indeed, requested for the postponement of the foreclosure sale. That, however, is all that respondents sought. Nowhere in the records was it shown that respondents purposely sought re-scheduling of the sale <i>without need of republication and reposting of the notice of sale</i>. To request postponement of the sale is one thing; to request it without need of compliance with the statutory requirements is another. Respondents, therefore, did not commit any act that would have estopped them from questioning the validity of the foreclosure sale for non-compliance with Act No. 3135.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> It was, therefore, wrong and presumptuous for Premiere Bank to justify the non-compliance with the requirements of posting and publication by reminding that the petitioners had themselves requested the series of postponements of the sale. We have already settled that the compliance with the requirements for posting and publication of the notice of the <i>rescheduled</i> sale was essential to the validity of the sale. The compliance could not be waived by either of the parties to the mortgage by reason of its being based on public policy considerations. As such, the statutory requirements of posting and publication of the notice were not intended for the protection of the parties to the mortgage but for the benefit of third persons. The foreclosure proceedings are undeniably imbued with public policy considerations, and any waiver made in connection therewith would be inconsistent with the intent and letter of Act No. 3135.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></p> <p> In light of the essentiality of the compliance with the notice requirements under Act No. 3135, the argument by Premiere Bank that it should not be responsible for the lack of posting and publication of the notice of the rescheduled sale because the conduct of the foreclosure sale was entirely under the control of the sheriff, and because its only participation in the proceedings was to pay the expenses of the publication as determined by the sheriff<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> was really of no consequence.</p> <p> And, thirdly, that the respondent sheriff was entitled to be presumed to have regularly performed his official duties in conducting the foreclosure proceedings, as Premiere Bank has urged,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> did not validate the sale. Such presumption could not excuse the non-compliance with the mandatory and jurisdictional requirements of Act No. 3135. At any rate, the disputable presumption of regularity could not even be extended to the respondent sheriff in view of the lack of posting and publication being sufficiently established by the admissions of the parties and their evidence.</p> <p> In view of the foregoing, the declaration of the February 18, 2002 sale as void <em>ab initio</em> is fully warranted. </p> <p align="center"><b>2. <br> The petitioners' liability to Premiere Bank, being a <br> factual matter, cannot be determined by the Court</b></p> <p> The last issue being raised herein is whether or not the loan obligation of the petitioners was fully settled. In this regard, the parties ostensibly disagreed, with the petitioners insisting that they were liable only for P401,820.00, the amount they actually tendered to the respondent sheriff in their effort to redeem the property but Premiere Bank belying the adequacy of their tender through its claim of their outstanding obligation already totaling P2,062,254.26 as of February 18, 2002. Such issue is a factual one that the Court cannot review and resolve through this mode of appeal. </p> <p>Accordingly, the petitioners' appeal of this issue should be disallowed for being in contravention of Section 1,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Rule 45 of the <em>Rules of Court</em>, which limited the appeal to questions of law that the petitioners must distinctly set forth. The limitation to questions of law is observed because the Court is not a trier of fact. </p> <p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court <b>PARTIALLY GRANTS</b> the petition for review on certiorari; and <b>MODIFIES</b> the decision promulgated on January 27, 2012 by: </p><p>(1) <b>DECLARING NULL AND VOID</b>: (a) the foreclosure sale held on February 18 2002 of the property located in Rodriguez, Montalban, Rizal to Premiere Development Bank; and (b) the issuance of Transfer Certificate of Title No. 452198 of the Register of Deeds of Marikina City issued in the name of Premiere Bank; </p><p>(2) <b>DIRECTING</b> the Register of Deeds of Marikina City <b>TO CANCEL</b> Transfer Certificate of Title No. 452198 issued in the name of Premiere Development Bank; and <b>TO REINSTATE</b> Transfer Certificate of Title No. 150668 issued in the name of petitioners Spouses Flavio P.
