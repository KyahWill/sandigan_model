Petitioner claimed that in 1997, it discovered that the NPC's transmission towers and transmission lines were located within a 19,635-square meter (sq. m.) portion (subject land) of its lands situated in Brgy. Felisa, Bacolod City. Further verification revealed that the transmission towers were constructed sometime before 1985 by NPC which entered the subject land without its knowledge and consent.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> </p><p> For its part,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> NPC denied having entered the subject land without any authority, and claimed that petitioner's President, Jovito Sayson, granted it the permit to enter<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> on September 21, 1989 for the construction of the 138 KV Mabinay-Bacolod Transmission Line. It further countered that since the transmission lines have been in existence for more than ten (10) years, a continuous easement of right of way has already been established.

At that time, the first stage of the expropriation proceedings, <i>i.e.</i>, the determination of the validity of the expropriation, has not been completed since no order of expropriation has yet been issued by the RTC, albeit it is not contested that the NPC's entry in the subject land was done for a public purpose,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> <i>i.e</i>., the construction/installation of transmission towers and lines which fall within the term "national government projects."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> It is settled that there is no need to determine with reasonable certainty the final amount of just compensation until after the trial court ascertains the provisional amount to be paid.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></p><p> The general rule is that upon the filing of the expropriation complaint, the plaintiff has the right to take or enter into possession of the real property involved if he deposits with the authorized government depositary an amount equivalent to the assessed value of the property. An exception to this procedure is provided by RA 8974 with respect to national government projects, which requires the payment of 100% of the zonal value of the property to be expropriated as the <u>provisional value</u>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> It must be emphasized, however, that whether a deposit is made under Rule 67 of the Rules of Court or the provisional value of the property is paid pursuant to RA 8974,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> the said amount serves the double-purpose of: (a) pre-payment if the property is fully expropriated, and (b) indemnity for damages if the proceedings are dismissed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></p><p> Section 2, Rule 67 of the Rules of Court requires the expropriator to deposit the amount equivalent to the assessed value of the property to be expropriated prior to entry. The assessed value<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> of a real property constitutes a mere percentage of its fair market value based on the assessment levels fixed under the pertinent ordinance passed by the local government where the property is located.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> In contrast, RA 8974 requires the payment of the amount equivalent to 100% of the current zonal value<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> of the property, which is usually a higher amount.</p><p> In <i>Republic of the Philippines v. Judge Gingoyon</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> the Court recognized that while expropriation proceedings have always demanded just compensation in exchange for private property, the deposit requirement under Rule 67 of the Rules of Court <b>"impeded immediate compensation to the private owner, especially in cases wherein the determination of the final amount of compensation would prove highly disputed."</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Thus, it categorically declared that <b>"[i]t is the plain intent of [RA] 8974 to <i><u>supersede</u></i> the system of deposit under Rule 67 with the scheme of 'immediate payment' in cases involving national government infrastructure projects."</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> The same case further ruled: </p><blockquote> <p> It likewise bears noting that <b>the appropriate standard of just compensation is a substantive matter. It is well within the province of the legislature to fix the standard, which it did through the enactment of [RA] 8974. Specifically, this prescribes the new standard in determining the amount of just compensation in expropriation cases relating to national government infrastructure projects, as well as the payment of the provisional value as a prerequisite to the issuance of a writ of possession.</b> Of course, rules of procedure, as distinguished from substantive matters, remain the exclusive preserve of the Supreme Court by virtue of Section 5(5), Article VIII of the Constitution. Indeed, Section 14 of the Implementing Rules recognizes the <b>continued applicability of Rule 67 on procedural aspects</b> when it provides "all matters regarding defenses and objections to the complaint, issues on uncertain ownership and conflicting claims, effects of appeal on the rights of the parties, and such other incidents affecting the complaint shall be resolved under the provisions on expropriation of Rule 67 of the Rules of Court."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> (Emphases supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> <b>Indubitably, a matter is substantive when it involves the creation of rights to be enjoyed by the owner of the property to be expropriated. </b>The <u>right of the owner to receive just compensation prior to acquisition of possession by the State of the property is a proprietary right</u>, appropriately classified as a substantive matter and, thus, within the sole province of the legislature to legislate on.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> </p><p> Statutes are generally applied prospectively unless they expressly allow a retroactive application.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> It is well known that the principle that a new law shall not have retroactive effect only governs rights arising from acts done under the rule of the former law. <b>However, if a right be declared for the first time by a subsequent law, it shall take effect from that time even though it has arisen from acts subject to the former laws, provided that it does not prejudice another acquired right of the same origin.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> </p><p> In this case, the government had long entered the subject land and constructed the transmission towers and lines. However, petitioner initiated inverse condemnation proceedings <u>after</u> the effectivity of RA 8974 on November 26, 2000;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> hence, procedurally and substantially, the said law should govern. Notably, the payment of the provisional value of the subject land equivalent to 100% of its <i>current</i> zonal value is declared for the first time by the said law which is evidently more favorable to the landowner than the mere deposit of its assessed value<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> as required by Rule 67. Accordingly, the application of the provisions of RA 8974 to the instant case is beyond cavil. Besides, there is no legal impediment to the issuance of a writ of possession in favor of respondent, as successor of NPC, despite entry to the subject land long before the filing of the inverse condemnation proceedings before the RTC because <b>physical possession gained by entering the property is not equivalent to expropriating it with the aim of acquiring ownership thereon.</b> In <i>Republic v. Hon. Tagle</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> the Court explained: </p><blockquote> <p> <b>The expropriation of real property does not include mere physical entry or occupation of land. </b>Although eminent domain usually involves a taking of title, there may also be compensable taking of only some, not all, of the property interests in the bundle of rights that constitute ownership.</p> <p> x x x [M]ere physical entry and occupation of the property fall short of the taking of title, which includes all the rights that may be exercised by an owner over the subject property. Its actual occupation, which renders academic the need for it to enter, does not by itself include its acquisition of all the rights of ownership. x x x.</p> <p> x x x <b>Ineludibly, [the] writ [of possession] is both necessary and practical, because mere physical possession that is gained by entering the property is not equivalent to expropriating it with the aim of acquiring ownership over, or even the right to possess, the expropriated property.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> (Emphases supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> Section 1 of RA 8974 declares the State's policy to ensure that owners of real property acquired for national government infrastructure projects are <b>promptly</b> paid just compensation. However, the sad truth is that several cases reached this Court wherein various government agencies, including respondent, had constructed transmission lines, tunnels, and other infrastructure before it decided to expropriate the properties upon which they built the same. Still, in other cases, the property owners were compelled to initiate inverse condemnation proceedings due to the government's long inaction to commence expropriation proceedings to acquire their land. As early as the 1960 case of <i>Alfonso v. Pasay City</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> the Court had pronounced its disapproval of such practice and its vigilance in the defense of the rights of the unpaid landowner who has been deprived of possession, thus: </p><blockquote> <p> This Tribunal does not look with favor on the practice of the Government or any of its branches, of taking away property from a private landowner, especially a registered one, without going through the legal process of expropriation or a negotiated sale and paying for said property without delay. The private owner is usually at a great and distinct disadvantage. He has against him the whole Government, central or local, that has occupied and appropriated his property, summarily and arbitrarily, sometimes, if not more often, against his consent. There is no agreement as to its price or its rent. In the meantime, the landowner makes requests for payment, rent, or even some understanding, patiently waiting and hoping that the Government would soon get around to hearing and granting his claim. The officials concerned may promise to consider his claim and come to an agreement as to the amount and time for compensation, but with the not infrequent government delay and red tape, and with the change in administration, specially local, the claim is pigeon holed and forgotten and the papers lost, [or] mislaid x x x. And when finally losing patience and hope, he brings a court action and hires a lawyer to represent him in the vindication of his valid claim, he faces the government represented by no less than the Solicitor General or the Provincial Fiscal or City Attorney, who blandly and with self-assurance, invokes prescription. The litigation sometimes drags on for years. In our opinion, that is neither just nor fair. When a citizen, because of this practice loses faith in the government and its readiness and willingness to pay for what it gets and appropriates, in the future said citizen would not allow the Government to even enter his property unless condemnation proceedings are first initiated, and the value of the property, as provisionally ascertained by the Court, is deposited, subject to his disposal. This would mean delay and difficulty for the Government, but all of its own making.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Notably, in its Answer,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> NPC invoked prescription of petitioner's claim,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> and despite the agreement to settle the case at the price of P400.00/ sq. m., the proposed compromise did not push through in view of the failure of the OSG for a number of years to duly act on the Deed of Sale entered into by the parties,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> prompting petitioner to file the motion for the payment of the provisional value of the subject land. Since the NPC's entry in the subject land on September 21, 1989, or for almost twenty-nine (29) years, the registered owner had been effectively deprived of the beneficial enjoyment of the subject land without having been paid a single centavo.</p><p> The Court reminds the government and its agencies that it is their obligation to immediately initiate eminent domain proceedings whenever they intend to take private property for any public purpose, which includes the payment of the provisional value thereof.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup></p><p> In view of the foregoing, the Court finds that the CA erred in setting aside the RTC Orders which should be, perforce, reinstated. Accordingly, the case should be remanded to the RTC for the determination of just compensation for the subject land, taking into consideration, the relevant standards<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> set forth under RA 8974.</p><p> It must be emphasized that RA 8974 does not take away from the courts the power to judicially determine the amount of just compensation. It merely provides relevant standards in order to facilitate the determination of just compensation, and sets the minimum price of the property as the provisional value<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> to immediately recompense the landowner with the same degree of speed as the taking of the property, which reconciles the inherent unease attending expropriation proceedings with a position of fundamental equity.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> </p><p> Nonetheless, it is settled that where actual taking was made without the benefit of expropriation proceedings, and the owner sought recovery of the possession of the property prior to the filing of expropriation proceedings, the Court has invariably ruled that <u>it is the value of the property at the time of taking that is controlling for purposes of compensation</u>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> Any other interpretation would be repugnant to the Constitution which commands the exproriator to pay the property owner no less than the full and fair equivalent of the property <b><u>from the date of taking</u></b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup></p><p> The reason for the rule, as pointed out in <i>Republic v. Lara</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> is that: </p><blockquote> <p> [W]here property is taken ahead of the filing of the condemnation proceedings, the value thereof may be enchanced by the public purpose for which it is taken; the entry by the plaintiff upon the property may have depreciated its value thereby; or, there may have been a natural increase in the value of the property from the time the complaint is filed, due to general economic conditions. The owner of private property should be compensated only for what he actually loses; it is not intended that his compensation shall extend beyond his loss or injury. And what he loses is only the actual value of his property at the time it is taken. This is the only way that compensation to be paid can be truly just; i.e., "just not only to the individual whose property is taken," "but to the public, which is to pay for it." <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> However, it must be emphasized that in determining just compensation, the courts <u>must consider and apply</u> the parameters set by the law and its implementing rules and regulations in order to ensure that they do not arbitrarily fix an amount as just compensation that is contradictory to the objectives of the law. Be that as it may, when acting within such parameters, courts are not strictly bound to apply the same to its minutest detail, particularly when faced with situations that do not warrant its strict application. <b>Thus, the courts may, in the exercise of their discretion, relax the application of the guidelines subject to the jurisprudential limitation that the factual situation calls for it and the courts clearly explain the reason for such deviation.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> </p><p> Finally, the Court deems it proper to modify the amount of the provisional value from P7,845,000.00 to P7,854,000.00 computed by multiplying the area of 19,635 sq. m. occupied by the transmission lines<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> by the zonal value of the subject land at P400.00/sq. m. Moreover, it must be clarified that the government's initial payment of the land's provisional value does not excuse it from avoiding payment of interest on any difference between the amount of final just compensation adjudged and the initial payment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> (unpaid balance). Legal interest shall be imposed on the unpaid balance at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum from the time of taking,<i> i.e.</i>, from entry in the subject land on September 21, 1989,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> until June 30, 2013; thereafter, or beginning July 1, 2013, until fully paid, the just compensation due petitioner shall earn interest at the rate six percent (6%) per annum.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup></p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.
