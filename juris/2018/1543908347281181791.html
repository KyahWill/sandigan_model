A notarial document is by law entitled to full faith and credit upon its face. Courts, administrative agencies[,] and the public at large must be able to rely upon the acknowledgment executed by a notary public and appended to a private instrument. For this reason, notaries public must observe with the utmost care the basic requirements in the performance of their duties. Otherwise, the confidence of the public in the integrity of this form of conveyance would be undermined."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>The basic requirements a notary public must observe in the performance of his duties are presently laid down in the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice. The failure to observe the requirements and/or comply with the duties prescribed therein shall constitute grounds for the revocation of the notarial commission of, as well as the imposition of the appropriate administrative sanction/s against, the erring notary public.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>In this case, the Court finds that respondent committed the following violations of the Notarial Rules:<br><br><b><i><u>First</u>,</i></b> respondent performed notarial acts without the proper notarial commission therefor.<br><br>Under the Notarial Rules, "a person commissioned as a notary public may perform notarial acts in any place within the territorial jurisdiction of the commissioning court for a period of two (2) years commencing the first day of January of the year in which the commissioning is made. Commission either means the grant of authority to perform notarial [acts] or the written evidence of authority." <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> <b>"<u>Without a commission, a lawyer is unauthorized to perform any of the notarial acts</u>.</b> <u>A lawyer who acts as a notary public without the necessary notarial commission is remiss in his professional duties and responsibilities</u>." <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Moreover, it should be emphasized that "[u]nder the rule, only persons who are commissioned as notary public may perform notarial acts <b>within the territorial jurisdiction of the court which granted the commission."</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>In this case, it was established that respondent notarized a Joint Affidavit<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> in <b>1993</b> and an Application for Business Permit,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> as well as the SPA<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> of Amante, in <b>2010,</b> all in <b>San Pedro, Laguna.</b> However, as per the October 5, 2011 Certification<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> issued by COC Beran-Baraoidan of the RTC-San Pedro, respondent was commissioned as a notary public for and within San Pedro, Laguna only from <b>1998 to 2005,</b> and that the said commission has not been renewed in 2010 and therefore, already expired.<br><br>Furthermore, it was shown that although respondent has been issued a notarial commission by the RTC-Biñan (which was valid from <b>January 1, 2010 until December 31, 2011),</b> he: <i><b>(a)</b></i> conducted business as a notary public during such time not only in his Biñan, Laguna law office (which he shared with a certain Atty.

At the time of notarization, the signatory shall sign or affix with a thumb or mark the notary public's notarial register. The purpose of these requirements is to enable the notary public to verify the genuineness of the signature and to ascertain that the document is the signatory's free act and deed. If the signatory is not acting of his or her own free will, a notary public is mandated to refuse to perform a notarial act."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>In <i>Gaddi v. Velasco,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> the Court ruled that a notary public who notarizes a document despite the missing details anent the signatory's competent evidence of identity not only fails in his duty to ascertain the signatory's identity but also improperly notarizes an incomplete notarial certificate, <i>viz.:</i><br><br><blockquote>In the present case, contrary to [Atty.] Velasco's claim that Gaddi appeared before him and presented two identification cards as proof of her identity, the notarial certificate, in rubber stamp, itself indicates: "SUBSCRIBE AND SWORN TO BEFORE ME THIS <u>APR 22, 2010</u> x x x AT MAKATI CITY. AFFIANT EXHIBITING TO ME HIS/HER C.T.C. NO. ______ ISSUED AT/ON ______." <b>The unfilled spaces clearly establish that Velasco had been remiss in his duty of ascertaining the identity of the signatory to the document.</b> Velasco did not comply with the most basic function that a notary public must do, that is, to require the presence of Gaddi; otherwise, he could have ascertained that the handwritten admission was executed involuntarily and refused to notarize the document. <b>Furthermore, Velasco affixed his signature in an incomplete notarial certificate.</b> x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> (Emphases supplied)</blockquote><br><br>Similar to this case, the <i>jurat </i>of the 2010 Application for Business Permit which respondent notarized did not bear the details of the competent evidence of identity of its principal-signatory. While this application appears to be a ready-made form issued by the Municipality of San Pedro, Laguna, this fact alone cannot justify respondent's non-compliance with his duties under the Notarial Rules.<br><br><b><i><u>And third</u>,</i></b> respondent failed to forward to the Clerk of Court (COC) of the commissioning court a certified copy of each month's entries and a duplicate original copy of any instrument acknowledged before him.<br><br>Under the Notarial Rules, a notary public must forward to the Clerk of Court, within the first ten (10) days of the month following, a certified copy of each month's entries and a duplicate original copy of any instrument acknowledged before the notary public.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> According to case law, failure to comply with this requirement is "[a] ground for revocation of a notary public's commission."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>As per the September 21, 2011 Certification<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> issued by COC Beran-Baraoidan, a copy of the SPA executed by Amante was not submitted before the Office of the COC of the RTC-San Pedro. This omission comes as no surprise considering that, as previously discussed, his notarial commission therefor had already expired.<br><br>Accordingly, in view of respondent's numerous violations of the Notarial Rules, the Court upholds the IBP's recommendation to revoke his incumbent notarial commission, if any, as well as to perpetually disqualify him from being commissioned as a notary public.<br><br>However, the Court cannot affirm the IBP's deletion of the penalty of suspension from the practice of law, which penalty was originally recommended by the IBP-IC. It should be emphasized that respondent's transgressions of the Notarial Rules also have a bearing on his standing as a lawyer. As a member of the Bar, respondent is expected at all times to uphold the integrity and dignity of the legal profession and refrain from any act or omission which might erode the trust and confidence reposed by the public in the integrity of the legal profession.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> By flouting the Notarial Rules on numerous occasions, respondent engaged in unlawful conduct which renders him liable for violation of the following provisions of the CPR:<br><br><blockquote>CANON 1 – A lawyer shall uphold the constitution, obey the laws of the land and promote respect for law and legal processes.<br><br>Rule 1.01 – A lawyer shall not engage in unlawful, dishonest, immoral or deceitful conduct.<br><br>CANON 7 – A lawyer shall at all times uphold the integrity and dignity of the legal profession and support the activities of the integrated bar.</blockquote><br><br>Thus, aside from the above-stated penalties, the Court further suspends respondent from the practice of law for a period of two (2) years, consistent with prevailing jurisprudence on the subject matter.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br><center><b>II.</b></center><br><br>Separately, in his Motion for Reconsideration in the Light of the New Evidence,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> complainant pointed out that, as per the May 7, 2015 Certification<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> issued by the OBC, respondent had previously been suspended by the Court for five (5) months in <i>"Resolution x x x dated December 04, 2000 in G.R.

Ramirez,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> the Court explained that the lifting of a lawyer's suspension is not automatic upon the expiration of the suspension period. The lawyer must still file before the Court the necessary motion to lift suspension and other pertinent documents, which include certifications from. the Office of the Executive Judge of the court where he practices his legal profession and from the IBP's Local Chapter where he is affiliated affirming that he ceased and desisted from the practice of law and has not appeared in court as counsel during the period of his suspension.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> Thereafter, the Court, after evaluation, and upon a favorable recommendation from the OBC, will issue a resolution lifting the order of suspension and thus allow him to resume the practice of law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> Prior thereto, the "suspension stands until he has satisfactorily shown to the Court his compliance therewith."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>Records do not show that respondent complied with the foregoing process. And yet, as complainant averred, respondent has been practicing law, as demonstrated by photos taken of court calendar of cases wherein respondent appeared as counsel for the accused in two (2) criminal cases,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> receipts issued bearing the Alvarez Law Office logo for the payment of acceptance fee,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> and a letter dated June 25, 2014 addressed to the COC &amp; Ex-Oficio Sheriff of the RTC-San Pedro signed by respondent as counsel for a certain Spouses Caridad Capistrano and Renato Bagtas.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>Thus, in view of the foregoing, the Court hereby requires respondent to show cause within ten (10) days from notice why he should not be held in contempt of court and/or further disciplined for allegedly practicing law although his suspension therefor has yet to be lifted.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the Court hereby finds respondent Atty.
