CEB CR-HC No. 01817, which affirmed <em>in toto</em> the Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> dated January 24, 2014 of the Regional Trial Court of Cebu City, Branch 13 (RTC) in Crim. Case No. CBU-96141 finding Leonila and her co-accused, Joseph Pontijos Libre @ "Joyjoy" (Joseph; collectively, the accused), guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating Section 5, Article II of Republic Act No. (RA) 9165,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> otherwise known as the "Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002." <p align="center"> <b>The Facts</b> </p><p> This case stemmed from an Information<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> dated June 8, 2012 filed before the RTC charging the accused with the crime of Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs, defined and penalized under Section 5, Article II of RA 9165, the accusatory portion of which reads: </p><blockquote> <p> That on or about the 6<sup>th</sup> day of June, 2012, at about 12:30 a.m., in the City of Cebu, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, conniving and confederating together and mutually helping x x x each other, with deliberate intent and without being authorized by law, did then and there sell and deliver to a police [poseur­ buyer] one (1) heat-sealed transparent plastic pack containing 24.80 grams of white crystalline substance, which, after laboratory examination, gave positive results to the tests for the presence of Methamphetamine Hydrochloride, a dangerous drug. </p> <p> CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> The prosecution alleged that on June 5, 2012, the Regional Anti-Illegal Drug Special Operations Task Group 7 (RAIDSOTG-7), Cebu City received a report from a confidential informant that Leonila and a cohort, later identified as Joseph, were engaged in selling <em>shabu</em> in Cebu City and neighboring cities and municipalities. Acting upon the report, Police Officer 1 Julius Codilla (PO1 Codilla), together with the confidential informant, proceeded to Colonade Mall at Colon St., Cebu City, where he was introduced to the accused as buyer of <em>shabu</em>. It was agreed that a sale of 25 grams of <em>shabu</em> for P100,000.00 would take place between twelve (12) o'clock that midnight and one (1) o'clock in the morning of the next day at a designated place along Pelaez Extension, Barangay Sta. Cruz, Cebu City.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> </p><p> After the meeting, PO1 Codilla reported the agreement to their office and a buy-bust operation was consequently organized in coordination with the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency, Regional Office VII.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> A Pre-Operation Report<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> was then prepared, and the buy-bust money, consisting of one marked P500.00 bill placed on top of wad papers, was entered in the Police Blotter.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Later in the evening, the buy-bust team went to the target area and positioned themselves at strategic places. PO1 Codilla and the informant waited along the road for the accused's arrival, carrying with them the boodle money. Soon after, the accused arrived, got out from their car, and approached PO1 Codilla. Joseph then took out a medium-sized transparent plastic sachet of suspected <em>shabu</em> from the right pocket of his maong pants and handed the same to PO1 Codilla, who inspected it and gave the marked money to Leonila, who demanded payment. At that point, PO1 Codilla reversed his ball cap – the pre-arranged signal – which prompted the other members of the buy-bust team to rush towards the scene, informed the accused of their constitutional rights, and arrested them. The team recovered the marked money from Leonila and likewise seized the accused's vehicle, ignition key, and cellphones.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> </p><p> PO1 Codilla marked the confiscated plastic sachet with "JPL/LPL-BB 06/06/12" and conducted an actual physical inventory at the crime scene.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> The inventory was witnessed by representatives from the media and a councilor of Barangay Sta. Cruz.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Photographs of the seized items, the accused, and the witnesses signing the inventory were taken.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Subsequently, the accused were brought to the RAIDSOTG-7 and eventually detained at Station 3, Cebu City Police Office holding cell;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> while the marked sachet was submitted to the Philippine National Police (PNP), Regional Crime Laboratory Office 7 for examination,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> and later tested positive for the presence of methamphetamine hydrochloride.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></p><p> Upon arraignment, the accused pleaded not guilty and denied the charges leveled against them. They claimed that at about six (6) o'clock in the evening of June 5, 2012, they were at the second floor of Chowking, Colonade Mall, Colon St., Cebu City waiting for their order, when three (3) persons approached them and invited them to go outside. They were then made to board a vehicle, blindfolded, and brought to the RAIDSOTG-7 where they were investigated separately. Later, they were brought to the reclamation area in Mandaue City. All the while, the police officers kept asking them about the identity of their supposed employer and even threatened to kill them if they would not cooperate. They were eventually brought back to the RAIDSOTG-7, made to sign a document against their will, and were consequently charged. They asserted that they have nothing against those who testified against them, noting that they were not the same police officers who brought them for investigation and planted evidence against them. Further, they admitted that media representatives were present and took photographs of them, their phones, their vehicle, and the pack of white crystalline substance.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></p><p align="center"> <b>The RTC Ruling</b> </p><p> In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> dated January 24, 2014, the RTC found the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating Section 5, in relation to Section 26, Article II of RA 9165, and accordingly, sentenced each of them to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and to pay a fine in the amount of P500,000.00 each.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></p><p> The RTC found that the prosecution had successfully established all the elements of the crime of Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs. Further, it pointed out that the presumption of regularity in the performance of official function must prevail over the mere denials of the accused, more so considering that they did not assail the genuineness of the chain of custody form nor of the inventory, as well as the accuracy of the photographs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> </p><p> Aggrieved, the accused appealed<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> to the CA. </p><p align="center"> <b>The CA Ruling</b> </p><p> In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> dated August 28, 2015, the CA affirmed the accused's conviction <em>in toto</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> finding that all the elements constituting the crime of Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs were present.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Moreover, it observed that the integrity and identity of the seized <em>shabu</em> were preserved and the chain of custody thereof was unbroken.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> </p><p> Unperturbed, the accused moved for reconsideration,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> which was, however, denied in a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> dated February 2, 2017; hence, this appeal filed by one of the accused,<em> i.e.</em>, Leonila. </p><p align="center"> <b>The Issue Before the Court</b> </p><p> The issue for the Court's resolution is whether or not the conviction of the accused for violation of Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 should be upheld.</p><p align="center"> <b>The Court's Ruling</b> </p><p> The appeal is meritorious.</p><p> At the outset, it must be stressed that an appeal in criminal cases opens the entire case for review, and thus, it is the duty of the reviewing tribunal to correct, cite, and appreciate errors in the appealed judgment whether they are assigned or unassigned.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> "The appeal confers the appellate court full jurisdiction over the case and renders such court competent to examine records, revise the judgment appealed from, increase the penalty, and cite the proper provision of the penal law."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> </p><p> In this case, the accused were charged with the crime of Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs, defined and penalized under Section 5,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Article II of RA 9165. In order to properly secure the conviction of an accused charged with Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs, jurisprudence requires that the prosecution must prove the following: (<em>a</em>) the identity of the buyer and the seller, the object, and the consideration; and (<em>b</em>) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Of these elements, proof that the transaction actually took place, coupled with the presentation before the court of the dangerous drugs, the <em>corpus delicti</em> of the crime, are crucial.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Consequently, the prosecution must show an unbroken chain of custody over the same by accounting for each link in the chain of custody from the moment of seizure up to its presentation in court as evidence of the <em>corpus delicti</em>, in order to prove its identity beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> </p><p> Considering the importance of ensuring that the dangerous drugs seized from an accused is the same as that presented in court, Section 21, Article II of RA 9165, prior to its amendment by RA 10640,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> and Section 21 (a), Article II of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA 9165 provide the procedures that the apprehending team should observe in the handling of the seized illegal drugs in order to preserve their identity and integrity as evidence. As part of the procedure, the apprehending team shall, <b>immediately after seizure and confiscation, conduct a physical inventory and photograph the seized items in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom the items were seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official</b> who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy of the same, and, within twenty-four (24) hours from confiscation, the seized drugs must be turned over to the PNP Crime Laboratory for examination.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> According to jurisprudence, the law requires the presence of an elected public official, as well as representatives from the DOJ and the media in order to remove any suspicion of tampering, switching, planting or contamination of evidence which could considerably affect a case, and thus, ensure that the chain of custody rule is observed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Since the police actions relative to the handling of the drugs seized in this case were committed in 2012, and thus prior to RA 9165 's amendment by RA 10640, the presence of all three witnesses during the conduct of inventory and photography is required. </p><p> It is important to state, however, that while the "chain of custody" rule demands strict compliance from the police officers, the saving clause under Section 21, Article II of the IRR of RA 9165 – which is now crystallized into statutory law with the passage of RA 10640 – provides that non-compliance with the requirements of Section 21, Article II of RA 9165 <b>under justifiable grounds</b> – will not irretrievably prejudice the prosecution's case and render void and invalid the seizure and custody over the seized items so long as the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer or team.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> </p><p> In other words, the failure of the apprehending team to strictly comply with the procedure laid down in Section 21, Article II of RA 9165 and its IRR does not <em>ipso facto</em> render the seizure and custody over the item/s as void and invalid, provided that the prosecution satisfactorily proves that: (a) there is justifiable ground for such non-compliance; and (b) the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized item/s are properly preserved.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> In <i>People v. Almorfe</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> the Court explained that for the saving clause to apply, <b><u>the prosecution must explain the reasons behind the procedural lapses, and that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized evidence had nonetheless been preserved</u></b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Additionally, <i>People v. De Guzman</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> emphasized that <b><u>the justifiable ground for non-compliance must be proven as a fact, because the Court cannot presume what these grounds are or that they even exist</u></b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Finally, in explaining the procedural lapse/s, <i>People v. Umipang</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> stressed that <u>the prosecution must establish the fact that genuine and <b>earnest efforts were employed in contacting and securing the presence of the representatives</b> enumerated under Section 21 (1), Article II of RA 9165, or that there was a justifiable ground for failing to do so</u>, so as to convince the Court that the failure to comply was reasonable under the given circumstances.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> </p><p> Applying the above principles, the Court finds that the police officers in this case committed unexplained and unjustified deviations from the prescribed chain of custody rule, thereby putting into question the integrity and evidentiary value of the item purportedly seized from the accused.</p><p> While the prosecution was able to show that the seized item was inventoried and photographed by the police officers in the presence of the accused, representatives from the media, and <em>barangay</em> councilor Quintana, records fail to disclose that said inventory and photography were conducted in the presence of a representative from the DOJ as required by law. </p><p> Notably, the absence of a DOJ representative during the inventory and photography of the seized drugs is not per se fatal to the prosecution's cause. However, as earlier intimated, it is incumbent upon the prosecution to demonstrate that genuine and earnest efforts were employed in securing the presence of the DOJ representative or that there exists a justifiable reason for non-compliance. Here, the police officers, in their affidavits, merely stated that "<i>the team exerted efforts to contact any representative from the Department of Justice but to no avail</i>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Far from satisfying the legal requirement, this statement partakes of a mere general conclusion that is bereft of any discernible detail regarding the steps and efforts the police officers had undertaken to secure the presence of the DOJ representative. As the Court held in <em>People v. Umipang</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> "[a] sheer statement that representatives were unavailable – without so much as an explanation on whether serious attempts were employed to look for other representatives, given the circumstances – is to be regarded as a flimsy excuse"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> – as in this case – and hence, not a valid excuse for non-compliance.</p><p> At this juncture, it must be emphasized that the procedure in Section 21, Article II of RA 9165 is a matter of substantive law, and cannot be brushed aside as a simple procedural technicality.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Accordingly, in light of the unjustified breach of procedure as explained above, the Court is impelled to conclude that the integrity and evidentiary value of the <em>corpus delicti</em> had been compromised.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> As such, the acquittal of the accused-appellant, Leonila, is in order. </p><p> In addition, Leonila's co-accused in this case, Joseph, must also be acquitted in view of Section 11 (a), Rule 122 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure, as amended, which states: </p><blockquote> <p> Section. 11. <i>Effect of appeal by any of several accused</i>. -</p> <blockquote> <p> (a) An appeal taken by one or more of several accused shall not affect those who did not appeal, <u>except insofar as the judgment of the appellate court is favorable and applicable to the latter.</u></p> <p> x x x x (Underscoring supplied)</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> While it is true that it was only Leonila who successfully perfected her appeal, the rule is that an appeal in a criminal proceeding throws the entire case out in the open, including those not raised by the parties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Considering that, under Section 11 (a), Rule 122 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure as above-quoted, a favorable judgment – as in this case – shall benefit the co-accused who did not appeal or those who appealed from their judgments of conviction but for one reason or another, the conviction became final and executory,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Leonila's acquittal for the crime charged is likewise applicable to Joseph.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> </p><p> As a final note, the Court finds it fitting to echo its recurring pronouncement in recent jurisprudence on the subject matter: </p><blockquote> <p> The Court strongly supports the campaign of the government against drug addiction and commends the efforts of our law enforcement officers against those who would inflict this malediction upon our people, especially the susceptible youth. But as demanding as this campaign may be, it cannot be more so than the compulsions of the Bill of Rights for the protection of liberty of every individual in the realm, including the basest of criminals. The Constitution covers with the mantle of its protection the innocent and the guilty alike against any manner of high-handedness from the authorities, however praiseworthy their intentions. </p> <p> Those who are supposed to enforce the law are not justified in disregarding the right of the individual in the name of order. Order is too high a price for the loss of liberty. x x x.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> "In this light, prosecutors are strongly reminded that they have the positive duty to prove compliance with the procedure set forth in Section 21[,Article II] of RA 9165, as amended. As such, they must have the initiative to not only acknowledge but also justify any perceived deviations from the prescribed procedure during the proceedings before the trial court. Since compliance with this procedure is determinative of the integrity and evidentiary value of the <em>corpus delicti</em> and ultimately, the fate of the liberty of the accused, the fact that any issue regarding the same was not raised, or even threshed out in the court/s below, would not preclude the appellate court, including this Court, from fully examining the records of the case if only to ascertain whether the procedure had been completely complied with, and if not, whether justifiable reasons exist to excuse any deviation. If no such reasons exist, then it is the appellate court's bounden duty to acquit the accused, and perforce, overturn a conviction."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> </p><p> <strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the appeal is <strong>GRANTED</strong>.
