				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Assailed in this ordinary appeal<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> is the Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated October 9, 2015 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 06576, which affirmed the Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated November 25, 2013 of the Regional Trial Court of Bambang, Nueva Vizcaya, Branch 37 (RTC) in Crim. Case No. 3156 finding accused-appellants Brandon Dela Cruz (Dela Cruz) and James Francis Bautista (Bautista; collectively, accused-appellants) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs, defined and penalized under Section 5, Article II of Republic Act No. (RA) 9165,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> otherwise known as the "Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002."<br><br><center><b>The Facts</b><br></center><br>This case stemmed from an Information<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> filed before the RTC charging accused-appellants of the crime of Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs. The prosecution alleged that at around five (5) o'clock in the afternoon of August 1, 2012, members of the Bambang Police Station successfully implemented a buy-bust operation against accused-appellants, during which 0.029 gram of white crystalline substance was recovered from them. The police officers then took accused-appellants and the seized item to the police station where the marking, inventory, and photography were done in the presence of Municipal Councilor Gregorio B. Alias, Jr. (Allas) and Conrad Gaffuy (Gaffuy), an employee of the Department of Justice (DOJ). The seized item was then brought to the crime laboratory where, after examination, the contents thereof tested positive for methamphetamine hydrochloride or <i>shabu</i>, a dangerous drug.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>In defense, accused-appellants denied the accusation against them and instead averred that at the time of the alleged incident, Dela Cruz was drinking with his friends in a hut inside their compound while Bautista was repairing Dela Cruzs motorcycle when, suddenly, armed men in civilian clothes alighted from two (2) cars parked at their gate and pointed guns at them. They claimed that these men searched their house and arrested them, and when asked by Bautista's mother-in-law<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> about the charges against them, one of the armed men brought out a small plastic sachet from his belt bag and answered that accused-appellants were selling drugs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> dated November 25, 2013, the RTC found accused­-appellants guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime charged, and accordingly, sentenced them to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and to pay a fine of P500,000.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> The RTC held that the prosecution was able to establish all the elements of the crime charged, as accused-appellants sold a sachet containing 0.029 gram of <i>shabu</i> to IO1 Nelmar Benazir C. Bugalon, which was later on presented to the court for identification. Moreover, the RTC ruled that there was substantial compliance with the chain of custody rule as it was shown, <i>inter alia</i>, that the conduct of the marking and photography were done at the police station and witnessed by an elected official and a representative of the DOJ in the presence of the accused­appellants.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Aggrieved, accused-appellants appealed to the CA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> dated October 9, 2015, the CA affirmed in toto the RTC ruling.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> It held that the prosecution had established beyond reasonable doubt all the elements of the crime charged. The CA ruled that the absence of a media representative in the inventory, marking, and photography of the seized item did not affect the integrity of the <i>corpus delicti</i>, as a DOJ representative and an elected municipal councilor were present to witness the same.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Hence, this appeal seeking that accused-appellants' conviction be overturned.<br><br><center><b>The Issue Before the Court</b><br></center><br>The issue for the Court's resolution is whether or not the CA correctly upheld accused-appellants' conviction for the crime charged.<br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b><br></center><br>The appeal is meritorious.<br><br>In cases for Illegal Sale and/or Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs under RA 9165,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> it is essential that the identity of the dangerous drug be established with moral certainty, considering that the dangerous drug itself forms an integral part of the <i>corpus delicti</i> of the crime.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Failing to prove the integrity of the <i>corpus delicti</i> renders the evidence for the State insufficient to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt and, hence, warrants an acquittal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>To establish the identity of the dangerous drug with moral certainty, the prosecution must be able to account for each link of the chain of custody from the moment the drugs are seized up to their presentation in court as evidence of the crime.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> As part of the chain of custody procedure, the law requires, <i>inter alia</i>, that the marking, physical inventory, and photography of the seized items be conducted immediately after seizure and confiscation of the same. In this regard, case law recognizes that "marking upon immediate confiscation contemplates even marking at the nearest police station or office of the apprehending team."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Hence, the failure to immediately mark the confiscated items at the place of arrest neither renders them inadmissible in evidence nor impairs the integrity of the seized drugs, as the conduct of marking at the nearest police station or office of the apprehending team is sufficient compliance with the rules on chain of custody.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>The law further requires that the said inventory and photography be done in the presence of the accused or the person from whom the items were seized, or his representative or counsel, as well as certain required witnesses, namely: (<i>a</i>) if <b>prior</b> to the amendment of RA 9165 by RA 10640,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> a representative from the media <u><i>AND</i></u> the DOJ, and any elected public official;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> or (<i>b</i>) if <b>after</b> the amendment of RA 9165 by RA 10640, an elected public official and a representative of the National Prosecution Service <u><i>OR</i></u> the media.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> The law requires the presence of these witnesses primarily "to ensure the establishment of the chain of custody and remove any suspicion of switching, planting, or contamination of evidence."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>As a general rule, compliance with the chain of custody procedure is strictly enjoined as the same has been regarded "not merely as a procedural technicality but as a matter of substantive law."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> This is because "[t]he law has been crafted by Congress as safety precautions to address potential police abuses, especially considering that the penalty imposed may be life imprisonment."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Nonetheless, the Court has recognized that due to varying field conditions, strict compliance with the chain of custody procedure may not always be possible.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> As such, the failure of the apprehending team to strictly comply with the same would not <i>ipso facto</i> render the seizure and custody over the items as void and invalid, provided that the prosecution satisfactorily proves that: (a) there is a justifiable ground for non­compliance; and (b) the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> The foregoing is based on the saving clause found in Section 21 (a),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Article II of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA 9165, which was later adopted into the text of RA 10640.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> It should, however, be emphasized that for the saving clause to apply, the prosecution must duly explain the reasons behind the procedural lapses,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> and that the justifiable ground for non-compliance must be proven as a fact, because the Court cannot presume what these grounds are or that they even exist.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Anent the witness requirement, non-compliance may be permitted if the prosecution proves that the apprehending officers exerted genuine and sufficient efforts to secure the presence of such witnesses, albeit they eventually failed to appear. While the earnestness of these efforts must be examined on a case-to-case basis, the overarching objective is for the Court to be convinced that the failure to comply was reasonable under the given circumstances.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Thus, mere statements of unavailability, absent actual serious attempts to contact the required witnesses, are unacceptable as justified grounds for non-compliance.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> These considerations arise from the fact that police officers are ordinarily given sufficient time - beginning from the moment they have received the information about the activities of the accused until the time of his arrest - to prepare for a buy-bust operation and consequently, make the necessary arrangements beforehand, knowing fully well that they would have to strictly comply with the chain of custody rule.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Notably, the Court, in <i>People v. Miranda</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> issued a definitive reminder to prosecutors when dealing with drugs cases. It implored that "[since] the [procedural] requirements are clearly set forth in the law, the State retains the positive duty to account for any lapses in the chain of custody of the drugs/items seized from the accused, regardless of whether or not the defense raises the same in the proceedings <i>a quo</i>; otherwise, it risks the possibility of having a conviction overturned on grounds that go into the evidence's integrity and evidentiary value, albeit the same are raised only for the first time on appeal, or even not raised, become apparent upon further review."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>After an examination of the records, the Court finds that the prosecution failed to comply with the above-described procedure since the inventory and photography of the seized item were not conducted in the presence of a media representative. As evinced by the Inventory of Seized Properties/Items,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> only Allas (an elected public official) and Gaffuy (a representative from the DOJ) were present to witness these activities. Although the prosecution in its Pre-Trial Brief<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> averred that "[n]o media representatives were present despite efforts x x x to secure their presence,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> nothing else on record appears to substantiate the same. Indeed, this general averment, without more, cannot be accepted as a proper justification to excuse non-compliance with the law. As earlier discussed, prevailing jurisprudence requires the prosecution to account for the absence of any of the required witnesses by presenting a justifiable reason therefor or, at the very least, by showing that genuine and sufficient efforts were exerted by the apprehending officers to secure their presence. Clearly, these standards were not observed in this case.<br><br>Thus, in view of this unjustified deviation from the chain of custody rule, the Court is constrained to conclude that the integrity and evidentiary value of the item purportedly seized from accused-appellants were compromised, which consequently warrants their acquittal.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appeal is <b>GRANTED</b>. The Decision dated October 9, 2015 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 06576 is hereby <b>REVERSED</b> and <b>SET ASIDE</b>. Accordingly, accused-appellants Brandon Dela Cruz and James Francis Bautista are <b>ACQUITTED</b> of the crime charged. The Director of the Bureau of Corrections is ordered to cause their immediate release, unless they are being lawfully held in custody for any other reason.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Carpio, Senior Associate Justice, (Chairperson), Caguioa, A.
