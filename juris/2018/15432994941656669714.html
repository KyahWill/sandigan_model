No pronouncement as to cost. </p> <p>x x x x </p> <p>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> The RTC ratiocinated that: </p><blockquote> <p> [T]he injuries sustained by the victim are too plainly shown by the Autopsy Report to be open to doubt. The principal question that projects itself for resolution is simply whether or not the injuries were inflicted by the [accused] under the circumstances threshed out by the prosecution witnesses so as to render them amenable to the liability for the charge leveled against him.</p> <p> The instant Information provides that the accused with intent to kill willfully, unlawfully and feloniously push to the wall of the house the cradle of the six (6) month old victim causing the latter traumatic injuries on the head and trunk that caused his death.</p> <p> The findings contained in Medico-Legal Report No. A-164-09 sufficiently prove [d] the criminal responsibility of the accused considering the calculative injuries sustained were obviously expected to end the life of the victim especially so when [his] age is taken into account. The defense [of accident] posed by the accused x x x finds no support in the light of the overwhelming evidence presented by the prosecution. In a way the accused admitted responsibility. He was the only adult companion of the victim at the time of the incident such that it is therefore not difficult to conclude that he was the only one who could have inflicted the injuries sustained that resulted to the victim's death.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> <b><i>Ruling of the Court of Appeals</i></b></p><p> On appeal, appellant argued that the trial court erred in finding that his guilt had been proven beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> He claimed that the narration of Medina in her Sworn Statement<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> that their neighbors, Andrea Barona and Angelyn Tulbo, heard Junel's cries, appellant's shouts, and the pounding on the wall, and that they saw how Junel's cradle twice hit the wall while he was being carelessly rocked, should not be given probative weight for being hearsay.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Appellant also argued that the neighbors who had initially executed Sworn Statements<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> were not even presented during trial.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> He further claimed that the trial court erred in finding him guilty based only on the medico-legal report.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></p><p> On the other hand, the People, through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), maintained that the guilt of appellant for the crime of parricide was proven beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> According to the OSG, the totality of the following circumstantial evidence warranted a conviction: (1) Medina left Junel well and healthy with appellant; (2) appellant was the only adult companion of Junel at the time; (3) Junel suffered injuries in the mouth, cigarette burns on the upper lip and chest, and hematomas on the chest; (4) appellant merely reasoned that what happened was an accident; (5) the autopsy report revealed injuries - contusion and abrasions - which could have been sustained before the victim died; and (6) the testimony of the medico-legal officer indicated that considering the nature of the injuries, it could not be possible that Junel had merely fallen off his cradle.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></p><p> The appellate court affirmed the ruling of the RTC, with modification as to the amounts of damages, to wit: </p><blockquote> <p> WHEREFORE, the appeal is DENIED. The assailed disposition is MODIFIED increasing the award of civil indemnity from Fifty Thousand Pesos (PhP50,000.00) to One Hundred Thousand Pesos (PhP100,000.00) and moral damages from Fifty Thousand Pesos (PhP50,000.00) to One Hundred Thousand Pesos (PhP 100,000.00); awarding exemplary damages in the amount of One Hundred Thousand Pesos (PhP 100,000.00); with legal interest of six percent (6%) per annum on all monetary awards from the finality of this judgment until fully paid. Costs against Accused-Appellant.</p> <p> SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Hence, this appeal.</p><p align="center"> <b>Our Ruling</b> </p><p> The appeal lacks merit. </p><p> Parricide is committed when: (1) a person is killed; (2) the deceased is killed by the accused; (3) the deceased is the father, mother, or child, whether legitimate or illegitimate, or a legitimate other ascendant or other descendant, or the legitimate spouse of accused.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> In the instant case, all the elements of the crime were clearly and sufficiently proved beyond reasonable doubt by the prosecution.</p><p> It is settled that "[d]irect evidence of the actual killing is not indispensable for convicting an accused when circumstantial evidence can sufficiently establish his guilt."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Circumstantial evidence can be the basis for conviction if there is more than one circumstance, the facts from which the inferences are derived have been proven, and the combination thereof produces a conviction beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></p><p> In the instant case, the circumstances already identified and enumerated by the appellate court bear restating. <em>First</em>, appellant was the only adult present at the time of the incident. <em>Second</em>, Junel suffered several hematomas and cigarette burns on different parts of his body which were inconsistent with the alleged accidental falling off the cradle. <em>Third</em>, the medico-legal report revealed that Junel had sustained injuries which could not have been caused by mere falling off the cradle. </p><p> The extent of the injuries sustained by Junel and the impossibility that these had been sustained by mere falling off the cradle were sufficiently explained by Dr. Porciuncula as follows: </p><blockquote> <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="4%"><div align="justify">Q</div></td> <td width="96%"><div align="justify">And what does this sketch of the human head refer to, what injuries, Mr. Witness?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A</div></td> <td><div align="justify">On the anterior portion of the head there is contusion on the oral region, upper and lower lips and on the buccal region, there is abrasion, sir.

Moreover, it must be stressed that only moral certainty, and not absolute certainty, is required for a conviction. Here, based on the attendant circumstances, we are morally convinced that appellant's guilt for the crime of parricide has been proved beyond reasonable doubt.</p> <p> Under Article 246 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act (RA) No. 7659, the penalty for parricide is <em>reclusion perpetua</em> to death. Under the prevailing circumstances, the proper imposable penalty is <em>reclusion perpetua</em> there being no modifying circumstances alleged or proved. Hence, both the RTC and the CA correctly imposed upon appellant the penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua</em>. Pursuant to Section 3 of RA No. 9346, appellant is not eligible for parole. As regards the damages awarded, prevailing jurisprudence<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> instructs that, for the crime of parricide punishable by<em> reclusion perpetua</em>, the amounts of damages should be as follows: P75,000.00 as civil indemnity; P75,000.00 as moral damages; and P75,000.00 as exemplary damages. In addition, temperate damages in lieu of actual damages in the amount of P50,000.00 is awarded. Finally, all monetary awards shall earn interest at the rate of 6%<em> per annum</em> from the finality of this Decision until full payment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> </p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the appeal is hereby <b>DISMISSED</b>.
