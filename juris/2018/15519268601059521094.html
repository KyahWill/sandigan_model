The question must involve the examination of probative value of the evidence presented.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> (Citation omitted)</blockquote><br><br>To resolve the issue on the taxability of the transaction between respondent and PeopleSupport, this Court is required to interpret Task Order #2 to the Agreement. Petitioner asserts that the Agreement between respondent and PeopleSupport merely involved a lease of information technology infrastructure, which is not covered by PeopleSupport's PEZA registration. This issue is a question of law. It does not require us to examine the probative value of the evidence presented. The Petition essentially requires this Court to determine the scope of the Agreement and the scope of activities covered by the fiscal incentives granted to PeopleSupport.<br><br><center><b>II (A)</b></center><br><br>Under Section 23 of Republic Act No. 7916, or the Special Economic Zone Act of 1995, as amended, business enterprises operating within economic zones are entitled to fiscal incentives.

It reads:<br><br><blockquote>Art. 39. <i>Incentives to Registered Enterprises.</i> — <b>All registered enterprises shall be granted the following incentives to the extent engaged in a preferred area of investment;</b><br><br>(a) <i>Income Tax Holiday.</i> —<br><br>(1) For six (6) years from commercial operation for pioneer firms and four (4) years for non-pioneer firms, new registered firms shall be fully exempt from income taxes levied by the National Government.

(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><br>However, Rule XIII, Section 5 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of Republic Act No. 7916 specifies that PEZA-granted incentives shall apply only to registered operations of the Ecozone Enterprise and only during its registration with PEZA. In other words, tax incentives to which an Ecozone Enterprise is entitled do not necessarily include all kinds of income received during the period of entitlement. Only income actually gained or received by the Ecozone Enterprise related to the conduct of its registered business activity are covered by fiscal incentives.<br><br>Executive Order No. 226 also provides that the incentives shall only be "to the extent engaged in a preferred area of investment."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> The purpose of the income tax holiday was explained, thus:<br><br><blockquote>An income tax holiday is bestowed on a new project to encourage investors to set up businesses and to contribute to the country's economic growth. The fiscal incentive is also meant to help registered enterprises recoup their substantial initial investments by giving them a reprieve from paying income tax for a few years. <i>However, like any privilege, the income tax holiday comes with conditions and requirements which must be fulfilled for its continued enjoyment.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>Revenue Regulations No. 20-2002<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> of the Bureau of Internal Revenue clarifies the tax treatment of income earned from unregistered activities by enterprises under the Bases Conversion and Development Act of 1992 and the Philippine Economic Zone Act of 1995.

In my mind, respondent has the burden of proving by preponderant evidence that [PeopleSupport] is registered with PEZA as a facility-provider and that [PeopleSupport]'s income from the lease of its physical plant space, infrastructure[,] and other transmission facilities to respondent is entitled to the ITH incentive.<br><br>Considering that respondent failed to establish that [PeopleSupport] is registered with PEZA as a facility-provider and that [PeopleSupport]'s income from the lease of physical plant space, infrastructure[,] and other transmission facilities to respondent is entitled to ITH incentive, it is my humble view that the income received by PPI from respondent is subject to regular corporate income tax imposed under Section 27(A) of the 1997 [National Internal Revenue Code], as amended.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup></blockquote><br><br>Tax incentives partake of the nature of tax exemptions.
