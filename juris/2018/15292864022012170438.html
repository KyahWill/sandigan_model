Monter (<em>Monter</em>), and Constante M. Castil (<em>Castil</em>), from the September 27, 2016 Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Court of Appeals-Cebu City (<em>CA</em>) in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 01906. The CA affirmed with modification the April 30, 2014 Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court of Maasin City, Southern Leyte, Branch 25 (<em>RTC</em>), in Crim. Case No. 11-03-3508 finding appellants guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape. <p align="center"> <b><u>The Antecedents</u></b> </p><p> The accusatory portion of the Information<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> against appellants states: </p><blockquote> <p> That on October 2, 2010, at about 2:00 o'clock dawn, in [deleted], province of Southern Leyte, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, conspiring, confederating and mutually helping each other, with lustful intent and lewd designs, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously, by means of force, threats and intimidation, successfully have sexual intercourse with the victim [AAA], without her consent and against her will, to the damage and prejudice of the said victim and of social order.</p> <p> CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> After the arraignment where the appellants pleaded not guilty,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> trial commenced. The prosecution presented four (4) witnesses: the offended party AAA, Maria Aina Daclan, records officer of the town's Rural Health Office, FFF, AAA's sister-in-law,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> and Liberty Pinamungahan (Liberty), a female companion who lived in the same household. On the other hand, the defense presented appellant minor XXX as its sole witness.</p><p align="center"> <b><u>Version of the Prosecution</u></b> </p><p> AAA lives with the family of her brother BBB<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> and known to be suffering from mental deficiency and exhibits childish behaviour.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> </p><p> Offended party AAA testified that on October 1, 2010, her brother BBB, whom she was living with, hosted a party for his grandchild, with appellants among the visitors. During the party, appellants invited her to go to the seashore and to the karaoke bar owned by a certain Amorin. AAA agreed and left the house with the appellants at around 2 o'clock in the morning when all the other occupants of the house were already asleep. They brought with them a watering can full of <em>tuba</em> from BBB, with AAA bringing the glasses they can use for drinking. </p><p> Because the karaoke bar was already closed, appellants and AAA went to the seashore, sat in the sand and drank the <em>tuba</em>. After drinking two (2) glasses of <em>tuba</em>, AAA felt shortness of breath. AAA also noticed that the appellants huddled together "as if they were agreeing to do something." Sometime during the night, AAA felt like urinating, and she did so in front of the appellants after asking them to turn their backs. After urinating, Castil took off her pants and underwear, which she asked to be placed beside her. She asked him what he was doing but the latter told her to keep silent. She did not complain as she felt very sleepy. Castil placed himself on top of her and the next thing she knew, Castil's penis was already in her vagina. After Castil raped her, she remembered XXX followed next, followed by Monter, and then Gilles. When Monter did the same act, she was already awake, but did not resist and told them she wanted to go home. Castil and XXX apparently raped her again, and while this was happening, she heard some people looking for her. Gilles and Monter ran away while Castil and XXX continued raping her even when the people looking for her — who turned out to be Jovita Escobal, Liberty, and a certain Antonio - were approximately 50 meters away. Castil and XXX ran away when they saw Escobal, Liberty, and Antonio near. AAA then stood up and put on her clothes. AAA and Liberty waited by the seashore for Escobal's husband who then fetched their motorcycle. </p><p> When they arrived home, AAA did not talk to anybody at their house and instead immediately went inside and slept. She slept the whole day and did not go outside her room until two (2) days later on October 3, 2010. She did not tell anybody about the incident. Her sister-in-law FFF learned of the rape incident when Elizabeth Gilles told FFF that Gilles was one of those who raped AAA. AAA was first brought to Medicare Hospital and then at the Rural Health unit where she was examined by Dr. Teodorico Esclamado, Jr. (<i>Dr. Esclamado</i>).</p><p> While appellants were in jail, AAA spoke with Castil, who asked for forgiveness and offered to marry her, which she rejected. She also spoke with Gilles' mother, Monter's sister, and Castil's mother, who all asked for forgiveness and offered to pay her.</p><p> On cross-examination, AAA admitted she voluntarily went with appellants when they invited her to go to the karaoke bar and eventually to the seashore. She admitted to providing them with the <em>tuba</em>. She explained the inconsistencies between her sworn statement, where she claimed being dragged to the seashore, as against her testimony, by stating that she told appellants she did not want to go with them to a further distance. </p><p> Prosecution's second witness, Maria Aina Daclan, presented the certified true copy of the Medical Report for the Alleged Sexual Abuse issued by Dr. Esclamado. The latter already retired sometime in 2011.</p><p> FFF, meanwhile, testified that from the time she married AAA's brother, she already noticed AAA's mental deficiency and childish behavior. She came to know about the incident when Gilles' mother told her that the former's son was the one who raped AAA. Thereafter, FFF and her husband went to the police station to have the incident entered in the police blotter. They then brought AAA to the Rural Health Unit.</p><p> The prosecution's last witness, Liberty, testified that she lived with FFF and her husband as the spouses sent her to school as she helped in their vegetable sales business. On October 1, 2010, AAA was drunk during the birthday party. On October 2, 2010, the witness was awoken at around 3 o'clock in the morning to go to the market. Tonio, one of the workers, reported that he saw AAA with some men. FFF asked her and Tonio to look for AAA. They were sent to the seashore upon information from Jovita Escobal. All three went to the seashore where they saw a man who told them AAA was along the seashore. The man and Tonio went to the seashore while Liberty stayed with the bicycle. When Liberty followed, she saw Monter, who walked past her towards his house, and XXX walking in the opposite direction. She saw AAA, sitting on the sand with Tonio and another man and that AAA had no short pants and her underwear was down to her legs. Liberty asked AAA to go home with them, but AAA insisted she would go home on her own, so they forced AAA to come with them.</p><p> <b><u>Version of the Defense</u></b> </p><p> XXX presented his birth certificate showing that he was born on December 3, 1994. He testified that on October 1, 2010, he went to the billiard hall where he met Castil, Montes, and Gilles. There, they were invited by BBB to his house to attend his grandson's party. The appellants stayed at the party and drank <em>tuba</em> until 11:30 in the evening. They eventually transferred to a bench outside the billiard hall. He laid down the bench and AAA appeared in front of him and squeezed his thigh and touched his penis. He rolled over towards his friends to avoid her but she called them gay. They saw Tonio riding a bicycle and they called for him to take AAA away as she was being bothersome. AAA refused but was eventually prevailed upon them. Appellants continued drinking until Castil suggested they transfer to the seashore, where they continued their drinking spree. AAA rejoined them and later removed her pajamas and urinated in front of them. Castil ignored her because she was already drunk as he saw her drinking at the birthday party. </p><p> Sometime later, XXX left the group and went 20 meters away to urinate. While he was urinating, AAA embraced and squeezed him from behind. He pleaded for AAA to stop, but the latter called him gay, forced him to lie down on the sand, and placed herself on top of him. XXX tried to free himself but AAA instead held his penis and inserted it into her vagina, and made pressing motions of her body against his. When AAA stood up, XXX was able to get away and he went back to his friends. He did not tell his friends about what happened but told them to go as AAA was being bothersome. He and his friends went home and did not know what happened to AAA after they parted ways.</p><p> <i>The RTC Ruling</i></p><p> In its decision, the RTC ruled in favor of the prosecution. The RTC noted that AAA's unrefuted testimony that all the appellants raped her, started by Castil who removed her pants and panty, placed himself on top of her and placed his penis inside her vagina, followed by XXX, Monter, and Gilles who did the same, already established the essential element of sexual congress. To the RTC, XXX's testimony corroborated the fact that there was sexual congress between him and AAA. In contrast to AAA's testimony, described as candid and unwavering, XXX's version appeared contrived and ineffectual.</p><p> The RTC further emphasized that Castil's act of asking for forgiveness and even offering marriage, and the relatives of the other appellants asking for forgiveness and wanting an out of court settlement, indicated that AAA's statements regarding the incident were truthful.</p><p> The RTC likewise observed that AAA, at 48 years old, appeared to be a mental retardate. AAA's "appearance, focus and demeanor while on the witness stand, and especially her responses to the questions propounded her by the prosecution and the defense counsel, showed that she is a mental retardate."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Reinforcing its finding that AAA was deprived of her will to resist the sexual advances of appellants, the RTC pointed to the fact that AAA was inebriated at the time of the incident.</p><p> The RTC found that the prosecution established beyond reasonable doubt the guilt of the appellants for simple rape but appreciated the privileged mitigating circumstance of minority in favor of XXX. The dispositive portion of the decision reads: </p><blockquote> <p> WHEREFORE, all the foregoing considered, the court finds each of the four accused GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of one act of Rape by direct participation.</p> <p> Accused Alfredo Gilles, Niño G. Monter and Constante M. Castil are hereby sentenced to <em>reclusion perpetua</em>.</p> <p> Accused [XXX] is hereby sentenced to an Indeterminate penalty of 10 years of <em>prision mayor</em>, as minimum, to 17 years and 4 months of <em>reclusion temporal</em>, as maximum, appreciating in his favor the privileged mitigating circumstance of minority. Pursuant to Section 38 of R.A. No. 9344 and Section 48 of Supreme Court Rule on Juveniles in Conflict with the Law, [XXX] is hereby placed under suspended sentence. Set the disposition conference regarding said accused on May 20, 2014 at 2:00 o'clock in the afternoon.</p> <p> All named accused are further ordered to jointly and solidarily pay [AAA] the sum of P200,000.00 as civil indemnity, the further sum of P200,000.00 as moral damages and the sum of P90,000.00 as exemplary damages plus costs, without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency. </p> <p>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> <i>The CA Ruling</i> </p><p> In sustaining the conviction of appellants, the CA noted that the victim was a retardate, and therefore the force or intimidation required to overcome her is of a lesser degree than that used against a normal adult. In this case, considering AAA is feeble-minded, the force required by law is the sexual act itself. The CA highlighted that appellants were convicted of the crime of simple rape through force and intimidation under paragraph 1(a) of Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code. However, it was established by testimonial evidence of FFF and the medical report of Dr. Esclamado that AAA is known to have mental deficiency. From these pieces of evidence, the CA determined AAA to be mentally deficient. </p><p> The CA ruled that the appellants argument that AAA is a woman of loose morals is bereft of merit as the moral character of the victim is immaterial. It held that the sexual act could not have been consensual as AAA was mentally deficient and thus did not have the capacity to give her consent. The CA further stated that resistance is not an element of the crime of rape, AAA's silence cannot be taken against her, and that a delay in reporting the crime of rape does not necessarily cast doubt on AAA's credibility. Finally, as to the credibility of the witnesses, the CA noted that the RTC considered AAA as a credible witness. The CA was fully convinced of her sincerity, candor and truthfulness. </p><p>On the subject of the penalty, however, the CA specified that the appellants were not eligible for parole pursuant to Section 3, Republic Act No. 9346.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> The dispositive portion of the decision reads: </p><blockquote> <p> WHEREFORE, the appeal is hereby DENIED. The April 30, 2014 Decision of the RTC, Branch 25, Maasin City, Southern Leyte, in Criminal Case No. 11-03-3508 finding accused-appellants guilty beyond reasonable doubt of simple rape is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION that all monetary awards shall be subject to interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of finality of this judgment until fully paid.</p> <p> SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> Hence, this appeal.</p><p align="center"> <b><u>Issues</u></b> </p><p> Appellants submit to this Court the following issues for resolution: </p><ol><li> Whether the courts <i>a quo </i>erred in convicting the appellants of the crime charged in giving full weight and credence to the materially unreliable and uncorroborated testimonies of the prosecution witnesses;<br><br> </li><li>Whether the courts <i>a quo</i> erred in convicting the appellants of the crime charged despite the failure of the prosecution to prove their guilt beyond reasonable doubt. </li></ol> <p> <i>Arguments for the appellants</i></p><p> Appellants stress that AAA is not mentally deficient. The medical certificate purportedly signed by Dr. Escalamado was never testified to by the physician. Moreover, the examination conducted by the physician was on AAA's vagina, and not on her mental condition. AAA's actuations were also incompatible with human experience and inconsistent with the acts of a person who allegedly went through a traumatic experience of being raped by four (4) men. Appellants insist that AAA was not deprived of reason at the time of the incident. She fully knew what was going to happen to her. She was not forced to go with the appellants, on the contrary, she consented and freely went with them. Her testimony is likewise inconsistent with the testimony of prosecution witness Liberty. Appellants also point out that FFF and her husband took it upon themselves to report the allegation to the police.</p><p> While it is true that the sole testimony of a victim is sufficient to sustain a conviction, appellants argue that the presumption of innocence is not overcome by mere suspicion, conjecture, or a probability that the defendant committed the crime. Even assuming that there was carnal knowledge between AAA and appellants, such was done in accord with their own volition.</p><p> <i>Arguments for the appellee</i></p><p> Appellee, through the Office of the Solicitor General, asserts that the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses show that indeed there was sexual congress between appellants and AAA. It insists that the prosecution was able to prove that appellants committed rape through force and intimidation, which was sufficient in consummating the purpose which the appellants had in mind. The conviction is not based on the fact that AAA is a mental retardate, but on the use of force and intimidation. The mental retardation was a circumstance the trial court used to evaluate the degree of the force and intimidation needed. In this case, the force required is only the sexual act itself. Further, the fact that AAA was apparently drunk at that time further demonstrates AAA's inability to give consent to having carnal knowledge. </p><p>Appellee likewise emphasizes the existence of the mental abnormality or deficiency on the part of AAA. Other evidence may prove mental retardation, which includes testimony of witnesses and even the observation by the trial court. </p><p align="center"> <b><u>The Court's Ruling</u></b> </p><p> From a review of the records, the Court finds the appeal impressed with merit.</p><p> Under the information, appellants are accused of committing rape under Sec. 266-A(1), which states: </p><blockquote> <p> <b>Article 266-A. Rape: When And How Committed. </b>- Rape is committed:</p> <p> 1) By a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances: </p> <blockquote> <p>a) Through force, threat, or intimidation;</p> <p> b) When the offended party is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious;</p> <p> c) By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority; and</p> <p> d) When the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age or is demented, even though none of the circumstances mentioned above be present.</p> <p> xxxx</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> The information against appellants alleged that they committed the heinous act through force, threat, or intimidation. There was no mention in the information that AAA was deprived of reason or was unconscious. </p><p>Specifically, for the review of rape cases, the Court has consistently adhered to the following established principles: a) an accusation of rape can be made with facility; it is difficult to prove, but more difficult for the person accused, though innocent, to disprove; b) in view of the intrinsic nature of the crime where only two persons are usually involved, the testimony of the complainant must be scrutinized with extreme caution; and c) the evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merits, and cannot be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> </p><p> Following these principles, the Court has also refined how rape is proved. The credibility of the complainant is the single most important issue in the prosecution of rape cases. The categorical and candid testimony of the complainant suffices, and a culprit may be convicted solely on the basis of her testimony, provided that it hurdles the test of credibility.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> It should not just come from the mouth of a credible witness, it should likewise be credible and reasonable in itself, candid, straightforward and in accord with human experience. Where the discrepancies and contradictory statements on important details in the testimony seriously impair its probative value, cast serious doubt on its credibility, and erode the integrity of the testimony,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> the Court should acquit the accused.</p><p> It is true that the Court accords great respect to the trial court's findings on witnesses' credibility. This is because trial provides judges with the opportunity to detect cues and expressions that could suggest sincerity or betray lies and ill will, not reflected in the documentary or object evidence. The exception, of course, is when the trial court and/or the CA overlooked or misconstrued substantial facts that could have affected the outcome of the case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></p><p> Ultimately, the prosecution has the primordial duty to present its case with clarity and persuasion that conviction becomes the only logical and inevitable conclusion. The prosecution is required to justify the conviction of the accused with moral certainty. Failing this test, the Court has the constitutional duty to acquit the accused lest its mind be tortured with the thought that it has imprisoned an innocent man for the rest of his life.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> The presumption of innocence is a primordial concern for the Court; thus, resort to inference, or the truth or proposition drawn from another which is supposed or admitted to be true, is not correct. The fact sought to be established is deduced as a logical consequence from other facts, or a state of facts, already proved or admitted.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></p><p> A review of the records and the transcripts, however, shows that there are numerous inconsistencies in the accounts of the prosecution witnesses that would lead any person with a reasonable mind to doubt the story offered against the appellants, which should lead to their acquittal.</p><p> This case falls within the exception of giving great respect to the RTC and CA's assessment of the evidence. The transcripts show that there was not enough evidence to say, and not out of mere inference, that appellants had carnal knowledge of AAA and that force, threat, and intimidation were employed upon her person to achieve appellants' supposed lecherous desires.

AAA asserted that Castil placed his penis inside her vagina, followed by XXX. But then as to Gilles and Monter, the story is confusing and unclear. The chronology of events is also hazily narrated. AAA claimed she fell asleep, but in the same testimony, said she was aware of Gilles and Monter raping her. The Court cannot take this as a positive allegation of Gilles and Monter's participation in the defilement. The participation of these appellants is tenuous at best, and based only on conjecture.</p> <p> More importantly, there was also no clear showing of force, threat, or intimidation from AAA's story. She narrated that only Castil held her arm, without even saying how he held it or describing the force, if any, that was inflicted upon her. This hardly comprises the force, threat, or intimidation contemplated by law.</p><p> The allegation of conspiracy to consummate the illegal act was likewise insufficiently proven. The elements of conspiracy must be proven beyond reasonable doubt, similar to the physical act constituting the crime itself. Evidence of actual cooperation, not only mere cognizance, approval, or mere presence, must be shown.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> In this case, the mere statement that appellants <i>appeared</i> to talk about "doing something to her" should not suffice.</p><p> Further, prosecution witness Liberty cannot even say that she saw the appellants with AAA, to which AAA positively testified. The four (4) appellants were never seen together with AAA at any point of the night. Instead of corroborating AAA's account that she was with the appellants throughout the night until the following morning, Liberty offered a contrary story. Also, Liberty even had a conflicting version as to who was seen last in the beach - was it Castil with XXX or Monter and XXX? </p><p> AAA's claim of being raped even when Liberty and her companions were already present at the place where the crime allegedly took place not only goes against human experience but likewise not consistent with Liberty's testimony. Another questionable factor in the whole story is the fact that given the family's assertion and recognition of her feeble-mindedness, BBB and FFF would still apparently allow AAA to get drunk and go out even at odd hours of the night. This does not reflect the normal concern and protection towards family members with mental deficiency. On the other hand, it shows that even AAA's family knows that she is a functioning member of their family, who makes and is allowed to make her own autonomous choices based on her own rational decision-making.</p><p> As noted earlier, the testimony of the victim should be scrutinized with extreme caution. With AAA's statements taken with Liberty's and the overall evidence presented by the prosecution, the Court is convinced that the burden of proving the occurrence of the crime of rape made in conspiracy among all the appellants, through force, threat, and intimidation, was not met. Serious doubts exist as to the credibility of the statements of the prosecution witnesses. Unlike the candid and straightforward characterization of the RTC of AAA's testimony, the Court finds that the occurrence of rape was not the only conclusion to be had here. All of these factors create a reasonable doubt in the mind of the Court, for which reason the appellants' acquittal is in order.</p><p> It appears from the RTC and CA decisions that appellants were convicted of rape because AAA was feeble-minded, and not because of the existence of force, threat, or intimidation. As emphasized in the CA decision: </p><blockquote> <p>Just like in this case, while there may have been no physical force employed on the victim but considering that she is feeble-minded, there is authority to the effect that the force required by law is the sexual act itself.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> This is not alleged in the information. The Court had previously ruled that an accused cannot be convicted of rape if the information charged him with rape through force, threat, or intimidation when what was proven was sexual congress with a woman deprived of reason, unconscious, or under twelve years of age. The conviction would be a deprivation of the constitutional right to be informed of the accusation against him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Nonetheless, in a more recent case, the Court held that even if the information lacked the allegation of any mental disability on the part of the victim, such allegation was unnecessary to convict the accused provided that sexual congress and mental incapacity,<i> i.e.</i> the incapacity to give consent, are proven by clear and convincing evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></p><p> The state of being feeble-minded has been explained as the incapacity of thinking and reasoning like any normal human being, not being able to think and reason from birth, and devoid or deficient in those instincts and other mental faculties that characterize the average and normal mortal. When a woman is feeble-minded, she has no free and voluntary will. She is incapable of freely and voluntarily giving consent which is necessary and essential from lifting coitus from the place of criminality.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> In <i>People of the Philippines v. Dalandas</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> the Court had the opportunity to distinguish between the various degrees of mental retardation, and where "feeble-mindedness" fell within the spectrum. The Court held: </p><blockquote> <p> Mental retardation is a chronic condition present from birth or early childhood and characterized by impaired intellectual functioning measured by standardized tests. It manifests itself in impaired adaptation to the daily demands of the individual's own social environment. Commonly, a mental retardate exhibits a slow rate of maturation, physical and/or psychological, as well as impaired learning capacity.</p> <p> Although mental retardation is often used interchangeably with mental deficiency, the latter term is usually reserved for those without recognizable brain pathology. xxx </p> <p>xxxx</p> <p> A normal mind is one which in strength and capacity ranks reasonably well with the average of the great body of men and women who make up organized human society in general, and are by common consent recognized as sane and competent to perform the ordinary duties and assume the ordinary responsibilities of life.</p> <p> <b>The traditional but now obsolescent terms applied to those degrees of mental retardation were (a) <i>idiot</i>, having an IQ of 0 to 19, and a maximum intellectual factor in adult life equivalent to that of the average two-year old child; (b) <i>imbecile </i>by an IQ of 20 to 49 and a maximum intellectual function in adult life equivalent to that of the average seven-year old child;<i> moron</i> or <i>feebleminded</i>, having an IQ of 50 to 69 and a maximum intellectual function in adult life equivalent to that of the average twelve-year old child. </b>Psychiatrists and psychologists apply the term borderline intelligence to those with IQ between 70 to 89. xxx.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> (emphasis supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> All elements of the crime of rape must be proven beyond reasonable doubt, including the victim's mental condition. Although it is true that mental abnormality or deficiency is enough for a woman to be considered "deprived of reason," thus dispensing with the proof of force, threat, or intimidation, abnormality or deficiency of whatever state or degree should be sufficiently and adequately established by orthodox and reasonably available methods and procedures. It is possible that complainant could well have been merely on the lower end of the acceptable mean for her age group, a condition which would have been aggravated by her lack of education, but this, by any medical or psychological yardstick, does not itself negate autonomous choice or decision-making based on reasoning.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> </p><p> Indeed, the Court has previously decided that other evidence aside from psychiatric evaluation can prove mental retardation or abnormality. The personal observation of the judge would suffice as a measure of determining the impact on her of the force, threat, and intimidation foisted upon the victim.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> This is the rule relied upon by the RTC. However, the cases cited anent this issue, <i>People of the Philippines v. Almacin (Almacin)</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> and <i>People of the Philippines v. Dumanon (Dumanon)</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> have different factual settings from the instant case. In<em> Almacin</em>, the victim could only read and write her own name, and did not even finish Grade 1 in school. Being illiterate and unschooled, she was considered mentally incapable of intelligently assenting or dissenting to sexual intercourse. In<em> Dumanon</em>, the trial court noted numerous pieces of evidence showing the victim's condition, including the mere appearance of the victim and the victim's difficulty in answering the questions while on trial. The trial court, upheld by the Court, remarked on her appearance as mongoloid and that she was suffering from Down's Syndrome. </p><p> Here, however, the Court only has the RTC's assessment of AAA to go by and determine that AAA was feeble-minded and therefore sexual congress with her equates to rape. The medical certificate stated that "patient is known to have mental deficiency."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> However, this was not even testified to by the doctor who signed the same. FFF, AAA's sister-in-law, also testified that AAA appeared "childish." Thus, the conclusion by the RTC was made absent Dr. Esclamado's testimony as well as medical proof of AAA's mental state, instead only made upon FFF's statement. It should also be emphasized that FFF's testimony was initially objected to by the counsel for the appellants as she was not included in the initial list of witnesses, and was even presented without the presence of the appellants' counsel. With only testimonial evidence from a partial witness, there is not enough proof of AAA's mental state that would justify the finding of appellants' guilt. </p><p> In <i>People of the Philippines v. Cartuano, Jr. (Cartuano)</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> where it was held that the deficiency of whatever state or degree should be sufficiently and adequately established by orthodox and reasonably available methods and procedures, there was a dearth of medical records to sustain a finding of mental retardation. In the recent case of <i>People of the Philippines v. Rodriguez (Rodriguez)</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> where<i> Cartuano</i> was invoked, the prosecution presented a neuro-psychiatric examination and evaluation conducted by a psychologist, which included the administration of the Standford Binnet Intelligence Test. The latter case shows that the doctrine in<i> Cartuano</i>, that there should be clear and convincing proof as to the mental state of the victim, is still good law.</p><p> Unlike the cases of <i>Almacin, Dumanon</i>, and <i>Rodriguez</i>, the instant case shows an obvious lack of clear and convincing evidence of the victim's mental deficiency upon which the conviction of the appellants is based. Without any showing of force, threat, or intimidation as alleged in the information, it is necessary to show that AAA was deprived of reason for the successful prosecution of the appellants for the crime of rape. The prosecution was unable to show this deprivation of reason.</p><p> To reiterate, the force, threat, and intimidation, and conspiracy among the appellants as alleged in the information, as well as AAA's mental deficiency, were not proven with moral certainty. The case presented by the prosecution was insufficient to overcome the presumption of innocence accorded by the law to appellants.</p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appeal is <b>GRANTED</b>.
