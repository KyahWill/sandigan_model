				<BR><BR><div align="justify">G.R. Nos. 213446 and 213658 are petitions for Certiorari, Prohibition and/or Mandamus under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, with Application for Issuance of Temporary Restraining Order and/or Writ of Preliminary Injunction, uniformly seeking to: (<i>a</i>) issue a Temporary Restraining Order to enjoin the implementation of Revenue Memorandum Order (RMO) No. 23- 2014 dated June 20, 2014 issued by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR); and (<i>b</i>) declare null, void and unconstitutional paragraphs A, B, C, and D of Section III, and Sections IV, VI and VII of RMO No. 23-2014. The petition in G.R. No. 213446 also prays for the issuance of a Writ of Mandamus to compel respondents to upgrade the P30,000.00 non-taxable ceiling of the 13<sup>th</sup> month pay and other benefits for the concerned officials and employees of the government.<p align="center"> <b>The Antecedents</b> </p><p> On June 20, 2014, respondent CIR issued the assailed RMO No. 23-2014, in furtherance of Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 23-2012 dated February 14, 2012 on the "<i>Reiteration of the Responsibilities of the Officials and Employees of Government Offices for the Withholding of Applicable Taxes on Certain Income Payments and the Imposition of Penalties for Non-Compliance Thereof</i>," in order to clarify and consolidate the responsibilities of the public sector to withhold taxes on its transactions as a customer (on its purchases of goods and services) and as an employer (on compensation paid to its officials and employees) under the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC or Tax Code) of 1997, as amended, and other special laws. </p><p align="center"> <b>The Petitions</b> </p><p> <b><i>G.R.

According to petitioners, RMO No. 23-2014 classified as taxable compensation, the following allowances, bonuses, compensation for services granted to government employees, which they alleged to be considered by law as non-taxable fringe and <i>de minimis</i> benefits, to wit: </p><blockquote> <p> I.

Japzon, President of the Philippine Association of Court Employees â€“ Manila Chapter, filed a Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> as duly authorized representatives of said associations, seeking to nullify RMO No. 23-2014 on the following grounds: (<i>1</i>) respondent CIR is bereft of any authority to issue the assailed RMO. The NIRC of 1997, as amended, expressly vests to the Secretary of Finance the authority to promulgate all needful rules and regulations for the effective enforcement of tax provisions;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> and (<i>2</i>) respondent CIR committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in the issuance of RMO No. 23-2014 when it subjected to withholding tax benefits and allowances of court employees which are tax-exempt such as: (<i>a</i>) Special Allowance for Judiciary (SAJ) under Republic Act (RA) No. 9227 and additional cost of living allowance (AdCOLA) granted under Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1949 which are considered as non-taxable fringe benefits under Section 33(A) of the NIRC of 1997, as amended; (<i>b</i>) cash gift, loyalty awards, uniform and clothing allowance and additional compensation (ADCOM) granted to court employees which are considered<em> de minimis</em> under Section 33(C)(4) of the same Code; (<i>c</i>) allowances and benefits granted by the Judiciary which are not taxable pursuant to Section 32(7)(E) of the NIRC of 1997, as amended; and (<i>d</i>) expenses for the Judiciary provided under Commission on Audit (COA) Circular 2012-001.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> </p><p> Petitioners further assert that RMO No. 23-2014 violates their right to due process of law because while it is ostensibly denominated as a mere revenue issuance, it is an illegal and unwarranted legislative action which sharply increased the tax burden of officials and employees of the Judiciary without the benefit of being heard.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> </p><p> On October 21, 2014, the Court resolved to consolidate the foregoing cases.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></p><p> Respondents, through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), filed their Consolidated Comment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> on December 23, 2014. They argue that the petitions are barred by the doctrine of hierarchy of courts and petitioners failed to present any special and important reasons or exceptional and compelling circumstance to justify direct recourse to this Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></p><p> Maintaining that RMO No. 23-2014 was validly issued in accordance with the power of the CIR to make rulings and opinion in connection with the implementation of internal revenue laws, respondents aver that unlike Revenue Regulations (RRs), RMOs do not require the approval or signature of the Secretary of Finance, as these merely provide directives or instructions in the implementation of stated policies, goals, objectives, plans and programs of the Bureau.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> According to them, RMO No. 23-2014 is in fact a mere reiteration of the Tax Code and previous RMOs, and can be traced back to RR No. 01-87 dated April 2, 1987 implementing Executive Order No. 651 which was promulgated by then Secretary of Finance Jaime V. Ongpin upon recommendation of then CIR Bienvenido A. Tan, Jr. Thus, the CIR never usurped the power and authority of the legislature in the issuance of the assailed RMO.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Also, contrary to petitioners' assertion, the due process requirements of hearing and publication are not applicable to RMO No. 23-2014.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></p><p> Respondents further argue that petitioners' claim that RMO No. 23-2014 is unconstitutional has no leg to stand on. They explain that the constitutional guarantee of fiscal autonomy to Judiciary and Constitutional Commissions does not include exemption from payment of taxes, which is the lifeblood of the nation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> They also aver that RMO No. 23-2014 never intended to diminish the powers of local government units. It merely reiterates the obligation of the government as an employer to withhold taxes, which has long been provided by the Tax Code.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></p><p> Moreover, respondents assert that the allowances and benefits enumerated in Section III A, B, C, and D, are not fringe benefits which are exempt from taxation under Section 33 of the Tax Code, nor <em>de minimis </em>benefits excluded from employees' taxable basic salary. They explain that the SAJ under RA No. 9227 and AdCOLA under PD No. 1949 are additional allowances which form part of the employee's basic salary; thus, subject to withholding taxes.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> </p><p> Respondents also claim that RMO No. 23-2014 does not violate petitioners' right to equal protection of laws as it covers all employees and officials of the government. It does not create a new category of taxable income nor make taxable those which are not taxable but merely reflect those incomes which are deemed taxable under existing laws.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> </p><p> Lastly, respondents aver that mandamus will not lie to compel respondents to increase the ceiling for tax exemptions because the Tax Code does not impose a mandatory duty on the part of respondents to do the same.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></p><p align="center"> <b>The Petitions-in-Intervention</b> </p><p> Meanwhile, on September 11, 2014, the National Federation of Employees Associations of the Department of Agriculture (NAFEDA) <i>et al</i>., duly registered union/association of employees of the Department of Agriculture, National Agricultural and Fisheries Council, Commission on Elections, Mines and Geosciences Bureau, and Philippine Fisheries Development Authority, claiming similar interest as petitioners in G.R. No. 213446, filed a Petition-in-Intervention<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> seeking the nullification of items III, VI and VII of RMO No. 23-2014 based on the following grounds: (<em>1</em>) that respondent CIR acted with grave abuse of discretion and usurped the power of the Legislature in issuing RMO No. 23-2014 which imposes additional taxes on government employees and prescribes penalties for government official's failure to withhold and remit the same;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> (<em>2</em>) that RMO No. 23-2014 violates the equal protection clause because the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) was not included among the constitutional commissions covered by the issuance and the ADCOM of employees of the Judiciary was subjected to withholding tax but those received by employees of the Legislative and Executive branches are not;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> and (<em>3</em>) that respondent CIR failed to upgrade the tax exemption ceiling for benefits under Section 32(B)(7) of the NIRC of 1997, as amended.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> </p><p> In its Comment,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> respondents, through the OSG, sought the denial of the Petition-in-Intervention for failure of the intervenors to seek prior leave of Court and to demonstrate that the existing consolidated petitions are not sufficient to protect their interest as parties affected by the assailed RMO.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> They further contend that, contrary to the intervenors' position, the CHR is not exempt from the applicability of RMO No. 23-2014.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> They explain that the enumeration of government offices and constitutional bodies covered by RMO No. 23-2014 is not exclusive; Section III thereof in fact states that RMO No. 23-2014 covers all employees of the public sector.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> They also allege that the ADCOM referred to in Section III(B) of the assailed RMO is unique to the Judiciary; employees and officials in the executive and legislative do not receive this specific type of ADCOM enjoyed by the employees and officials of the Judicial branch.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> </p><p> On October 10, 2014, a Motion for Intervention with attached Complaint in Intervention<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> was filed, in G.R. No. 213658, by the Members of the Association of Regional Trial Court Judges in Iloilo City. Claiming that they are similarly situated with petitioners, said intervenors pray that the Court declare null and void RMO No. 23-2014 and direct the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) to refund the amount illegally exacted from the salaries/compensations of the judges by virtue of the implementation of RMO No. 23-2014.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> The intervenors claim that RMO No. 23-2014 violates their right to due process as it takes away a portion of their salaries and compensation without giving them the opportunity to be heard.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> They also aver that the implementation of RMO No. 23-2014 resulted in the diminution of their salaries/compensation in violation of Sections 3 and 10, Article VIII of the Constitution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></p><p> In their Comment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> to the Motion, respondents adopted the arguments in their Consolidated Comment and further stated that: (1) RMO No. 23-2014 does not diminish the salaries and compensation of members of the judiciary as it has been judicially settled that the imposition of taxes on salaries and compensation of judges and justices is not equivalent to diminution of the same;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> (2) the allowances and benefits enumerated under Section III(B) of RMO No. 23-2014 are not fringe benefits exempt from taxation;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> (3) the AdCOLA and SAJ are not fringe benefits as these are considered part of the basic salary of government employees subject to income tax;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> and (4) there is no valid ground for the refund of the taxes withheld pursuant to RMO No. 23-2014.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></p><p> In sum, petitioners and intervenors (collectively referred to as petitioners) argue that: </p><ol><li> RMO No. 23-2014 is <i>ultra vires </i>insofar as: <br><br> <ol start="" type="a"><li> Sections III and IV of RMO No. 23-2014, for subjecting to withholding taxes non-taxable allowances, bonuses and benefits received by government employees;<br><br></li><li> Sections VI and VII, for defining new offenses and prescribing penalties therefor, particularly upon government officials; <br><br> </li></ol> </li><li> RMO No. 23-2014 violates the equal protection clause as it discriminates against government employees; <br><br></li><li> RMO No. 23-2014 violates fiscal autonomy enjoyed by government agencies; <br><br></li><li> The implementation of RMO No. 23-2014 results in diminution of benefits of government employees, a violation of Article 100 of the Labor Code; and <br><br></li><li> Respondents may be compelled through a writ of mandamus to increase the tax-exempt ceiling for 13th month pay and other benefits. </li></ol> <p> On the other hand, respondents counter that: </p><ol><li> The instant consolidated petitions are barred by the doctrine of hierarchy of courts;<br><br></li><li> The CIR did not abuse its discretion in the issuance of RMO No. 23-2014 because: <br><br> <ol start="" type="a"><li> It was issued pursuant to the CIR's power to interpret the NIRC of 1997, as amended, and other tax laws, under Section 4 of the NIRC of 1997, as amended; <br><br></li><li> RMO No. 23-2014 does not discriminate against government employees. It does not create a new category of taxable income nor make taxable those which are exempt; <br><br></li><li>RMO No. 23-2014 does not result in diminution of benefits; <br><br></li><li>The allowances, bonuses or benefits listed under Section III of the assailed RMO are not fringe benefits; <br><br></li><li>The fiscal autonomy granted by the Constitution does not include tax exemption; and <br><br> </li></ol> </li><li> Mandamus does not lie against respondents because the NIRC of 1997, as amended, does not impose a mandatory duty upon them to increase the tax-exempt ceiling for 13th month pay and other benefits. </li></ol> <p> Incidentally, in a related case docketed as A.M. No. 16-12-04-SC, the Court, on July 11, 2017, issued a Resolution directing the Fiscal Management and Budget Office of the Court to maintain the <em>status quo</em> by the non-withholding of taxes from the benefits authorized to be granted to judiciary officials and personnel, namely, the Mid-year Economic Assistance, the Year-end Economic Assistance, the Yuletide Assistance, the Special Welfare Assistance (SWA) and the Additional SWA, until such time that a decision is rendered in the instant consolidated cases. </p><p align="center"><b>The Court's Ruling</b> </p><p align="center"> I. </p><p align="center"> <u>Procedural</u> </p><p><i>Non-exhaustion of administrative remedies.</i> </p><p>It is an unquestioned rule in this jurisdiction that certiorari under Rule 65 will only lie if there is no appeal, or any other plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law against the assailed issuance of the CIR.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> The plain, speedy and adequate remedy expressly provided by law is an appeal of the assailed RMO with the Secretary of Finance under Section 4 of the NIRC of 1997, as amended, to wit: </p><blockquote> <p> SEC. 4. Power of the Commissioner to Interpret Tax Laws and to Decide Tax Cases. â€“ <b>The power to interpret the provisions of this Code and other tax laws shall be under the exclusive and original jurisdiction of the Commissioner,<u> subject to review by the Secretary of Finance</u></b>.</p> <p> The power to decide disputed assessments, refunds of internal revenue taxes, fees or other charges, penalties imposed in relation thereto, or other matters arising under this Code or other laws or portions thereof administered by the Bureau of Internal Revenue is vested in the Commissioner, subject to the exclusive appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Tax Appeals.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> The CIR's exercise of its power to interpret tax laws comes in the form of revenue issuances, which include RMOs that provide "directives or instructions; prescribe guidelines; and outline processes, operations, activities, workflows, methods and procedures necessary in the implementation of stated policies, goals, objectives, plans and programs of the Bureau in all areas of operations, except auditing."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> These revenue issuances are subject to the review of the Secretary of Finance. In relation thereto, Department of Finance Department Order No. 007-02<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> issued by the Secretary of Finance laid down the procedure and requirements for filing an appeal from the adverse ruling of the CIR to the said office. A taxpayer is granted a period of thirty (30) days from receipt of the adverse ruling of the CIR to file with the Office of the Secretary of Finance a request for review in writing and under oath.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></p><p> In <i>Asia International Auctioneers, Inc. v. Parayno, Jr.</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> the Court dismissed the petition seeking the nullification of RMC No. 31-2003 for failing to exhaust administrative remedies. The Court held: </p><blockquote> <p> x x x It is settled that the premature invocation of the court's intervention is fatal to one's cause of action. If a remedy within the administrative machinery can still be resorted to by giving the administrative officer every opportunity to decide on a matter that comes within his jurisdiction, then such remedy must first be exhausted before the court's power of judicial review can be sought. The party with an administrative remedy must not only initiate the prescribed administrative procedure to obtain relief but also pursue it to its appropriate conclusion before seeking judicial intervention in order to give the administrative agency an opportunity to decide the matter itself correctly and prevent unnecessary and premature resort to the court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> The doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies is not without practical and legal reasons. For one thing, availment of administrative remedy entails lesser expenses and provides for a speedier disposition of controversies. It is no less true to state that courts of justice for reasons of comity and convenience will shy away from a dispute until the system of administrative redress has been completed and complied with so as to give the administrative agency concerned every opportunity to correct its error and to dispose of the case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> While there are recognized exceptions to this salutary rule, petitioners have failed to prove the presence of any of those in the instant case.</p><p> <i>Violation of the rule on hierarchy of courts.</i></p><p> Moreover, petitioners violated the rule on hierarchy of courts as the petitions should have been initially filed with the CTA, having the exclusive appellate jurisdiction to determine the constitutionality or validity of revenue issuances. </p><p> In <i>The Philippine American Life and General Insurance Co. v. Secretary of Finance</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> the Court held that rulings of the Secretary of Finance in its exercise of its power of review under Section 4 of the NIRC of 1997, as amended, are appealable to the CTA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> The Court explained that while there is no law which explicitly provides where rulings of the Secretary of Finance under the adverted to NIRC provision are appealable, Section 7(a)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> of RA No. 1125, the law creating the CTA, is nonetheless sufficient, albeit impliedly, to include appeals from the Secretary's review under Section 4 of the NIRC of 1997, as amended. </p><p> Moreover, echoing its pronouncements in <i>City of Manila v. Grecia-Cuerdo</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> that the CTA has the power of certiorari within its appellate jurisdiction, the Court declared that "it is now within the power of the CTA, through its power of <i>certiorari</i>, to rule on the validity of a particular administrative rule or regulation so long as it is within its appellate jurisdiction. Hence, it can now rule not only on the propriety of an assessment or tax treatment of a certain transaction, but also on the validity of the revenue regulation or revenue memorandum circular on which the said assessment is based."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> </p><p> Subsequently, in <i>Banco de Oro v. Republic</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> the Court, sitting <em>En Banc</em>, further held that the CTA has exclusive appellate jurisdiction to review, on certiorari, the constitutionality or validity of revenue issuances, even without a prior issuance of an assessment. The Court <i>En Banc</i> reasoned: </p><blockquote> <p> We revert to the earlier rulings in <em>Rodriguez, Leal</em>, and <em>Asia International Auctioneers, Inc</em>. The Court of Tax Appeals has exclusive jurisdiction to determine the constitutionality or validity of tax laws, rules and regulations, and other administrative issuances of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.</p> <blockquote> <p> Article VIII, Section 1 of the 1987 Constitution provides the general definition of judicial power:</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p align="center"> ARTICLE [VIII] <br>JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT </p><blockquote> <blockquote> <p> Section 1. The judicial power shall be vested in one Supreme Court and in such lower courts as may be established by law.</p> <p> Judicial power includes the duty of the courts of justice to settle actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable, and <i>to determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government</i>. (Emphasis supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> Based on this constitutional provision, this Court recognized, for the first time, in <i>The City of Manila v. Hon. Grecia-Cuerdo</i>, the Court of Tax Appeals' jurisdiction over petitions for certiorari assailing interlocutory orders issued by the Regional Trial Court in a local tax case. Thus:</p> <blockquote> <p> [W]hile there is no express grant of such power, with respect to the CTA, Section 1, Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution provides, nonetheless, that judicial power shall be vested in one Supreme Court and in such lower courts as may be established by law and that judicial power includes the duty of the courts of justice to settle actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable, and <b>to determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government.</b> </p> <p> On the strength of the above constitutional provisions, it can be fairly interpreted that the power of the CTA includes that of determining whether or not there has been grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of the RTC in issuing an interlocutory order in cases falling within the exclusive appellate jurisdiction of the tax court. It, thus, follows that the CTA, by constitutional mandate, is vested with jurisdiction to issue writs of <i>certiorari</i> in these cases. (Emphasis in the original)</p> </blockquote> <p> This Court further explained that the Court of Tax Appeals' authority to issue writs of <i>certiorari</i> is inherent in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction: </p> <blockquote> <p> A grant of appellate jurisdiction implies that there is included in it the power necessary to exercise it effectively, to make all orders that will preserve the subject of the action, and to give effect to the final determination of the appeal. It carries with it the power to protect that jurisdiction and to make the decisions of the court thereunder effective. The court, in aid of its appellate jurisdiction, has authority to control all auxiliary and incidental matters necessary to the efficient and proper exercise of that jurisdiction. For this purpose, it may, when necessary, prohibit or restrain the performance of any act which might interfere with the proper exercise of its rightful jurisdiction in cases pending before it.</p> <p> Lastly, it would not be amiss to point out that a court which is endowed with a particular jurisdiction should have powers which are necessary to enable it to act effectively within such jurisdiction. These should be regarded as powers which are inherent in its jurisdiction and the court must possess them in order to enforce its rules of practice and to suppress any abuses of its process and to defeat any attempted thwarting of such process. </p> <p> In this regard, Section 1 of RA 9282 states that the CTA shall be of the same level as the CA and shall possess all the inherent powers of a court of justice. </p> <p> Indeed, courts possess certain inherent powers which may be said to be implied from a general grant of jurisdiction, in addition to those expressly conferred on them. These inherent powers are such powers as are necessary for the ordinary and efficient exercise of jurisdiction; or are essential to the existence, dignity and functions of the courts, as well as to the due administration of justice; or are directly appropriate, convenient and suitable to the execution of their granted powers; and include the power to maintain the court's jurisdiction and render it effective in behalf of the litigants. </p> <p> Thus, this Court has held that "while a court may be expressly granted the incidental powers necessary to effectuate its jurisdiction, a grant of jurisdiction, in the absence of prohibitive legislation, implies the necessary and usual incidental powers essential to effectuate it, and, subject to existing laws and constitutional provisions, every regularly constituted court has power to do all things that are reasonably necessary for the administration of justice within the scope of its jurisdiction and for the enforcement of its judgments and mandates." Hence, demands, matters or questions ancillary or incidental to, or growing out of, the main action, and coming within the above principles, may be taken cognizance of by the court and determined, since such jurisdiction is in aid of its authority over the principal matter, even though the court may thus be called on to consider and decide matters which, as original causes of action, would not be within its cognizance. (Citations omitted) </p> </blockquote> <p> Judicial power likewise authorizes lower courts to determine the constitutionality or validity of a law or regulation in the first instance. This is contemplated in the Constitution when it speaks of appellate review of final judgments of inferior courts in cases where such constitutionality is in issue. </p> <p> On June 16, 1954, Republic Act No. 1125 created the Court of Tax Appeals not as another superior administrative agency as was its predecessor â€” the former Board of Tax Appeals â€” but as a part of the judicial system with exclusive jurisdiction to act on appeals from: </p> <blockquote> <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="4%"><div align="justify">(1)</div></td> <td width="96%"><div align="justify">Decisions of the Collector of Internal Revenue in cases involving disputed assessments, refunds of internal revenue taxes, fees or other charges, penalties imposed in relation thereto, or other matters arising under the National Internal Revenue Code or other law or part of law administered by the Bureau of Internal Revenue;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(2)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Decisions of the Commissioner of Customs in cases involving liability for customs duties, fees or other money charges; seizure, detention or release of property affected fines, forfeitures or other penalties imposed in relation thereto; or other matters arising under the Customs Law or other law or part of law administered by the Bureau of Customs; and</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(3)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Decisions of provincial or city Boards of Assessment Appeals in cases involving the assessment and taxation of real property or other matters arising under the Assessment Law, including rules and regulations relative thereto.</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote> <p>Republic Act No. 1125 transferred to the Court of Tax Appeals jurisdiction over all matters involving assessments that were previously cognizable by the Regional Trial Courts (then courts of first instance). </p> <p> In 2004, Republic Act No. 9282 was enacted. It expanded the jurisdiction of the Court of Tax Appeals and elevated its rank to the level of a collegiate court with special jurisdiction.

On the contrary, they merely mirror the relevant provisions of the NIRC of 1997, as amended, and its implementing rules on the withholding tax on compensation income as discussed above. The assailed Sections simply reinforce the rule that every form of compensation for personal services received by all employees arising from employer-employee relationship is deemed subject to income tax and, consequently, to withholding tax,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> unless specifically exempted or excluded by the Tax Code; and the duty of the Government, as an employer, to withhold and remit the correct amount of withholding taxes due thereon.</p><p> While Section III enumerates certain allowances which may be subject to withholding tax, it does not exclude the possibility that these allowances may fall under the exemptions identified under Section IV â€“ thus, the phrase, "subject to the exemptions enumerated herein." In other words, Sections III and IV articulate in a general and broad language the provisions of the NIRC of 1997, as amended, on the forms of compensation income deemed subject to withholding tax and the allowances, bonuses and benefits exempted therefrom. Thus, Sections III and IV cannot be said to have been issued by the CIR with grave abuse of discretion as these are fully in accordance with the provisions of the NIRC of 1997, as amended, and its implementing rules.</p><p> Furthermore, the Court finds untenable petitioners' contention that the assailed provisions of RMO No. 23-2014 contravene the equal protection clause, fiscal autonomy, and the rule on non-diminution of benefits.</p><p> The constitutional guarantee of equal protection is not violated by an executive issuance which was issued to simply reinforce existing taxes applicable to both the private and public sector. As discussed, the withholding tax system embraces not only private individuals, organizations and corporations, but also covers organizations exempt from income tax, including the Government of the Philippines, its agencies, instrumentalities, and political subdivisions. While the assailed RMO is a directive to the Government, as a reminder of its obligation as a withholding agent, it did not, in any manner or form, alter or amend the provisions of the Tax Code, for or against the Government or its employees.</p><p> Moreover, the fiscal autonomy enjoyed by the Judiciary, Ombudsman, and Constitutional Commissions, as envisioned in the Constitution, does not grant immunity or exemption from the common burden of paying taxes imposed by law. To borrow former Chief Justice Corona's words in his Separate Opinion in <i>Francisco, Jr. v. House of Representatives</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> "fiscal autonomy entails freedom from outside control and limitations, <b><u>other than those provided by law</u></b>.

Commissioner of Internal Revenue</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> that the imposition of taxes on salaries of Judges does not result in diminution of benefits. This applies to all government employees because the intent of the framers of the Organic Law and of the people adopting it is "<b><u>that all citizens should bear their aliquot part of the cost of maintaining the government and should share the burden of general income taxation equitably</u></b>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> </p><table width="50%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><i>Determination of existence of fringe benefits is a question of fact.</i> </td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>Petitioners, nonetheless, insist that the allowances, bonuses and benefits enumerated in Section III of the assailed RMO are, in fact, fringe and <i>de minimis</i> benefits exempt from withholding tax on compensation. The Court cannot, however, rule on this issue as it is essentially a question of fact that cannot be determined in this petition questioning the constitutionality of the RMO. </p><p> To be sure, settled is the rule that exemptions from tax are construed <i>strictissimi juris</i> against the taxpayer and liberally in favor of the taxing authority.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> One who claims tax exemption must point to a specific provision of law conferring, in clear and plain terms, exemption from the common burden<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> and prove, through substantial evidence, that it is, in fact, covered by the exemption so claimed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> The determination, therefore, of the merits of petitioners' claim for tax exemption would necessarily require the resolution of both legal and factual issues, which this Court, not being a trier of facts, has no jurisdiction to do; more so, in a petition filed at first instance.</p><p> Among the factual issues that need to be resolved, at the first instance, is the nature of the fringe benefits granted to employees. The NIRC of 1997, as amended, does not impose income tax, and consequently a withholding tax, on payments to employees which are either (<i>a</i>) required by the nature of, or necessary to, the business of the employer; or (<i>b</i>) for the convenience or advantage of the employer.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> This, however, requires proper documentation. Without any documentary proof that the payment ultimately redounded to the benefit of the employer, the same shall be considered as a taxable benefit to the employee, and hence subject to withholding taxes.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup></p><p> Another factual issue that needs to be confirmed is the recipient of the alleged fringe benefit. Fringe benefits furnished or granted, in cash or in kind, by an employer to its managerial or supervisory employees, are not considered part of compensation income; thus, exempt from withholding tax on compensation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> Instead, these fringe benefits are subject to a fringe benefit tax equivalent to 32% of the grossed-up monetary value of the benefit, which the employer is legally required to pay.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> On the other hand, fringe benefits given to rank and file employees, while exempt from fringe benefit tax,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> form part of compensation income taxable under the regular income tax rates provided in Section 24(A)(2) of the NIRC, of 1997, as amended;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> and consequently, subject to withholding tax on compensation.</p><p> Furthermore, fringe benefits of relatively small value furnished by the employer to his employees (both managerial/supervisory and rank and file) as a means of promoting health, goodwill, contentment, or efficiency, otherwise known as <i>de minimis</i> benefits, that are exempt from both income tax on compensation and fringe benefit tax; hence, not subject to withholding tax,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> are limited and exclusive only to those enumerated under RR No. 3-98, as amended.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> All other benefits given by the employer which are not included in the said list, although of relatively small value, shall not be considered as <i>de minimis</i> benefits; hence, shall be subject to income tax as well as withholding tax on compensation income, for rank and file employees, or fringe benefits tax for managerial and supervisory employees, as the case may be.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> </p><p>Based on the foregoing, it is clear that to completely determine the merits of petitioners' claimed exemption from withholding tax on compensation, under Section 33 of the NIRC of 1997, there is a need to confirm several factual issues. As such, petitioners cannot but first resort to the proper courts and administrative agencies which are better equipped for said task. </p><p> All told, the Court finds Sections III and IV of the assailed RMO valid. The NIRC of 1997, as amended, is clear that all forms of compensation income received by the employee from his employer are presumed taxable and subject to withholding taxes. The Government of the Philippines, its agencies, instrumentalities, and political subdivisions, as an employer, is required by law to withhold and remit to the BIR the appropriate taxes due thereon. Any claims of exemption from withholding taxes by an employee, as in the case of petitioners, must be brought and resolved in the appropriate administrative and judicial proceeding, with the employee having the burden to prove the factual and legal bases thereof. </p><table width="50%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><i>Section VII of RMO No. 23-2014 is valid; Section VI contravenes, in part, the provisions of the NIRC of 1997, as amended, and its implementing rules.</i> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>Petitioners claim that RMO No. 23-2014 is <i>ultra vires</i> insofar as Sections VI and VII thereof define new offenses and prescribe penalties therefor, particularly upon government officials. </p><p> The NIRC of 1997, as amended, clearly provides the offenses and penalties relevant to the obligation of the withholding agent to deduct, withhold and remit the correct amount of withholding taxes on compensation income, to wit: </p><p align="center"> TITLE X<br> Statutory Offenses and Penalties</p><p align="center"> CHAPTER I <br>Additions to the Tax </p><blockquote> <p> SEC. 247. <i>General Provisions</i>. â€“</p> <p> (a) The additions to the tax or deficiency tax prescribed in this Chapter shall apply to all taxes, fees and charges imposed in this Code.

Section VII simply mirrors the relevant provisions of the NIRC of 1997, as amended, on the penalties for the failure of the withholding agent to withhold and remit the correct amount of taxes, as implemented by RR No. 2-98.</p><p> However, with respect to Section VI of the assailed RMO, the Court finds that the CIR overstepped the boundaries of its authority to interpret existing provisions of the NIRC of 1997, as amended. </p><p> Section VI of RMO No. 23-2014 reads: </p><blockquote> <p> <b>VI.

In relation thereto, Section 82 of the NIRC of 1997, as amended, states that the return of the amount deducted and withheld upon any wage paid to government employees shall be made by the officer or employee having control of the payments or by any officer or employee duly designated for such purpose.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> Consequently, RR No. 2-98 identifies <i>the Provincial Treasurer in provinces, the City Treasurer in cities, the Municipal Treasurer in municipalities, Barangay Treasurer in barangays, Treasurers of government-owned or -controlled corporations (GOCCs), and the Chief Accountant or any person holding similar position and performing similar function in national government offices</i>, as persons required to deduct and withhold the appropriate taxes on the income payments made by the government.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup></p> <p> However, nowhere in the NIRC of 1997, as amended, or in RR No. 2-98, as amended, would one find the Provincial Governor, Mayor, Barangay Captain and the Head of Government Office or the "Official holding the highest position (such as the President, Chief Executive Officer, Governor, General Manager)" in an Agency or GOCC as one of the officials required to deduct, withhold and remit the correct amount of withholding taxes. The CIR, in imposing upon these officials the obligation not found in law nor in the implementing rules, did not merely issue an interpretative rule designed to provide guidelines to the law which it is in charge of enforcing; but instead, supplanted details thereon â€” a power duly vested by law only to respondent Secretary of Finance under Section 244 of the NIRC of 1997, as amended.</p><p> Moreover, respondents' allusion to previous issuances of the Secretary of Finance designating the Governor in provinces, the City Mayor in cities, the Municipal Mayor in municipalities, the Barangay Captain in barangays, and the Head of Office (official holding the highest position) in departments, bureaus, agencies, instrumentalities, government-owned or -controlled corporations, and other government offices, as officers required to deduct and withhold,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> is bereft of legal basis.

Accordingly, the petition for mandamus should be dismissed for being moot and academic.</p><p> As a final point, the Court cannot turn a blind eye to the adverse effects of this Decision on ordinary government employees, including petitioners herein, who relied in good faith on the belief that the appropriate taxes on all the income they receive from their respective employers are withheld and paid. Nor does the Court ignore the situation of the relevant officers of the different departments of government that had believed, in good faith, that there was no need to withhold the taxes due on the compensation received by said ordinary government employees. Thus, as a measure of equity and compassionate social justice, the Court deems it proper to clarify and declare, <i>pro hac vice</i>, that its ruling on the validity of Sections III and IV of the assailed RMO is to be given only prospective effect.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup></p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the Petitions and Petitions-inÂ­ Interventions are <b>PARTIALLY GRANTED</b>. Section VI of Revenue Memorandum Order No. 23-2014 is <b>DECLARED</b> null and void insofar as it names the Governor, City Mayor, Municipal Mayor, Barangay Captain, and Heads of Office in government agencies, government-owned or -controlled corporations, and other government offices, as persons required to withhold and remit withholding taxes.</p><p> Sections III, IV and VII of RMO No. 23-2014 are <b>DECLARED</b> valid inasmuch as they merely mirror the provisions of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended. However, the Court cannot rule on petitioners' claims of exemption from withholding tax on compensation income because these involve issues that are essentially factual or evidentiary in nature, which must be raised in the appropriate administrative and/or judicial proceeding.</p><p> The Court's Decision upholding the validity of Sections III and IV of the assailed RMO is to be applied only prospectively.</p><p> Finally, the Petition for Mandamus in G.R. No. 213446 is hereby <b>DENIED</b> on the ground of mootness.</p><p> <b>SO ORDERED.</b></p><p> <i>Carpio, Velasco, Jr., Leonardo-De Castro, Peralta, Bersamin, Del Castillo, Perlas-Bernabe, Leonen, Martires, Tijam, Reyes, Jr.</i>, and <i>Gesmundo, JJ</i>., concur. <i><br> Jardeleza, J.</i>, no part prior OSG action. <br></p><br><p>
