Considering that the loan agreements spanned a long period of time, it maintains that when the loans matured, the value of the securities would have greatly diminished, making the loans effectively unsecured. Furthermore, it asserts that the law prohibits future properties from becoming the object of contracts of mortgage, inasmuch as there was no way to validly appraise them when Pioneer Glass' loan application was processed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>Petitioner claims that the question of whether or not Development Bank exercised sound business judgment in line with acceptable banking practices is ultimately factual in nature and should have been threshed out before a trial court. It asserts that public respondent Office of the Ombudsman should not have prematurely ruled on such matter and used it as one of its bases for denying the complaint.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Petitioner underscores that the Committee, which had banking experts for its members, found that numerous transactions between Development Bank and Pioneer Glass had all the traits of behest loans.

There is no showing that the DBP Board of Governors did not exercise sound business judgment in approving the loans, or that the approval was contrary to acceptable banking practices at that time. No manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence can, therefore, be attributed to private respondents in approving the loans.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[126]</sup></blockquote><br><br>Finally, it cannot be inferred that the loan was undercollateralized or that a grossly disadvantageous contract to the government in violation of Section 3(g) of Republic Act No. 3019 was entered into. Development Bank's total exposure of P63,202,884.44<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[127]</sup> was secured by the following: personal and real properties amounting to P46,822,362.00; assignment to Development Bank of sales contracts worth P13,413,000.00; personal undertakings by members of the Hofileña and Yaptinchay families and other Pioneer Glass stockholders; and the assignment to Development Bank of Luis' mining claims.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[128]</sup> Clearly, the loans were suitably secured when they were taken out.<br><br>Section 3, paragraphs (e) and (g) of Republic Act No. 3019 should not be interpreted in such a way that they will prevent Development Bank, through its managers, to take reasonable risks in relation to its business. Profit, which will redound to the benefit of the public interests owning Development Bank, will not be realized if our laws are read constraining the exercise of sound business discretion.<br><br>Thus, Section 3(e) requires "manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence" and the element of arbitrariness and malice in taking risks must be palpable. Likewise, there must be a showing of "undue injury" to the government. Section 3(g), on the other hand, requires a showing of a "contract or transaction manifestly and grossly disadvantageous to the [government]."<br><br>Definitely, this means that it must not only be proven that Development Bank suffered business losses but that these losses, in the ordinary course of business and with the exercise of sound judgment, were inevitably unavoidable. Public respondent's findings did not transgress these requirements.
