				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">An employee in the private sector who did not expressly agree to the terms of an early retirement plan cannot be separated from the service before he reaches the age of 65 years. The employer who retires the employee prematurely is guilty of illegal dismissal, and is liable to pay his backwages and to reinstate him without loss of seniority and other benefits, unless the employee has meanwhile reached the mandatory retirement age under the Labor Code, in which case he is entitled to separation pay pursuant to the terms of the plan, with legal interest on the backwages and separation pay reckoned from the finality of the decision.<br><br><center><b>The Case</b><br></center><br>The petitioner seeks the review and reversal of the adverse decision promulgated on August 31, 2012,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> whereby the Court of Appeals (CA) upheld the ruling of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) dated June 21, 2010 affirming the dismissal of his complaint for illegal dismissal by the Labor Arbiter.<br><br><center><b>Antecedents</b><br></center><br>The CA summarized the factual antecedents as follows:<br><blockquote>On 1 June 2001, petitioner Alfredo F. Laya, Jr. was hired by respondent Philippine Veterans Bank as its Chief Legal Counsel with a rank of Vice President. Among others, the terms and conditions of his appointment are as follows; (sic)<br><blockquote>"3. As a Senior Officer of the Bank, you are entitled to the following executive ben[e]fits:<br><ul><li>Car Plan limit of P700,000.00, without equity on your part; a gasoline subsidy of 300 liters per month and subject further to The Car Plan Policy of the Bank.<br><br></li><li>Membership in a professional organization in relation to your profession and/or assigned functions in the Bank.<br><br></li><li>Membership in the Provident Fund Program/Retirement Program.<br><br></li><li>Entitlement to any and all other basic and fringe benefits enjoyed by the officers; core of the Bank relative to Insurance covers, Healthcare Insurance, vacation and sick leaves, among others."<br></li></ul></blockquote>On the other hand, private respondent has its Retirement Plan Rules and Regulations which provides among others, as follows:<br><blockquote><center>ARTICLE IV <br><br>RETIREMENT DATES<br></center><br>Section 1. Normal Retirement. The normal retirement date of a Member shall be the first day of the month coincident with or next following his attainment of age 60.<br><br>Section 2. Early Retirement.

Late Retirement. A Member may, with the approval of the Board of Directors, extend his service beyond his normal retirement date but not beyond age 65.

As this Honorable Court observed in <u><i>Philippine Veterans Bank Employees Union-NUBE vs. Philippine Veterans Bank</i></u> - <br><blockquote><i>These stockholdings</i> (of the veterans, widows, orphans or compulsory heirs) <i>do not enjoy any special immunity over and above shares of stock in any other corporation, which are always subject to the vicissitudes of business. Their value may appreciate or decline or the stocks may become worthless altogether. Like any other property, they do not have a fixed but a fluctuating price. Certainly, the mere acceptance of these shares of stock by the petitioners did not create any legal assurance from the Government that their original value would be preserved and that the owners could not be deprived of such property under any circumstance no matter how justified.</i><br></blockquote>Secondly, the obvious legislative intent is "<i>to give meaning and realization to the constitutional mandate to provide immediate and adequate care, benefits and other forms of assistance to war veterans and veterans of military campaigns, their surviving spouses and orphans</i>" Article XVI, Section 7 of the Constitution states:<br><blockquote><i>Section 7. The State shall provide immediate and adequate care, benefits and other forms of assistance to war veterans and veterans of military campaigns, their surviving spouses and orphans. Funds shall be provided therefor and due consideration shall be given them in the disposition of agricultural lands of the public domain and, in appropriate cases, in the utilization of natural resources.</i><br></blockquote>The creation of Veterans Bank through Republic Act Nos. 3518 and 7169 should therefore be taken in conjunction and harmonized with Section 16, Article XII of the Constitution. The predilection of the said Republic Acts towards the welfare of the veterans, their widows, orphans or compulsory heirs is supported by no less than a constitutional provision. That Republic Act Nos. 3518 and 7169 do not fall within the proscription against the creation of private corporations is readily apparent from the fact that <u>in both laws, the intendment of the legislature is that Veterans Bank will eventually be operated, managed and exist under the general laws, i.e., Corporation Code and General Banking Act</u>. The mere circumstance that the charter was granted directly by Congress does not signify that only Congress can modify or abrogate it by another enactment.<br><br>Thirdly, the following mandate of Section 3 of Republic Act No. 7169 had been accomplished:<br><blockquote>"<i>The operations and changes in the capital structure of the Veterans Bank, as well as other amendments to its articles of incorporation and by-laws as prescribed under Republic Act No. 3518, shall be in accordance with the Corporation Code, the General Banking Act, and other related laws.</i>"<br></blockquote>Pursuant hereto, the Bank had registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under its certificate of incorporation/registration number 24681. It has its articles of incorporation and by-laws separate and distinct from the provisions of Republic Act Nos. 3518 and 7169. The manner by which the Bank's Board of Directors is to be organized and the Officers to be elected or appointed are stated in the by-laws. The latest Definitive Information Sheet of the Bank indicates that as of April 30, 2014, the total number of shareholders of record (common and preferred) is 383,852. There had been 25,303,869 common shares and 3,611,556 preferred shares issued, none of which belong to the government. It is thus operating under and by virtue of the Corporation Code and the General Banking Act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br></blockquote>Through its comment, the OSG presents an opinion favorable to the position of the petitioner, opining upon the authority of <i>Boy Scouts of the Philippines v. Commission on Audit</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> and Article 44 of the <i>Civil Code</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> that PVB is a public corporation created in the public interest, and a government instrumentality with juridical personality;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> hence, the law governing the petitioner's compulsory retirement age was Republic Act No. 8291, and the compulsory retirement age for him should be 65 years.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br><center><b>Issues</b><br></center><br>The following procedural and substantive issues are to be considered and resolved, namely: (1) whether or not the Court could accept the petitioner's second motion for reconsideration; (2) whether PVB is a private entity or a public instrumentality; and (3) whether the petitioner was validly retired by PVB at age 60.<br><br><center><b>Ruling of the Court</b><br></center><br>In light of pertinent laws and relevant jurisprudence, the Court has ascertained, after going over the parties' arguments and the records of the case, that the reconsideration of the Court's resolutions promulgated on April 8, 2013 and August 28, 2013, and the lifting of the entry of judgment made herein are in order; and that the appeal by the petitioner should be given due course.<br><br><center><b>1.<br>The Court <i>En Banc</i> properly accepted the petitioner's second motion for reconsideration.</b><br></center><br>As a general rule, second and subsequent motions for reconsideration are forbidden.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Nevertheless, there are situations in which exceptional circumstances warrant allowing such motions for reconsideration, and for that reason the Court has recognized several exceptions to the general rule. We have extensively expounded on the exceptions in <i>McBurnie v. Ganzon</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> where we observed:<br><blockquote>At the outset, the Court emphasizes that second and subsequent motions for reconsideration are, as a general rule, prohibited. Section 2, Rule 52 of the Rules of Court provides that "[n]o second motion for reconsideration of a judgment or final resolution by the same party shall be entertained." The rule rests on the basic tenet of immutability of judgments. "At some point, a decision becomes final and executory and, consequently, all litigations must come to an end."<br><br>The general rule, however, against second and subsequent motions for reconsideration admits of settled exceptions. For one, the present Internal Rules of the Supreme Court, particularly Section 3, Rule 15 thereof, provides:<br><blockquote><b>Sec. 3. <i>Second motion for reconsideration</i>. </b>- The Court shall not entertain a second motion for reconsideration, and <b>any exception to this rule can only be granted in the higher interest of justice</b> by the Court <i>en banc</i> upon a vote of at least two-thirds of its actual membership. There is reconsideration "in the higher interest of justice" <b>when the assailed decision is not only legally erroneous, but is likewise patently unjust and potentially capable of causing unwarranted and irremediable injury or damage to the parties</b>. A second motion for reconsideration can only be entertained before the ruling sought to be reconsidered becomes final by operation of law or by the Court's declaration.<br><br>x x x x<br></blockquote><b>In a line of cases, the Court has then entertained and granted second motions for reconsideration "in the higher interest of substantial justice,"</b> as allowed under the Internal Rules when the assailed decision is "legally erroneous," "patently unjust" and "potentially capable of causing unwarranted and irremediable injury or damage to the parties." In <i>Tirazona v. Philippine EDS Techno-Service, Inc. (PET, Inc.)</i>, we also explained that a second motion for reconsideration may be allowed in instances of "extraordinarily persuasive reasons and only after an express leave shall have been obtained." In <i>Apo Fruits Corporation v. Land Bank of the Philippines</i> we allowed a second motion for reconsideration as the issue involved therein was a matter of public interest, as it pertained to the proper application of a basic constitutionally ­ guaranteed right in the government's implementation of its agrarian reform program. In <i>San Miguel Corporation v. NLRC</i>, the Court set aside the decisions of the LA and the NLRC that favored claimants-security guards upon the Court's review of San Miguel Corporation's second motion for reconsideration. In <i>Vir-Jen Shipping and Marine Services, Inc. v. NLRC, et al.</i>, the Court <i>en banc</i> reversed on a third motion for reconsideration the ruling of the Court's Division on therein private respondents' claim for wages and monetary benefits.<br><br><b>It is also recognized that in some instances, the prudent action towards a just resolution of a case is for the Court to suspend rules of procedure, for "the power of this Court to suspend its own rules or to except a particular case from its operations whenever the purposes of justice require it, cannot be questioned."</b> In <i>De Guzman v. Sandiganbayan</i>, the Court, thus, explained:<br><blockquote>[T]he rules of procedure should be viewed as mere tools designed to facilitate the attainment of justice. Their strict and rigid application, which would result in technicalities that tend to frustrate rather than promote substantial justice, must always be avoided. Even the Rules of Court envision this liberality. This power to suspend or even disregard the rules can be so pervasive and encompassing so as to alter even that which this Court itself has already declared to be final, as we are now compelled to do in this case x x x.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The Rules of Court was conceived and promulgated to set forth guidelines in the dispensation of justice but not to bind and chain the hand that dispenses it, for otherwise, courts will be mere slaves to or robots of technical rules, shorn of judicial discretion. That is precisely why courts in rendering real justice have always been, as they in fact ought to be, conscientiously guided by the norm that when on the balance, technicalities take a backseat against substantive rights, and not the other way around. Truly then, technicalities, in the appropriate language of Justice Makalintal, "<i>should give way to the realities of the situation</i>." x x x.<br></blockquote>Consistent with the foregoing precepts, the Court has then reconsidered even decisions that have attained finality, finding it more appropriate to lift entries of judgments already made in these cases. In <i>Navarro v. Executive Secretary</i>, we reiterated the pronouncement in <i>De Guzman</i> that the power to suspend or even disregard rules of procedure can be so pervasive and compelling as to alter even that which this Court itself has already declared final. The Court then recalled in <i>Navarro</i> an entry of judgment after it had determined the validity and constitutionality of Republic Act No. 9355, explaining that:<br><blockquote>Verily, the Court had, on several occasions, sanctioned the recall of entries of judgment in light of attendant extraordinary circumstances. The power to suspend or even disregard rules of procedure can be so pervasive and compelling as to alter even that which this Court itself had already declared final. In this case, the compelling concern is not only to afford the movants-intervenors the right to be heard since they would be adversely affected by the judgment in this case despite not being original parties thereto, but also to arrive at the correct interpretation of the provisions of the [Local Government Code (LGC)] with respect to the creation of local government units. x x x.<br></blockquote>In <i>Muñoz v. CA</i>, the Court resolved to recall an entry of judgment to prevent a miscarriage of justice. This justification was likewise applied in <i>Tan Tiac Chiang v. Hon. Cosico</i>, wherein the Court held that:<br><blockquote>The recall of entries of judgments, albeit rare, is not a novelty. In <i>Muñoz v. CA</i>, where the case was elevated to this Court and a first and <i>second</i> motion for reconsideration had been denied with <i>finality</i>, the Court, in the interest of substantial justice, recalled the Entry of Judgment as well as the letter of transmittal of the records to the Court of Appeals.<br></blockquote>In <i>Barnes v. Judge Padilla</i>, we ruled:<br><blockquote>[A] final and executory judgment can no longer be attacked by any of the parties or be modified, directly or indirectly, even by the highest court of the land.<br><br>However, this Court has relaxed this rule in order to serve substantial justice considering (a) matters of life, liberty, honor or property, (b) the existence of special or compelling circumstances, (c) the merits of the case, (d) a cause not entirely attributable to the fault or negligence of the party favored by the suspension of the rules, (e) a lack of any showing that the review sought is merely frivolous and dilatory, and (f) the other party will not be unjustly prejudiced thereby. (Citations omitted; underscoring supplied)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br></blockquote></blockquote>In short, the Court may entertain second and subsequent motions for reconsideration when the assailed decision is legally erroneous, patently unjust and potentially capable of causing unwarranted and irremediable injury or damage to the parties. Under these circumstances, even final and executory judgments may be set aside because of the existence of compelling reasons.<br><br>It is notable that the retirement program in question herein was established solely by PVB as the employer. Although PVB could validly impose a retirement age lower than 65 years for as long as it did so with the employees' consent,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> the consent must be explicit, voluntary, free, and uncompelled.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> In dismissing the petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>, the Court's First Division inadvertently overlooked that the law required the employees' consent to be express and voluntary in order for them to be bound by the retirement program providing for a retirement age earlier than the age of 65 years. Hence, the Court deems it proper to render a fair adjudication on the merits of the appeal upon the petitioner's second motion for reconsideration. Furthermore, allowing this case to be reviewed on its merits furnishes the Court with the opportunity to re-examine the case in order to ascertain whether or not the dismissal produced results patently unjust to the petitioner. These reasons do justify treating this case as an exception to the general rule on immutability of judgments.<br><br><center><b>2.<br>The pronouncement of the Court in <i>Philippine Veterans Bank Employees Union-NUBE v. The Philippine Veterans Bank</i> is still doctrinal on the status of the Philippine Veterans Bank as a private, not a government, entity</b><br></center><br>In <i>Philippine Veterans Bank Employees Union-NUBE v. The Philippine Veterans Bank</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> we pertinently pronounced:<br><blockquote>Coming now to the ownership of the Bank, we find it is not a government bank, as claimed by the petitioners. The fact is that under Section 3(b) of its charter, while 51% of the capital stock of the Bank was initially fully subscribed by the Republic of the Philippines for and in behalf of the veterans, their widows, orphans or compulsory heirs, the corresponding shares of stock were to be turned over within 5 years from the organization by the Bank to the said beneficiaries who would thereafter have the right to vote such common shares. The balance of about 49% was to be divided into preferred shares which would be opened for subscription by any recognized veteran, widow, orphans or compulsory heirs of said veteran at the rate of one preferred share per veteran, on the condition that in case of failure of any particular veteran to subscribe for any preferred share of stock so offered to him within thirty (30) days from the date of receipt of notice, said share of stock shall be available for subscription to other veterans in accordance with such rules or regulations as may be promulgated by the Board of Directors. Moreover, under Sec. 6(a), the affairs of the Bank are managed by a board of directors composed of eleven members, three of whom are <i>ex officio</i> members, with the other eight being elected annually by the stockholders in the manner prescribed by the Corporation Law. Significantly, Sec. 28 also provides as follows:<br><blockquote>Sec. 28. <i>Articles of incorporation</i>. - This Act, upon its approval, shall be deemed and accepted to all legal intents and purposes as the statutory articles of incorporation or Charter of the Philippine Veterans' Bank; and that, notwithstanding the provisions of any existing law to the contrary, said Bank shall be deemed registered and duly authorized to do business and operate as a commercial bank as of the date of approval of this Act.<br></blockquote><b>This point is important because the Constitution provides in its Article IX-B, Section 2(1) that "the Civil Service embraces all branches, subdivisions, instrumentalities, and agencies of the Government, including government-owned or controlled corporations with original charters." As the Bank is not owned or controlled by the Government although it does have an original charter in the form of R.A. No. 3518, it clearly does not fall under the Civil Service and should be regarded as an ordinary commercial corporation. Section 28 of the said law so provides. The consequence is that the relations of the Bank with its employees should be governed by the labor laws, under which in fact they have already been paid some of their claims.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> (Bold underscoring supplied for emphasis)<br></blockquote>Anent whether PVB was a government or a private entity, therefore, we declare that it is the latter. The foregoing jurisprudential pronouncement remains to be good law, and should be doctrinal and controlling.<br><br>We also note that Congress enacted Republic Act No. 7169,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> whereby it acknowledged the Filipino veterans of World War II as the owners of PVB, but their ownership had not been fully realized despite the implementation of Republic Act No. 3518.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> As one of the mechanisms to rehabilitate PVB, Congress saw fit to modify PVB's operations, capital structure, articles of incorporation and by-laws through the enactment of Republic Act No. 7169.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> By restoring PVB <i>as envisioned</i> by Republic Act No. 3518,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> and by providing that the creation of the PVB would be in accord with the <i>Corporation Code</i>, the <i>General Banking Act</i>, and other related laws, Congress undeniably bestowed upon the PVB the personality of a <i>private commercial bank</i> through Republic Act No. 7169. In that regard, Section 8 of Republic Act No. 7169 directed the Filipino veterans to raise P750,000,000.00 in total unimpaired capital accounts, prior to PVB's reopening, but excused the Government from making any new capital infusion, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>Section 8. Transitory Provisions. - Without requiring new capital infusion either from the Government or from outside investigators, the Filipino veterans of World War II who are real owners-stockholders of the Veterans Bank shall cause the said bank to have at least Seven hundred fifty million pesos (P750,000,000.00) in total unimpaired capital accom1ts prior to reopening pursuant to this Act as a commercial bank.<br><br>It is hereby provided that the Board of Trustees of the Veterans of World War II (BTVWW II) created under Republic Act No. 3518 is hereby designated as trustee of all issued but undelivered shares of stock.<br></blockquote>With the Government having no more stake in PVB, there is no justification for the insistence of the petitioner that PVB "is a public corporation masquerading as a private corporation."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br><center><b>3.<br>Petitioner Alfredo Laya was not validly retired at age 60</b><br></center><br>Notwithstanding the rejection of the petitioner's insistence that PVB was a public corporation, we find and declare that the petitioner was not validly retired at age 60.<br><br>Before going further, we clarify that the CA, in the exercise of its <i>certiorari</i> jurisdiction, is limited to determining whether or not the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. The remedy is the special civil action for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 of the <i>Rules of Court</i> brought in the CA, and once the CA decides the case the party thereby aggrieved may appeal the decision of the CA by petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 45 of the <i>Rules of Court</i>.<br><br>However, rigidly limiting the authority of the CA to the determination of grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of the NLRC does not fully conform with prevailing case law, particularly <i>St. Martin Funeral Home v. NLRC</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> where we firmly observed that because of the "growing number of labor cases being elevated to this Court which, not being a trier of fact, has at times been constrained to remand the case to the NLRC for resolution of unclear or ambiguous factual findings"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> the CA could more properly address petitions for <i>certiorari</i> brought against the NLRC. Conformably with such observation made in <i>St. Martin Funeral Homes</i>, we have then later on clarified that the CA, in its exercise of its <i>certiorari</i> jurisdiction, can review the factual findings or even the legal conclusions of the NLRC,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>In <i>St. Martin Funeral Home[s] v. NLRC</i>, it was held that the special civil action of <i>certiorari</i> is the mode of judicial review of the decisions of the NLRC either by this Court and the Court of Appeals, although the latter court is the appropriate forum for seeking the relief desired "in strict observance of the doctrine on the hierarchy of courts" and that, in the exercise of its power, the Court of Appeals can review the factual findings or the legal conclusions of the NLRC. The contrary rule in <i>Jamer</i> was thus overruled.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br></blockquote>There is now no dispute that the CA can make a determination whether the factual findings by the NLRC or the Labor Arbiter were based on the evidence and in accord with pertinent laws and jurisprudence.<br><br>The significance of this clarification is that whenever the decision of the CA in a labor case is appealed by petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>, the Court can competently delve into the propriety of the factual review not only by the CA but also by the NLRC. Such ability is still in pursuance to the exercise of our review jurisdiction over administrative findings of fact that we have discoursed on in several rulings, including <i>Aklan Electric Coooperative, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Commission</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> where we have pointed out:<br><blockquote>While administrative findings of fact are accorded great respect, and even finality when supported by substantial evidence, nevertheless, when it can be shown that administrative bodies grossly misappreciated evidence of such nature as to compel a contrary conclusion, this Court had not hesitated to reverse their factual findings. Factual findings of administrative agencies are not infallible and will be set aside when they fail the test of arbitrariness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br></blockquote>The review of the findings of the CA becomes more compelling herein, inasmuch as it appears that the CA did not appreciate the fact that the retirement plan was not the sole prerogative of the employer, and that the petitioner was automatically made a member of the plan. Upon reviewing the resolution by the NLRC, the CA simply concluded that the petitioner's acceptance of the employment offer had carried with it his acquiescence, which implied his knowledge of the plan, thus:<br><blockquote>This Court finds petitioner's argument to be misplaced. It must be stressed that when petitioner was appointed as Chief Legal Officer on 01 June 2001 among the terms and conditions of his employment is the membership in the Provident Fund Program/Retirement Program. Worthy to note that when petitioner accepted his appointment as Chief Legal Officer, he likewise signified his conformity with the provisions of the Retirement Program considering that the same has already been in existence and effective since 1 January 1996, <i>i.e.</i> prior to his appointment. As such, this Court is not convinced that petitioner was not aware of the private respondent's retirement program.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br></blockquote>The retirement of employees in the private sector is governed by Article 287 of the <i>Labor Code</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><blockquote>Art. 287. Retirement. <b>Any employee may be retired upon reaching the retirement age established in the collective bargaining agreement or other applicable employment contract.</b><br><br>In case of retirement, the employee shall be entitled to receive such retirement benefits as he may have earned under existing laws and any collective bargaining agreement and other agreements: <i>Provided</i>, however, That an employee's retirement benefits under any collective bargaining and other agreements shall not be less than those provided therein.<br><br><b>In the absence of a retirement plan or agreement providing for retirement benefits of employees in the establishment, an employee upon reaching the age of sixty (60) years or more, but not beyond sixty-five (65) years which is hereby declared the compulsory retirement age,</b> who has served at least five (5) years in the said establishment, may retire and shall be entitled to retirement pay x x x x.<br></blockquote>Under the provision, the employers and employees may agree to fix the retirement age for the latter, and to embody their agreement in either their collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) or their employment contracts. Retirement plans allowing employers to retire employees who have not yet reached the compulsory retirement age of 65 years are not <i>per se</i> repugnant to the constitutional guaranty of security of tenure, provided that the retirement benefits are not lower than those prescribed by law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>The CA concluded that the petitioner had agreed to be bound by the retirement plan of PVB when he accepted the letter of appointment as its Chief Legal Counsel.<br><br>We disagree with the conclusion. We declare that based on the clear circumstances herein the CA erred in so concluding.<br><br>The petitioner's letter of appointment pertinently stated:<br><blockquote>3. As a Senior Officer of the Bank, you are entitled to the following executive benefits:<br><ul><li>Car Plan limit of P700,000.00, without equity on your part; a gasoline subsidy of 300 liters per month and subject further to The Car Plan Policy of the Bank.<br><br></li><li>Membership in a professional organization in relation to your profession and/or assigned functions in the Bank.<br><br></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Membership in the Provident Fund Program/Retirement Program.</span><br><br></li><li>Entitlement to any and all other basic and fringe benefits enjoyed by the officers; core of the Bank relative to Insurance covers, Healthcare Insurance, vacation and sick leaves, among others.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br></li></ul></blockquote>Obviously, the mere mention of the retirement plan in the letter of appointment did not sufficiently inform the petitioner of the contents or details of the retirement program. To construe from the petitioner's acceptance of his appointment that he had acquiesced to be retired earlier than the compulsory age of 65 years would, therefore, not be warranted. This is because retirement should be the result of the bilateral act of both the employer and the employee based on their voluntary agreement that the employee agrees to sever his employment upon reaching a certain age.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>That the petitioner might be well aware of the existence of the retirement program at the time of his engagement did not suffice. His implied knowledge, regardless of duration, did not equate to the voluntary acceptance required by law in granting an early retirement age option to the employee. The law demanded more than a passive acquiescence on the part of the employee, considering that his early retirement age option involved conceding the constitutional right to security of tenure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>In <i>Cercado v. Uniprom, Inc.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> we have underscored the character of the employee's consent in agreeing to the early retirement policy of the employer, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>Acceptance by the employees of an early retirement age option must be <b>explicit, voluntary, free, and uncompelled</b>. While an employer may unilaterally retire an employee earlier than the legally permissible ages under the Labor Code, this prerogative must be exercised pursuant to a mutually instituted early retirement plan. In other words, only the implementation and execution of the option may be unilateral, but not the adoption and institution of the retirement plan containing such option. For the option to be valid, the retirement plan containing it must be voluntarily assented to by the employees or at least by a majority of them through a bargaining representative.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> (Bold emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Furthermore, the petitioner's membership in the retirement plan could not be justifiably attributed to his signing of the letter of appointment that only listed the minimum benefits provided to PVB's employees. Indeed, in <i>Cercado</i>, we have declared that the employee's consent to the retirement plan that came into being two years after the hiring could not be inferred from her signature on the personnel action forms accepting the terms of her job description, and compliance with the company policies, rules and regulations, to wit:<br><blockquote><b>We also cannot subscribe to respondent's submission that petitioner's consent to the retirement plan may be inferred from her signature in the personnel action forms containing the phrase: "<i>Employee hereby expressly acknowledges receipt of and undertakes to abide by tile provisions of his/her Job Description, Company Code of Conduct and such other policies, guidelines, rules and regulations the company may prescribe</i>."<br><br>It should be noted that the personnel action forms relate to the increase in petitioner's salary at various periodic intervals. To conclude that her acceptance of the salary increases was also, simultaneously, a concurrence to the retirement plan would be tantamount to compelling her to agree to the latter. Moreover, voluntary and equivocal acceptance by an employee of an early retirement age option in a retirement plan necessarily connotes that her consent specifically refers to the plan or that she has at least read the same when she affixed her conformity thereto.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br></blockquote>A perusal of PVB's retirement plan shows that under its Article III all the regular employees of PVB were automatically admitted into membership, thus:<br><blockquote><center>ARTICLE III<br>MEMBERSHIP IN THE PLAN<br></center><br>Section 1. <b>Eligibility at Effective Date</b>. Any Employee of the Bank as of January 1, 1996 shall automatically be a Member of the Plan as of such date.<br><br>Section 2. <b>Eligibility after Effective Date. Any person who becomes an Employee after January 1, 1996 shall automatically become a Member of the Plan on the date he becomes a regular permanent Employee, provided he is less than 55 years old as of such date.</b><br><br>Section 3. <b>Continuation/Termination of Membership.</b> Membership in the Plan shall be concurrent with employment with the Bank, and shall cease automatically upon termination of the Member's service with the Bank for any reason whatsoever.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> (Bold underscoring supplied for emphasis)<br></blockquote>Having thus automatically become a member of the retirement plan through his acceptance of employment as Chief Legal Officer of PVB,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> the petitioner could not withdraw from the plan except upon his termination from employment.<br><br>It is also notable that the retirement plan had been in existence since January 1, 1996,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> or more than five years prior to the petitioner's employment by PVB. The plan was established solely by the PVB,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> and approved by its president.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> As such, the plan was in the nature of a contract of adhesion,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> in respect to which the petitioner was reduced to mere submission by accepting his employment, and automatically became a member of the plan. With the plan being a contract of adhesion, to consider him to have voluntarily and freely given his consent to the terms thereof as to warrant his being compulsorily retired at the age of 60 years is factually unwarranted.<br><br>In view of the foregoing, the Court disagrees with the view tendered by Justice Leonen to the effect that the petitioner, because of his legal expertise and educational attainment, could not now validly claim that he was not informed of the provisions of the retirement program. The pertinent rule on retirement plans does not presume consent or acquiescence from the high educational attainment or legal knowledge of the employee. In fact, the rule provides that the acquiescence by the employee cannot be lightly inferred from his acceptance of employment.<br><br>Moreover, it was incumbent upon PVB to prove that the petitioner had been fully apprised of the terms of the retirement program at the time of his acceptance of the offer of employment. PVB did not discharge its burden, for the petitioner's appointment letter apparently enumerated only the minimum benefits that he would enjoy during his employment by PVB, and contained no indication of PVB having given him a copy of the program itself in order to fully apprise him of the contents and details thereof. Nonetheless, even assuming that he subsequently obtained information about the program in the course of his employment, he still could not opt to simply withdraw from the program due to his membership therein being automatic for the regular employees of PVB.<br><br>To stress, company retirement plans must not only comply with the standards set by the prevailing labor laws but must also be accepted by the employees as commensurate to their faithful services to the employer within the requisite period.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> Although the employer could be free to impose a retirement age lower than 65 years for as long its employees consented,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> the retirement of the employee whose intent to retire was not clearly established, or whose retirement was involuntary is to be treated as a discharge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup><br><br>With the petitioner having been thus dismissed pursuant to the retirement provision that he had not knowingly and voluntarily agreed to, PVB was guilty of illegal dismissal as to him. Being an illegally dismissed employee, he was entitled to the reliefs provided under Article 279<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> of the <i>Labor Code</i>, to wit:<br><blockquote>Article 279. Security of tenure. - In cases of regular employment, the employer shall not terminate the services of an employee except for a just cause or when authorized by this Title. An employee who is unjustly dismissed from work shall be entitled to reinstatement without loss of seniority rights and other privileges and to his full backwages, inclusive of allowances, and to his other benefits or their monetary equivalent computed from the time his compensation was withheld from him up to the time of his actual reinstatement.<br></blockquote>Considering that the petitioner's reinstatement is no longer feasible because of his having meanwhile reached the compulsory retirement age of 65 years by June 11, 2012, he should be granted separation pay. In this regard, retirement benefits and separation pay are not mutually exclusive.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> The basis for computing the separation pay should accord with Section 4,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> Article III of PVB's retirement plan. Hence, his full backwages should be computed from July 18, 2007 - the date when he was illegally dismissed - until his compulsory retirement age of 65 years on June 11, 2012. Such backwages shall all be subject to legal interest of 12% <i>per annum</i> from July 18, 2007 until June 30, 2013, and then to legal interest of 6% interest <i>per annum</i> from July 1, 2013 until full satisfaction, conformably with <i>Nacar v.

Thus, the right to security of tenure is a <b>constitutional right</b> of an employee.<br><br>This Court has explained that "[s]ecurity of tenure is a right of paramount value. Precisely, it is given specific recognition and guarantee by the Constitution no less. The State shall afford protection to labor and 'shall assure the rights of workers to x x x security of tenure.'"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> This Court has explained further: "It stands to reason that a right so highly ranked as security of tenure should not lightly be denied on so nebulous a basis as mere speculation."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>The well-recognized rule is that any waiver of a <b>constitutional right</b> must be <b>clear, categorical, knowing, and intelligent</b>. Thus, in a long line of cases, this Court has ruled: "The relinquishment of a constitutional right has to be laid out convincingly. <b>Such waiver must be clear, categorical, knowing, and intelligent</b>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>Under Article 287 of the Labor Code, the "compulsory retirement age" is 65 years, "in the absence of a retirement plan or agreement providing for retirement benefits of employees." While Philippine Veterans Bank (PVB) has a retirement plan making 60 years the compulsory retirement age, <b>this specific fact was not made known to petitioner at the time PVB handed him his appointment letter on 1 June 2001</b>. The appointment letter mentioned in one line a retirement plan but the retirement plan itself was not attached to the appointment letter or given to petitioner. <b>Nothing in the appointment letter indicated, expressly or impliedly, that the compulsory retirement age was 60 years. Anyone who received and read the appointment letter would not have known that the compulsory retirement age was 60 years.</b> In short, petitioner could not have waived knowingly the compulsory retirement age of 65 years because <b>this fact was not made known to him</b> at the time of his appointment. Any such waiver was <b>not made knowingly</b>.<br><br>The fact that petitioner is a lawyer cannot give rise to the presumption that he impliedly waived his constitutional right to security of tenure when he accepted the appointment letter. This Court has ruled:<br><blockquote>But a waiver by implication cannot be presumed. There must be clear and convincing evidence of an <b>actual intention to relinquish the right to constitute a waiver of a constitutional right</b>. There must be proof of the following: (a) that the right exists; (b) that the person involved had knowledge, either actual or constructive, of the existence of such right; and, (c) <b>that the said person had an actual intention to relinquish the right</b>. The waiver must be made voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently. The Court indulges every reasonable presumption against any waiver of fundamental constitutional rights.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>There is no showing here that petitioner has an actual intention to waive his constitutional right to security of tenure. <b>Such intention to waive a fundamental constitutional right cannot be presumed but must be actually shown and established.</b> The bar against any implied waiver is very high because this Court "indulges [in] every reasonable presumption against any waiver of fundamental constitutional rights." PVB has failed to surmount that high bar.<br><br>Even in determining whether the appointment of an employee is permanent or probationary, actual disclosure of the performance standards <b>at the time of the employment</b> is required and cannot be presumed. This Court has explained that a probationary employee shall be deemed a regular employee <b>where no standards are made known to him at the time of his engagement</b>, unless the job is self-descriptive, like maid, cook, driver, or messenger.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Thus, to comply with the constitutional mandate that the "<b>State shall afford full protection to labor</b>," disclosure to the employee <b>at the time of appointment</b> is necessary to bind the employee. "<b>Full protection</b>" means implied waivers in derogation of an employee's constitutional or statutory right cannot be presumed.<br><br>Accordingly, I vote to <b>GRANT</b> the petition.<br><br><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="noshade" align="LEFT"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>City Service Corp.

He was free to reject the offer of the Bank. Part of the provisions of the letter of appointment is his membership to the retirement program of Respondent Philippine Veterans Bank, which has been in effect since January 1, 1996, or even before Petitioner Laya's employment. As such, at the time he agreed to be employed by the Bank, he was aware that a retirement program is in existence and that he is a member of such program.

In that case, the Court ruled that the Cercado did not voluntarily agree to the retirement plan and so, was not bound by the early retirement clause. Moreover, in that case, the retirement plan was not in existence at the time Cercado was employed in 1978. Also, there was no Collective Bargaining Agreement, or any other contract, including one for employment, which indicated the compulsory retirement age for employees to be 60 years old. Instead, the retirement plan was codified in 1980, or two years after Cercado had already been employed, and without consultation with the employees.<br><br>In this case, the retirement program had long been in existence and in writing even before Petitioner Laya was employed by the Respondent Philippine Veterans Bank. Furthermore, he was informed of the existence of the retirement program when he signed his employment contract - his contract specified that he would automatically become a member of the retirement program upon being hired.<br><br>In <i>Banco De Oro Unibank, Inc. v. Guillermo C. Sagaysay</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> the Court ruled that the employee was deemed to have agreed to all the rules and regulations of the company upon accepting the employment offer: <br><blockquote><b>[B]y accepting the employment offer of BDO, Sagaysay was deemed to have assented to all existing rules, regulations and policy of the bank, including the retirement plan.</b> Likewise, he consented to the CBA between BDO and the National Union of Bank Employees Banco De Oro Chapter. Section 2 of Article XVII of the CBA provides that "[t]he Bank shall continue to grant retirement/gratuity pay . . . ." Notably, both the retirement plan and the CBA <b>recognize that the bank has a continued and existing practice of granting the retirement pay to its employees</b>.<br><br><i>Third</i>, on June 1, 2009, BDO issued a memorandum regarding the implementation of its retirement program, reiterating that the normal retirement date was the first day of the month following the employee's sixtieth (60<sup>th</sup>) birthday. Similar to the case of <i>Obusan</i>, the memorandum was addressed to <b>all employees and officers</b>. By that time, Sagaysay was already an employee and he did not deny being informed of such memorandum.<br><br><b>For four years, from the time he was employed until his retirement, and having actual knowledge of the BDO retirement plan, Sagaysay had every opportunity to question the same, if indeed he knew it would not be beneficial to him. Yet, he did not express his dissent.</b> As observed in <i>Obusan</i>, "[t]his deafening silence eloquently speaks of [his] lack of disagreement with its provisions."<br><br>Lastly, perhaps the most telling detail indicative of Sagaysay's assent to the retirement plan was his e-mails to the bank, dated July 27, 2010 and August 19, 2010. In these communications, <i>albeit</i> having been informed of his upcoming retirement, Sagaysay never opposed the company's compulsory age of retirement. In fact, he recognized that "the time has come that BDO Retirement Program will be implemented to those reaching the age of sixty (60)."<br><br>Glaringly, he even requested that his services be extended, at least until May 16, 2011, so that he could render five (5) years of service. Sagaysay's request reflects the late retirement option where an employee may be allowed by the bank to continue to work on a yearly extension basis beyond his normal retirement date. <b>The late retirement option is embodied in the same retirement plan, of which, ironically, he claimed to be unaware.</b> With such inconsistent stance, the Court can only conclude that Sagaysay was indeed notified and had accepted the provisions of the retirement plan. <b>It was only when his request for late retirement was denied that he suddenly became oblivious to the said plan.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Petitioner Laya is not a weaker party that can claim ignorance of the implications of- what he is signing or agreeing to. As a lawyer, he is considered to be knowledgeable of the legal effects and ramifications of what he is signing or agreeing to.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> This is further emphasized by the position he was employed for: as Chief Legal Counsel. He was hired based on his legal prowess. In addition, as Chief Legal Counsel with a Vice President rank, the information regarding the retirement of employees was at his disposal; he cannot claim that the Retirement Plan Rules and Regulations were belatedly shown to him, and that its provisions should not apply to him. In all his years as an employee of Respondent Philippine Veterans Bank, he did not contest the provisions of the Retirement Plan Rules and Regulations, despite his knowledge that he was a member the Bank's retirement program.<br><br>It must be noted that when he was notified by Respondent Philippine Veterans Bank of his retirement, he requested for an extension of his service for another two (2) years based on the Retirement Plan Rules and Regulations. This shows that he not only was aware of the provisions of the retirement program, but that his retirement was governed by it. It was only upon the rejection of his request for extension did he allege that he was illegally dismissed.<br><br>As an employee with legal expertise, whose educational attainment and professional experience require that he be more prudent in the contracts and agreements he enters into, Petitioner Laya cannot simply allege that he was not informed of the provisions of the retirement program at the time he was employed. Part of the work of a lawyer is to exercise due diligence in the review of documents and contracts presented before him. His membership in the retirement program was clearly indicated in his employment contract, which he is presumed to have read and understood.
