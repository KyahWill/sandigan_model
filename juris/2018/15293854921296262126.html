Ordering the [respondent Joel] and all persons claiming rights under him to immediately vacate the subject property and to peacefully turn over possession of the same to [petitioners]; </p> <p>2. Ordering [respondent Joel] to pay [petitioners] the sum of FIVE THOUSAND PESOS (P5,000.00) per month as reasonable compensation for the continued use and occupation of the premises beginning May 16, 2010 until the line the [respondent Joel] vacates the property; and </p> <p>3.

SP No. 130384. </p><p> For the first time, respondent Joel raised, as an issue the alleged failure of the GSIS to comply with the provisions under Republic Act (RA) No. 6552, otherwise known as the Maceda Law. He alleged that his sister's contract had not been cancelled and that she had not received the cash surrender value of the payments made on the subject property.</p><p> On September 29, 2014, the CA reversed the ruling of the RTC. The CA dismissed the complaint for unlawful detainer for failure of the GSIS to issue a notarized notice of cancellation and to refund the cash surrender value of the payments made on the subject property.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> </p><p>Petitioners moved for reconsideration<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> arguing that the CA erred in allowing respondent Joel to change his theory on appeal. In any case, petitioners attached a copy of the notarized cancellation of the contract<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> from the GSIS to dispute the allegation of respondent Joel. As to the cash surrender value, petitioners alleged that, under the law, it would be released only upon the retirement of respondent Joel's sister. </p><p>On December 1, 2014, the CA issued a Resolution denying petitioners’ Motion for Reconsideration for lack of merit. Hence, petitioners filed the instant Petition for Review on Certiorari, raising the following errors: </p><blockquote> <p align="center"> I.</p> <p> THE HONORABLE [CA] ERRED AND COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION WHEN IT ALLOWED RESPONDENT [JOEL] TO CHANGE HIS THEORY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS PETITION FOR REVIEW AND GRANTED THE SAME, THE CHANGE OF THEORY MADE BY RESPONDENT IS PROHIBITED BY THE RULES OF COURT. </p> <p align="center">II. </p> <p>THE HONORABLE [CA] ERRED AND COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION WHEN IT RULED THAT [RA] NO. 6552 COMMONLY KNOWN AS MACEDA LAW APPLIES TO BOTH PARTIES DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE PROVISIONS OF THE MACEDA LAW APPLIES ONLY TO SELLER AND BUYER OF A REAL ESTATE PROPERT[Y].

This rule affirms that 'courts of justice have no jurisdiction or power to decide a question not in issue.' Thus, a judgment that goes beyond the issues and purports to adjudicate something on which the court did not hear the parties is not only irregular but also extrajudicial and invalid. The legal theory under which the controversy was <i>heard</i> and <i>decided</i> in the dial, court should be the<i> same</i> theory under which the <i>review on appeal</i> is conducted. Otherwise, prejudice will result to the adverse party. We stress that points of law, theories, issues, and arguments not adequately brought to the attention of the lower court will not be ordinarily considered by a reviewing court, inasmuch as they cannot be raised for the first time on appeal. This would be offensive to the basic rules of fair play, justice, and due process.</p> </blockquote> <p> In this case, respondent Joel in his Answer<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> averred: </p><blockquote> <p> 7. The subject property was originally awarded to [respondent's] sister, Beaulah L. Aguillon (Aguillon, for brevity), by the GSIS through a housing loan. Aguilion's monthly loan amortizations were dutifully deducted through her salary and remitted to GSIS from year 1985 to 2000. xxx</p> <p> 8. Since Aguilion's place of work was in Bacolod City, she requested [respondent's] family to stay in the subject property. In 1994, the GSIS informed Aguillon, through defendant, that she was delinquent on her payment of amortizations. To prove payments and reconcile with her records, Aguillon requested GSIS (Manila and Iloilo branches) to furnish her with copies of remittances of amortization. She even went to Manila to request statement of payment/remittance but to no avail. Later on, defendant would do the following up with GSIS Manila regarding the request for issuance of statement of remittance which efforts suffered the same fate as Aguillon. xxx </p> <p>9. Burdened by the continued inaction of GSIS, Aguillon executed a Deed of Transfer of Rights in favor of [respondent] which was approved by the former. [Respondent] then availed of condonation/amnesty of whatever unpaid amortization the former owner of the subject property incurred after paying ten (10%) percent of the computed balance subject to proper computations of the total remittance made by Aguillon. xxx <br></p><p>10. [Respondent] paid the ten (10%) percent down payment and requested anew for the proper computation of the total remittance made by Aguillon in order to determine the correct and proper balance payable. Like the previous ones, GSIS failed to address the concern of [respondent]. xxx</p> <p> 11. On May 16, 2010, [respondent] was shocked when [petitioners] went to his house and informed him that they had bought the subject property from GSIS. </p> <p>12. [Petitioner] has no cause of action against herein [respondent.] [Respondent is entitled to the possession of the subject property as buyer thereof. His failure to pay the amortization was due to the fault of GSIS arising from the latter's continued disregard of the repeated request for computation of the total remittance/amortization made for the purpose of ascertaining the correct and proper balance of the loan. This mess could be attributed to the absence of ledger of the account as noticed by [respondent] or perhaps caused by the complete computerization program GSIS has introduced in its system which bugged down resulting in confusion of its records and its consequent filing of a case against the contractor – IBM.</p> <p> 13. Moreover, the sale made by GSIS in favor of [petitioners] is void. GSIS cannot unilaterally terminate the deed of [conditional] sale without violating due process. Besides, subject property was not mortgage[d] as security for the loan. Even if it was, no foreclosure proceeding was initiated to date.</p> <p>14. Having paid since 1985, Aguillon acquired ownership over the subject property. The effect of the blunder in the computerization program of GSIS should not be tossed to [respondent]. </p> <p>15. Assuming for the sake of argument that the termination of the deed of conditional sale was legal, [petitioners,] did not exhaust administrative remedies. [Petitioner Teresita], a neighbor, acted in bad faith in purchasing [the] subject property from GSIS. She was aware that [the] subject property is owned by [respondent]. On the other hand, GSIS did not act on the offer proposal of [respondent ] to purchase the property.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> In his Pre-Trial Brief,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> respondent Joel raised two issues, to wit: </p><ol><li> Whether x x x [petitioners] are legitimate buyer[s] and legally entitled to the possession of the subject property? <br><br></li><li>Whether x x x [respondent Joel] has superior right over [petitioners] as transferee of the subject property and are entitled to its possession as well as to the compulsory counterclaim?<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> </li></ol> <p> On appeal to the RTC, respondent Joel raised the following issues: </p><p align="center"> I. </p><blockquote> <p> THE LOWER COURT'S FINDING THAT THE [PETITIONERS] ARE BUYERS IN GOOD FAITH IS HIGHLY ERRONEOUS FOR BEING CONTRARY TO ATTENDANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES.</p> <p align="center"> II. </p> <p>THE LOWER COURT REGRETTABLY CLOSED ITS EYES ON THE APPARENT LACK OF DUE PROCESS, WHICH UNJUSTLY DEPRIVED [RESPONDENT JOEL] OF HIS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO PROPERTY.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> From the foregoing, it is apparent that the issue of whether the GSIS complied with the Maceda Law or not was never brought to the attention of the MTC and the RTC. Respondents’ contention that the MTC and the RTC should have taken judicial notice of the Maceda Law is untenable as the issue of compliance with the Maceda Law is a factual matter, which should have been alleged or raised as a defense in the Answer. And since respondent Joel failed to allege such matters in his Answer, there was no reason for the MTC, as well as the RTC, to resolve the issue and apply the Maceda Law.</p><p> Moreover, records show that it was only before the CA that respondent Joel alleged that the GSIS failed to send a notarized notice of cancellation and a refund of the cash surrender value to his sister. The CA, therefore, should not have considered these belated allegations, as these are factual matters, which would require the presentation of additional evidence on the part of petitioners. </p><p> Furthermore, these belated allegations likewise changed the theory of his case, which is not allowed under the Rules as it goes against the basic rules of fair play, justice, and due process. </p><p> All told, the Court finds that the CA gravely erred in resolving the issue of GSIS' compliance with the Maceda Law, as it had no jurisdiction to resolve an issue not raised before the lower courts. Accordingly, the CA Decision must be set aside and the RTC Decision affirming the MTC Decision must be reinstated. </p><p> Respondents, therefore, must vacate the premises and pay petitioners the amount of P5,000.00 per month as reasonable compensation for the continued use and occupation of the subject property from May 16, 2010, the date of the demand to vacate, until respondents actually vacate the subject property and the amount of P20,000.00 as and for attorney's fees, plus costs of suit.</p><p> In addition, the reasonable compensation for the use and occupation of the subject property shall incur a legal rate of interest of 6% <i>per annum</i> from May 16, 2010, when the demand to vacate was made, up to the finality of this Decision. Thereafter, an interest, of 6% <i>per annum</i> shall be imposed on the total amount due until full payment is made in accordance with <i>Nacar v.
