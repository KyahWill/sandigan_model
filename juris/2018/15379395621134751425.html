Ramos (PO3 Ramos) and POl Michelle V. Gimena (PO1 Gimena) of the Station Anti-Illegal Drugs Special Operations Task Group (SAID-SOTG), and Barangay Kagawad Miguelito P. Bernal, Jr. (Kagawad Bernal). </p><p> Their testimonies were summarized by the CA, as follows: </p><blockquote> <p> x x x [O]n August 13, 2010, at around 3:10PM, PO3 Ramos was at the [SAID-SOTG] office of the Makati City Police Station with other police officers. They received a report from their confidential informant about an on-going illegal drug activity in Araro [Street], Barangay Palanan, Makati City. After PO3 Ramos prepared a Coordination Form (Exh. "A") for submission to the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA), the police officers planned a buy-bust operation against one "Delia Callejo" and "alias Bitoy" to be led by Police Chief Inspector Jonathan B. Villamor [PCI Villamor]. <b>PO3 Ramos was designated as poseur-buyer and [PO1 Gimena] as his immediate back-up. </b>PCI Villamor gave PO3 Ramos a [Php500.00] bill (Exh. "D") to be used in the operation. PO3 Ramos marked the bill by putting his initials "ER" above the serial number thereof. Together with the informant, the police team proceeded to the target area at Araro [Street]. Arriving at the place, PO3 Ramos and the informant walked towards an alley, PO1 Gimena trailing them by about 15 meters. PO3 Ramos and the informant then saw their target person, later identified as Callejo, talking with another woman, later identified as Antoque. <b>Callejo and Antoque knew the informant and Antoque approached and talked to him saying, "<i>[m]ay ibibigay ako sayo</i>." </b>The informant introduced PO3 Ramos to the two women. <b>Antoque offered the dangerous drug to PO3 Ramos. After PO3 Ramos handed the marked [Php500.00] bill to Antoque, Callejo gave him a plastic sachet containing shabu.</b> PO3 Ramos lit a cigarette as a signal to his companions that the transaction had been completed. He introduced himself to the two women as a police officer and arrested and apprised them of their constitutional rights. Antoque tried to escape but was prevented by [PO1 Gimena]. <b>PO3 Ramos confiscated the marked money from Antoque and took custody of the plastic sachet (Exh. "N") subject of the sale. PO1 Gimena recovered another plastic sachet (Exh. "O") from Callejo.</b> At the place of arrest, PO3 Ramos marked the two sachets with Callejo's initials "DTC-1" and "DTC-2." A member of the back-up team went to see Kagawad Bernal to ask him to assist in the inventory of the confiscated items. The accused and the seized items were presented to Bernal who later watched as PO3 Ramos prepared the Inventory Receipt (Exh. "E"). Bernal signed the Inventory Receipt after ascertaining that the items listed were the items actually shown to him. The entire process was photographed by PO1 Gimena. PO3 Ramos then turned over the items and the Inventory Receipt to PO3 Rafael Castillo [PO3 Castillo], the Investigator on Case. PO3 Castillo prepared a request for laboratory examination (Exh. "L") of the subject specimens and a request for drug test (Exh. "Q") on the person of the two suspects. PO1 Gimena delivered the requests and the specimens to the PNP Crime Laboratory in Makati City between 7:20 PM and 7:25 PM of August 13, 2010. The specimens delivered were found positive for shabu.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> The appellants denied the prosecution's allegations and claimed that the charges filed against them were completely fabricated. The CA summarized the appellants' testimonies, as follows: </p><blockquote> <p> x x x Callejo testified that at 2:30 PM of [August 13, 2010], she was taking a bath in her house at Araro [Street]. Her brother's girlfriend, Rowena, was also in the house. Thereafter, she left the house and went to an alley to do laundry work for a neighbor. She chanced upon PO3 Ramos who was in civilian clothes. PO3 Ramos suddenly grabbed her hand and told her, "<i>Ilabas mo na</i>." She told [PO3 Ramos] that she does not know what he was looking for. He slapped her on the face, handcuffed her, pointed his short firearm at her, and arrested her. She did not say anything or ask why she was arrested. It was only Rowena who had witnessed the incident. As she and PO3 Ramos were going out of the alley, she saw Antoque talking with PO1 Gimena, also in civilian clothes. Antoque was also in handcuffs. Shortly thereafter, she and Antoque were shown plastic containers which were on top of a table in front of a store. PO3 Ramos told her that the items were recovered from her house. She was surprised because she did not see any police operative enter her house. The police officers called Kagawad Bernal and made him sign a document. She and Antoque were then boarded inside a van and brought to the police station where they were detained.</p> <p> x x x x</p> <p> Antoque denied having sold illegal drugs. She claimed that on August 13, 2010, at 3 PM, she was in the house of her neighbor, Apple, at Araro Street watching TV with Apple's children, Kulit and Ryan[,] while Apple was doing laundry. Suddenly, [PO1 Gimena] approached her from behind and told her that she will ask her some questions. However, PO1 Gimena did not ask questions and instead grabbed her, searched the left back pocket of her short pants, and handcuffed her. PO1 Gimena did not get anything from Antoque's pocket or placed anything in it. Antoque asked PO1 Gimena why she handcuffed her but she was told to keep quiet. x x x Antoque and PO1 Gimena then walked out of the alley and headed to a store nearby and there she saw "plastics" being placed on a table. She saw Callejo for the first time on that day when PO3 Ramos and Callejo chanced upon her at the alley. She and Callejo were made to sit in front of the table. Kagawad Bernal asked them what happened and they told him that they do not know but they were suddenly handcuffed and brought before him. Thereafter, they were boarded in a van and brought to the SAID-SOTG office. x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> In a Decision dated November 29, 2011, the RTC found appellants guilty beyond reasonable doubt, thus: </p><blockquote> <p> WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered as follows: </p> <blockquote> <p> In Criminal Case No. 10-1555, the [RTC] finds the accused, DELIA CALLEJO y TADEJA and SILVERA ANTOQUE y MOYA, GUILTY, beyond reasonable doubt of the charge for <b>violation of Section 5[,] Article II, [RA] 9165</b> and sentences them to suffer the penalty of life- imprisonment and to pay a fine of Five Hundred Thousand Pesos [Php]500,000.00 each; </p> <p> In Criminal Case No. 10-1556, the [RTC] finds the accused DELIA CALLEJO y TADEJA, GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the charge for <strong>violation of Section 11[,] Article II, [RA] 9165</strong> and sentences her to suffer the penalty of imprisonment of twelve (12) years and one (1) day as minimum to fourteen (14) years and eight (8) months as maximum and to pay a fine [of] Three Hundred Thousand Pesos [Php]300,000.00[.]</p> <p> x x x x</p> <p> SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> On the Section 5 charge, the RTC ruled that sufficient evidence exists on record to establish that the buy-bust operation conducted by the SAID-SOTG was valid.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Further, the RTC held that the prosecution successfully established the identity of the <i>corpus delicti</i> in the present case, as the integrity and evidentiary value of the plastic sachet marked as "DTC-1" which was purchased from Callejo had been "well safeguarded as to be reliable."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> </p><p> On the Section 11 charge, the RTC held that the prosecution sufficiently proved that the plastic sachet marked as "DTC-2" containing <i>shabu</i> had been recovered from Callejo's possession, and that the latter possessed the same freely and consciously, without proper authority.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> </p><p> The RTC rejected the appellants' defense of frame-up.

RA 9165 was later amended by RA 10640,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> which was approved on July 15, 2014. Since the offenses subject of this appeal were allegedly committed on August 13, 2010, the <em>original</em> version of Section 21 applies. Said original version reads: </p><blockquote> <p> SEC. 21.<i> Custody and Disposition of Confiscated, Seized, and/or Surrendered Dangerous Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous Drugs, Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, Instruments/Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment</i>. – The PDEA shall take charge and have custody of all dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, as well as instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment so confiscated, seized and/or surrendered, for proper disposition in the following manner:</p> <p> (1) The apprehending team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, <b>physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof[.]</b></p> </blockquote> <p> Section 21(a), Article II of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA 9165 (IRR) filled in the details as to the prescribed place of inventory and photographing.

Any deviation in the mandatory procedure must be satisfactorily justified by the apprehending officers. Under Section 21 of the IRR, the Court may allow deviation from the procedure only where the following requisites concur: (a) the existence of justifiable grounds to allow departure from the rule on strict compliance; and (b) the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending team.

And only if this is not practicable, does the IRR allow that the inventory and photographing be done as soon as the buy-bust team reaches the nearest police station or the nearest office of the apprehending officer/team. <b>By the same token, this also means that the three required witnesses should already be physically present at the time of apprehension</b> — <b><u>a requirement that can easily be complied with by the buy-bust team considering that the buy-bust operation is, by its nature, a planned activity</u></b>. Simply put, the buy-bust team has enough time and opportunity to bring with them said witnesses.</p><p> The SAID-SOTG failed to comply with the three-witness rule. </p><p> As confirmed by the testimonies presented by the prosecution, Kagawad Bernal was called to the place of arrest only <i>after</i> the apprehension of the appellants and the alleged seizure of drugs from their possession. In fact, Kagawad Bernal averred that he was surprised when he was summoned by the SAID-SOTG while he was cooking lunch in his home, which, in turn, happened to be near the place of arrest.

The submissions of the prosecution do not indicate that the SAID-SOTG exerted genuine effort in order to secure their presence at the time of apprehension. </p><p> The presence of the witnesses from the DOJ, media, and from public elective office is necessary to protect against the possibility of planting, contamination, or loss of the seized drug. Using the language of the Court in <i>People v. Mendoza</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> without the <b>insulating presence</b> of the representative from the media or the DOJ and any elected public official during the seizure and marking of the drugs, the evils of switching, "planting" or contamination of the evidence that had tainted the buy-busts conducted under the regime of RA 6425 (Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972) again reared their ugly heads as to negate the integrity and credibility of the seizure and confiscation of the subject sachets that were evidence of the <i>corpus delicti</i>, and thus adversely affected the trustworthiness of the incrimination of the accused.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> </p><p> The presence of the three witnesses must be secured not only during the inventory but more importantly at the time of the buy-bust arrest. It is at this point when the presence of the three witnesses is most needed, as it is their presence at the time of seizure and confiscation that would belie any doubt as to the source, identity, and integrity of the seized drug. If the buy-bust operation is legitimately conducted, the presence of the insulating witnesses would also controvert the usual defense of frame-up as the witnesses would be able to testify that the buy-bust operation and inventory of the seized drugs were done in their presence in accordance with Section 21 of RA 9165. </p><p> The practice of police operatives of not bringing to the intended place of arrest the three witnesses, when they could easily do so — and "calling them in" to the place of inventory to witness the inventory and photographing of the drugs only after the buy-bust operation has already been finished — does not achieve the purpose of the law in having these witnesses prevent or insulate against the planting of drugs. </p><p> To restate, the presence of the three insulating witnesses at the time of seizure and confiscation of the drugs must be secured and complied with at the time of the warrantless arrest; such that they are required to be at or near the intended place of the arrest so that they can be ready to witness the inventory and photographing of the seized and confiscated drugs "immediately after seizure and confiscation". </p><table width="50%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><i>The prosecution failed to establish the chain of custody of the seized drugs. </i></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>As stated earlier, there is a saving clause in Section 21 of the IRR, which states: "noncompliance of these requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and invalid such seizures and custody over said items." </p><p> In <i>People v. Alviz</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> the Court held that the integrity and evidentiary value of seized items are properly preserved for as long as the chain of custody of the same is duly established. </p><p> Chain of custody is defined in Section 1(b) of Dangerous Drugs Board Regulation No. 1, Series of 2002: </p><blockquote> <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="3%"><div align="justify">b.</div></td> <td width="97%"><div align="justify">"Chain of Custody" means the <b>duly recorded authorized movements and custody of seized drugs or controlled chemicals or plant sources of dangerous drugs or laboratory equipment of each stage, from the time of seizure/confiscation to receipt in the forensic laboratory to safekeeping to presentation in court for destruction</b>.

According to the appellants, such failure also renders the statements in PO3 Castillo's Inventory Receipt and PSI Bacani's Physical Science Report inadmissible due to lack of proper authentication. The OSG contends, however, that the subject matter of the testimonies of PO3 Castillo and PSI Bacani, as well as the veracity of the statements in the Inventory Receipt and Physical Science Report, can no longer be assailed since they had been stipulated upon by the parties during the preliminary conference. </p><p> In this respect, the Court finds that while the parties indeed made the stipulations in question, such stipulations do not relate to or do not cover the specific manner through which the seized items were handled while in their possession. Further, they do not indicate how such items were subsequently turned over to the next responsible party. </p><p> PO3 Ramos testified that he turned over the seized items to PO3 Castillo for investigation and referral after physical inventory and photographing.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> <b>Notably, however, no other testimony was offered to explain how the seized items were passed on and placed in the hands of PO3 Castillo and PSI Bacani, or how the integrity of said items were preserved while they remained in their custody.</b> </p><p> The Court's ruling in <i>People v. Sanchez</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> (Sanchez) lends guidance. In <i>Sanchez</i>, the trial court dispensed with the testimony of the forensic chemist therein after the parties stipulated that "the items allegedly confiscated from the accused were submitted to the crime laboratory for examination and the findings were put into writing."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> As a result, only the sole testimony of the poseur-buyer was presented to attest to the chain of custody of the seized items therein. The Court held: </p><blockquote> <p> x x x [The sole testimony presented by the prosecution] failed to disclose the identities of the desk officer and the investigator to whom the custody of the drugs was given, and how the latter handled these materials. No reference was ever made to the person who submitted the seized specimen to the PNP Crime Laboratory for examination. Likewise, no one testified on how the specimen was handled after the chemical analysis by the forensic chemist. <b>While we are aware that the RTC's Order of August 6, 2003 dispensed with the testimony of the forensic chemist because of the stipulations of the parties, we view the stipulation to be confined to the handling of the specimen at the forensic laboratory and to the analytical results obtained. The stipulation does not cover the manner the specimen was handled before it came to the possession of the forensic chemist and after it left his possession. </b>To be sure, personnel within the police hierarchy (as SPO2 Sevilla's testimony casually mentions) must have handled the drugs but evidence of how this was done, <i>i.e</i>., how it was managed, stored, preserved, labeled and recorded from the time of its seizure, to its receipt by the forensic laboratory, up until it was presented in court and subsequently destroyed — is absent from the evidence adduced during the trial. x x x</p> <p> The recent case of <i>Lopez v. People</i> is particularly instructive on how we expect the chain of custody or "movement" of the seized evidence to be maintained and why this must be shown by evidence: </p> <blockquote> <p> As a method of authenticating evidence, the chain of custody rule requires that the admission of an exhibit be preceded by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what the proponent claims it to be. <b>It would include testimony about every link in the chain, from the moment the item was picked up to the time it is offered into evidence, in such a way that every person who touched the exhibit would describe how and from whom it was received, where it was and what happened to it while in the witness' possession, the condition in which it was received and the condition in which it was delivered to the next link in the chain. These witnesses would then describe the precautions taken to ensure that there had been no change in the condition of the item and no opportunity for someone not in the chain to have possession of the same.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> In turn, the importance of establishing the chain of custody in drugs cases was explained in <i>Mallillin v. People</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup>: </p><blockquote> <p> A unique characteristic of narcotic substances is that they are not readily identifiable as in fact they are subject to scientific analysis to determine their composition and nature. The Court cannot reluctantly close its eyes to the likelihood, or at least the possibility, that at any of the links in the chain of custody over the same there could have been tampering, alteration or substitution of substances from other cases by accident or otherwise – in which similar evidence was seized or in which similar evidence was submitted for laboratory testing. Hence, in authenticating the same, a standard more stringent than that applied to cases involving objects which are readily identifiable must be applied, a more exacting standard that entails a chain of custody of the item with sufficient completeness if only to render it improbable that the original item has either been exchanged with another or been contaminated or tampered with. <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> As the drug itself is the <i>corpus delicti </i>in drugs cases, it is of utmost importance that there be no doubt or uncertainty as to its identity and integrity. </p><p> As in <i>Sanchez</i>, the scope of the stipulations made by the parties in this case were similarly narrow: </p><p align="center"> <b>MINUTES OF THE PRELIMINARY CONFERENCE</b> </p><blockquote> <p> x x x The prosecution offered for stipulation the existence of the following documentary and object evidence, to which the defense was amenable: </p> <blockquote> <p> x x x x</p> <p> 5. Inventory Receipt </p> <p>x x x x</p> <p> 16. Physical Science Report No. "D-287-10s" </p> <p>x x x x </p> </blockquote> <p>The prosecution and the defense likewise stipulated on <b>the subject matter</b> of the testimonies of the following witnesses: [PO3 Castillo], the police investigator on [the] case; [PSI Bacani] the forensic chemist who conducted the laboratory examination on the items allegedly taken from the accused and on the urine sample x x x. Hence, their testimonies in open court were already dispensed with.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> Considering the limited scope of the foregoing stipulations, as well as the lack of any other evidence to supplement the same, the Court finds that the prosecution failed to establish each link in the chain of custody as required by Section 21. Such failure casts doubt on the identity and integrity of the seized items which cannot be excused through the expedience of invoking presumption of regularity. </p><table width="50%" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><i>The apprehending officers' testimonies are plagued with material inconsistencies. </i></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>The narrative presented by the SAID-SOTG anent the identity of their confidential informant is marred with inconsistencies.

For another there were instances where elected <i>barangay</i> officials themselves were involved in the punishable acts apprehended and thus, it is difficult to get the most grassroot-elected public official to be a witness as required by law."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> </p><p> In his Co-sponsorship speech, Senator Vicente C. Sotto III said that in view of a substantial number of acquittals in drug-related cases due to the varying interpretations of prosecutors and judges on Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165, there is a need for "certain adjustments so that we can plug the loopholes in our existing law" and ensure [its] standard implementation."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Senator Sotto explained why the said provision should be amended: </p><blockquote> <p> Numerous drug trafficking activities can be traced to operations of highly organized and powerful local and international syndicates. The presence of such syndicates that have the resources and the capability to mount a counter-assault to apprehending law enforcers makes the requirement of Section 21(a) impracticable for law enforcers to comply with. It makes the place of seizure extremely unsafe for the proper inventory and photograph of the seized illegal drugs.</p> <p> x x x x </p> <p>Section 21(a) of RA 9165 need to be amended to address the foregoing situation. We did not realize this in 2002 where the safety of the law enforcers and other persons required to be present in the inventory and photography of seized illegal drugs and the preservation of the very existence of seized illegal drugs itself are threatened by an immediate retaliatory action of drug syndicates at the place of seizure. The place where the seized drugs may be inventoried and photographed has to include a location where the seized drugs as well as the persons who are required to be present during the inventory and photograph are safe and secure from extreme danger.</p> <p> It is proposed that the physical inventory and taking of photographs of seized illegal drugs be allowed to be conducted either in the place of seizure of illegal drugs or at the nearest police station or office of the apprehending law enforcers. The proposal will provide effective measures to ensure the integrity of seized illegal drugs since a safe location makes it more probable for an inventory and photograph of seized illegal drugs to be properly conducted, thereby reducing the incidents of dismissal of drug cases due to technicalities.</p> <p> Non-observance of the prescribed procedures should not automatically mean that the seizure or confiscation is invalid or illegal, as long as the law enforcement officers could justify the same and could prove that the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are not tainted. This is the effect of the inclusion in the proposal to amend the phrase "justifiable grounds." There are instances where there are no media people or representatives from the DOJ available and the absence of these witnesses should not automatically invalidate the drug operation conducted. Even the presence of a public local elected official also is sometimes impossible especially if the elected official is afraid or scared.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> However, under the original provision of Section 21 and its IRR, which is applicable at the time the appellants committed the crimes charged, the apprehending team was required to immediately conduct a physical inventory and photograph the drugs after their seizure and confiscation in the presence of no less than <b>three (3) witnesses</b>, namely: (a) a representative from the media, <b><u>and</u></b> (b) the DOJ, <b><u>and</u></b>; (c) any elected public official who shall be required to sign copies of the inventory and be given copy thereof. The presence of the three witnesses was intended as a guarantee against planting of evidence and frame up, as they were "necessary to insulate the apprehension and incrimination proceedings from any taint of illegitimacy or irregularity."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></p><p> The prosecution bears the burden of proving a valid cause for non­ compliance with the procedure laid down in Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165, as amended. It has the positive duty to demonstrate observance thereto in such a way that during the trial proceedings, it must initiate in acknowledging and justifying any perceived deviations from the requirements of law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Its failure to follow the mandated procedure must be adequately explained, and must be proven as a fact in accordance with the rules on evidence. It should take note that the rules require that the apprehending officers do not simply mention a justifiable ground, but also clearly state this ground in their sworn affidavit, coupled with a statement on the steps they took to preserve the integrity of the seized items.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Strict adherence to Section 21 is required where the quantity of illegal drugs seized is minuscule, since it is highly susceptible to planting, tampering or alteration of evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> </p><p>In this case, the prosecution never alleged and proved that the presence of all the required witnesses was not obtained for any of the following reasons, such as: (1) <b>their attendance was impossible because the place of arrest was a remote area;</b> (2) <b>their safety during the inventory and photograph of the seized drugs were threatened by an immediate retaliatory action of the accused or any person/s acting for and in his/her behalf;</b> (3) <b>the elected official themselves were involved in the punishable acts sought to be apprehended;</b> (4) <b>earnest efforts to secure the presence of a DOJ or media representative and an elected public official within the period required under Article 125</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> <b>of the Revised Penal Code prove futile through no fault of the arresting officers, who face the threat of being charged with arbitrary detention</b>; or (5) <b>time constraints and urgency of the anti-drug operations, which often rely on tips of confidential assets, prevented the law enforcers from obtaining the presence of the required witnesses even before the offenders could escape.</b> </p><p> Invocation of the disputable presumptions that the police officers regularly performed their official duty and that the integrity of the evidence is presumed to be preserved, will not suffice to uphold appellants' conviction. Judicial reliance on the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty despite the lapses in the procedures undertaken by the agents of the law is fundamentally flawed because the lapses themselves are affirmative proofs of irregularity.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> The presumption may only arise when there is a showing that the apprehending officer/team followed the requirements of Section 21 or when the saving clause found in the IRR is successfully triggered. In this case, the presumption of regularity had been contradicted and overcome by evidence of non-compliance with the law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> </p><p>At this point, it is not amiss to express my position regarding the issue of which between the Congress and the Judiciary has jurisdiction to determine sufficiency of compliance with the rule on chain of custody, which essentially boils down to the application of procedural rules on admissibility of evidence. In this regard, I agree with the view of Hon. Associate Justice Teresita J. Leonardo-De Castro in <i>People v. Teng Moner y Adam</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> that "if the evidence of illegal drugs was not handled precisely in the manner prescribed by the chain of custody rule, the consequence relates not to inadmissibility that would automatically destroy the prosecution's case but rather to the weight of evidence presented for each particular case." As aptly pointed out by Justice Leonardo-De Castro, the Court's power to promulgate judicial rules, including rules of evidence, is no longer shared by the Court with Congress. </p><p> I subscribe to the view of Justice Leonardo-De Castro that the chain of custody rule is a matter of evidence and a rule of procedure, and that the Court has the last say regarding the appreciation of evidence. Evidentiary matters are indeed well within the powers of courts to appreciate and rule upon, and so, when the courts find appropriate, substantial compliance with the chain of custody rule as long as the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items have been preserved may warrant the conviction of the accused.</p><p> I further submit that t<b>he requirements of marking the seized items, conduct of inventory and taking photograph in the presence of a representative from the media or the DOJ and a local elective official, are police investigation procedures which call for administrative sanctions in case of non-compliance. Violation of such procedure may even merit penalty under R.A. No. 9165</b>, to wit: </p><blockquote> <p> <b>Section 29. </b><i>Criminal Liability for Planting of Evidence</i>. - Any person who is found guilty of "planting" any dangerous drug and/or controlled precursor and essential chemical, regardless of quantity and purity, shall suffer the penalty of death.</p> <p> <b>Section 32. </b><i>Liability to a Person Violating Any Regulation Issued by the Board.</i> -The penalty of imprisonment ranging from six (6) months and one (1) day to four (4) years and a fine ranging from Ten thousand pesos (P10,000.00) to Fifty thousand pesos (P50,000.00) shall be imposed upon any person found violating any regulation duly issued by the Board pursuant to this Act, in addition to the administrative sanctions imposed by the Board.</p> </blockquote> <p> However, non-observance of such police administrative procedures should not affect the validity of the seizure of the evidence, because the issue of chain of custody is ultimately anchored on the admissibility of evidence, which is exclusively within the prerogative of the courts to decide in accordance with the rules on evidence.<br><br></p><p> </p><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="noshade" align="LEFT"> <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>"AN ACT INSTITUTING THE COMPREHENSIVE DANGEROUS DRUGS ACT OF 2002, REPEALING REPUBLIC ACT NO. 6425, OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE DANGEROUS DRUGS ACT OF 1972, AS AMENDED, PROVIDING FUNDS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES"</i> <p><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Sec. 21. <i>Custody and Disposition of Confiscated, Seized, and/or Surrendered Dangerous Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous Drugs, Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, Instruments/Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment</i>. - The PDEA shall take charge and have custody of all dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, as well as instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment so confiscated, seized and/or surrendered, for proper disposition in the following manner: </p> <blockquote> <p>(1) The apprehending team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof;</p> </blockquote> <p> <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> <em>People v.
