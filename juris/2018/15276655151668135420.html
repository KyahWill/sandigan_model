    <p> On the 18<sup>th</sup> day of March 2013, in the city of Makati,
 the Philippines, accused, not being lawfully authorized to possess or 
otherwise use any dangerous drugs without the corresponding license or

    <p>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> The prosecution alleged that on March 18, 2013, an informant 
tipped the Makati Anti-Drug Abuse Council (MADAC) that Miranda, alias 
"Thunder," was selling illegal drugs along Infanta Street, Barangay 
Olympia, Makati City. After verifying the said tip, a buy-bust operation
 was organized in coordination with the Philippine Drug Enforcement 
Agency (PDEA), and the team, together with the informant, proceeded to 
the target area along Infanta Street at ten (10) o'clock in the evening.
 Upon arriving, the informant introduced MADAC operative Delno A. 
Encarnacion (Encarnacion), the designated poseur-buyer, to Miranda as 
the buyer of <i>shabu</i> worth P300.00. Encarnacion then gave the 
marked money to Miranda, while the latter simultaneously handed over one
 (1) transparent sachet of suspected <i>shabu</i>. After inspecting the 
item, Encarnacion executed the pre-arranged signal by wiping his face 
with a white towel, prompting the buy-bust team to rush towards the 
scene and arrest Miranda. Subsequently, a body search was conducted on 
Miranda, whose pockets purportedly yielded another plastic sachet of <i>shabu</i>
 and the buy-bust money. Since Miranda  allegedly resisted and attempted
 to escape, the team was constrained to pull out from the site and bring
 him to the barangay hall of Barangay Olympia. Thereat, Encarnacion 
marked (with "THUNDER" and "THUNDER-1") and inventoried the seized 
sachets of <i>shabu</i> in the presence of Miranda and Barangay Kagawad 
Noe Lyndon Gonzales, among others. Photos of the seized drugs, together 
with the witnesses, were likewise taken. Encarnacion turned over the 
items to Senior Police Officer 1 Nildo T. Orsua<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>
 (SPO1 Orsua), who prepared a letter-request for examination. After 
securing the letter-request, Encarnacion retrieved the items from SPO1 
Orsua and brought them to the Philippine National Police (PNP) crime 
laboratory for qualitative examination. At 11:15 in the evening, the 
same were received by forensic chemist Police Senior Inspector Rendielyn
 L. Sahagun (PSI Sahagun) and confirmed that they indeed contained<em> methamphetamine hydrochloride</em>, a dangerous drug.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>
  </p><p> For his part, Miranda denied the allegations against him, 
claiming that at around 3:30 in the afternoon of March 18, 2013, he was 
in No. 7420 Infanta Street, Makati City installing a window screen of a 
house when two (2) unidentified persons suddenly held his back, 
handcuffed him, and boarded him inside a van. He averred that he was 
taken to the Station Anti-Illegal Drugs Office, where he was 
photographed with two (2) plastic sachets placed on a table. Thereafter,
 he was brought to the barangay hall and was made to face a<em> barangay kagawad</em>.
 Shortly after, he was again photographed together with said official 
and the plastic sachets. They proceeded to the Scene of the Crime 
Operatives Office and then to the Pasay Hospital. Consequently, Miranda 
was placed in detention at the Criminal Investigation Division for two 
(2) weeks.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>
  </p><p align="center"> <b>The RTC Ruling</b>
  </p><p> In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> dated March 10, 2015, the RTC ruled as follows: (<em>a</em>)
 in Crim. Case No. 13-906, Miranda was found guilty beyond reasonable 
doubt of violating Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 and, accordingly, 
sentenced to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and to pay a fine 
of P500,000.00, without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency; 
and (<em>b</em>) in Crim. Case No. 13-907, Miranda was found guilty 
beyond reasonable doubt of violating Section 11, Article II of RA 9165 
and, accordingly, sentenced to suffer the indeterminate penalty of 
twelve (12) years and one (1) day to fifteen (15) years of imprisonment 
and to pay a fine of P400,000.00, without subsidiary imprisonment in 
case of insolvency.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> The 
RTC found that the prosecution sufficiently established all the elements
 of the crimes charged. On the contrary, Miranda failed to overturn the 
presumption of regularity  afforded to police officers, as he only 
proffered a denial, to prove that the evidence obtained against him were
 tampered or meddled with.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>
  </p><p> Furthermore, the RTC declared that the integrity and 
evidentiary value of the seized items were properly preserved from the 
time of their seizure by Encarnacion until their turnover to PSI Sahagun
 at the PNP crime laboratory. It was shown that Encarnacion marked and 
inventoried the said items and handed them over to SPO1 Orsua for 
further investigation. SPO1 Orsua then returned the said items to 
Encarnacion, who subsequently delivered them to PSI Sahagun for 
laboratory testing. After examination, the latter revealed that they 
contained <em>methamphetamine hydrochloride</em>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>
  </p><p> Aggrieved, Miranda appealed<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> to the CA.</p><p align="center"> <b>The CA Ruling</b>
  </p><p> In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> dated July 29, 2016, the CA affirmed Miranda's conviction for the crimes charged.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>
 It held that all the elements of the crime of illegal sale of dangerous
 drugs were adequately proven, given that: (a) an illegal sale of <i>shabu</i>,
 a dangerous drug, actually took place during a valid buy-bust 
operation; (b) Miranda was positively identified as the seller of the 
said <i>shabu</i>; and (c) both the sachet of <i>shabu</i> and buy-bust 
money were presented and duly identified in open court as the same items
 recovered from Miranda. It also ruled that Miranda had no right to 
possess the other sachet of <i>shabu</i> incidentally recovered from him during his arrest.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> 
  </p><p>Moreover, the CA declared that the police officers - 
notwithstanding their failure to immediately mark, inventory, and 
photograph the seized items at the place of arrest - substantially 
complied with the chain of custody rule, as it was shown that the 
integrity and evidentiary value of the said items were preserved. It 
added that the non-presentation of PSI Sahagun's testimony, as well as 
the use of Miranda's alias in marking the seized items (<em>i.e</em>., 
"THUNDER" and "THUNDER-1"), neither affected their integrity and 
evidentiary value. Besides, the marking, inventory, and photography of 
the items were witnessed by a <i>barangay kagawad</i>, which thus belied any incidents of tampering or switching of evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> 
  </p><p>Hence, this appeal.      
  </p><p align="center"> <b>The Issue Before the Court</b>
  </p><p> The issue for the Court's resolution is whether or not the CA correctly upheld Miranda's conviction for the crimes charged. 
  </p><p align="center"><b>The Court's Ruling</b>
  </p><p> The appeal is meritorious.</p><p> At the outset, it must be 
stressed that an appeal in criminal cases opens the entire case for 
review and it is the duty of the reviewing tribunal to correct, cite, 
and appreciate errors in the appealed judgment whether they are assigned
 or unassigned.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> "The 
appeal confers the appellate court full jurisdiction over the case and 
renders such court competent to examine records, revise the judgment 
appealed from, increase the penalty, and cite the proper provision of 
the penal law."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></p><p> In 
this case, Miranda was charged with the crimes of illegal sale and 
illegal possession of dangerous drugs, respectively defined and 
penalized under Sections 5 and 11, Article II of RA 9165. Case law 
states that in every prosecution of illegal sale of dangerous drugs, the
 following elements must be proven beyond reasonable doubt: (a) the 
identity of the buyer and the seller, the object, and the consideration;
 and (b) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>
 Meanwhile, in order to convict an accused charged of illegal possession
 of dangerous drugs, the prosecution must establish the following 
elements also by proof beyond reasonable doubt: (a) the accused was in 
possession of an item or object identified as a prohibited drug; (b) 
such possession was not authorized by law; and (c) the accused freely 
and consciously possessed the said drug.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></p><p>
 In both instances, it is essential that the identity of the dangerous 
drug be established with moral certainty, considering that the dangerous
 drug itself forms an integral part of the <i>corpus delicti</i> of the 
crime. The prosecution has to show an unbroken chain of custody over the
 dangerous drugs so as to obviate any unnecessary doubts on the identity
 of the dangerous drugs on account of switching, "planting," or 
contamination of evidence. Accordingly, the prosecution must be able to 
account for each link of the chain of custody from the moment the drugs 
are seized up to their presentation in court as evidence of the crime.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></p><p>
 Section 21, Article II of RA 9165 outlines the procedure which the 
police officers must follow when handling the seized drugs in order to 
preserve their integrity and evidentiary value.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Under the said section, the apprehending team shall, among others, <b>immediately after seizure and confiscation conduct a physical inventory and photograph the seized items <u>in
 the presence of the accused or the person from whom the items were 
seized, or his representative or counsel, a representative from the 
media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public 
official</u></b> who shall be required to sign the copies of the 
inventory and be given a copy of the same, and the seized drugs must be 
turned over to the PNP Crime Laboratory within twenty-four (24) hours 
from confiscation for examination.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> In the case of <i>People v. Mendoza</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> the Court stressed that "<b><u>[w]ithout
 the insulating presence of the representative from the media or the 
Department of Justice, or any elected public official during the seizure
 and marking of the [seized drugs], the evils of switching, 'planting' 
or contamination of the evidence</u></b> that had tainted the buy-busts conducted under the regime of [RA] 6425 (<i>Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972</i>) again reared their ugly heads as to <b><u>negate the integrity and credibility of the seizure and confiscation of the [said drugsl that were evidence herein of the <i>corpus delicti</i>, and thus adversely affected the trustworthiness of the incrimination of the accused</u></b>. Indeed, the x x x presence of such witnesses would have preserved an unbroken chain of custody."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>
  </p><p> The Court, however, clarified that under varied field 
conditions, strict compliance with the requirements of Section 21 of RA 
9165 may not always be possible.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>
 In fact, the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA 9165 - 
which is now crystallized into statutory law with the passage of RA 
10640<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> - provide that the 
said inventory and photography may be conducted at the nearest police 
station or office of the apprehending team in instances of warrantless 
seizure, and that <b>non-compliance with the requirements of Section 21 of RA 9165 - <u>under justifiable grounds</u> - will not render void and invalid the seizure and custody over the seized items <u>so long as the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer or team</u></b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>
 Tersely put, the failure of the apprehending team to strictly comply 
with the procedure laid out in Section 21 of RA 9165 and the IRR does 
not<em> ipso facto</em> render the seizure and custody over the items as
 void and invalid, provided that the prosecution satisfactorily proves 
that: (a) there is justifiable ground for non-compliance; <b><u>and</u></b> (b) the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> In <i>People v. Almorfe</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> <b><u>the
 Court stressed that for the above-saving clause to apply, the 
prosecution must explain the reasons behind the procedural lapses, and 
that the integrity and value of the seized evidence had nonetheless been
 preserved</u></b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Also, in <i>People v. De Guzman</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> it was emphasized that <b><u>the
 justifiable ground for non-compliance must be proven as a fact, because
 the Court cannot presume what these grounds are or that they even 
exist.</u></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>
  </p><p> In this case, the Court finds that the police officers 
committed unjustified deviations from the prescribed chain of custody 
rule, thereby putting into question the integrity and evidentiary value 
of the items purportedly seized from Miranda.</p><p> Records reveal that
 while the seized items were marked by Encarnacion in the presence of 
Miranda and an elected public official, the same was not done in the 
presence of any representative from the DOJ and the media. During the 
cross-examination of Encarnacion, he testified that: 
  </p><blockquote>
    <p>  ATTY. PUZON:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p> <u>Who was present at the time of the preparation and signing of the Inventory?</u> </p>

    <p>WITNESS: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><u>The witness, Kagawad Lyndon Gonzales; me; the accused and my immediate back-up, PO2 Renie Aseboque.</u> </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>ATTY. PUZON: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><u>Was there any representative coming from DOJ? </u></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>WITNESS:</p>

    </blockquote>
    <p>ATTY. PUZON:</p>

    <p>ATTY PUZON: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The accused was not likewise represented by his own counsel at that time? </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>WITNESS: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>No, Ma'am. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>ATTY. PUZON: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>That would be all, Your Honor. x x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p> The law requires the presence of an elected public official, as 
well as a representative from the DOJ and the media in order to ensure 
the establishment of the chain of custody and remove any suspicion of 
switching, planting, or contamination of evidence. Despite the 
non-observance of this requirement, the prosecution did not even proffer
 a plausible explanation therefor. No practicable reasons were given by 
the police officers, such as a threat to their safety and security or 
the time and distance which the other witnesses might need to consider.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>
 Thus, considering the police officers' unjustified non-compliance with 
the prescribed procedure under Section 21 of RA 9165, the integrity and 
evidentiary value of the confiscated drugs are clearly put into 
question.
  </p><p> At this juncture, it is important to clarify that the fact 
that Miranda raised his objections against the integrity and evidentiary
 value of the drugs purportedly seized from him only for the first time 
before the CA <b><u>does not preclude</u></b> it or even this Court from passing upon the same.</p><p>
 To recount, the CA held that "[any] [l]apses in the safekeeping of the 
seized illegal drugs[,] [which affect] their integrity and evidentiary 
value should be raised at the trial court level."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> As basis, the CA cited the case of <i>People v. Mendoza (Mendoza)</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> which in turn, cited the case of <i>People v. Sta. Maria</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><i> (Sta. Maria)</i> wherein it was opined that:
  </p><blockquote>
    <p> The law excuses non-compliance under justifiable grounds. 
However, whatever justifiable grounds may excuse the police officers 
involved in the buy-bust operation in this case from complying with 
Section 21 will remain unknown, because appellant did not question 
during trial the safekeeping of the items seized from him. Indeed, the 
police officers' alleged violations of Sections 21 and 86 of Republic 
Act No. 9165 were not raised before the trial court but were instead 
raised for the first time on appeal. In no instance did appellant least 
intimate at the trial court that there were lapses in the safekeeping of
 seized items that affected their integrity and evidentiary value. 
Objection to evidence cannot be raised for the first time on appeal; 
when a party desires the court to reject the evidence offered, he must 
so state in the form of objection. Without such objection he cannot 
raise the question for the first time on appeal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> Based on this premise, the Court, in <em>Mendoza</em>, thus ruled 
that when an accused fails to raise any issues on the chain of custody 
before the trial court and yet questioned the same only upon appeal, 
whatever justifiable ground which may excuse the police officers from 
complying with Section 21 of RA 9165 will remain in obscurity but will 
not adversely affect the prosecution's case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> 
  </p><p>The<i> Sta. Maria</i> pronouncement may further be traced to <i>People v. Uy</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><i> (Uy)</i>,
 which, for its part, cited the annotation of "FRANCISCO, VICENTE J., 1 
The Revised Rules of Court, Vol. 1, Part II, 1997 ed., 405," stating the
 general principle on evidence that: 
  </p><blockquote>
    <p> Objection to evidence cannot be raised for the first time on 
appeal; when a party desires the court to reject the evidence offered, 
he must so state in the form of objection. Without such objection he 
cannot raise the question for the first time on appeal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> Notably,<i> Mendoza, Sta. Maria</i>, and <i>Uy</i>, are all 
criminal cases for violation of RA 9165, particularly involving 
objections to the chain of custody of seized drugs, which were then 
ultimately rejected by the Court since the same were raised only for the
 first time on appeal.</p><p> After a thorough study of these cases, 
however, this Court holds that that the aforesaid declarations espouse 
misplaced rulings, as the same clearly run counter to the fundamental 
rule that "<b><u>an appeal in criminal cases throws the whole case open for review</u></b>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></p><p>
 It is axiomatic that an appeal in criminal cases confers upon the court
 full jurisdiction and renders it competent to examine the record and 
revise the judgment appealed from.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Accordingly, "errors in an appealed judgment [of a criminal case], <b><u>even if not specifically assigned</u></b>, may be corrected<i> motu propio</i> by the court <b><u>if the consideration of these errors is necessary to arrive at a just resolution of the case</u></b>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>
 The rationale behind this rule stems from the recognition that an 
accused waives the constitutional safeguard against double jeopardy once
 he appeals from the sentence of the trial court. As such, it is 
incumbent upon the appellate court to render such judgment as law and 
justice dictate, whether it be favorable or unfavorable to the him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></p><p> Thus, in <i>People v. Gatlabayan</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup>
 this Court considered every glaring deficiency in each link of the 
custody, even if the same was not raised as an error on appeal, and 
reversed the judgment of conviction, given that <b><u>what was at stake was no less than the liberty of the accused</u></b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></p><p> In <i>Villareal v. People</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>
 this Court clarified that unlike in civil cases, the assignment of 
errors in criminal cases is not essential to invoke the court's 
appellate review, considering that it will nevertheless review the 
record, and accordingly, reverse or modify the appealed judgment if it 
finds that errors which are prejudicial to the rights of the accused 
have been committed, including those errors "<b>which go to the sufficiency of evidence to convict</b>":
  </p><blockquote>
    <p> The rule means that, <b>notwithstanding the absence of an 
assignment of errors, the appellate court will review the record and 
reverse or modify the appealed judgment</b>, not only on grounds that the court had no jurisdiction or that the acts proved do not constitute the offense charged, <b>but also o<u>n prejudicial errors to the right of accused</u> which are plain, fundamental, vital, or serious, or <u>on errors which go to the sufficiency of the evidence to convict</u></b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> (Emphases and underscoring supplied)</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> In this case, the Court cannot simply turn a blind eye against the
 unjustified deviations in the chain of custody on the sole ground that 
the defense failed to raise such errors in detail before the trial 
court. Considering the nature of appeals in criminal cases as 
above-discussed, it is then only proper to review the said errors even 
if not specifically assigned. Verily, these errors, which go to the 
sufficiency of the evidence of the <em>corpus delicti </em>itself, would
 indeed affect the court's judgment in ultimately ascertaining whether 
or not the accused should be convicted and hence, languish in prison for
 possibly a significant portion of his life. In the final analysis, a 
conviction must prudently rest on the moral certainty that guilt has 
been proven beyond reasonable doubt. Therefore, if doubt surfaces on the
 sufficiency of the evidence to convict, regardless that it does only at
 the stage of an appeal, our courts of justice should nonetheless rule 
in favor of the accused, lest it betray its duty to protect individual 
liberties within the bounds of law.
  </p><p> To be sure, this Court is not impervious to the sentiments of 
the State when it is left to deal with the seemingly unfair situation of
 having a drug conviction overturned upon grounds that it was not able 
to meet in the proceedings<i> a quo</i>. However, there is no gainsaying
 that these sentiments must yield to the higher imperative of protecting
 the fundamental liberties of the accused. Besides, the law itself 
apprises our law enforcement authorities about the requirements of 
compliance with the chain of custody rule. Case law exhorts that the 
procedure in Section 21 of RA 9165 is a matter of substantive law, and 
cannot be brushed aside as a simple procedural technicality; or worse, 
ignored as an impediment to the conviction of illegal drug suspects.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> <b><u>Therefore,
 as the requirements are clearly set forth in the law, then the State 
retains the positive duty to account for any lapses in the chain of 
custody of the drugs/items seized from the accused, regardless of 
whether or not the defense raises the same in the proceedings <i>a quo</i>;
 otherwise, it risks the possibility of having a conviction overturned 
on grounds that go into the evidence's integrity and evidentiary value, 
albeit the same are raised only for the first time on appeal, or even 
not raised, become apparent upon further review</u></b>.</p><p> In this 
case, the prosecution failed to provide justifiable grounds for the 
police officers' non-compliance with Section 21 of RA 9165, as well as 
its IRR. Thus, even though these lapses have only surfaced on appeal, 
reasonable doubt now persists in upholding the conviction of the 
accused. As the integrity and evidentiary value of the <i>corpus delicti </i>had been compromised,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Miranda's acquittal is perforce in order.</p><p> As a final note, the Court finds it fitting to echo its recurring pronouncement in recent jurisprudence on the subject matter:
  </p><blockquote>
    <p> The Court strongly supports the campaign of the government 
against drug addiction and commends the efforts of our law enforcement 
officers against those who would inflict this malediction upon our 
people, especially the susceptible youth. But as demanding as this 
campaign may be, it cannot be more so than the compulsions of the Bill 
of Rights for the protection of liberty of every individual in the 
realm, including the basest of criminals. The Constitution covers with 
the mantle of its protection the innocent and the guilty alike against 
any manner of high-handedness from the authorities, however praiseworthy
 their intentions.</p>
    <p> Those who are supposed to enforce the law are not justified in 
disregarding the right of the individual in the name of order. [For 
indeed,] [o]rder is too high a price for the loss of liberty. x x x.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> In this light, prosecutors are strongly reminded that they have the <b>positive duty</b> to prove compliance with the procedure set forth in Section 21 of RA 9165, as amended. As such, <b>they must have the <u>initiative</u> to not only <u>acknowledge</u> but also <u>justify</u> any perceived deviations from the said procedure during the proceedings before the trial court</b>. Since compliance with this procedure is determinative of the integrity and evidentiary value of the <i>corpus delicti</i>
 and ultimately, the fate of the liberty of the accused, the fact that 
any issue regarding the same was not raised, or even threshed out in the
 court/s below, would not preclude the appellate court, including this 
Court, from fully examining the records of the case if only to ascertain
 whether the procedure had been completely complied with, and if not, 
whether justifiable reasons exist to excuse any deviation. If no such 
reasons exist, then it is the appellate court's bounden duty to acquit 
the accused and, perforce, overturn a conviction.</p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appeal is <b>GRANTED</b>. The Decision dated July 29, 2016 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 07580 is hereby <b>REVERSED</b> and <b>SET ASIDE</b>. Accordingly, accused-appellant Jovencito Miranda <i>y </i>Tigas is <b>ACQUITTED</b>
 of the crimes charged. The Director of the Bureau of Corrections is 
ordered to cause his immediate release, unless he is being lawfully held
 in custody for any other reason.</p><p> <b>SO ORDERED.</b></p><p> <i>Carpio (Chairperson), Peralta, Caguioa</i>, and <i>Reyes, Jr., JJ.</i>, concur. <br><br></p><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="noshade" align="LEFT">

warrantless seizures: <i>Provided, finally</i>, That noncompliance of 
these requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity
