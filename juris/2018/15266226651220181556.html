She neither submitted any application for leave. Thus, she has been on absence without official leave (AWOL) since July 17, 2017.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> </p><p>On May 30, 2017, Millare applied for and was granted authority to travel to Saipan<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> from June 5 to July 14, 2017.
