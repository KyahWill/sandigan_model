				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">A.M. No. RTJ-11-2301 is an administrative complaint for gross irregularity in the conduct of proceedings in annulment and declaration of nullity of marriage cases. The complaint was born of a judicial audit conducted at the Regional Trial Court of Dasmariñas, Cavite, Branch 90 (RTC Dasmariñas 90), on 15-17 September 2010.<br><br>A.M. No. RTJ-11-2302 stemmed from a report on a judicial audit conducted on 3-11 February 2011 and treated as an administrative complaint against the judges and personnel of the Regional Trial Court of Imus, Cavite, Branches 20, 21 and 22 (RTC Imus 20, 21 and 22); and RTC Dasmariñas 90.<br><br>A.M. No. 12-9-188-RTC stemmed from an anonymous complaint against Judge Perla V. Cabrera-Faller (Judge Cabrera-Faller) of RTC Dasmariñas 90 relative to the irregularity of the proceedings in Civil Case No. 1998-08 for declaration of nullity of marriage.<br><center><b><br>FACTS<br><br><i>A.M. No. RTJ-11-2301</i></b><br></center><br>In a Report dated 23 February 2011,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) narrated its findings on the judicial audit conducted on 15-17 September 2010 at RTC Dasmariñas 90.<br><br>At the time of audit, the court had a total case load of 827 cases, 417 of which were criminal and 410, civil.<br><br>Of the criminal cases, the judicial audit team found that the court had failed to take action on three cases for a considerable length of time. Its last action on one case was on 10 June 2008, when the private prosecutor was given five days within which to submit a formal offer of evidence; the two other cases had not been acted upon since the denial of the motion for judicial determination of probable cause on 3 June 2009. Another criminal case had a pending motion to lift a warrant of arrest since 19 August 2009. Two cases had recently been submitted for decision, and one case was scheduled for the promulgation of judgment.<br><br>The civil cases proved more problematic. Still not acted upon from the time of their filing were 106 cases, some of which went as far back as 2008. The court had not acted on 51 cases for a considerable length of time. In fact, the last court action on 35 of these cases was from 2003 to 2009. There were 28 civil cases with pending incidents. Their pendency was relatively recent, because 26 of them were filed only in 2010, one was filed 2009 and another in 2008. There were 17 civil cases submitted for decision 16 of them were recent, but one had been submitted for decision since 8 December 2008.<br><br>The judicial audit team observed that the case records in the court were not stitched, but held together by fasteners only, and that they were not chronologically arranged or paginated. Nevertheless, the stitching of the records was immediately done upon advice of the audit team. It also appeared that the court personnel were not wearing the prescribed uniform for the trial courts.<br><br>The team noted several irregularities in the petitions for declaration of nullity and annulment of marriage:<br><br>1. Improper service of summons<br><br>Process Server Rizalino Rinaldi B. Pontejos (Process Server Pontejos) had been in the habit of making a substituted service of summons without compliance with the mandatory requirements for validly effecting it, as enunciated in <i>Manotoc v. CA</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> In two cases, it is indicated that the summonses were "duly served but despite diligent efforts x x x exerted, the same proved ineffectual."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> In at least 12 cases cited, summonses were not attached to the records.<br><br>2. No appearance by the Solicitor General<br><br>In nine cases, the hearing of the petition proceeded even without the filing of a notice of appearance by the Solicitor General.<br><br>3. No categorical finding on whether collusion existed between the parties/no collusion report at all<br><br>In all his reports regarding the existence of collusion between the parties, Assistant Provincial Prosecutor Oscar R. Jarlos stated that "the undersigned Prosecutor is not in the position to tell whether collusion exists."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> In 10 cases, the hearing of the petition proceeded even without the submission of the collusion report by the public prosecutor.<br><br>4. No pretrial briefs<br><br>No pretrial briefs can be found in the records of 11 cases at the trial stage and three that have been submitted for decision.<br><br>5. No formal offer of exhibits/evidence<br><br>Two cases were submitted for decision without any formal offer of exhibits/evidence.<br><br>6. Non-attachment of the minutes to the records<br><br>The minutes were not attached to the records of several cases, and the audit team had doubts whether the psychiatrist/psychologist who had prepared the evaluation report testified in court.<br><br>7. Irregular psychological evaluation reports<br><br>Some of the Psychological Evaluation Reports attached to the records were mere photocopies. In two cases, the affidavits of the psychiatrist/psychologist were unsubscribed. The psychological report attached to the record of one case was unsigned and undated.<br><br>8. Absence of the public prosecutor's signature in the jurat of the judicial affidavit of the petitioner in one case<br><br>In a Resolution dated 11 October 2011,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> the Court resolved to docket the Report as A.M. No. RTJ-11-2301, a case for gross irregularity in the conduct of proceedings in petitions for declaration of nullity and annulment of marriage. Judge Cabrera-Faller, Officer-in-Charge Ophelia G. Suluen (OIC Suluen) and Process Server Pontejos were required to explain, within 30 days from notice, the irregularities observed by the judicial audit team.<br><br>Judge Cabrera-Faller was likewise directed to take appropriate action on all cases that the court had failed to act upon for a considerable length of time from the date of their filing. She was further directed to act on those without further setting, with pending incidents or those submitted for decision. She was required to submit a copy of the actions taken thereon within 10 days from notice.<br><br>During the audit, it was brought to the attention of the team that family court cases falling within the territorial jurisdiction of RTC Dasmariñas 90 were being raffled to RTC Imus 20 and 21. Accordingly, the Court also amended the Resolution dated 16 June 1998 in A.M. No. 92-9-855-RTC<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> to read as follows: "[F]amily court cases originating from the municipalities of Dasmariñas shall be heard and tried exclusively by the Regional Trial Court, Branch 90, Dasmariñas, Cavite."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Judge Cabrera-Faller, OIC Suluen and Process Server Pontejos submitted their joint compliance or explanation in a letter dated 8 December 2011.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> They also attached relevant court orders and decisions to cases that were cited by the audit team as awaiting action by the court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> The Court referred these documents to the OCA for evaluation, report and recommendation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>In its Memorandum dated 12 August 2014,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> the OCA recommended that Judge Cabrera-Faller be fined in the amount of P10,000 for her failure to comply fully with the Resolution dated 11 October 2011. According to the OCA, she did not take appropriate action on all the cases enumerated in the Comi's Resolution, in defiance of the directive given to her. For the same reason, it also recommended that OIC Suluen be fined in the amount of P20,000.<br><br>As regards Process Server Pontejos, the OCA observed that while he signed the joint compliance or explanation dated 8 December 2011, he gave no explanation regarding his practice of making a substituted service of summons without compliance with the mandatory requirements for validly effecting it. Thus, it recommended that he be suspended for three months without salary and other benefits for his utter failure to comply with the Resolution dated 11 October 2011.<br><br>The OCA recommended the foregoing penalties not for the irregularities observed by the audit team, but for the failure of Judge Cabrera-Faller, OIC Suluen and Process Server Pontejos to comply fully, if at all, with the Resolution dated 11 October 2011. Noting this deficiency, the Court opted to defer the imposition of penalties and instead require complete compliance with the Resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> In addition, the irregularities discovered involved petitions for declaration of nullity and annulment of marriage, which are among the subjects of A.M. No. RTJ-11-2302 and A.M. No. 12-9-188-RTC. Hence, the Court consolidated the two cases with the instant administrative matter, which has a lower, and therefore earlier, docket number.<br><br>Judge Cabrera-Faller and OIC Suluen complied through their submissions dated 8 December 2011,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> 29 January 2015<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> and 30 September 2015.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Process Server Pontejos submitted his explanation in a compliance dated 30 September 2015.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>As regards several irregularities in the petitions for annulment and declaration of nullity of marriage noted by the judicial audit team, the following explanations were offered by Judge Cabrera-Faller, OIC Suluen and Process Server Pontejos:<br><br>1. Improper service of summons<br><br>Process Server Pontejos explained that while some summonses were made through substituted service, they were served upon persons who were immediate relatives, had relations of confidence with the respondent, or were residing at the given address.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> These are persons who usually know the situation and expect that court personnel will serve summons, which they are willing to receive and acknowledge on behalf of the respondent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Some of them also call or text the respondent before receiving the summons.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> However, if the relatives refuse to receive the summons, Process Server Pontejos sets an appointment with the respondent and makes a second or third attempt to serve the summons. When it is not possible to make a second or third attempt due to the distance of the respondent's address, he explains to the relatives the importance of the summons and of notifying the respondent about the petition. In case only caretakers, security guards or minors are at the given address, he makes several attempts to locate the respondent or submits a written report with the notation "UNSERVED."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Judge Cabrera-Faller, OIC Suluen and Process Server Pontejos claim that the rules and jurisprudence on the service of summons are largely observed, although they admit that due to the heavy work load of the process server, some of these rules may have been overlooked.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Judge Cabrera-Faller explains that no "<i>pro forma</i> summons"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> was attached to the records of some cases, because summonses were made by publication. In summons by publication, the order granting the summons already incorporates it as a form of cost-cutting.<br><br>2. No appearance by the Solicitor General<br><br>Judge Cabrera-Faller insists that there is nothing in the rules prohibiting the court from proceeding with the case without the entry of appearance of the Solicitor General.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> She says that it is enough that there be proof of service on the Solicitor General and the provincial prosecutor to commence proceedings. She is aware of the mandatory period for the disposal of cases and, considering that the Office of the Solicitor General takes ages before the latter transmits its entry of appearance, she sees a need to speedily proceed with the hearing of the cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>3. No categorical finding on whether collusion exists between the parties/no collusion report at all<br><br>Judge Cabrera-Faller believes that the proceedings in the Office of the Provincial Prosecutor are not under the direct control and supervision of the judge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> She points out that the rules do not state that the court shall order the prosecutor to conduct the collusion investigation in a manner that the court deems fit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> She further points out that it is not true that in all the reports of Assistant Provincial Prosecutor Oscar R. Jarlos regarding the existence of collusion between the parties, he merely indicated that "the undersigned Prosecutor is not in the position to tell whether collusion exists."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Attached to the compliance dated 8 December 2011 is a report of the prosecutor stating that "the undersigned is of well-considered opinion that no collusion exists between the parties to this petition."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>She also considers it highly improbable for the court to proceed with the hearing of annulment cases when no report of collusion is attached to the record.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> While she admits that the audit team identified 10 cases in which the hearings proceeded even without the submission of the public prosecutor's collusion report, she emphasizes that these are contested cases. The prosecutor no longer submits any collusion report in cases where the respondent has vigorously opposed the petition by filing an answer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>4. No pretrial briefs<br><br>Judge Cabrera-Faller believes that pretrial briefs are simply guides for the parties on the stipulation of facts, admissions, and the manner in which the case shall proceed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> She allows the parties to proceed to pretrial even without the required pretrial briefs if the parties agree, in the case of contested proceedings; or if the prosecutor agrees, in the case of uncontested petitions. It is a strategy she has devised in order to shorten the proceedings and lessen the costs of litigation.<br><br>5. No formal offer of exhibits/evidence<br><br>It is not true that two cases were submitted for decision without any formal offer of exhibits or evidence. In those cases, the offer of evidence was made orally in open court, as there were only few documentary exhibits offered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>6. Nonattachment of minutes to the records<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Judge Cabrera-Faller states that the audit team seemed to equate the nonattachment of the stenographic notes to the record with the non-taking of the actual testimonies of the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> The stenographic notes are kept in the stenographers' files to keep them safe. They are not attached to the records, which are kept in a container van outside the Hall of Justice and exposed to the elements.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Despite repeated orders by this Court and several compliances by Judge Cabrera-Faller, OIC Suluen and Process Server Pontejos, no explanation or comment was included with regard to the irregularities involving the psychological evaluation reports of the psychiatrists/psychologists.<br><br>In a Resolution dated 20 October 2015,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> the Court referred this administrative case, together with A.M. Nos. RTJ-11-2302 and 12-9-188-RTC, to the Court of Appeals (CA) for its immediate raffle among the members thereof. The investigating CA justice was directed to evaluate the cases and make a report and recommendation within 90 days from notice.<br><br><center><b>A.M. No. RTJ-11-2302</b><br></center><br>In a Report dated 29 June 2011,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> the OCA narrated its findings on the judicial audit conducted on 3-11 February 2011 at RTC Imus 20, 21 and 22; and RTC Dasmariñas 90. According to the OCA, the four branches have generally violated A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> and specific provisions of the Rules of Court in handling petitions for declaration of nullity and annulment of marriage, adoption, and correction of entries.<br><br>In the Resolution dated 10 April 2012,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> the Court considered the irregularities found by the audit team sufficient to warrant the conduct of a full investigation. Accordingly, the Report was treated as an administrative complaint against the judges and personnel of the four branches, and they were required to comment on the findings. The OCA was directed to submit its evaluation, report and recommendation to the Court. Meanwhile, until the conclusion of the investigation, the presiding judges of the four branches were prohibited from acting on all cases for declaration of nullity and annulment of marriage, adoption, and correction of entries.<br><br>The investigation, conducted from 22 April to 8 May 2013, covered the decided cases for declaration of nullity and annulment of marriage filed from the year 2008 to 2011.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Thereafter, the OCA submitted an Investigation Report dated 13 February 2014.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>The findings of the comprehensive investigation were itemized per court, to wit:<br><br><b><i>RTC Imus 20</i></b><br><br>1. Improper venue<br><br>Out of 65 cases, 49 are indicative of improper venue.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> While the petitions for declaration of nullity and annulment of marriage show that one or both of the parties reside under the territorial jurisdiction of RTC Imus 20, most of the given addresses were vague or incomplete.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> The notices sent to several parties were "returned to sender" because the addresses were insufficient, incomplete, unknown or could not be located. In others, the addressees were unknown at the given addresses, or they were abroad, or had moved out. Worse, there were four different cases in which the parties had common addresses, leading to the suspicion that the private counsels might have also been involved in the use of bogus addresses in order to fulfill the residence requirement.<br><br>In Civil Case No. 2785-09 for declaration of nullity of marriage, the respondent filed an Answer and prayed for the dismissal of the petition, because the petitioner had allegedly been living in Taoyuan, Taiwan, since 1994; and none of the parties resided in Imus, Cavite.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> In fact, the order setting the case for pretrial and sent to the petitioner's address bore the notation "RTS-moved out." Nevertheless, the OCA found that Judge Fernando L. Felicen (Judge Felicen) ignored the Answer entirely when he granted the petition. He said in his Decision dated 7 June 2010 that "[d]espite the service of summons, no responsive pleading was filed by respondent within the reglementary period."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> A certification from the Bureau of Immigration showed that the petitioner had no record of arrival or departure in the country from January 1993 to 28 May 2013.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Yet she apparently testified before the court on 3 March 2010<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> based on the minutes of the proceedings prepared by Interpreter Imelda M. Juntilla (Interpreter Juntilla) and the transcript prepared by Stenographer Teresita P. Reyes (Stenographer Reyes).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>In Civil Case No. 3141-09 for declaration of nullity of marriage, the respondent also filed an Answer stating that the petition was filed in the wrong venue, because petitioner was in fact a resident of Caloocan City. The petition was still given due course, despite the fact that mail matters sent to the petitioner were returned because of the vague Cavite address.<br><br>2. Questionable jurisdiction/improper service of summons<br><br>Process Server Hipolito O. Ferrer (Process Server Ferrer) claims to have personally served summons at the given Cavite addresses, even though subsequent notices sent to them were "returned to sender" for the above­mentioned reasons.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Together with Sheriff Anselmo P. Pagunsan, Jr. (Sheriff Pagunsan), Process Server Ferrer also resorts to substituted service of summons without observing the requirements therefor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> There was clearly a practice of leaving the summons at the front door or resorting to a substituted service, even when the recipient refused to sign or acknowledge receipt. Sheriff Pagunsan made a substituted service on a person named "Jose Justino" on two separate occasions in two different addresses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>In Civil Case No. 3222-09, Sheriff Pagunsan issued a return dated 16 November 2009 stating that the summons was served on the respondent through a certain Gino Uson.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> However, the respondent sent a letter dated 21 January 2010 requesting copies of the pertinent records of the case to enable him to file an Answer. Nevertheless, initial trial proceeded on 25 January 2010, and a decision granting the petition was rendered on 12 March 2010, stating that the respondent had "failed to tender his responsive pleading within the reglementary period to file the same."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>3. Questionable raffling of cases<br><br>Of the 65 cases examined, 37 were filed and raffled on the same day.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> In one case, the petition had already been assigned to RTC Imus 20 even before it was stamped "received" by the RTC Office of the Clerk of Court and raffled to that branch. In others, there are clear indications that the court had already acted upon the petition even before the case was assigned to it by raffle.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> This circumstance led to a suspicion that the petitions were just stamped "received" on the day of the raffle, so that they could be assigned to predetermined courts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>4. No categorical finding on whether collusion existed between the parties/no collusion report at all<br><br>Of the 65 case records examined, 59 contained an investigation report submitted by Prosecutor Rosa Elmina Catacutan-Villarin stating that "she is not in a position to tell whether collusion exists or not."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Civil Case Nos. 2666-09 and 2916-09 proceeded to trial, and the petitions for declaration of nullity of marriage were granted even if no investigation reports were found in the records.<br><br>5. Finality of judgment despite non-service of copies of the decisions on the respondents<br><br>In four cases, the certificate of finality and the decree of absolute nullity of marriage were issued despite the fact that the copy of the decision sent to the respondents bore the notation "returned to sender."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>6. Issuance of the decree of nullity of marriage despite absence of proof that the entry of judgment had been registered with the local civil registrar<br><br>In 40 cases, the certificate of finality and the decree of nullity were issued on the same day; in seven cases, the decree of nullity was even issued ahead of the certificate of finality.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>7. Grant of petitions for declaration of nullity and annulment of marriage at the extraordinary speed of six months or less<br><br>Of the 65 case records examined, 50 were found to have been granted in six months or less from the date of filing to the rendition of judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br><b><i>RTC Imus 21</i></b><br><br>1. Improper venue<br><br>Out of the 62 cases examined, 19 have indications of improper venue.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> In the petition in Civil Case No. 2329-08, while the body alleged that the petitioner was a resident of Damariñas, Cavite, and the respondent of Valenzuela City, the verification expressly stated that the petition was to be filed in Pasay City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> In the petition in Civil Case No. 2691-09, while the body alleged that the petitioner was a resident of Dasmariñas, Cavite, the verification stated that she was a resident of Silang, Cavite, which was outside the jurisdiction of the court. There were eight cases in which a party had the same address as a party in another case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>In Civil Case No. 3026-09, the petition stated that both parties were based in Italy. Despite the fact that the petitioner had no record of travel back to the Philippines since 18 July 2002, she was able to execute a judicial affidavit in Makati City, and it was allowed in court by Judge Norberto J.

Sheriff Pagunsan echoes this argument.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> Clerk of Court Marasigan states that his duty of signing the summons to be served is also ministerial, for it is not his duty to determine whether the addresses of the parties are valid, existing, certain, and verifiable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> He adds that he has no authority to question, much less prevent, the continuation of the trial of particular cases if there is a question on the residence of the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> The matter rests upon the judicial discretion of the judge.<br><br>Judge Felicen insists that the parties who indicated that they resided in Cavite were indeed residents of Cavite.

Thus, Judge Felicen found that a discussion in the decision regarding the respondent's allegation was unnecessary.

Interpreter Juntilla and Stenographer Reyes argue that they were in no position to question the identity of the witness, who appeared before the court and testified under pain of criminal prosecution.

No categorical finding on whether collusion existed between the parties/no collusion report at all<br><br>Judge Felicen explains that the statement of the public prosecutor that "she is not in a position to tell whether collusion exists or not" is always accompanied by a manifestation that she will actively participate in the proceedings to safeguard against collusion or fabricated evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[126]</sup> The court relies on the regular performance of duties by the public prosecutor and proceeds to hear and try the petition. The judge has no control over how the public prosecutor conducts the investigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[127]</sup> To reject the latter's report would result in an unreasonable and indefinite deferment of trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[128]</sup><br><br>5. Finality of judgment despite non-service of the copies of the decisions to the respondents<br><br>Judge Felicen and Clerk of Court Marasigan explain that the certificate of finality is only given to them for signature by the clerk in charge, who is tasked with verifying the records in order to determine whether the decision has indeed attained finality.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[129]</sup> At any rate, Clerk of Court Marasigan notes that copies of the decisions were not served on the respondents, because the returns bore the notation "RTS-moved out/moved."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[130]</sup> Respondents are duty-bound to inform the court of any change in their addresses, and the finality of the decisions cannot be held hostage by the absence of forwarding addresses.<br><br>6.

Judge Quisumbing explains that the same is true regarding the verification in Civil Case No. 2691-09, in which the petitioner stated that she was a resident of Silang, Cavite. He, however, points out that the respondent in that case was a resident of Kawit, Cavite, which was within the jurisdiction of his <i>sala</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[136]</sup><br><br>As regards those instances when a party in one case had the same address as a party in another case, Judge Quisumbing offers the possibility that the petitioners really lived in the same house, because they were both separated from their respective spouses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[137]</sup> Also, considering that two of these parties had addresses that did not contain house numbers, it was possible that they only lived in the same street.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[138]</sup><br><br>Finally, with regard to the observation in Civil Case No. 3026-09 that the petitioner therein had no record of travel back to the Philippines since 18 July 2002, Judge Quisumbing only knows that on 19 July 2010, a person who introduced herself as the petitioner in the case testified under oath in open court in his presence and that of his court staff, the public prosecutor, and the petitioner's counse1.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[139]</sup><br><br>2.

The latter usually advises him to give the summons to the person present in the house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[141]</sup> Afterwards, he also interviews the person present and verifies that person's relationship with the addressee.

In all four courts, the OCA and the judicial audit teams found that most of the given addresses were vague or incomplete. It may be true, as explained by Judge Quisumbing, that some residential addresses in the provinces have no house numbers. Yet, the fact that most of the court notices sent to the parties by RTC Imus 20 and 22 and RTC Dasmariñas 90 were "returned to sender" shows that there was something amiss in the given addresses. It is even more curious that the notices were "returned to sender" for the reason that the addressees were unknown at the given address or could not be located.<br><br>More important, cases where parties have the same address as those in another case cannot be explained away. In fact, out of the four respondent judges, only Judge Quisumbing attempted to give an explanation of this anomaly. But his statement, instead of clarifying the matter, only operated to strengthen the cases against them. He offers the possibility that the petitioners really lived in the same house, because they were separated from their respective spouses.

Indeed, at the time that the petitioner in Civil Case No. 2785-09 testified in open court, th re was sufficient basis to believe that she was indeed who she said she was. After all, the witness identified herself under oath, stated her name and other personal circumstances for the record, and signed the minutes of the proceedings.

We cannot accept their explanation regarding the alleged unauthorized use of their addresses. It should be noted that relative to the majority of the vague and incomplete addresses given by the parties in the other petitions, those given by the petitioners who used the addresses of Process Server Azcueta and Social Worker Serilo stick out in their specificity: the block and lot number, street, subdivision and even the barangay were indicated. Furthermore, the addresses of the respondents in these petitions were not in Cavite. Thus, the addresses of Process Server Azcueta and Social Worker Serilo were the ones that provided the opportunity for these petitions to be in compliance with the venue requirement. This single most important fact negates any declaration that they did not consent to, or that they were even aware of the use of their addresses.<br><br>In A.M.

This fact, together with the admission of the petitioner that he is a naturalized American citizen, should have engendered suspicion on the part of Judge Cabrera-Faller that the former did not reside within the territorial jurisdiction of RTC Dasmariñas 90. The affidavit executed by Armando Tunay stating that he resided in that address for six months before the filing of the petition and until a year after the termination of the case is, at best, self-serving. What he stated in his affidavit may be relevant only to the proceedings for his petition for declaration of nullity of marriage. It cannot operate to excuse the gross ignorance of the law committed by Judge Cabrera-Faller with regard to the application of the rules on venue for petitions for declaration of nullity and annulment of marriages.<br><br><b><i>Improper Service of Summons</i></b><br><br>Section 6 of A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC provides that the service of summons shall be governed by Rule 14 of the Rules of Court. Under that Rule, the summons may be served by the sheriff, the deputy sheriff, or other proper court officer, or, for justifiable reasons, by any suitable person authorized by the court issuing the summons.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[256]</sup> Whenever practicable, the summons shall be served by handing a copy thereof to respondents in person or, if they refuse to receive and sign for it, by tendering it to them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[257]</sup> However, if the service cannot be done personally for justifiable causes and within a reasonable time, it may be effected by (a) leaving copies of the summons with some other person of suitable age and discretion then residing at respondent's house; or (b) leaving copies of the summons with some competent person in charge of the respondent's office or regular place of business.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[258]</sup><br><br><i>Manotoc v. CA</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[259]</sup> operationalized the provision for a valid substituted service of summons by laying down the following requirements:<br><blockquote>(1) Impossibility of Prompt Personal Service<br><br>The party relying on substituted service or the sheriff must show that defendant cannot be served promptly or there is impossibility of prompt service. Section 8, Rule 14 provides that the plaintiff or the sheriff is given a reasonable time to serve the summons to the defendant in person, but no specific time frame is mentioned. Reasonable time is defined as so much time as is necessary under the circumstances for a reasonably prudent and diligent man to do, conveniently, what the contract or duty requires that should be done. having a regard for the rights and possibility of loss, if any[,] to the other party. Under the Rules, the service of summons has no set period. However, when the court, clerk of court, or the plaintiff asks the sheriff to make the return of the summons and the latter submits the return of summons, then the validity of the summons lapses. The plaintiff may then ask for an alias summons if the service of summons has failed. What then is a reasonable time for the sheriff to effect a personal service in order to demonstrate impossibility of prompt service? To the plaintiff: reasonable time means no more than seven (7) days since an expeditious processing of a complaint is what a plaintiff wants. To the sheriff, reasonable time means 15 to 30 days because at the end of the month, it is a practice for the branch clerk of court to require the sheriff to submit a return of the summons assigned to the sheriff for service. The Sheriffs Return provides data to the Clerk of Court, which the clerk uses in the Monthly Report of Caseto be submitted to the Office of the Court Administrator within the first ten (10) days of the succeeding month. Thus, one month from the issuance of summons can be considered reasonable time with regard io personal service on the defendant.<br><br>Sheriffs are asked to discharge their duties on the service of summons with due care, utmost diligence, and reasonable promptness and speed so as not to prejudice the expeditious dispensation of justice. Thus, they are enjoined to try their best efforts to accomplish personal service on defendant. On the other hand, since the defendant is expected to try to avoid and evade service of summons, the sheriff must be resourceful, persevering, canny, and diligent in serving the process on the defendant. For substituted service of summons to be available, there must be several attempts by the sheriff to personally serve the summons within a reasonable period [of one month] which eventually resulted in failure to prove impossibility of prompt service. Several attempts [mean] at least three (3) tries, preferably on at least two different dates. In addition, the sheriff must cite why such efforts were unsuccessful. It is only then that impossibility of service can be confirmed or accepted.<br><br>(2) Specific Details in the Return<br><br>The sheriff must describe in the Return of Summons the facts and circumstances surrounding the attempted personal service. The efforts made to find the defendant and the reasons behind the failure must be clearly narrated in detail in the Return. The date and time of the attempts on personal service, the inquiries made to locate the defendant, the name/s of the occupants of the alleged residence or house of defendant and all other acts done, though futile, to serve the summons on defendant must be specified in the Return to justify substituted service. The form on Sheriffs Return of Summons on Substituted Service prescribed in the Handbook for Sheriffs published by the Philippine Judicial Academy requires a narration of the efforts made to find the defendant personally and the fact of failure. Supreme Court Administrative Circular No. 5 dated November 9, 1989 requires that impossibility of prompt service should be shown by stating the efforts made to find the defendant personally and the failure of such efforts, which should be made in the proof of service.<br><br>(3) A Person of Suitable Age and Discretion<br><br>If the substituted service will be effected at defendant's house or residence, it should be left with a person of suitable age and discretion then residing therein. A person of suitable age and discretion is one who has attained the age of full legal capacity (18 years old) and is considered to have enough discernment to understand the importance of a summons. Discretion is defined as the ability to make decisions which represent a responsible choice and for which an understanding of what is lawful, right or wise may be presupposed. Thus, to be of sufficient discretion, such person must know how to read and understand English to comprehend the import of the summons, and fully realize the need to deliver the summons and complaint to the defendant at the earliest possible time for the person to take appropriate action. Thus, the person must have the relation of confidence to the defendant, ensuring that the latter would receive or at least be notified of the receipt of the ummons. The sheriff must therefore determine if the person found in the alleged dwelling or residence of defendant is of legal age, wnat the recipients relationship with the defendant is, and whether said person comprehends the significance of the receipt of the summons and his duty to immediately deliver it to the defendant or at least notify the defendant of said receipt of summons. These matters must be clearly and specifically described in the Return of Summons.<br><br>(4) A Competent Person in Charge<br><br>If the substituted service will be done at [defendant'sl office or regular place of business, then it should be served on a competent person in charge of the place. Thus, the person on whom the substituted service will be made must be the one managing the office or business of defendant, such as the president or manager; and such individual must have sufficient knowledge to understand the obligation of the defendant in the summons, its importance, and the prejudicial effects arising from inaction on the summons. Again, these details must be contained in the Return.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[260]</sup><br></blockquote>The return for a substituted service should state, with more particularity and detail, the facts and circumstances such as the number of attempts at personal service, dates and times of the attempts, inquiries made to locate the respondent, names of occupants of the alleged residence, and reasons for failure in order to satisfactorily show the efforts undertaken.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[261]</sup> The exertion of efforts to personally serve the summons on respondent, and the failure of those efforts, would prove the impossibility of prompt personal service.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[262]</sup><br><br><i>Manotoc</i> also emphasized that while substituted service of summons is permitted, it is extraordinary in character and a departure from the usual method of service.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[263]</sup> As such, it must faithfully and strictly comply with the prescribed requirements and circumstances authorized by the rules.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[264]</sup><br><br>In these cases, it was clear that no faithful and strict compliance with the requirements for substituted service of summons was observed by Sheriffs De Villa and Pagunsan and Process Servers Ferrer, Azcueta, and Pontejos.<br><br>Contrary to the findings of Justice Paredes, those arrived at by this Court show that the returns made by Process Server Ferrer did not sufficiently comply with the guidelines in <i>Manotoc</i>. To illustrate, he submitted the following return in Civil Case No. 2511-09:<br><blockquote>This is to certify that on January 29, 2009, the undersigned personally served the Summons together with the copy of a Petition and its annexes in the above-entitled case upon the respondent thru <b>Candy Socorro, house maid</b> but she refuse[d] to affix by [sic] her name and signature in the original copy of the Summons.<br><br>That all diligent efforts were exetted to serve the said Summons as the undersigned went also to the above stated address on January 21 and 24, 2009 but the same proved ineffectual.<br><br>The original copy of the Summons is therefore respectfully returned duly served.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[265]</sup><br></blockquote>Notably, this return fails to establish the impossibility of prompt personal service. Although it states that he went to the respondent's address three times on three different dates, it does not show that efforts were made to find the respondent personally or cite why those efforts "proved ineffectual." Neither does it show that he ascertained whether or not the recipient comprehended the significance of the receipt of the summons and the duty to deliver it to the respondent or at least to notify the latter about the receipt of the summons.<br><br>In Civil Case Nos. 2216-08 and 2243-08, Process Server Ferrer indicated in his returns that he had made a personal service of summons on the respondents at their given addresses. However, subsequent orders sent to the same addresses were "returned to sender." Indeed, it is possible that after personal service of summons on respondents, they moved to another residence, but it is a different matter if the subsequent orders were returned to sender because respondents were "unknown at given address."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[266]</sup> This notation overturns whatever presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties may be accorded to the prior return of Process Server Ferrer stating that personal service on the respondent was made at that address. Furthermore, Civil Case No. 2216-08 was decided by RTC Imus 20 in three months and 10 days and Civil Case No. 2243-08 in four months and 17 days from filing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[267]</sup> It would be hard to imagine that in such a short span of time, the respondents would be "unknown at given address," if they had really been found there just a few months previously.<br><br>Sheriff Pagunsan was in the habit of stating in his returns that "no one was around to receive the court process. Hence, a copy of the summons was left at the door of the defendant's place."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[268]</sup> The Court cannot even begin to describe how far-off this practice is from the prescribed requirements and circumstances authorized by the rules. It does not even fall under the category of substituted service of summons, which, as we have said, is already a departure from the usual method of service. The following is an example of Sheriff Pagunsan's return for a substituted service of summons:<br><blockquote>THIS IS TO CERTIFY that on November 8, 2009, the undersigned personally served the copy of Summons together with the Petition and its annexes in the above captioned case to the defendant VINCENT CHRISTIAN OBLENA at xxx Parañaque City thru Gino Uson [who] claims to be a relative of the defendant, of sufficient age and discretion to receive the court process as [sic] however refused to affix his signature on the original copy of the Summons.<br><br>Earnest efforts were made by the undersigned in the morning and afternoon of the said date to serve the summons personally upon the respondent but failed on the grounds that respondent was always out at the time of the said service, hence, substituted service was resorted to in accordance with the Rules of Court.<br><br>The original copy of the summons is, therefore, respectfully returned DULY SERVED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[269]</sup><br></blockquote>The foregoing return clearly shows that while there were two attempts to serve the summons personally, they were made on the same day. He does not mention if he made any inquiry to locate the respondent; or if the recipient, who "claims to be a relative" of the respondent, comprehended the significance of the receipt of the summons and the duty to deliver it to the respondent or at least to notify the latter about the receipt thereof.<br><br>The blatant nonobservance of the rule regarding personal and substituted service of summons was shown by Sheriff De Villa in Civil Case No. 2693-09 when he resorted to substituted service of summons on the very same day that it was issued.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[270]</sup> He was also found to have served summons one was personal and the other substituted - on two different respondents in two different cases at the same address in Makati.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[271]</sup> We cannot countenance his alleged practice of resorting to substituted service after being advised by the respondent over the phone to leave the summons with the person present in the house. Contrary to his helief, this practice does not fulfill the requirement that he exert all efforts to personally serve the summons. In these instances, since he had already contacted the respondent by phone, it would have been more prudent and dutiful to have set an appointment for another day to enable him to personally serve the summons on the respondent himself, rather than to resort to a substituted service at the first instance.<br><br>The following is an example of a return that he submitted for a substituted service of summons:<br><blockquote>Respectfully returned to ATTY. MARIA CRSITITA A. RIVAS­SANTOS, Clerk of Court V, RTC Br. 21, Imus, Cavite the enclosed original copy of the Summons issued in the above-captioned case to respondent, PAUL JEFFREY R. SANTOS of xxx, Pasig City with the information that copy of the Summons together with the attached Petition and its Annexes was received by respondent's mother, LINA R. SANTOS on March 10, 2010, as evidenced by her signature appearing at the face bottom of said summons.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[272]</sup><br></blockquote>Again, this return fails to establish the impossibility of a prompt personal service. It does not show that Sheriff De Villa went to the respondent's address three times on at least two different dates, or that he exerted efforts to find the respondent and serve the summons personally. Neither does the return show that he ascertained whether the recipient comprehended the significance of receiving the summons and the duty to deliver it to the respondent or at least to notify the latter about the receipt of the summons.<br><br>In a number of the returns submitted by Process Server Azcueta, he claimed to have made a substituted service of summons to recipients who refused to sign or acknowledge receipt thereof. However, subsequent orders sent to the same addresses were "returned to sender," because "no such defendant/name" or "unknown address;" or, worse, the address was "unlocated, no such name and number of house on given address."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[273]</sup> Again, these notations overturn whatever presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties may be accorded to the prior return of Process Server Azcueta that substituted service on respondents was made at the given addresses.<br><br>No return of summons was attached to the records of five cases before RTC Imus 22.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[274]</sup> Process Server Azcueta explains that attaching the returns to the case records was not his job. On the other hand, Judge Mangrobang and Clerk of Court Cordez offer the possibility that the returns were accidentally detached from the records due to numerous instances of retrieval and photocopying. All of them claim that just because no returns were attached to the records did not mean that there was an improper service of summons. Curiously, whether it was a matter of failure to attach the returns to the records or accidental detachment of the returns therefrom, no evidence of the actual existence of the missing returns has been shown. If it was a matter of failure to attach the returns, their submission to the judicial audit team would have been easy. In any event, the accidental detachment of the returns could have been proven by a gap in the pagination of the records.<br><br>The following is an example of a return that Process Server Azcueta submitted for a substituted service of summons:<br><blockquote>Respectfully return(ed] to the Honorable Court the attached original copy of the summons and petition dated September 29, 2009 issued by this Honorable Court with thfollowing information:<br><br>1. That on October 1, 2009, the undersigned caused the service of Summons to the respondent but said respondent was not around on the said date.<br><br>2. That earnest effort to personally serve the summons failed as the said respondent is still not around at the given address when service was effected on October 10, 2009. To satisfy the Rules, substituted service was made by tendering a copy of the summons with petition and its annexes thru MA. PAZ C.

While it shows that Process Server Azcueta went to the respondent's address twice on two different dates, it does not show that he exerted efforts to find the respondent and serve the summons personally. Despite its use of the phrase "[t]o satisfy the Rules," it does not indicate the relation of the recipient with the respondent or whether the former comprehended the significance of the receipt of the summons and the duty to deliver it to the respondent or at least to notifY the latter about the receipt of the summons.<br><br>As regards Process Server Pontejos, it bears noting that there were findings of improper service of summons in both A.M. Nos. RTJ-11-2301 and RTJ-11-2302. Out of the 32 cases in A.M. No. RTJ-11-2301 and 45 in A.M. No. RTJ-11-2302 in which he made a substituted service of summons without compliance with the mandatory requirements of Manotoc, only one case overlapped - Civil Case No. 3746-10.<br><br>In A.M. No. RTJ-11-2302, the service of summons in 18 out of the 45 cases audited was made personally. However, all the returns in these 18 cases indicate that respondents refused to sign the original copy of the summons. Below is an example of such returns:<br><blockquote>THIS IS TO CERTIFY that on February 19, 2010, the undersigned caused the service of summons issued by the Clerk of Court of this Court together with the copy of complaint in the above-entitled case upon respondent Aurora T.

First, it was contrary to Administrative Circular No. 12 dated 1 October 1985, which provides that the service of all court processes and the execution of writs issued by the courts shall only be made within their territorial jurisdictions. Second, the level of industry, commitment and diligence that went into the service of summons in places very far from the territorial jurisdictions of the courts in question unfortunately failed to find its way into the service of summons <i>within</i> the territorial jurisdictions of the concerned courts or into the preparation of the corresponding returns.<br><br>The purpose of a summons is twofold: to acquire jurisdiction over the person of respondents and to notify them that an action has been commenced, so that they may be given an opportunity to be heard on the claim being made against them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[286]</sup> The importance of the service and receipt of summons is precisely the reason why the Court has laid down very strict requirements for undertaking substituted service of summons. As we said in <i>Manotoc</i>, to allow sheriffs and process servers to describe the facts and circumstances of substituted service in inexact terms would encourage routine performance of their precise duties. It would be quite easy for them to shroud or conceal carelessness or laxity in such broad terms.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[287]</sup><br><br>Having administrative supervision over court personnel, Clerks of Court Marasigan and Cordez in A.M. No. RTJ-11-2302 and OIC Suluen in A.M. No. RTJ-11-2301 had the responsibility to monitor compliance with the rules and regulations governing the performance of their duties.

That they allowed and tolerated noncompliance with the strict requirements of the rules for a long period of time shows their unfitness to discharge the duties of their office. Despite the improper service of summons, they continued with the conduct of the proceedings in the petitions for declaration of nullity and annulment of marriage. These findings tie up with the allegation of the OCA and the judicial audit teams that a conspiracy existed and thereby turned the courts in Cavite into havens for "paid-for annulments."<br><br><b><i>Lack of Collusion Report</i></b><br><br>Under Section 8(1) of A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC, the respondent is required to submit an Answer within 15 days from receipt of the summons. If no answer is filed, the court shall order the public prosecutor to investigate whether collusion exists between the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[290]</sup> Within one month from receipt of the order of the court, the public prosecutor shall submit a report to the court stating whether the parties are indeed in collusion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[291]</sup> If it is found that collusion exists, the public prosecutor shall state the basis of that conclusion in the report.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[292]</sup> The court shall then set the report for hearing; and if convinced that the parties are in collusion, it shall dismiss the petition. If the public prosecutor reports that no collusion exists, the court shall set the case for pretrial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[293]</sup><br><br>Notably, the rules do not merely ask whether the public prosecutor is in a position to determine whether collusion exists. They require that the investigating prosecutor determine whether or not there is collusion. In A.M.

No further proceedings should have been held without the investigation report.<br><br>In <i>Corpus v. Ochotorena</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[296]</sup> the Court found the respondent judge therein administratively liable for failure to observe the mandatory requirement of ordering the investigating public prosecutor to determine whether collusion existed between the parties. The Court emphasized that the active participation of the public prosecutor in the proceedings of the case could not take the place of the investigation report:<br><blockquote>While the record shows that Public Prosecutor Arturo M. Paculanag had filed a <i>Certification</i> dated May 04, 2001 with the respondent judge's court, stating, among others, that he appeared in behalf of the Solicitor General during the <i>ex-parte</i> presentation of plaintiffs evidence, even cross-examining the plaintiff and his witness, the psychiatrist Dr. Cheryl T. Zalsos, and that he had no objection to the granting of the petition for declaration of nullity of marriage, such <i>Certification</i> does not suffice to comply with the mandatory requirement that the court should order the investigating public prosecutor whether a collusion exists between the parties. Such directive must be made by the court before trial could proceed, not after the trial on the merits of the case had already been had. Notably, said <i>Certification</i> was filed after the respondent judge had ordered the termination of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[297]</sup><br></blockquote>There is no merit either in the contention that the active participation of the public prosecutor in the proceedings in lieu of an investigation report facilitates the speedy disposition of thcases. In <i>OCA v. Aquino</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[298]</sup> we enunciated that shortcuts in judicial processes cannot be countenanced, because speed is not the principal objective of a trial.<br><br>It is the considered opinion of this Court that the reason why the public prosecutors are not in a position to determine whether there is collusion between the parties is that one or both of them cannot be summoned to appear before the public prosecutor. Presumably, the irregularity regarding the non-submission of collusion investigation reports is likewise tied with the anomalous addresses of the parties. Hence, the non­submission of the reports is another manifestation of the conspiracy to reflect paper compliance with the rule on venue.<br><br><b><i>Failure to Serve Copies of the Decisions on Respondents</i></b><br><br>If a counsel or party moves to another address without informing the court of that change, the former's failure to receive a copy of the decision sent to the last known address will not stay the finality of the decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[299]</sup> It is a different matter, however, if from the very inception of the proceedings there is already doubt as to the genuineness of a party's given address.<br><br>In Civil Case No. 2904-09 filed before RTC Imus 20, summons was served on the respondent through substituted service. A copy of the order setting the pretrial was sent to respondent's address, but was returned to sender for the reason "no such name at given address."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[300]</sup> A copy of the decision granting the petition for the annulment of marriage sent to the respondent's address was again returned to sender for the reason "unknown at given address."

Nevertheless, a certificate of finality was issued by the court. In other cases before RTC Imus 22, copies of the decision sent to the respondents' addresses were returned to sender with the notations "unknown," "no such name," or "no such address." Yet, certificates of finality were issued by the court.<br><br>These notations should have put Judges Felicen and Mangrobang and Clerks of Court Marasigan and Cordez on guard regarding the propriety of issuing a certificate of finality, considering that the notations meant that this was not just a simple matter of failure of the parties to inform the court of their new addresses. At best their failure to be circumspect constituted neglect of duty. At worst, it was another manifestation of the conspiracy to grant fast and easy annulments to those who needed it.<br><br><b><i>Grant of Petitions at Extraordinary Speed</i></b><br><br>In RTC Imus 20, 50 out of the 65 cases examined were granted in six months or less from filing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[302]</sup> Sixteen cases were granted in three months, 12 in four months, 13 in five months, and nine in six months.<br><br>In RTC Imus 21, 15 out of the 62 cases examined were granted in six months or less from filing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[303]</sup> One case each was granted in two, three or four months; seven cases in five months; and five cases in six months.<br><br>In RTC Imus 22, 46 out of the 118 cases examined were granted in six months or less from filing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[304]</sup> One case was granted in record 25 days.

No. RTJ-11-2301 involving Judge Cabrera-Faller include those of the judicial audit team showing a number of criminal and civil cases pending before RTC Dasmariñas 90 that have not been acted upon for a considerable length of time; some of them, even as far back as the time of their filing.<br><br>During the material period when Judge Mangrobang was deciding the declaration of nullity and annulment of marriage cases with extraordinary speed, he failed to resolve two pending motions before his <i>sala</i> within the 90-day reglementary period. In <i>Castro v. Mangrobang</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[308]</sup> this Court found him guilty of undue delay in resolving pending matters and fined him in the amount of P10,000.

If it is true that the four judges are committed to the speedy resolution and disposition of cases, this commitment should have been reflected in all the cases pending before their courts, and not just in the declaration of nullity and annulment of marriage cases.<br><br><b><i>Lack of Registration with the Local Civil Registrar</i></b><br><br>Under Section 19(3) of A.M.

Entry of judgment shall be made if no motion for reconsideration or new trial, or appeal, is filed by any of the parties, the public prosecutor, or the Solicitor General. If the parties have no properties, the court shall forthwith issue the corresponding decree of declaration of absolute nullity or annulment of marriage upon the finality of the decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[311]</sup> Otherwise, upon the finality of the decision, the court shall observe the procedure prescribed for the liquidation, partition and distribution of the properties of the spouses, including custody, support of common children, and delivery of their presumptive legitimes.<br><br>In both cases, the entry of judgment shall be registered in the civil registry where the marriage was recorded and in the civil registry where the family court granting the petition for the declaration of absolute nullity or annulment of marriage is located.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[312]</sup><br><br>If the parties have properties, the decree of declaration of absolute nullity or annulment of marriage shall be issued only after the registration of the approved partition and distribution of the properties of the spouses in the proper Register of Deeds where the real properties are located; and after the delivery of the children's presumptive legitimes in cash, property, or sound securities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[313]</sup> The approved deed of partition shall be attached to the decree.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[314]</sup><br><br>Again, in both cases in which the parties have or do not have properties, the decree shall be registered in the civil registry where the marriage was registered, the civil registry of the place where the family court is situated, as well as in the National Census and Statistics Office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[315]</sup><br><br>In these administrative cases, absent a finding by the OCA and the judicial audit teams that the parties in the identified cases have properties, the Court cannot condemn the practice of the issuance on the same day of the certificate of finality and the decree of declaration of absolute nullity or annulment of marriage.

Considering further that both the entry of judgment and the decree must be registered with the civil registry where the marriage was registered and the civil registry of the place where the family court is situated, it is in fact easier for the parties to secure both from the courts on the same day and have them registered at the same time.<br><br><b><i>Questionable Raffling of Cases</i></b><br><br>The recommendation of Justice Paredes regarding the dismissal of charges against Clerk of Court Eusebio is well taken. Records show that Civil Case No. 1852-08 was filed on 1 February 2008 and received by RTC Imus 20 on 4 February 2008. The stamp of the Office of the Clerk of Court indicating that it was filed on 24 February 2008 was only due to inadvertence.<br><br>The same is true with Civil Case No. 3309-09. The case was raffled and transmitted to RTC Imus 20 on 23 November 2009, and the statement in the return of summons that an attempt to serve the summons was made on 6 November 2009 was merely due to Sheriff Pagunsan's failure to update the old return format. With regard to Civil Case No. 3676-10, summons was personally received by the respondent on 14 April 2010, not 25 March 2010.<br><br>The finding that most of the case8 were filed and raffled on the same day, without more, cannot make the judges and court personnel administratively liable.

No. RTJ-11-2302, other irregularities committed in RTC Imus 22 include the rendition of judgment ahead of the issuance of the order admitting the documentary exhibits and the giving of due course to a petition without a verification and certification against forum shopping. We find no merit in the explanation of Judge Mangrobang regarding the date indicated in the order admitting the documentary exhibits. He says that the date, which shows that the order admitting the exhibits was issued four days after the date of the decision, was a mere typographical error. As keenly observed by the OCA and the judicial audit teams, even the stitching and the pagination of these two rulings show that the decision is ahead of the order admitting the documentary exhibits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[321]</sup> As regards the missing page containing the verification and certification against forum shopping, its alleged accidental detachment from the records could have been proven by a gap in the pagination of the records. No evidence of this sort was offered by Judge Mangrobang.<br><br>Again, in RTC Dasmariñas 90, one petition for the declaration of nullity of marriage was granted even without the appearance of the parties.

Judges are expected to exhibit more than just cursory acquaintance with statutes and procedural laws. They must know the laws and apply them properly in all good faith. Judicial competence requires no less. Thus, unfamiliarity with the rules is a sign of incompetence. Basic rules must be at the palm of his hand. When a judge displays utter lack of familiarity with the rules, he betrays the confidence of the public in the courts. Ignorance of the law is the mainspring of injustice. Judges owe it to the public to be knowledgcahle, hence, they are expected to have more than just a modicum of acquaintance with the statutes and procedural rules; they must know them by heart. When the inefficiency springs from a failure to recognize such a basic and elemental rule, a law or a principle in the discharge of his functions, a judge is either too incompetent and undeserving of the position and the prestigious title he holds or he is too vicious that the oversight or omission was deliberately done in bad faith and in grave abuse of judicial authority. In both cases, the judge's dismissal will be in order.<br></blockquote>But when there is persistent disregard of well-known rules, judges not only become liable for gross ignorance of the law, they commit gross misconduct as well.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[326]</sup> It is then that a mistake can no longer be regarded as a mere error of judgment, but one purely motivated by a wrongful intent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[327]</sup><br><br>The four courts herein have allowed themselves to become havens for "paid-for annulments."

Maranan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[339]</sup> Judge Pelicen was also involved in an alleged pattern of corruption involving the annulment of marriage cases in RTC Imus 20.<br><br>Considering that Judge Cabrera-Faller has already been dismissed from service, and Judges Mangrobang and Pelicen have already compulsorily retired, the penalty of suspension can no longer be imposed on them. Thus, they are hereby ordered to pay a fine in the amount of P80,000 each. Notably, Judge Mangrobang had already passed away. At any rate, the fine shall be deducted from the retirement benefits of Judges Mangrobang and Felicen. The same fine shall be deducted from whatever amounts may still be due Judge Cabrera-Faller.<br><br>The irregularities committed in these administrative cases took place and festered under the watch of Judge Quisumbing. As executive judge, he performs the functions of a court administrator within his administrative area.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[340]</sup> He was supposed to provide leadership and coordinate the management of the courts, as well as implement policies concerning court operations laid down by the Supreme Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[341]</sup> Unfortunately, instead of exercising his prerogatives in ordef that those under his management be kept in line, he joined in the commission of some of the reprehensible practices described in these administrative cases.<br><br>Thus, the Court cannot adopt the recommendation of Justice Paredes to completely absolve Judge Quisumbing of all liability. To note, the <i>sala</i> of Judge Quisumbing was also involved in the irregularities regarding cases where parties had the same address as those in another case. Of the four pairs of parties before the RTC Imus 21 who had the same addresses, three were represented by the same counsels. Judge Quisumbing also failed to observe the mandatory requirement of ordering the investigating public prosecutor to determine whether collusion existed between the parties m cases for the declaration of nullity and atmulment of marriage.<br><br>Nevertheless, considering that his infractions are not as grave as those of the other three judges, he shall be liable for gross ignorance of the law and simple misconduct. In <i>Adriano v. Villanueva</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[342]</sup> a judge found guilty of gross ignorance of the law, simple misconduct, and undue delay in deciding a case was ordered to pay a fine in the amount of P40,000. In the case of Judge Quisumbing, a fine in the amount of P21,000 shall suffice. Considering that he had retired from judicial service, this amount shall be deducted from his retirement benefits.<br><br><b><i>Sheriffs Pagunsan and De Villa; and Process Servers Ferrer, Azcueta and Pontejos</i></b><br><br>We have had occasion to emphasize the importance of the responsibilities of process servers in the efficient and proper administration of justice:<br><blockquote>A process server should be fully cognizant not only of the nature and responsibilities of his task but also of their impact in the speedy administration of justice. It is through the process server that a defendant learns of the action brought against him by the complainant. More importantly, it is through the service of summons of the process server that the trial court acquires jurisdiction over the defendant. As a public officer, the respondent is bound <i>virtute oficii</i> to bring to the discharge of his duties the prudence, caution, and attention which careful men usually exercise in the management of their affairs. Relevant in the case at bar is the salutary reminder from this Court that the image of a court of justice is necessarily mirrored in the conduct, official or otherwise, of the men and women who work thereat, from the judge to the least and lowest of its personnel - hence, it becomes the imperative sacred duty of each and everyone in the court to maintain its good name and standing as a true temple ofjustice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[343]</sup><br></blockquote>Sheriffs and process servers are required to exercise utmost care in seeing to it that all notices assigned to them are duly served upon the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[344]</sup> Their failure to perform their duties can never be excused by a heavy work load.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[345]</sup><br><br>Again, in a line of cases,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[346]</sup> we have ruled that the failure to serve court processes promptly and properly amounts to simple neglect of duty. It is the failure of employees to give their attention to a task expected of them, which thereby shows a disregard of duty resulting from carelessness or indifference.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[347]</sup> On the other hand, there is gross neglect of duty when, from the gravity of the case or the frequency of instances, the neglect becomes so serious in character as to endanger or threaten public welfare.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[348]</sup><br><br>Under the Revised Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[349]</sup> simple neglect of duty is punishable by suspension for one month and one day to six months for the first offense and dismissal from service for the second offense. Gross neglect of duty is punishable by dismissal from service for the first offense.<br><br>We find Sheriffs Pagunsan and De Villa and Process Servers Ferrer, Azcueta, and Pontejos guilty of simple neglect of duty.<br><br>In <i>Holasca v. Pagunsan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[350]</sup> Sheriff Pagunsan was found guilty of gross inefficiency, for which he was suspended for a period of nine months and one day without pay. Since gross inefficiency is closely related to gross neglect, as both involve specific acts of omission on the part of the employee,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[351]</sup> that previous administrative liability shall make this instant administrative infraction a second offense that should merit the severe penalty of dismissal from service.<br><br>In <i>Espero v. De Villa</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[352]</sup> Sheriff De Villa was found guilty of simple neglect of duty for his failure to file a return of a writ of execution and to make periodic reports to the court. The penalty of suspension for a period of one month and one day was meted out to him. As this is already his second offense, Sheriff De Villa should be dismissed from service.<br><br>In <i>Tan v. Azcueta</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[353]</sup> Process Server Azcueta was found guilty of simple neglect of duty and was accordingly reprimanded and warned that a repetition of the same or a similar act shall be dealt with more severely. While mitigating circumstances were appreciated in that case, making the penalty imposed lower than that prescribed by the Revised Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service, there is no question that this is already his second offense. Accordingly, Process Server Azcueta should also be dismissed from service.<br><br>In the case of Process Server Pontejos, he is hereby found guilty of two counts of simple neglect of duty in A.M. Nos. RTJ-11-2301 and RTJ-11-2302. Again under the Revised Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service, if the respondent is found guilty of two charges or counts, the penalty to be imposed shall correspond to the more serious charge or count, and the other shall be considered as an aggravating circumstance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[354]</sup> The presence of an aggravating circumstance shall increase the penalty to the maximum provided under the rules.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[355]</sup> As the maximum of the penalty for simple neglect of duty is dismissal from service, that penalty should be imposed on Process Server Pontejos.<br><br>The foregoing notwithstanding, we have always taken advantage of every opportunity to show compassion and leniency in the imposition of administrative penalties on erring court employees. This is because work is as much a source of one's dignity as it is of one's income. While this Court will never tolerate any act of wrongdoing in the performance of duties, it would not be remiss in its mandate, should it extend just one more chance for court employees to improve their ways. That chance shall be given to Sheriffs Pagunsan and De Villa and to Process Servers Azcueta and Pontejos. They would do well not to waste it.<br><br>The penalty of suspension for a period of one year shall instead be imposed on Sheriff Pagunsan. On the other hand, the penalty of suspension for a period of six months shall be imposed on Sheriff De Villa and Process Servers Azcueta and Pontejos.<br><br>The penalty of suspension for one month and one day shall be meted out to Process Server Ferrer for the instant first offense of simple neglect of duty.<br><br><b><i>Clerks of Court Cordez and Marasigan and OIC Suluen</i></b><br><br>Clerks of Court Marasigan and Cordez in A.M. No. RTJ-11-2302 and OIC Suluen in A.M. No. RTJ-11-2301 are likewise found guilty of simple neglect of duty. They failed to monitor compliance with the rules and regulations governing the performance of duties by court personnel under their administrative supervision. Also, Clerks of Court Marasigan and Cordez failed to exercise the required circumspection prior to issuing certificates of finality in declaratjon of nullity and annulment of marriage cases, considering that notices of the court's decisions had not been served at the time upon the respondents.<br><br>The penalty of suspension tor one month and one day shall be meted out to them for the instant first offense of simple neglect of duty.<br><br>Considering that Clerk of Court Cordez has transferred to another government agency, the penalty of suspension can no longer be imposed on her. Accordingly, in lieu of suspension, a penalty of fine equivalent to her salary for a period of one month shall be imposed.<br><br><b><i>Process Server Azcueta and Social Worker Serilo</i></b><br><br>In <i>Japson v. Civil Service Commission</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[356]</sup> the petitioner therein was a former senior member services representative assigned at the Social Security System (SSS) branch in Baguio City. In conspiracy with others, the petitioner enticed benefit claimants to file their claims before SSS Baguio, where he could guarantee prompt releases because he was assigned at the claims section. As the claimants were residing in outlying provinces, they used in their claim forms the address of the petitioner in Baguio City. When the claims were released, the petitioner was able to secure a chunk of each claimant's benefits.<br><br>In a case for dishonesty, grave misconduct, and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service against the petitioner, the SSS found him guilty on all counts. It ruled that it was not necessary to show concrete proof of the receipt of a consideration for the arrangement, following the principle of <i>res ipsa loquitur</i>. On appeal, the Civil Service Commission ruled that while there was no strong evidence showing that the petitioner received, collected, or took a share from the benefits awarded to the claimants, he was still liable. His irregular conduct and indiscriminate judgment relative to the handling of the claims were found to have caused a serious breach in the integrity of the system observed by the SSS, as well as endangered the welfare of the public at large.<br><br>After the denial of his petition for review before the CA, the petitioner therein came to this Court claiming, among others, that there was no evidence showing that he had specifically authorized any of the claimants involved to use his address. The Court denied the petition for lack of merit. We ruled that his acts clearly reflected his dishonesty and grave misconduct. He was less than forthright in his dealings and led claimants to believe that he could give them undue advantage by processing their claims faster than others without the same connection.<br><br>The surrounding facts in <i>Japson</i> are analogous to those in the case of Process Server Azcueta and Social Worker Serilo. Both involve the use of a government employee's address in order for others to comply with the residence requirement laid down by the rules. In their defense, the petitioner therein and Process Server Azcueta and Social Worker Serilo herein claim that they did not authorize anyone to use their address. As in Japson, the Court's conclusion here shall be the same.<br><br>Considering, however, that the infraction committed by Process Server Azcueta and Social Worker Serilo is not directly connected with the performance of their official duties, they are liable not for misconduct but for conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service. "The word 'prejudicial' means 'detrimental or derogatory to a party; naturally, probably or actually bringing about a wrong result.'"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[357]</sup> Their conduct placed the entire judiciary in a bad light;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[358]</sup> that our rules are easily circumvented by our very own.<br><br>Under the Revised Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service, conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service is punishable by suspension for six months and one day to one year for the first offense and dismissal from service for the second offense. Accordingly, the penalty of suspension for six months and one day shall be meted out to Social Worker Serilo for the instant first offense of conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service.<br><br>As regards Process Server Azcueta, in addition to his suspension for six months for the second offense of simple neglect of duty, the penalty of suspension for six months and one day shall be meted out to him for conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the Court has arrived at the following findings:<br><br>1.

Quisumbing, Jr. who should be exonerated as recommended by Justice Victoria Isabel A. Paredes (Justice Paredes) of the Court of Appeals who, after conducting her investigation, recommended the dismissal of the complaint against Judge Quisumbing. The pertinent portion of the Amended Report of Justice Paredes reads:<br><blockquote><b>Exec. Judge Norberto J. Quisumbing, Jr., RTC, Branch 21, Imus, Cavite</b><br><br>The judicial audit examined 62 case records, of which 19, or 30% have indications of improper venue. In <b>Civil Case No. 2329-08</b> (<i>Cruz vs. De la Vega</i>), the petitioner therein claimed that she is a resident of Dasmariñas, Cavite, while the respondent is a resident of Valenzuela City; however, the verification portion stated that the petition is to be filed in the RTC of Pasay City which could only mean that the petitioner is a resident of Pasay City. In <b>Civil Case No. 2691-09</b> (<i>Quiamson vs. Quiamson</i>), the petitioner claims to be a resident of Dasmariñas, Cavite, but in the verification portion, the petitioner stated that she is a resident of Silang, Cavite, a place outside the jurisdiction of the court. Nine (9) cases had vague addresses albeit there is no indication that mail matters were "returned to sender"; while in eight (8) petitions, three (3) pairs showed that petitioners had the same addresses, and one (1) pair had respondents sharing the same address. In <b>Civil Case No. 3026-09</b> (<i>Ramales vs. Ramales</i>), the petition states that both parties are already based in Italy. The judicial affidavit of petitioner was allegedly taken before petitioner's counsel in Salcedo Village, Makati City; however, verification from the Bureau of Immigration shows that petitioner left for abroad on July 18, 2002 with no record of having returned to the country thereafter. The judicial affidavit was admitted without the appearance of petitioner.<br><br>Exec. Judge Quisumbing, Jr. comments that three (3) cases were raffled to RTC-Branch 90 presided by Judge Faller. On the other hand, cases mentioned in pages 59-62 (Records, A.M. No. RTJ-11-2302, pp. 555-558) were those handled by his Branch (21).<br><br>Commenting on Civil Cases No. 2329-08, 2733-09, 2057-09 and 3441-10, Exec. Judge Quisumbing, Jr. claims that venue was properly laid as the petitioners were residents of Dasmariñas, Cavite, and respondents were duly notified either personally or by substituted service, and those who received the summons and copy of the petition indicated receipt with their signatures; moreover, none of the respondents or the public prosecutor questioned the venue. In Civil Case No. 2329-08, the audit team observed that the verification portion states that the petition is to be filed in Pasay City; however, the verification is not controlling; the address stated in the petition, as well as petitioner's testimony in open court, is that she is a resident of Unit 142 Orchard Townhomes, Salawag, Dasmariñas, Cavite. In Civil Case No. 2691-09, the audit team observed that the verification portion shows that petitioner is a resident of Silang, Cavite; however, the petition states that petitioner is a resident of Dasmariñas, Cavite and the residence of the respondent is at 348 B. Ocullo St., Wakas I, Kawit, Cavite, which is within the territorial jurisdiction of the Imus, Cavite RTC courts. In Civil Case No. 2136-08, the audit team observed that petitioner gave a vague address - San Juan St., Dasmariñas, Cavite; however, at the given street address, houses thereat have no nwnbers.<br><br>With respect to <b>Civil Case No. 3026-09</b> (<i>Elizabeth Ramales vs. Aquilino Ramales</i>) where the petitioner swore to her judicial affidavit before the notary public who also happened to be her counsel, and that petitioner could not have testified in court for, per records of the BI, petitioner left on July 18, 2002 and has no record of travel back to the country, Exec. Judge Quisumbing, Jr. sees no irregularity in the execution of the judicial affidavit of petitioner for what is prohibited by the Rules is the lawyer who executes a judicial affidavit, signs it and notarizes it; in such a case, the affidavit must be notarized by another notary public. He disavows knowledge of the BI certification, but he knows that on July 19, 2010, a person who introduced herself as the petitioner, swore under oath and testified in open court; no one questioned her identity and the court cannot be required to look into the identity of each and every witness who testifies in court.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The cases mentioned in pages 32-34, Table 2.2 of the OCA Memorandum (Records, A.M. No. RTJ-11-2302, pp. 528-30), pertain to cases handled by RTC-Branch 90 under Judge Faller; while the cases mentioned in pages 66-69 (Records, A.M. No. RTJ-11-2302, pp. 562-5) were handled by Judge Mangrobang of RTC-Branch 22. In <b>Civil Case No. 2329-08</b>, summons was received by respondent thru his mother, Shirley de la Vega, on October 15, 2008 as evidenced by her signature at the bottom of the summons; in <b>Civil Case No. 2733-09</b>, summons was served to the respondent thru his niece, Irene P. Siglos, on April 23, 2009 as evidenced by her signature at the bottom of the summons. In <b>Civil Case No. 2136-09</b>, the audit team observed that the petitioner's address at San Juan St., Dasmariñas, Cavite, is vague; however, the street really do not have house numbers, and the marriage certificate likewise states the same address for petitioner. In nos. 10-15, pp. 30-31 ((Records, A.M. No. RTJ-11-2302, pp. 526-27) of the OCA Memorandum, the audit team found the addresses in Cavite, vague; however, the addresses are by Block no. And Lot no., the way addresses in Cavite are stated. In nos. 16 and 17, p. 31 (Records, A.M. No. RTJ-11-2302, p. 527), referring to <b>Civil Case Nos. 3490-10</b> and <b>3558-10</b>, where petitioners allegedly reside at the same address, Exec. Judge Quisumbing, Jr. claims that there is a possibility that petitioners did live in the same address since they have the same action for declaration of nullity of their marriage, and they live separately from their spouses. In nos. 18-19, p. 31 (Records, A.M. No. RTJ-11-2302, p. 527), <b>Civil Case Nos. 3636-10</b> and <b>3786-10</b>, where the audit team observed that the petitioners bear the same address in these cases, since the address given does not bear a house number, it is possible that the petitioners lived in the same street but at different houses. In <b>Civil Case Nos. 2733-09</b> and <b>3208-09</b>, where respondents were observed to have the same address, Exec. Judge Quisumbing, Jr. explains that at one time, one of the petitioners may have lived in that address on a given date.<br><br>The investigation reports usually state that no collusion exists; however, in five cases where publication was resorted to in the service of summons, the investigation reports mentioned that the public prosecutor cannot determine whether collusion exists, but the public prosecutor undertakes to participate in the prosecution of the case; while in five (5) other cases, the public prosecutor only made reservations to actively prosecute the case. In 13 cases, no investigation report could be found.<br><br>The proceedings in the office of the Provincial Prosecutor are not under the direct control and supervision of the court; moreover, Section 9 of the Rule on Marriage does not provide any form or procedure in the conduct of the collusion investigation, and it does not provide the manner the investigation is conducted. And, although the Rule requires the public prosecutor to state the basis of his finding that collusion exists, it is silent if his finding is that no collusion exists. In his manifestation, the public prosecutor stated that: <i>He deems it best to pursue the investigation of this case by active participation in the hearing and trial of the case, this, considering the inability of the respondent to file (a response to the petition)</i>.<br><br>Of the 62 cases examined, 15 cases or 24% of petitions were granted at extraordinary speed: 1 case was decided in a little over 2 months; 1 case decided in 3 months; and 1 case in 4 months; 7 cases in a little over 5 months; while 5 cases were decided in a little over 6 months. [The comparative finding of Justice Paredes on this matter states:]<br><blockquote>In this case, the four (4) judges, to a man, although in varying percentages, granted petitions for the declaration of nullity of marriage in less than six (6) months. Judge Felicen was 77%; Exec. Judge Quisumbing, Jr. had 24%; Judge Mangrobang was 39%, and having the dubious title of granting a petition in 25 days from its filing [re: <b>Civil Case No. 2434-08</b> (<i>Olarte vs. Olarte</i>)]; finally, Judge Faller was 57%.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br></blockquote>Executive Judge Quisumbing, Jr. finds nothing wrong with adhering to the exhortations of the Supreme Court for the speedy disposition of cases in order to unclog the court's dockets. He pleads that the alleged "irregularities" found by the audit team are neither gross, blatant nor flagrant, but more of inadvertence and oversight which could have been easily corrected; thus, he prays that he be accorded the presumption of regularity in the faithful performance of his duties, and the charge against him be dismissed.<br><br>With respect to the findings regarding the questionable raffling of cases, he disavows any participation in the issuance of summons as these pertain to the particular branches (RTC-Branch 20 for Judge Felicen, and RTC-Branch 90 for Judge Faller). As Executive Judge, he supervises the raffle of cases, sees to it that a report is made after the raffle, signs the minutes of raffle and oversees the transmittal of the cases to the concerned court. In <b>Civil Case No. 1852-08</b> (<i>Resco-Del Rosario vs. Del Rosario</i>), he admits that the stamp "February 24, 2008" was an oversight. The petition was filed with the OCC on February 1, 2008; and the official receipts showing payment of legal fees and other fees and dues were made on February 2, 2008; the additional number "4" in "2.1" is a clear case of oversight. <b>SP No. 680-09</b> (<i>In Re Petition for the Adoption of Minor Paulo Lebaste</i>) was mistakenly transmitted to RTC-Branch 20, instead of RTC­ Branch 22 whish has original and exclusive jurisdiction over family court cases; the Branch Clerk of Court (BCC) of RTC-Branch 20 sent a transmittal letter dated January 26, 2009 to the BCC of RTC-Branch 22; and although there is no stamp received on the face of the record, a notice of hearing was sent on March 5, 2009 by RTC-Branch 22.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br></blockquote>It bears to stress that the acts of a judge which pertain to his/her judicial functions are not subject to disciplinary power unless they are committed with fraud, dishonesty, corruption or bad faith.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> As a matter of policy, in the absence of fraud, dishonesty or corruption, the acts of a judge in his/her judicial capacity are not subject to disciplinary action even though such acts are erroneous.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Otherwise, a judicial office would be untenable, for "no one called upon to try the facts or interpret the law in the administration of justice can be infallible."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> He/she cannot be subjected to liability - civil, criminal, or administrative - for any of his/her official acts, no matter how erroneous, as long as he/she acts in good faith. In such a case, the remedy of the aggrieved party is not to file an administrative complaint against the judge but to elevate the error to the higher court for review and correction,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> because an administrative complaint is not an appropriate remedy where judicial recourse is still available.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> The court has to be shown acts or conduct of the judge clearly indicative of arbitrariness or prejudice before the latter can be branded the stigma of being biased and partial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Not every error or mistake that a judge committed in the performance of his/her duties renders him/her liable, unless he/she is shown to have acted in bad faith or with deliberate intent to do an injustice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Otherwise, perhaps, no judge, however competent, honest or dedicated he/she may be, can ever hope to retire from the judiciary with an unblemished record.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Regarding the improper service of summons, the same falls within the responsibility of Sheriff Wilmar M. de Villa of RTC-Branch 21, Imus, Cavite. Investigating Justice Paredes found Sheriff de Villa guilty of simple neglect of duty and abuse of authority and recommended that a fine of P5,000.00 be imposed on him for each of the charges with stem warning that a repetition of the same or similar offense shall be dealt with more severely.<br><br>Unlike in the case of Judge Fernando L. Felicen, Judge Cesar A. Mangrobang and Judge Perla V. Cabrera-Paller who were found by Investigating Justice Paredes to be guilty of grave abuse of authority, for which they should be administratively sanctioned, Executive Judge Quisumbing was recommended for exoneration as follows:<br><blockquote>II. (Ret.) EXECUTIVE JUDGE NORBERTO J. QUISUMBING, JR., the complaint/charge in A.M. No. RTJ-11-2302 be <b>DISMISSED</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br></blockquote>There was no proof at all that Executive Judge Quisumbing was guilty of grave abuse of authority nor of fraud, dishonesty, corruption or bad faith to merit the extreme penalty of forfeiture of all his retirement benefits.<br><br>Moreover, it is unfair to hold Executive Judge Quisumbing who was the Executive Judge administratively liable for the offenses or infraction committed by Judges Felicen, Mangrobang, and Faller, over whom he had no control and supervision. The aforesaid Judges exercised jurisdiction over cases raffled to them independently of the Executive Judge. To hold Executive Judges administratively responsible for the conduct of Judges within their respective area will send a chilling effect on Executive Judges as it will go far beyond the official duties imposed on them by Supreme Court regulations.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, I respectfully reiterate my opinion that as recommended by Investigating Justice Victoria Isabel A. Paredes the complaint/charge in A.M. No. 11-2302 against Executive Judge Norberto J. Quisumbing, Jr. be <b>DISMISSED</b>.<br><br><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="noshade" align="LEFT"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo</i> (A.M.
