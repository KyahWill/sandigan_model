that appellant's motion for reconsideration was filed on February 1, 1969, or
50 days after the rendition of the decision appealed from on December 13, 1968,
and does not state the dates when the defendants received copy of said decision
and notice of the order of July 14, 1967, denying their motion for
reconsideration of said decision, so that "the record on appeal fails to
disclose on its face that the appeal was perfected within the period fixed by the
Rules." The defendants, accordingly, filed with the Supreme Court a
petition for certiorari to review the resolution of the Court of Appeals
dismissing their aforementioned appeal and to compel said appellate court to
entertain and decide said appeal on the merits.</p>

may be taken by serving upon the adverse party and filing with the trial court,
within thirty (30) days from notice of order or judgment, a notice of appeal,
an appeal bond, and a record on appeal," and that, "(<span class="SpellE">i</span>)f the notice of appeal, the appeal bond and the record on
appeal have been filed in due time, the appeal is deemed perfected upon the
approval of the record on appeal and of the appeal bond other than a cash bond,

appeal that the notices of appeal, appeal bond and record of appeal were filed
within 30 days from notice of the appealed order, after deducting the period
during which the motions for reconsideration were pending, as required by Rule
41, section 3.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The deficiencies pointed out are fatal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the reason that in ordinary appeals the
original record is not forwarded to the appellate court, and because the dates
when an applicant received the notice of the per­tinent orders or judgment
under appeal, and of the de­nial of his motions for reconsideration or new
trial, are facts within the exclusive knowledge of said appellant, the Revised
Rules of Court place upon the appel­lant the burden of showing that his appeal
is timely, and for that purpose prescribe (Rule 41, sec. 6) that the record of
appeal shall include 'such data as will show that the appeal was perfected on
time.' This requirement is mandatory and jurisdictional, for un­less appeal is
perfected on time the appellate court acquires no jurisdiction over the
appealed case, and has power only to dismiss the appeal (<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bello</span></st1:place></st1:city> vs. Fer­nando, L-16970, <st1:date year="1962" day="30" month="1">Jan. 30, 1962</st1:date>; <span class="SpellE">Caisip</span>

<p class="BODY">Elucidating on the background of Sec. 6 of Rule 41, this Court
pointed out, in a subsequent case:<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"In this connection, it should be noted that, prior to the
promulgation of the Rules of Court now in force, the first sentence of Section
6 of Rule 41, was as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="text-indent: 0in;">'The full names of all the parties to the
pro­ceeding shall be stated in the caption of the record on appeal, and it
shall include the or­der or judgment from which the appeal is taken, and, in
chronological order, copies of all pleadings, petitions, motions and all
interlocutory orders relating to the appealed order or judgment.'<b><o:p></o:p></b></p>

<blockquote>"This Court noticed, however, that issues were often raised in
appellate courts on whether the appeal had been perfected on time or not, owing
to the fact that the data pertinent thereto were not set forth in the record on
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch as the records of trial
courts, in cases appealed by record on appeal, are not forward­ed to appellate
courts, the latter had no means of checking or verifying the conflicting
allegations of fact made, either in the briefs, or in the motion to dismiss the
ap­peal and the opposition thereto, filed by the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a consequence, appellate courts had to
examine such evi­dence as the parties may have submitted thereto, in sup­port
of their respective contentions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
entailed additional work and unnecessary waste of time, that con­tributed to
the delay in the final determination of ap­pealed cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To eliminate such obstacles to the speedy
administration of justice, this Court deemed it best, not only to rephrase the
first sentence of said Section 6, so as to read:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="text-indent: 0in;">'The full names of all the parties to the
pro­ceedings shall be stated in the caption of the record on appeal and it
shall include the or­der or judgment from which the appeal is taken, and, in
chronological order, copies of only such pleadings, petitions, motions and all
interlocutory orders as are related to the appealed order or judgment and neces­sary
for the proper understanding of the issue involved.'</p>

<blockquote>but, also, to add, at the end thereof, the
clause:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="text-indent: 0in;">'together with such data as will show that
the appeal was perfected on time.'</p>

<blockquote>"Obviously, this amendment would become use­less and its
purpose completely defeated, if we gave thereto the interpretation advocated by
the main respondent herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other
words, we would have the same issues and the same waste of time that were
sought to be eliminated by the amendment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, our ruling in Government vs. Antonio (<u>supra</u>), which, it
should be noted, was made, not in a decision, but, in a resolution, so that the
public may know imme­diately - instead of waiting for the decision on the
merits, which might require more time - the effect of said amendment, and the
injurious consequences of a failure to grasp its full import could thus be
minimized."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We have time and again reiterated this stand, and stressed the
mandatory and jurisdictional nature of the requirements con­tained in Sec. 6 of
Rule 41 of the Rules of Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a> What is more, in a recently decided
case,<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a> We
added:</p>

<blockquote>"It may not be amiss to point out that, in making the
amendment adverted to above, We have not over­looked the fact that oftentimes
the record on appeal is approved without any objection on the part of the <span class="SpellE">appel­lee</span>, who, it has, sometimes, been urged, should be
deemed to be in <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>, in consequence of his afore­mentioned
failure to question the appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
notwith­standing, We have deemed and still deem it best to maintain the
aforementioned view, not only because the theory of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>
cannot apply when all of the par­ties concerned are aware of the relevant facts
- and the appellant as well as the trial court are supposed to know whether or
not the requisite steps for the per­fection of an appeal have been seasonably
taken - but, also, because, otherwise, the decision or final order complained
of becomes final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, so that the trial
court has no jurisdiction to sanction an appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
and the appellate court is devoid of juris­diction to entertain the appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well-settled is the rule that the
jurisdiction over a case or matter may be questioned at any stage of the
proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the language of
Government v. Antonio, (<u>supra</u>) 'the certi­fication of the record on
appeal by the trial court, after expiration of the period to appeal cannot
restore the jurisdiction which has been lost.'"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Applying the foregoing views, from which We find no reason to
depart, We hold that the Court of Appeals did not err in dismiss­ing the appeal
involved in L-28783, for failure of petitioner's re­cord on appeal to state
that he had posted an appeal bond and the date on which he had done so, the
filing of said bond within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period
being one of the essential conditions for the per­fection of an appeal,
pursuant to <span class="SpellE">Secs</span>. 3 and 9, of Rule 41.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner maintains that the Court of Appeals "erred, in
failing to apply the provisions of Section 7 of Rule 41," which al­legedly
"requires both the trial court and the respondent x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> to direct the amendment of the record on appeal by
the inclusion of any matter omitted therein which are deemed essential to the
de­termination of any issue of fact or law" in the appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said Sec­tion 7 does not, however,
"require" the trial court to give the aforementioned directive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The issuance thereof is merely dis­cretionary
for the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, said provision
refers to matters "essential to the determination of the issue of law or
fact involved in the appeal" <u>taken by the appellant</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appeal bond was not essential to the
issues sought to be raised by <u>petitioner herein</u>, as appellant in the
main case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Similarly, the Court of Appeals was justified in dismissing the
appeal involved in L-28818 for failure of the record on appeal, filed by
petitioners therein, to state the date of the filing of their original record
on appeal, although such date must have been stamped on said original record on
appeal, which remained in the lower court, the one forwarded to the Court of
Appeals being the joint record on appeal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In this connection, We had occasion to state, in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Valera</span></st1:place></st1:city> v. Court of Appeals, <u>supra</u>,
which is squarely in point:</p>

<blockquote>"The first ground might have a semblance of validity had the
record on appeal approved by the lower court and certified to the Court of
Appeals been the <u>Original</u> Record on Appeal, for the date on which it was
filed would appear stamped thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the case at bar, the Court of Appeals had no more than the <u>Amended</u>
Record on Appeal, which was submitted subsequently to the Original Record on
Appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The date of the filing thereof
does <u>not</u> appear in the records of the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, said date could have and should
have been stated in the Amended Re­cord on Appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The certification by the Clerk of the trial
court, to the effect that the original record on appeal had been filed on <st1:date year="1966" day="7" month="1">January 7, 1966</st1:date>, is not suf­ficient to
cure the defect of the amended record on appeal."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">According to petitioners' joint record on appeal, copy of the
decision of the Court of First Instance, dated June 27, 1966, was received by
them on July 7, 1966; twenty-seven (27) days later, or on August 3, 1966, they
filed their notice of appeal; the next day, or August 4, 1966, they filed their
appeal bond; and on <u>Sep­tember 14, 1966</u>, or two (2) months and seven (7)
days after notice of said decision, the joint record on appeal was filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, with­out the dates of the filing of
the original record on appeal, the order of the trial court authorizing the
filing of the joint record and the period therein given, if any, it is not
possible to determine whether the appeal had been perfected on time.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears from the record on appeal involved in L-29225 that the
decision of the court of first instance was rendered "under date of July
17, 1964"; that appellant <span class="SpellE">Laperal</span> had filed her
notice of ap­peal "under date of September 19, 1964" or about 62 days
after the rendition of said decision, dated July 17, 1964; and that the appeal
bond had, also, been paid to the Clerk of Court on September 19, 1964, which
is, likewise, the date of the record on appeal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Since, the record on appeal does not state the dates when appellant
received copy of said decision and filed her record on appeal, it is not
possible to determine, on the face thereof, whether or not the appeal had been
perfected on time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the Court
of Appeals was justified in dismissing, in CA-G.R. No. 35634-R, <span class="SpellE">Laperal's</span> appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
fact, her counsel impliedly concedes this, except that, he claims, a dif­ferent
norm has been applied by the trial court in connection with the appeal therein
taken by plaintiff Herrera, which is the subject-matter of L-29731.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards said appeal of Herrera, the aforementioned record on
appeal shows: that Herrera received copy of the appealed decision on August 21,
1964; that he had, therefore, up to September 20, 1964, to perfect his appeal;
that twenty-eight (28) days later, or on Sep­tember 18, 1964, he filed a motion
for reconsideration of said decision; that, pending resolution of said motion,
or on October 7, 1964, Herrera filed his notice of appeal and cash bond, with a
petition for "an additional period of 15 days from the date of expiry of
the sus­pended period to appeal, the suspension being due to the
non-receipt" of the resolution of his motion for reconsideration; that, on
the same date, October 7, 1964, he filed another motion to suspend the period
within which to perfect his appeal and for "an additional period of 15
days from the expiration of the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period,
as suspended, within which to perfect his appeal"; that on October 24,
1964, the trial court issued an order denying Herrera's motion for reconsidera­tion
and granting him "an extension of ten (10) days from receipt" of said
order "within which to submit his Record on Appeal"; that on October
26, 1964, said court approved the record on appeal submitted by the defendants;
and that Herrera filed a supplemental record on appeal dated November 9, 1964,
adopting "as his own" the record on appeal filed by the defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the date of receipt of the order of
October 24, 1964, granting plaintiff ten (10) days from notice thereof, and the
date of the filing of plaintiff's supplemental record on appeal, dated November
9, 1964, or 16 days later, are not given in such record on appeal, the data therein
contained are insufficient to show that plain­tiff's appeal has been perfected
on time.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main issue in L-29753 differs from that of the other cases
disposed of in this decision, in that the sufficiency of the facts set forth in
the record on appeal involved in L-29753 was assailed in and passed upon by the
trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the data lacking
in said record on appeal - date on which petitioners herein received copy of
the order of said court dated February 24, 1968, denying their motion for new trial
- is supposed to be available in the record of Civil Case No. 336 of the same
court which was before respondent Judge.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There can be no question, therefore, that <u>he</u> <u>could</u>
determine, by examining the whole record before him, what said date was and, consequently,
whether or not the appeal had been perfected on time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He seems to be, however, under the impression
that - even if said record warranted an affirmative answer - he could not order
the amendment of petitioners' record on appeal by the insertion therein of the
date on which they had received copy of his order aforementioned.</p>

<p class="BODY">The reason for this impression of respondent Judge seems to be
that, since the requirements of section 6, Rule 41 of the Rules of Court, are
"mandatory and jurisdictional," a record on appeal that fails to
comply with said requirement is a worthless piece of paper which does not
suspend the running of the period to perfect the appeal, so that, upon the
expiration thereof - as, he claims, in the case at bar - he may no longer order
the amendment of the record on appeal for the completion of the data lacking in
the original record on appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have held that the provision in section 6 of Rule 41 - to the
effect that the record on appeal should, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>,
state "such data as will show that the appeal was perfected on time"
- is "mandatory and jurisdictional," in the sense that, if the appeal
is not so perfected, the decision or final order sought to be reviewed would
have become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, so that the <u>appellate</u>
court would have <u>no</u> <u>jurisdiction</u> to entertain the appeal, and
that, accordingly, com­pliance with said requirement is "mandatory,"
in view of which, failure of the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> to object
to the approval of the record on appeal would not bar him from asking the
appellate court to dismiss the appeal for non-compliance with the
aforementioned requirement.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then, again, one other reason for the requirement under con­sideration
is that, in cases appealed by record on appeal, the original record of the case
remains in the trial court, so that the <u>appellate</u> court has <u>no</u> <u>means</u>
of determining - if the record on ap­peal does not comply with said Rule -
whether or not the appeal has been duly perfected, unless evidence thereon were
introduced, and this, precisely, is sought to be avoided by section 6 of Rule
41.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the reception of such
evidence would consume time which is badly needed by appellate courts for other
cases and more meritorious issues and could be saved by complying with the
provisions of said section.<i><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">In the light of the spirit and purpose thereof, We hold,
therefore, that the filing of petitioners' record on appeal, with the
deficiency adverted to above, suspended the running of the period to perfect
their appeal and that the Court of Appeals has not erred in ordering the trial
court to permit an amendment of said record on appeal so as to state therein
the date when petitioners received notice of the order denying their motion for
new trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be noted, moreover, that the appeal by certiorari to
the Supreme Court, docketed therein as L-29753, has been taken, not by any of
the parties in the main case,<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a> but by respondent Judge, who is
merely a nominal party in the present action for certiorari and mandamus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He has been included as respondent therein in
compliance with section 5 of Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, which provides that
-</p>

<blockquote>"When the petition filed relates to the acts or omissions of a
court or judge, the petitioner shall join, as parties defendant with such court
or judge, the person or persons interested in sustaining the proceedings in the
court; and it shall be the duty of such person or persons to appear and defend,
both in his or their own behalf and in behalf of the court or judge affected by
the proceedings, and costs awarded in such proceedings in favor of the
petitioner shall be against the person or persons in interest only, and not
against the court or judge."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is clear from this provision that respondent Judge is not a
person "in interest", within the purview thereof, and that, accord­ingly,
he has no standing or authority to appeal from or seek a review on certiorari
of the decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. No. 41577-R, although, in
taking such step, he was motivated by the best of intentions.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to L-29970, the record on appeal in CA-G.R. No.
41825-R shows that the decision in Civil Case No. 68339 of the court of first
instance of Manila was rendered on January 29, 1968; that, twenty eight (28)
days later, or on February 26, 1968, Dominguez filed his notice of appeal from
said decision, as well as his appeal bond; that, forty six (46) days later, or
on May 14, 1968, said court issued an order directing Dominguez to make in his
record on appeal, within five (5) days from receipt of copy of said order, the
corrections specified in said order; that on May 18, 1968, Dominguez filed a
motion to be allowed to make said corrections, in open court, on the original
record on appeal, the corrections specified in the order of May 14, 1968 being
due to mere typographical errors; that on May 25, 1968, the court issued an
order directing the submission of a corrected record on appeal within five (5)
days from said date; and that Domin­guez filed an amended record on appeal
dated May 29, 1968, which was set for hearing on June 8, 1968, and approved on
June 20, 1968.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch as the amended
record on appeal does not state the dates on which Dominguez received copy of
the decision dated <st1:date year="1968" day="29" month="1">January 29, 1968</st1:date>
and filed the original record on appeal, it is not possible to ascertain from
the amended record on appeal whether or not the appeal had been perfected on
time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals did not err,
therefore, in dismissing said appeal, pursuant to section 6 of Rule 41 and Sec.
1(a) of Rule 50 of the Rules of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then, again, according to the record on appeal in CA-G.R. No.
42266, which is involved in L-30525, the decision in civil case No. 8613 of the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> was rendered on <st1:date year="1966" day="13" month="12">December 13, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Forty eight (48) days later, or on <st1:date year="1967" day="1" month="2">February 1, 1967</st1:date>, the defendants filed
a motion for new trial, which was denied on <st1:date year="1967" day="18" month="2">February 18, 1967</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thirteen (13) days later, or on <st1:date year="1967" day="3" month="3">March
 3, 1967</st1:date>, the defendants filed a motion for reconsideration, which
was denied on <st1:date year="1967" day="14" month="7">July 14, 1967</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendants filed a record on appeal dated
<st1:date year="1967" day="21" month="7">July 21, 1967</st1:date>, which was
approved in an order dated <st1:date year="1968" day="21" month="3">March 21,
 1968</st1:date>, stating that the requisite notice of appeal, appeal bond and
record on appeal had been filed, without specifying the dates on which each act
had been performed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering that
forty eight (48) days had elapsed from the rendition of the decision to the
filing of the motion for new trial; that thirteen (13) days had elapsed from
the date of denial of said motion to that of the filing of the motion for
reconsideration; and that seven (7) days had elapsed from the denial of said
motion for recon­sideration to July 21, 1967, the date of the record on appeal,
which must have been filed still later, for despite the absence of any oppo­sition
thereto, it was not approved until March 21, 1968, it is manifest that the
silence of the record on appeal as regards the dates when the defendants:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) received a) copy of the decision of
December 13, 1966, b) notice of the order of February 18, 1967, denying their
motion for new trial, and c) notice of the order denying their motion for recon­sideration;
and (2) filed their record on appeal, renders it impossible to determine, from
an examination of the record on appeal, whether or not the appeal had been
perfected on time.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards L-31054, the Government maintains that the state­ment
made by His Honor, the Trial Judge, in his order approving the record on
appeal, to the effect that the joint record on appeal, the notice of appeal and
the appeal bond had been filed "within the period" prescribed <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, suffices to comply with the require­ments of Sec.
6 of Rule 41.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This pretense is
untenable, said state­ment being a mere <u>conclusion</u>, not a <u>fact</u>
indicative of the seasonable perfection of the appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true that the notice of appeal filed by
the Government stated the dates on which it received notice of the decision of
the trial court, filed its motion for reconsideration of said decision and
received notice of the order denying the same.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such statement constitutes a substantial compliance with the requirements
of Sec. 6 of Rule 41, as regards the events to which said dates refer, but the
record on appeal is still deficient, insofar as it does not mention the
extension of time given for the filing of the joint record on appeal and the
duration of said exten­sion.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, said joint record on appeal shows that on October 2,
1968, the Government received copy of the decision of the court of first
instance, dated September 23, 1968; that 26 days later, or on October 28, 1968,
the Government filed its motion for reconsidera­tion of said decision; that
notice of the order denying said motion for reconsideration was received by the
Government on January 13, 1969; that the Government filed its notice of appeal
on January 14, 1969; that the Government had been given an extension of time -
the length of which is not stated - within which to file a record on appeal;
and that the joint record on appeal bears the date, March 4, 1969, or about 49
days after notice of the denial of the motion for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In short, without a statement of the date of
the filing of the original record on appeal, of the length of the ex­tension of
time granted for the filing of the joint record on appeal, and of the date of
the filing thereof, it is not possible to establish whether or not the appeal
had been perfected on time.</p>

<p class="BODY">The printed record on appeal in L-31510 does not show the date on
which it was filed with the trial court, but such date is stamped on the
original record on appeal, which was approved by said court and forwarded to
the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 6, Rule 41
of the Rules of Court, obviously refers to the record on appeal filed with the
trial court, not to the record on appeal printed in the appellate court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, the Court of Appeals is in a
position to determine the date aforementioned, by examining the original record
on appeal thereto forwarded, and, hence, forming part of its own records.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, petitioner's record on appeal
meets the objective of said provision of the Rules of Court, which may be
deemed to have been substantially complied with.</p>

<p class="BODY">The amended record on appeal in L-31875 does not state either the
date when the original record on appeal was filed or the date when appellant
received notice of the order directing that said record on appeal be
amended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, it does not show
that the appeal has been perfected on time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioners argue that this deficiency has been offset by the order
approving the record on appeal, which states "that the plaintiffs have
filed an amended record on appeal <u>in</u> <u>compliance</u> <u>with</u> the
order of June 3, 1969," and that said record on appeal is "in
order," in view of which it was approved.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This statement in said order does not suffice to cure the defect of the
record on appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed - apart from
being a mere conclusion, not a fact serving as a premise <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
- the statement about compliance with the order of June 3, 1969 - the contents
of which are neither reproduced in the record on appeal nor described therein -
simply means that petitioners herein had made in the record on appeal the
amendments directed in said order.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, the aforementioned statement does not supply sufficient
data to enable the appellate court to determine whether or not the appeal had
been perfected <u>on</u> <u>time</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
other words, said statement did not forestall the issues that were sought to be
avoided by Sec. 6 of Rule 41.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record on appeal involved in L-32395 does not state the date
on which the requisite appeal bond had been filed, not even whe­ther or not
petitioners therein had filed said appeal bond.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, it is not possible to determine, upon examination of the record on
appeal, whether or not they had seasonably perfected their appeal, which was
properly dismissed by the trial court.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">TEEHANKEE, <i>J.</i>:<span style="font-weight: normal;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">I respectfully submit that the respondent court of appeals'
resolutions dismissing the appeal of the Government should be set aside for the
following considerations:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">1.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">There was concededly substantial
compliance on the Govern­ment's part with the requirements of Rule 41, section
6 that the re­cord on appeal must show "such data as will show that the
appeal was perfected on time." Thus, its notice of appeal, duly incorporated
in the record on appeal (at pp. 292-293), duly state the dates on which it
received notice of the trial court's decision, filed its motion for
reconsideration and received notice of the order of denial thereof.</span></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">2.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">The only deficiency which the
appellate court noted at its own instance and made the basis for its order of
dismissal was that the record on appeal does not indicate "when the
defendants filed a motion for extension within which to file the record on
appeal nor does it indicate how long an extension was granted." The trial
court's own order of March 15, 1969 approving the record on appeal (at p. 297)
expressly makes of record "that the defendants had filed a joint record on
appeal, notice of appeal and appeal bond <u>within the period</u>, defendant
Director of Building and Real Property Management <u>having been granted an
extension within which to file a record on appeal</u>."</span></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">3.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">Plaintiffs-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
(herein private respondents) themselves did not raise in their motion for
dismissal with the appellate court any such alleged deficiency of the record on
appeal concerning the ex­tension of time and the length thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only ground for dismissal alleged by them
as against the Government's appeal was that "the said appeal is frivolous,
dilatory and malicious." (Annex F, Petition; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 50).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They may therefore be held now
in <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> as to the alleged deficiency, which they
never questioned in the first instance - after the Government had with the
private defendant-appellant defrayed the cost of printing the voluminous
298-page record on appeal and filed in due course, as required, the necessary
number of printed copies thereof with the appellate court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(See <span class="SpellE">Dequito</span> vs.
Lopez, L-27757, March 20, 1968).</span></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">4.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">Substantial and important legal
issues and factual questions appear to be involved in the subject case, which
merit the granting of due opportunity to the Government to pursue its appeal
and secure a decision on the merits thereof from the appellate court, rather
than the summary dismissal of its appeal for a ground not even advanced or
raised by respondents-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> in their dismissal
motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Solicitor-General summarizes
in his petition (at p. 18) the issues raised in the Government's appeal, as
follows:</span></p>

<blockquote>"The legal issue centers around the status of lands reclaimed
from the sea as a result of certain works done by the government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is herein <span class="GramE">peti­tioner's</span>
thesis that lands having disappeared on account of gradual erosion due to the
ebb and flow of tide and subsequently reclaimed by the government are public
lands.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Questions of facts also abound in the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner herein had adduced evidence
showing that the subject lots even before World War II began to erode due to
the action of the sea (<st1:place><st1:placename>Manila</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Bay</st1:placetype></st1:place>);
that when the lots were completely submerged, pri­vate respondents herein never
took steps to protect the lots; they likewise did not register any objection to
the reclamation project of the government.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"These are some facts supported by the evidence but which the
lower court failed to appreciate fully--hence the appeal.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Certainly, with this important legal issue and questions of
facts no amount of reasoning can support the charge that the appeal is
'frivolous, malicious and dilatory.'"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">I therefore vote for the granting of the petition at bar and the
issuance of the writ of certiorari and mandamus, as prayed for.</p>
