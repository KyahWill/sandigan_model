				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Original petition for certiorari with a prayer for the issuance
of a writ of preliminary injunction filed by the People of the Philippines
against the Honorable Jorge R. <span class="SpellE">Coquia</span>, in his
capacity as Presiding Judge of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span> (<span class="SpellE">Mamburao</span>) and the other
respondents <span class="SpellE">Diosdado</span> de <span class="SpellE">Atras</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Arrostre</span> <span class="SpellE">Callanga</span>, <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> <span class="SpellE">Go­rospe</span>, Faustino <span class="SpellE">Valeroso</span>, Jose <span class="SpellE">Encarnacion</span>,
Rodolfo Bernar­do, and three others of <span class="GramE">unknown</span>
identity, praying that, after proper proceedings, the respondent judge be
ordered to dis­charge Rodolfo Bernardo, one of several defendants in Cri­minal
Case No. R-837, for murder, of the <span class="SpellE">abovenamed</span> court,
so that he may testify therein as a state witness.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that on <st1:date year="1966" day="1" month="6">June
 1, 1966</st1:date> <span class="GramE">an information</span> for murder was
filed in the abovementioned court against <span class="SpellE">Atras</span>, <span class="SpellE">Callanga</span>, <span class="SpellE">Gorospe</span>, <span class="SpellE">Valeroso</span>, <span class="SpellE">Encarnacion</span> and Rodolfo
Ber­nardo (Criminal Case No. 837).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
June 14 of the same year, the State opposed the motion for bail filed by the
defendants and presented in support of its opposition the testimony of several
witnesses, amongst them Judge <span class="SpellE">Leandro</span> Reyes of the
Municipal Court of San Jose, Occiden­tal <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>, Dr.
Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Pascasio</span>, <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Omus</span>, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Collantes</span> and
Salvador <span class="SpellE">Tambagahan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was understood in this connection that such evidence was to be
considered as already presented for the purpose of the trial on the merits.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="12" month="9">September 12, 1966</st1:date>
the prosecution filed a motion for the discharge of defendant Rodolfo Bernardo
so that he may be used as a state witness, alleging as reason <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> that his testimony was absolutely necessary <u>to
prove con­spiracy</u> and that said defendant had expressed his willing­ness to
be a state witness if so discharged.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="14" month="11">November 14, 1966</st1:date>,
before the resumption of the trial on the merits, the respondent judge issued
an order holding "in abeyance its ruling (upon the motion to dis­charge
Bernardo) until it is satisfied with the conditions set forth by the law as
seen from the evidence of the prosecution".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter and after prosecution witness Sal­vador
<span class="SpellE">Tambagahan</span> had been cross-examined, the prosecution
presented its last witness in the person of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Guillerma</span>
Ortiz <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE">de</span> Cruz whose
testimony is, as alleged at pp. 3 and 4 of the petition under consideration,
substantially as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"That she was sleeping in her little house inside the <span class="SpellE">Iglesia</span> Ni <span class="SpellE">Cristo</span> compound on <st1:date year="1966" day="19" month="12">December 19, 1966</st1:date> with her husband
and children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their house has only a <span class="SpellE">sala</span> where the family slept together under a big mosquito
net; that at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="13">1</st1:time> to <st1:time minute="30" hour="13">1:30</st1:time> in the morning of <st1:date year="1963" day="20" month="12">December 20, 1963</st1:date> she was awakened when a person
woke her husband who was sleeping beside her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And then the person who woke her husband fired a gun hitting her husband
who later died in a hospital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She iden­tified
the triggerman as <span class="SpellE">Diosdado</span> de <span class="SpellE">Atras</span>,
one of the accused in this case, and also identified two persons, namely, <span class="SpellE">Arrostre</span> <span class="SpellE">Callanga</span> and <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> <span class="SpellE">Gorospe</span>, who were
standing beside the trigger-man holding short guns at the time of the shoot­ing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These two persons are also accused in this
case (p. 4, 5-58, T.S.N. Dec. 16, 1966;"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Before Mrs. Cruz could be examined, petitioner re­quested the
court to make a final ruling on its motion to discharge defendant
Bernardo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a result, on <st1:date year="1966" day="19" month="12">December 19, 1966</st1:date>, the respondent
judge issued the resolution complained of denying the motion aforesaid, stating
therein, among other things, the following:</p>

<blockquote>"This morning, counsel for the prosecution requested for a
ruling on the said motion to dis­charge and upon manifesting to the Court that
their last witness to be presented for the pro­secution is Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Guillerma</span> Ortiz <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE">de</span> Cruz, who is still on the witness stand under
cross-examination and the other witness to be present­ed is Rodolfo Bernardo in
case he is discharged from the information this Court hereby resolves the said
motion to discharge.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After going over the records, this Court finds that the said
motion is without merit under Sec. 9, Rule 119 of the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has been ruled in this connection that the
discharge of a defendant to be utilized as a witness for the prosecution,
should be availed of only if there is absolute necessity for the testimony of
the accused whose discharge is re­quested or the accused is the only one who
has knowledge of the crime and not when his testi­mony would simply corroborate
or otherwise strengthen the evidence in the hands of the prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(People vs. Ibanez, 92 Phil
933; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Borja</span>, G. R. No.</span> L-14327,
January 30, 1960) Furthermore, one of the requirements for the discharge of the
defendant under Sec. 9, Rule 119 of the Rules of Court is that there is no
other direct evidence of the prosecution for the offense committed except the
testimony of the defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such is not
the situation in the case at bar."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The records show that there were three witnesses so far
presented by the prosecution who allegedly saw the shooting incident and
identified the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These witnesses
are <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Omus</span>, Salvador <span class="SpellE">Tambagahan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Guiller­ma</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE">de</span> Cruz, the last being the
widow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the purpose of
utilizing said Rodolfo Bernardo is to prove conspiracy of the accused.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is the rule that all the conditions set forth in the
aforesaid rule (Sec. 9, Rule 119) must be complied with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the law seeks to regulate the manner of
enforcement of the regulations in the sound discretion of the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(U. S. vs. <span class="SpellE">Abanzado</span>, 37 Phil. 658; <span class="SpellE">Guiao</span> vs.
Figueroa, 94 Phil. 1018).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dis­charge
of an accused that he may turn state witness is expressly left to the
discretion of the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court has
the exclusive responsibility to see that conditions pre­scribed by the rule
exist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(People vs. <span class="SpellE">Iba­ñez</span>, <u>supra</u>).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The grant of discretion in cases of this kind
under this provision was not a grant of arbitrary discretion to be exercised
with due regard to the correct ad­ministration of justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(U. S. vs. <span class="SpellE">Abanza­do</span>,
37 Phil: 658)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">It appearing</span> that at the time the motion
to discharge Bernardo was filed three prosecution witnesses, namely, <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Omus</span>, Salvador <span class="SpellE">Tambagahan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Guillerma</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE">de</span> Cruz, had already
testified to the effect, inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span>, that they saw
the shooting incident and had actually identified the defendants, it seems
obvious that there is no absolute necessity for the testimony of Bernardo in
order to prove the commission of the offense by the de­fendants nor even to
prove conspiracy amongst them.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the writ prayed for is denied and the petition
under consideration is hereby dismissed, without costs.</p>
