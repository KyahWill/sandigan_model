				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The defendant-appellant, Joaquin P. <span class="SpellE">Lipana</span>,
contracted two marriages:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the first with
Maria Loreto <span class="SpellE">Ancino</span> in 1930 and the second with <span class="SpellE">Isidra</span> Gomez y <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> in
1935.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the time of the second marriage
the first was still subsisting, which fact, however, <span class="SpellE">Lipana</span>
concealed from the second wife.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1943" day="17" month="12">December 17, 1943</st1:date>
the spouses of the second marriage acquired by purchase a piece of land in <span class="SpellE">Cubao</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>

the property (Transfer Certificate No. 25289 of the Register of Deeds for <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city>) was issued on <st1:date year="1944" day="1" month="2">February 1, 1944</st1:date>, in the name of
"Joaquin <span class="SpellE">Lipana</span> married to <span class="SpellE">Isidra</span>
Gomez."</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1958" day="20" month="7">July 20, 1958</st1:date>
<span class="SpellE">Isidra</span> Gomez died intestate and childless, and
survived only by her sisters as the nearest relatives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1961" day="7" month="8">August
 7, 1961</st1:date> Ofelia Gomez, judicial <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span>
of her estate, commenced the present suit, pray足ing for the forfeiture of the husband's
share in the <span class="SpellE">Cubao</span> property in favor of the said
estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reliance is placed on Article
1417 of the old Civil Code, the Spanish text of which provides:</p>

<blockquote>"La <span class="SpellE">sociedad</span> de <span class="SpellE">gananciales</span>
<span class="SpellE">concluye</span> al <span class="SpellE">disolverse</span> el <span class="SpellE">matrimonio</span> o al ser <span class="SpellE">declarado</span> <span class="SpellE">nulo</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"El <span class="SpellE">conjuge</span> <span class="SpellE">que</span> <span class="SpellE">por</span> <span class="SpellE">su</span>

<span class="SpellE">gananciales</span>."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The trial court, ruling that the second marriage was void <span class="SpellE"><u>ab</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>initio</u></span> and that
the husband was the one who gave cause for its nullity, applied the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> provision and declared his interest in the
disputed property forfeited in favor of the estate of the deceased second wife.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the present appeal by the defendant he attributes two errors
to the trial court:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) in allowing a
collateral attack on the validity of the <span class="GramE">second</span>
marriage and in holding it to be bigamous and void <span class="SpellE"><u>ab</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>initio</u></span>; and (2) in holding that Article 1417
of the Spanish Civil Code is applicable in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first error has not been committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The con足trolling statute is Act 3613 of the
Philippine Legislature, the Marriage Law which became effective on <st1:date year="1929" day="4" month="12">December 4, 1929</st1:date> and was in force
when the two marriages were celebrated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The pertinent provisions are as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 29.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Illegal Marriages<span class="GramE">.-</span>
Any marriage subsequently contracted by any person during the lifetime of the
first spouse of such person with any person other than such first spouse shall
be illegal and void from its performance, unless:</blockquote>

<blockquote>(a) The first marriage was annulled or dissolved;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(b) The first spouse had been absent for seven consecutive years at
the time of the second marriage without the spouse present having news of the
absentee being alive, or the absentee being generally considered as dead and
believed to be so by the spouse present at the time of contracting such
subsequent marriage, the marriage so contracted being valid in either case
until declared null and void by a competent court.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 30.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Annullable marriages<span class="GramE">.-</span>
A marriage may be annulled for any of the following causes, existing at the
time of the marriage:</blockquote>

<blockquote>(b) For causes mentioned in sub足division (b):<span style="">&nbsp; </span>by either party during the life of the other,

<p class="BODY">The appellant, relying on Section 30(b) quoted above, maintains
that his marriage to <span class="SpellE">Isidra</span> Gomez was valid and could
be annulled only in an action for that purpose, which in the light of Section
31 could be filed only by either party thereto, during the lifetime of the
other, or by the former spouse.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, it is not Section 30 but Section 29 which governs in
this case, particularly the first paragraph thereof, which says that "any
marriage contracted by any person during the lifetime of the first spouse of
such person with any person other than such first spouse shall be illegal and
void from its performance." This is the general rule, to which the only
two exceptions are those mentioned in sub-sections (a) and (b) of the same
provision.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no suggestion here that the defendant's 1930 marriage to
Maria Loreto <span class="SpellE">Ancino</span> had been annulled or dissolved
when he married <span class="SpellE">Isidra</span> Gomez in 1935, and there is no
proof that he did so under the conditions envisioned in sub-section (b).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The burden is on the party invoking the
exception to prove that he comes under it; and the defendant has not discharged
that burden at all, no evi足dence whatsoever having been adduced by him at the
trial. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Indeed, he contracted the second
marriage less than seven years after the first, and he has not shown that his
first wife was then generally considered dead or was believed by him to be so.</p>

<p class="BODY">The second error bears closer analysis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is Article 1417 of the Spanish Civil Code
applicable under the facts of this case?</p>

<p class="BODY">There is one primordial fact which must be con足sidered, namely,
that since the defendant's first marriage has not been dissolved or declared
void the conjugal partnership established by that marriage has not ceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor has the first wife lost or relinquished
her status as putative heir of her husband under the new Civil Code, entitled
to share in his estate upon his death should she survive him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, whether as conjugal partner in
a still subsisting marriage or as such putative heir she has an interest in the
husband's share in the property here in dispute, even if it was acquired during
the second marriage, of which interest she would be deprived if his share
should be declared forfeited in favor of the second wife.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is a difference of opinion among the members of this Court
as to whether such resulting prejudice to the first wife is within the
contemplation of the Spanish Civil Code when it decrees in general terms in
Article 1417 that the spouse who in bad faith has given cause for nullity (of
the marriage) shall have no share in the conjugal properties, considering that
in the present case the first marriage has not been terminated and therefore
likewise impresses the conjugal stamp of that marriage upon whatever properties
are acquired during its existence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
believe, however, that it is not necessary to resolve that question here
inasmuch as the facts do not call for the application of Article 1417.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first paragraph of this Article states
two causes for the termination of the conjugal partnership:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) dissolution of the marriage and (2)
declaration of nullity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the second
paragraph of the same Article it is upon the termina足tion of the partnership by
either of said causes that the forfeiture of the share of the guilty spouse
takes place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now then, when did the
conjugal partnership formed by virtue of the marriage of the defendant to the
deceased <span class="SpellE">Isidra</span> Gomez terminate?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Obviously when the marriage was dissolved by
the latter's death in 1958.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By that time
Article 1417 was no longer in force, having been eliminated in the new Civil
Code, which took effect in 1950.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
legal situation arising from these facts is that while insofar as the second
wife was concerned, she having acted in good faith, her marriage pro足duced
civil effects and gave rise, just the same, to the formation of a conjugal
partnership wherein she was entitled to an equal share upon dissolution,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
no action lies under Article 1417 for the forfeiture of the husband's share in
her favor, much less in favor of her estate, with respect to which there are
after all no children, but only collateral relatives, who are entitled to
succeed.</p>

<p class="BODY">It would not do to say that since the second marriage in this
case was void <span class="SpellE"><u>ab</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>initio</u></span>
the application of Article 1417 should be reckoned as of the date it was
celebrated in 1935.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This article speaks
from the moment of the termina足tion of the conjugal partnership (either by the
dissolution of the marriage or by the declaration of its nullity); and it would
be self-contradictory to consider that the conjugal partnership was formed and
terminated at the same time and by the same act, that is, by the celebration
itself of the marriage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Colin y <span class="SpellE">Capitant</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
comments on this provision as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"<span class="SpellE">Disuelven</span> <span class="SpellE">matrimonio</span> y, <span class="SpellE">por</span> <span class="SpellE">tanto</span>, la <span class="SpellE">sociedad</span> de <span class="SpellE">gananciales</span>, la <span class="SpellE">muerte</span> de <span class="SpellE">uno</span> de <span class="SpellE">los</span> <span class="SpellE">conjuges</span>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"En <span class="SpellE">caso</span> de <span class="SpellE">declaracion</span> de <span class="SpellE">nulidad</span>, la <span class="SpellE">sociedad</span> de <span class="SpellE">gananciales</span> se <span class="SpellE">extingue</span> al ser <span class="SpellE">declarado</span> <span class="SpellE">nulo</span> el <span class="SpellE">matrimonio</span>, <span class="SpellE">es</span> <span class="SpellE">decir</span>, en el <span class="SpellE">momento</span> en <span class="SpellE">que</span> sea <span class="SpellE">firme</span> la <span class="SpellE">sentencia</span> <span class="SpellE">declarativa</span> de la <span class="SpellE">nulidad</span>."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It may thus be seen that if the nullity, or annulment, of the
marriage is the basis for the application of Article 1417, there is need for a
judicial declaration thereof, which of course contemplates an action for that
purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the instant case, however,
the conjugal partnership formed by the second marriage was dissolved by the
death of the second wife; and there has been no judicial declaration of nullity
except possibly in this very action, filed after dissolution by death had taken
place and when Article 1417 of the Spanish Civil Code was no longer in force.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is, to be sure, a statement of <span class="SpellE">Manresa</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
that in case of nullity it is presumed, with respect to the spouse who acted in
bad faith, that neither the marriage nor the conjugal partnership ever existed,
and hence such spouse has no right to a share in the conjugal properties; but
this legal effect of such presumption derives from the premise that Article
1417 is still in force, and in any event is of doubtful application if it would
be in derogation of and to the prejudice of the right of the other spouse of
the first marriage in the conjugal partnership formed thereby, which includes
properties acquired by the husband during its existence.</p>

<p class="BODY">The only just and equitable solution in this case would be to
recognize the right of the second wife to her share of one-half in the property
acquired by her and her husband, and consider the other half as pertaining to
the conjugal partnership of the first marriage.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="text-transform: uppercase;">Wherefore</span></b>,
