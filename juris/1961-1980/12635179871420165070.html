				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Direct appeal by plaintiff-appellant Vicente <span class="SpellE">Dira</span>
from a decision of the Court of First In­stance of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>,
dated February 13, 1964, dismissing, on the grounds of prescription and <span class="SpellE">laches</span>, the complaint in its Civil Case No. 2886, an act­ion
for accounting of a share in an alleged partnership, payment of salaries and
other money claims, without pronouncement as to costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">The material facts as found by the trial judge are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"That sometime in March 1946, plain­tiff and defendant
together with Fran­cisco <span class="SpellE">Pagulayan</span> entered into a
partner­ship for the purpose of engaging in the printing business in the City
of <span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span> and that the terms of the said
partnership was for a period of five (5) years from the organization thereof;
that this fact was admitted by the defendant in his ans­wer; that, in the
articles of co-partnership, the plaintiff was designated as President and his
salary as such was P150.00 a month, that, during his incum­bency as President
until the expiration of the period, the defendant who was the manager-treasurer
of the partnership never paid him his salary; that at the time the plaintiff
was also the editor of the <span class="SpellE">Leyte-Samar</span> Tribune and in
accord­ance with their Articles of Partnership established the said periodicals
, the plaintiff as editor was to receive a sa­lary of P100.00 a month; that
this salary and the accrued amount therein was not also paid by the defendant,
who was the business manager of the enterprise; that the capital of the said
partnership was P5,000.00 equally divided among the part­ners; that this amount
was used by the partnership to purchase printing equip­ments from the 64th
Naval Construction <span style="">Battalion, </span><span style="">U.S.N. </span><span style="">and which
printing equipments are in the possession of the defendant up to now; that,
before the purchase by the three of them of the printing equipments, the
plaintiff ob­tained a personal loan from Francisco <span class="SpellE">Pagulayan</span>
in the amount of P1,100.00 and he pledged his share in the said equip­ments to
pay the same; that, upon the re­quest of the plaintiff, the defendant paid the
said amount to Francisco <span class="SpellE">Pagu­layan</span> and this time plaintiff
used his share in the partnership as guarantee for the defendant's payment;
that on June 3, 1946, Francisco <span class="SpellE">Pagulayan</span> sold his
share of the partnership to the def­endant and who by virtue thereof became 2/3
owner of the business; that the defendant presented Exhibit '5' which<span style="">&nbsp; </span>purports to be a letter of demand to
plaintiff asking him to settle his ac­count, but due to his failure to do so,
he (defendant) assumed full ownership of the business, he changed the name from
the <span class="SpellE">Leyte-Samar</span> Press to <span class="SpellE">Tañega</span>
Press; that from the time the partner­ship was organized and went into busi­ness,
the defendant as Manager-Treasurer never rendered any accounting of the
business operations, or paid the share of the plaintiff in the profits; and
that the present action of partnership accounting and sum of money was only
filed in Court by the plaintiff against the defendant on February 10, 1961,
that is after a lapse of 9 years, 10 months and 11 days after the expiration of
the con­tract of partnership, Exhibit 'A' on February 28, 1951." <span class="GramE">(Pp.49-51, R. on A.)</span><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE"><span style="">" x</span></span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"It
is undisputed that the defendant had been in the exclusive possession of all
the printing equipments since 1946.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Plaintiff himself admitted that the defendant conducted himself as ab­solute
owner of the printing equipments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
testified that defendant changed lo­cation of the printing press which </span><span style="">place he (<span class="SpellE">Dira</span>) did
not know.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to defendant
himself, he believed in good faith and acted accordingly since 1947 that he was
the sole owner of the printing press, after the refusal of the plaintiff to pay
his indebtedness of P1<span class="GramE">,100.00</span> to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the above facts, it can be deduced that
defendant had acquired ownership of the printing equipments and accessories in
question as Article 1132 of the Civil Code pro­vides that the ownership of
movables prescribes through uninterrupted posses­sion of eight years, without
need of any condition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Surely 1946 or
1947 to 1961, more than four and/or eight years had elapsed.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Plaintiff stated that defendant ig­nored him and did not give
him any parti­cipation, since 1947, in the business, yet he did not demand an
immediate accounting of the business. For his fail­ure to demand accounting
five years before <st1:date year="1961" day="10" month="2">February 10, 1961</st1:date>,
from the def­endant, he had forfeited his right by prescription.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In support, Article 1153 of the Civil Code,
among other things, provides that the period for prescription of actions to
demand accounting runs from the day the persons who should ren­der same cease
in their functions, and Article 1149 of the Civil Code provides that 'all other
actions whose periods are not fixed in this Code or in other laws within five
years from the time the right of action accrues.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is an incontrovertible fact that the plaintiff had filed
this action against the defendant on <st1:date year="1961" day="10" month="2"><span style="">February </span>10, 1961</st1:date>, nearly
ten years after the expiration of the contract of partnership between them on
March, 1951. <span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>" (Pp. 56-57, R. on A.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In his complaint, plaintiff-appellant prayed for payment of his
salaries not only as President of the partnership but also as editor of the <span class="SpellE">Leyte-Samar</span> Tribune which admittedly he had not been paid
from the start, for accounting of the partnership affairs, for payment of his
alleged share in the ren­tal value of the printing equipment and accessories
used by the partnership, of which he also claimed part-ownership proportionally
to his share in the partnership, and for damages, attorney's fees and
costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
admitted practically all the material allegations of the complaint about the
organization of the partnership and the terms thereof as well as the
non-payment of the salaries claimed by appellant, but, in defense, he alleged
that the whole business of the partnership became his alone in 1947 after he
had acquired by purchase the share of Francisco <span class="SpellE">Pagulayan</span>
and had taken over the share of appellant, since the latter failed to pay the
P1,100 he had requested <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> to pay to <span class="SpellE">Pagu­layan</span>, as security for the payment of which, he had
pledged his said share to <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>; that since 1947,
the place of the business was transferred by him, he had its name changed to <span class="SpellE">Tañega</span> Press and he had always been operating openly and
publicly the said printing business from 1947 without any intervention or
participation of appellant and without said appel­lant making any claim of any
kind <span style="">in connection there</span>with
until the filing of the complaint on February 10, 1961, hence, all the claims
and causes of action of the appellant had already prescribed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the facts found by His Honor quoted above, <span class="GramE">We</span> agree with <span style="">His </span>Honor
in upholding <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> defense of prescription.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From any angle that this case may be viewed,
it <span style="">is </span>obvious that appellant's
causes of action are barred by the statute of limitations.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Appellee</span> took exclusive control of the
partner­ship affairs since 1947, publicly and openly and after having notified
appellant that he would do so should the latter fail to comply with his letter
of demand, Exhibit "5", dated <st1:date year="1947" day="19" month="4">April
 19, 1947</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nowhere in the
facts found by the trial judge does it appear that appellant did anything about
said demand or that he ever contested the action of the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
of transferring the place of business and changing its name to <span class="SpellE">Tañega</span> Press.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There <span style="">is </span>nothing to show that he had taken
any move for the payment to him of his unpaid salaries both as President of the
business and as editor of the <span class="SpellE">Leyte-Samar</span> Tribune.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under these circumstances, it would be giving premium to inaction
and indifference to still hold that appellant could sue <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>,
almost fourteen years after the latter, with prior notice to the former, had
openly and publicly taken over exclusive control of the partnership business as
if it were his own and only a little short of ten years after the expira­tion
of the stipulated term of partnership.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His claims for salaries accrued after each month they were unpaid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether we assume that these claims lost
basis in 1947 when <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> took over the businesses
of the printing press and the newspaper or in 1951, upon the expira­tion of the
term of the agreements, by all standards, these claims had already prescribed
when the present suit was filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
other hand, under Article 1153 of the Civil Code, a demand for "accounting
runs from the day the persons who should render the same ceases in their
functions", which in this case was in 1947, when the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
began to operate the businesses as exclusively his own.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, inasmuch as the longest period in the
chapter on prescription of the Civil Code <span style="">is </span>ten years, it is evident that appellant's action for accounting
<span style="">is </span>already barred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same is true with the claim for rentals
and recovery of proportional ownership of the printing equipment and
accessories, as to which, appellant's period to bring his actions accrued also <span style="">in </span>1947, fourteen years before this suit
was filed.</p>

<p class="BODY">As a matter of fact, appellant impliedly admits the correctness
of this position, since in this ap­peal his only contention is that both as his
partner and as <span class="SpellE">pledgee</span> of his share, the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> became his trustee, in legal contemplation, or that,
in the eyes of the law, a relationship of trusteeship arose between him and <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, hence his actions against him are <span class="SpellE">imprescriptible</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant's pose is without merit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In bad faith or in good faith, after eight years of actual adverse
possession, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> acquired clear ownership of
appellant's share by ac­quisitive prescription.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">According to Art.</span> <span class="GramE">1132 <span style="">of the Civil Code, "the ownership of
personal property </span>also prescribes through uninterrupted possession for
eight years, without need of any other condition."</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> became
undisputed owner of appellant's share since 1955 or <span style="">six </span>years before this <span style="">action
was filed and since said year the allegation of trusteeship had already lost
any basis whatsoever.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under Article </span>1140
of same Code, "Actions to recover movables shall prescribe eight years
from the time the possession thereof is lost, unless the possessor has acquired
the ownership by prescription for a less period" or for an equal period,
in which latter case, the right to sue prescribes together with the title.</p>

<p class="BODY">Equally untenable is appellant's reliance on the theory that as a
member of the partnership, <span class="SpellE">appel­lee</span> continued as a
trustee even after 1947, when said <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> took the
business for <span class="GramE">himself</span> and even after 1951, the expiry
date of the agreements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The provi­sions
of Article 1785 to the effect that:</p>

<blockquote>"When a partnership for a fixed term or particular undertaking
is continued after the termination of such term or particular undertaking
without any express agreement, the rights and duties of the partners remain the
same as they were at such termination, so far as is consistent with a
partnership at will.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A continuation of the business by the partners or such of
them as habitually acted therein during the term, without any settlement or liquidation
of <span style="">the partnership affairs, is <u>prima</u>
<u>facie</u> evidence of a continua</span>tion of the partnership."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="GramE">and</span> Article 1829
thus:</p>

<blockquote>"On dissolution the partner­ship is not terminated, but
continues until the winding up of partnership affairs is completed."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="GramE"><span style="">are</span></span><span style=""> </span>clearly inapplicable here, for the
simple reason that those articles are premised on a continuation of the
partnership <span style="">as </span>such, which is
not our case, because here <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> repudiated the
partnership as early as 1947 with either actual or presumed know­ledge of the
appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By analogy, at least, with
the rule as to a co-ownership, which a partnership essentially is, prescription
does not run in favor of any of the co-owners only as long as the co-owner
claiming against the others "expressly or <span style="">impliedly </span>recognizes the
co-ownership", a circumstance irrecon­cilably inconsistent with <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> conduct of transferring the place of business,
changing its name and not paying appellant any of the salaries agreed upon in
the articles of partnership.</p>

<p class="BODY">What is more, this case may well be decided on the basis of <span class="SpellE">laches</span> as was done by the trial judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, even if prescription were not
proper­ly applicable, <span class="GramE">We</span> could still hold that under
the facts proven in the record and found by the lower court, appellant has been
guilty of <span class="SpellE">laches</span> and his stale demands may not gain
the ears of the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We note, however,
that in his answer, the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> limi­ted his defense
specifically to prescription <span style="">which </span><span style="">is </span>a separate defense from <span class="SpellE">laches</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not that such par­ticularity of <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> defense is fatal, because, <span style="">after all, it does
not appear that the evidence proving <span class="SpellE">laches</span> were
objected to by appellant, (Sec­tion 5, Rule </span>10, Rules of Court) but <span class="GramE">We</span> do not feel that in this case We need to go beyond the
specific defense expressly invoked by the appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is mentioned only, lest appellant may
still entertain any hope regarding this case.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment of the lower court is affirmed,
with costs against appellant.</p>
