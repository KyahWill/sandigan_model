				<H3>DEVELOPMENT BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. SPOUSES ADRIANO V. SANTOS & MARTINA HABACON AND EVARISTO PICAZO, DEFENDANTS, EVARISTO PICAZO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.<BR><BR>R E S O L U T I O N</H3>

				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Before Us is appellee's motion to dismiss the appeal interposed by
Development Bank of the Philippines, upon the sole ground that the
record on appeal fails to disclose on its face that the appeal was
taken within the period fixed by the Revised Rules of Court, in
violation of Rule 50, paragraph (a), in connection with Rule 56,
Section 1 and Rule 41, Section 6, of the same Rules.
<p>In support of his contention appellee calls attention to the fact
that while the record on appeal shows that the appealed order of
February 11, 1966 (p. 38, Record on Appeal) dismissing the case against
appellee was received by appellant's counsel on March 16, 1966 (p. 39,
supra), and that a motion for reconsideration of said order was filed
on March 23 of the same year - which motion was denied in an order
dated April 11 - said record on appeal fails to disclose the date when
appellant received notice of the aforesaid order denying its motion for
reconsideration. Thus, appellee argues, it is impossible to determine,
on the basis of the contents of the record on appeal, whether or not
the appeal was taken within the period provided by law, after deducting
the period during which the motion for reconsideration was pending.</p>
<p>Appellant filed an opposition to the motion to dismiss claiming that
its record on appeal was filed on May 12, 1966, the last day of the
period for the filing thereof as extended by the lower court in its
order dated April 27, 1966 granting appellant's Urgent Motion for
Extension of Time, a copy of which order was attached to the opposition
as Annex A. Appellant further avers that the noninclusion of the order
Annex A in the record on appeal was due to the fact that when the
record was being prepared on April 28, 1966, appellant had not yet been
served with a copy of said order. Appellant further argues that said
omission was corrected by appellee's failure to object to the approval
of the record on appeal at the hearing held in the lower court for the
approval or disapproval thereof.</p>
<p>It is, therefore, a fact that while the record on appeal states the
date when the order of dismissal appealed from was received (March 16,
1966); that a motion for reconsideration thereof was filed one week
later (March 23, 1966) and that said motion for reconsideration was
denied by the lower court on April 11 of the same year, the record on
appeal does not show the date when appellant received notice of the
order of denial - an important date for the determination of whether or
not the record on appeal was filed on time. It appears in this
connection that the order of April 11, 1966 denying appellant's motion
for reconsideration is reproduced on pp. 184-6 of the record on appeal,
followed immediately by a statement to the effect that on April 20 of
the same year, appellant filed its notice of appeal and appeal bond (p.
186, supra). Next comes a statement to the effect that on April 25,
1966, appellant filed an Urgent Motion for Extension of Time to file
its record on appeal, which motion appears on pp. 187-8 of the record
on appeal, but nothing appears thereafter to show that the said Urgent
Motion for Extension was submitted to and granted by the Court, nor to
show the date when appellant received notice of the order granting the
aforesaid motion for extension.</p>
<p>Upon the above facts, We are of the opinion that our decision in
Government of the Philippines etc. vs. Luis Antonio et al., (G. R. No.
L-23736) is squarely applicable to the present case. The pertinent
portion of said decision reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The deficiencies pointed out are fatal. For the
reason that in ordinary appeals the original record is not forwarded to
the appellate court, and because the dates when an applicant received
the notice of the pertinent orders or judgment under appeal, and of the
denial of his motion for reconsideration or new trial, are facts within
the exclusive knowledge of said appellant, the Revised Rules of Court
place upon the appellant the burden of showing that his appeal is
timely, and for that purpose prescribe (Rule 41, Sec. 6) that the
record of appeal shall include 'such data as will show that the appeal
was perfected on time'. This requirement is mandatory and
jurisdictional, for unless appeal is perfected on time the appellate
court acquires no jurisdiction over the appealed case, and has power
only to dismiss the appeal (Bello vs. Fernando, L-16970, Jan. 30, 1962;
Caisip vs. Cabangon, L-14684, August 26, 1960; Espartero vs. Ladaw, 49
Off. Gaz., 1439). The certification of the record on appeal by the
trial court, after expiration of the period to appeal can not restore
the jurisdiction which has been lost (Alvero vs. de la Rosa, 76 Phil.
428, 433, and cases cited). The principle is confirmed by Rule 50,
section 1, subpar. (a), heretofore quoted."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appeal interposed by appellant is hereby dismissed, without costs.</p>

<p><i>Concepcion, C.J., Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, Makalintal, Bengzon, J.P., Zaldivar, Sanchez, </i>and <i>Ruiz Castro, JJ</i>., concur.<br><i>Regala, J</i>., no part.
