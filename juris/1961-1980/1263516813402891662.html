				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">The plaintiffs below
(respondents here) filed a complaint</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> against herein </span><span style="">petitioners </span><span style="">alleging ownership of a parcel of land situated in the municipality of
Cuyapo, Nueva Ecija, with an area of 255 hectares, more or less, and praying
that the defendants be ordered to surrender possession to the plaintiffs and to
pay damages, attorney's fees and costs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The said parcel is described in the com­plaint as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-weight: normal;">"A PARCEL OF LAND ADJOINED
IN MASSE<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 0in 0in 15pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-weight: normal;">INDICATED "LOT X"</span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"(Between the red and
green lines) </span>on the plan S.W.O. 24137, portion of our actual
LANDHOLDINGS.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Bounded on the North,
North-west, West, South-west and South by the pro­perty of the defendants,
registered in 1910 in their registration case 5550 covered in O.C.T. 139 and on
the East are numerous individual lots owned by the plaintiffs; containing an
area of TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE (255) hectares, more or less, situated in the
aforesaid barrios of the municipality of Cuyapo, Pro­vince of Nueva Ecija.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This property is assessed for the amount of
P76,500.00, at P300.00 per hectare, as per schedule of values in the munici­pality
of Cuyapo, Province of Nueva Ecija."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The defendants moved to
dismiss on the following grounds:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the cause of action if any is already
barred by the statute of limitations.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Court has no jurisdiction over the nature of the action as in effect it seeks
to annul or revoke decisions and resolutions of the Supreme Court considering
that a court of first instance is not authorized to do this even assuming that
the decisions or resolutions of the Supreme Court are wrong.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
complaint states <span style="">no </span>cause of
action.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
cause of action is already barred by two prior judgments and several
resolutions."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Respondent Court denied
the motion to dismiss in its order of </span><span style="">July </span><span style="">18, 1966, which
states:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"One of the grounds of the <span style="">Motion </span>to Dismiss filed by the defendant Paz Ongsiako thru her
counsel on June <span style="">8, </span>1966 <span style="">is </span>that the cause of action is already
barred by two prior judg­ments and several resolutions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the complaint on its face ap­pears
to have a different cause of action than the two prior cases and it is up to
the defendants to prove their defense of <u>res</u> j<u>udicata</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further­more, the allegation of the
plaintiffs that the defendants are encroach­ing upon the boundaries of their
pro­perty is also a matter of evidence."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It may be noted that the foregoing order of denial ruled merely
on two of the grounds alleged in the motion to dismiss, namely, bar by prior
judgments and lack of cause of action.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It did not resolve the plea of prescription.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This omission is now relied upon, among other
reasons, in the instant petition for certiorari to set aside the order
aforequoted, as well as a subsequent order denying peti­tioners' motion for
reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">The voluminous pleadings, motions and memoranda filed here deal
largely with the plea of <u>res</u> <u>judicata</u>, particularly with the
question of identity between the land claimed by respondents as an integral
portion of the lands involved in the previous litigations between the parties
and/or their predecessors-in-interest, namely:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Government of the Philippine Islands vs. Leoncio Abad, et al., (47 Phil.
573); Feliciano Abad, et al., vs. Government of the Philippines, (103 Phil.
247); Luis Antonio et al., vs. Jose Mariano de Santos, et al., Cad. Case No. 19
of the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija, and the resolutions of the
Supreme Court of October 19, 1965 and December 3, 1965, dismissing the appeal
in the last mentioned case.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">For the resolution of the
present petition it is not necessary to go into identity of the land as a point
material to the question of <u>res</u> <u>judicata</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The issue of prescription is decisive, and
the failure of respondent Court to resolve it constitutes a grave abuse of dis­cretion
correctible by certiorari.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Paragraph 7 of the complaint below contains the fol­lowing
allegation:</p>

<blockquote>"That the defendants are illegal­ly in possession, occupation
and cultivation of the land indicated "LOT X" on plan SWO 2437, since
1924 after the cadastral Court's decision in 1924 and benefited on the crops
raised there­on, to the prejudice of the plaintiffs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such possession and cultivation by the
defendants over the land in question are without just title, for it was not
within the bounds of their regis­tered property in 1910, covered by O.C.T. No.
139, issued by virtue of DECREE 4485-A in their Registra­tion Case No.
5550."<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Elaborating on the matter
of possession, respondents state in their memorandum of September 18, 1967:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"x x x Notwithstanding
the fact that plaintiffs' predecessors-in?</span>interests were the
original occupants over the land (Lot "X") since time immemorial, who
cleared and introduced improvements thereon, such as the pilapils, dams, fruit
trees, coconut plants and others on the land (Lot "X") <span style="">and became productivity and cultivable
(sic).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, on or before 1924 during
the cadastral survey of Cuyapo, Nueva Ecija, they (defendants-petitioners)
moved their monuments 450 meters, more or less, from their respective permanent
places accord­ing to the technical description speci­fied in the notice of
publication in the </span><span style="">Official </span><span style="">Gazette of their Registration case 5550 in
1910.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, their Overseers,
Encargados or Catiwalas informed to the people, (our predecessors-in-interests)
that their boundary is up to the RED LINES, thus in 1924, our
predecessors-in-interests </span><span style="">left </span><span style="">the premises (Lot "X") and stayed
up to the RED LINE appearing on plan SWO-24137.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, such possession of the defendants-petitioners over the land
(Lot "X") is possession in bad faith, which it would not ripen into
ownership."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is thus admitted that
since 1924 or for a period of forty-two years before the basic complaint was
filed in 1966, petitioners had been in possession of the land claimed by
plaintiffs below, now respondents, and that such posses­sion was adverse, or in
concept of owner, although allegedly in bad faith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the Code of Civil Procedure formerly in
force, good or bad faith was immaterial for purposes of ac­quisitive
prescription.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Adverse possession in
either charac</span>ter ripened into ownership after the lapse of ten years.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>

the Civil Code.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>Even the thirty-year period fixed in
