				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petition for certiorari seeking the annulment of the order of the
Court of First Instance of Camarines Sur in its Civil Case No. 4309 granting
herein private respondents' motion for a writ of posses­sion to place them in
possession of the land involved which is being used by herein petitioner as a
cemetery for <span style="">the </span>Catholic
Parish of Manguiring, Calabanga, Camarines Sur, and of the subsequent order of
the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u><span style=""> </span>denying
the motion of petitioner for the reconsideration of said order.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that on January 24, 1955, herein private respond­ents
obtained Original Certificate of Title No. 545 to their land in said
Manguiring, Calabanga, Camarines Sur, through an ordinary registration
proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Embraced in the said
certificate of title, how­ever, is the Catholic Cemetery used by petitioner,
together with the surrounding area which is admittedly owned by <span style="">said </span>respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Peti</span>tioner
then commenced action against private respondents on October 17, 1958, by
filing the complaint (for reconveyance) in Civil Case No. 4309 of the Court of
First Instance of Camarines Sur, praying for judg­ment (1) to declare herein
petitioner the owner of the portion <span style="">it
uses </span>as <span style="">a cemetery; </span>(2)
to order private respondents to reconvey said por­tion to petitioner; and (3)
to condemn respondents to pay it P1,000.00 <span style="">in </span>damages plus costs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondents answered with a denial of petitioner's claim of title and an
assertion of its own ownership of the land in question, and by<span style=""> </span><span style="">way of </span>counterclaim alleged the existence of a lease and prayed
for payment of rentals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After due trial,
the court, Judge Jose L. Moya presiding, rendered judgment on June 4, 1959,
with the following dispositive portion:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment <span style="">is
</span>hereby rendered dec<span style="">laring </span>the
plaintiff to be the owner of the land described above and commanding the
defendants to <span style="">reconvey </span>it to
him, with costs against them."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The judgment above-quoted was, however,
reversed by the Court of Ap­peals in CA-G.R. No. 27303-R upon appeal thereto by
private respond­ents, the said appellate court finding and holding thus:</p>

<blockquote>"x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In this appeal the defendants contend that the lower court
erred in holding (1) <span style="">that the plaintiff
</span>acquired title to the land in question by prescription; (2) that the
defendants sold the land to the plaintiff <span style="">as </span>early as 1934; (3) in com<span style="">pelling </span>them to reconvey the land<span style=""> </span>to the <span style="">plaintiff </span>and
(4) in sentencing them to pay damages.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="">"We
have gone over the evidence carefully, particularly the transcript of the
stenographic notes taken during the <span style="">hearing
</span>on March 13, 1959, <span style="">and </span>found
nothing to show in what manner the <span style="">plaintiff
</span>acquired ownership of the land <span style="">in </span><span style="">question
</span>from the defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
statement in the pre<span style="">-</span>trial order
that 'the defendants had been demanding <span style="">pay</span>ment
for the land since 1934 but the plaintiff failed to pay and merely made re<span style="">peated </span>promises to pay' does not
afford a safe basis for <span style="">determining </span>that
the land in question was sold by the defendants to the plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No testimony whatsoever was offered by the
plaintiff to show how it acquired the <span style="">land
</span>from the defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x x x x</p>

<blockquote>“x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>

<blockquote>"The documentary evidence does not show that the land involved
in the same <span style="">is that declared by the
plaintiff in its </span><span style="">name </span><span style="">for taxation purposes under Tax </span>Declaration No. 6148 of the
municipality of Naga, province of Camarines Sur (Exhibit C).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This <span style="">tax
declaration, </span>the commencement year of which <span style="">is </span>not <span style="">in</span>dicated, shows that the land is bounded on <span style="">the </span>North <span style="">by that </span>of Paulino Bonco; on the east by <span style="">public land, and </span>on the south and the west by that of <span style="">Paulino </span>Bonco.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the adjoining owner<span style=""> </span><span style="">on all sides </span>except on the east is Pa<span style="">ulino Bonco.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According </span>to
the sketch, <span style="">Exhibit A, </span>showing
the <span style="">dimensions and </span>boundaries of
the land (and this was agreed upon by both parties to be correct), the <span style="">adjoining owner on all sides is the
defendant, Marcos Atienza, one of the </span><span style="">registered owners of the area covered by Certificate of Title No. 545
of the Registry of Deeds of the Province of Camarines Sur.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This area indubitably contains the land in
dispute as an integral part.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">not
been sufficiently proven that the plaintiff has been</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">in
</span>pos<span style="">session of said land since
1934 </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">its tax declaration, Exhibit C, does not show
when it became effective </span>as <span style="">the
land covered thereby </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">exempt from
taxation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary it shows that
the land described therein </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">altogether different and distinct from the
one in</span>volved herein and no testimony <span style="">was </span>presented by the plaintiff to explain the discrepancy.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The statement in paragraph 3 of the pre-trial order that
defendants have been demanding payment for the land since 1934 does not
necessarily show that it was sold to it by the defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may be construed in relation to paragraph
4 thereof stating 'that the reasonable compensation for the use and occupancy
of the land is P30.00 a month’.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
demand for payment mentioned in paragraph 3 may possibly refer to the payment
of monthly rentals of P30.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These
doubtful and obscure points could have been threshed out or clarified at the
pre-trial conference or at the trial itself, but unfortunately the record of
the hearing is a memorial of the incompleteness and deficiency of plaintiff's
evidence.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Plaintiff's acquisition of ownership of the land by
prescription has not been satisfactorily established, the defendants
maintaining that in using the land <span style="">as
cemetery </span>plaintiff has always recognized their rights thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although this was <span style="">denied by the </span>plaintiff's lone witness, Fr. Amado Camaya, this
mode was not established by positive evidence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>During the direct examination of Fr. Amado Camaya he was not given a
chance to state what was the nature of the plaintiff's possession and how it
was obtained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The transcript of the
stenographic notes previously quoted shows that when h<span style="">e was asked </span>about the nature of the plaintiff's possession, the
attorney for the defendants objected to the question for lack of basis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plaintiff's attorney, instead of reforming
his question and pres­sing on the matter so as to establish the plaintiff's
uninterrupted, peaceful and public possession thereof in the concept of an
owner, desisted and closed his <span style="">evi</span>dence
by saying:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'In that case, Your Honor
please, that will be all for the witness'.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The admission by the defendants that the plaintiff has been
in possession of the land and using it <span style="">as
a </span>cemetery since 1934, is open to varied interpre­tations and does not
shut out the possibility that the <span style="">use </span>of
the land for that purpose was with the tolerance or permission of the
defendants, for which reason they have been demanding payment of rentals at the
rate of P30.00 monthly (t.s.n., p. 8, Esplago).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We are not in accord with the trial court's theory that the
demand for payment of the land is an admission that it was sold to the
plaintiff by the def­endants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
absence of other evidence showing that the plaintiff became the owner under any
of the modes of acquiring ownership established by <span style="">law, </span>that owner­ship cannot be merely presumed or implied
therefrom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For <span style="">a </span>reconveyance action to prosper, the plaintiff must show that
he is the owner of the land involved, the foun­dation of such kind of action
being an indubitable title which is defeated or rendered ineffectual by fraudulent
registration in the name of another under Act No. 496 (Section 55, Act 496, <span style="">as </span>amended

<blockquote>"Having shown that plaintiff <span style="">is </span>not the owner of the land in dispute, it <span style="">was </span>not, there­fore, fraudulently
deprived thereof by the regis­tration in the name of the defendants of the area
containing it <span style="">as an </span>integral
part.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No actionable fraud <span style="">was, </span>therefore, perpetrated by the
defendants in not notifying the plaintiff of its application.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such failure to notify the plaintiff is not
the kind of fraud which, under Article 38 of Act 496, serves as a ground for reopening
the decree of regis­tration<span style=""> </span>within
one year <span style="">after its </span>issuance or
for com<span style="">pelling, under Section 55 of
said Act, the </span>recon­<span style="">veyance of
the registered property, or portion </span>there­<span style="">of, to the rightful owner (De la Cruz v. Fabio, </span>35 <span style="">Phil. 144; Loyola v. Barruela, et al., CA-G.R.
No. 12420-R, Dec. 21, 1955).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps it
would be easier to believe that the defendants acted fraudulently in gobbling
up the land involved had it been shown by the plaintiff that it purchased the
same </span>from <span style="">the former, </span>and
<span style="">that despite such alienation they
proceeded to include it clandestinely in the regis­tration </span>of the <span style="">area containing it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even then, it </span>would be <span style="">hardly possible for the plaintiff not to have
known of </span><span style="">the application </span>for
registration and to op­<span style="">pose it,
considering its capacity and its economic and social standing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The publication of </span>the notice of
hearing in the Official <span style="">Gazette, which
serves as a notice to the whole world in land registration its proceeding <u>in</u>
<u>rem</u>, precludes any imputation to the defendants of fraud or concealment </span>in
<span style="">obtaining registered </span>title <span style="">thereto.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But it </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">unnecessary </span>to <span style="">dwell further on the question of whether or not there was fraud,
inasmuch </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">it </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">our conclusion that
plaintiff has no valid title to the land involved </span>and is not the <span style="">owner of the same.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">This decision of </span>the
Court of Appeals having become final, on October 11, 1965, herein private
respondents filed a motion for <span style="">exec­</span>ution
with the lower court, praying that a "writ of possession <span style="">be issued in </span>this case, commanding the
Provincial Sheriff to deliver the land in question" to them; and,

<blockquote>"To enforce the pronouncements of the appellate court, we find
no reason to deny the prevailing defendant-appellant from <span style="">enforcing </span>the decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would indeed be a useless ceremony to
ventilate <span style="">ano­ther action </span>just
to compel <span style="">plaintiff-appellee to restore
</span>defendants to the possession of the property in question.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Petition granted."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner moved for the<span style=""> </span>reconsideration
of this <span style="">order, </span>but <span style="">his motion <span style="">was </span></span>denied by respondent judge in his order of <span style="">December <span style="">15, </span></span>1965, with the following rationale:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<blockquote>"The carefully prepared motion for reconsideration citing
cases to support the <span style="">said motion finds
no practical applicability to the present case.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

land in question is <span style="">a </span><span style="">titled </span>property, the ownership of
which has <span style="">been and still with the
defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Supported by the
pronouncements </span>of the Court of Appeals, the <span style="">basic and elementary concept of ownership</span> attached to it the right
of possession.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"To deny the prevailing party, the <span style="">defendant, from </span>the exercise of ownership <span style="">and dominion over his </span>property will be tantamount to <span style="">giving a premium </span><span style="">to the plaintiff which he never did deserve.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"While it is true that the <span style="">cases cited </span>by <span style="">plain</span>tiff-appellee
were in consonance with the <span style="">laws </span>then
existing, nevertheless the pronouncements of the Court of Appeals finds no
support <span style="">under Article</span> 22 of the
Civil Code which seemed to do away with fur<span style="">ther unnecessary litigations after the very fundamental object and motive
of the action has been duly passed upon and decided.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the motion <span style="">for
reconsideration </span>should be, as it is hereby not favorably granted."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In effect, petitioner
assails these orders on the following </span><span style="">grounds:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span><span style="">first, </span>that the
issuance of a writ of <span style="">possession
ordering pe</span><span style="">titioner to deliver
the land to private respondents would not be in </span><span style="">accordance with the dispositive</span> portion of the decision <span style="">of the<span style="">
</span></span><span style="">Court of</span> Appeals
which merely states "Wherefore, the judgment appealed from <span style="">is </span>hereby
reversed and the case dismissed with cost against plaintiff-appellee";
and, second, that since private respondents themselves maintain "that if
the plaintiff (herein <span style="">petitioner) is </span>in
possession of the same (the portion of the land used by petitioner as a
cemetery) it is because the plaintiff had asked permission sometime in the year
1934 from the defendants' (herein private respondents') father to utilize said
portion of land as cemetery with the agreement that the plaintiff shall pay the
defendants the reasonable rental thereof", then, petitioner "cannot
be deprived of the possession of the land merely by means of a writ of
possession" but respondents "must file an action for unlawful
detainer on account of the failure of petitioner to pay the rent as contended
by them". <span style="">&nbsp;</span>(Par. 15, Petition, and
Appendices "E" and "G")</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner <span style="">is </span>right
on both scores.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Evidently, <span style="">respondent judge has misread </span>the
decision of the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
is nothing therein indicating that respondents have been illegally deprived of
the possession of their land or that the continued possession thereof by
petitioner is against their will.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Oh the
contrary, what appears strongly suggested to the point of appearing as a
factual premise for the decision is the existence of a lease agreement between
petitioner and respondent covering the land in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, if anything is to be gathered
regarding this matter from the records, it <span style="">is </span>that the counter-claim of respondents for the payment of
rentals must be con­sidered <span style="">as </span>having
been dismissed by both the trial court and the Court of Appeals, considering
the same <span style="">was </span>properly pleaded
and yet it <span style="">was </span>not passed upon
by said courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the only
rentals which would appear to be recoverable by respondents are those which
accrued after the decision of the Court of Appeals became final.</p>

<p class="BODY">Ordinarily, <span style="">as </span>precedents
have it,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a> a
judgment declaring a party the owner of a land entitles such party to an
execution to re­cover possession thereof from the losing party even if there is
no prayer therefore <span style="">in </span>the
complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This rule holds, however,
only when the matter of possession is not otherwise litigated separately from
that of ownership.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is only proper
that when possession is dealt with by the parties in any manner that separates
it from the matter of ownership or title, the two things be also considered <span style="">as </span>separable
in the judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing
inconsistent in ownership and possession being in distinct parties when there
are relations or agreements between them to such effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this particular case, for instance,<span style=""> </span>while indisputably the title over the
subject land belongs to the <span style="">res­</span>pondents, it is equally clear that petitioner is using the <span style="">same </span><span style="">as a </span>cemetery, no less, by virtue of a
contract of lease.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In such <span style="">circums­tance, petitioner's </span>contention
must be upheld that it <span style="">is </span>only by a separate action of ejectment, if such be warranted,
that respondents may recover the possession of their land.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Talens v. Garcia,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>one <span style="">Felipe Garcia filed a complaint (1) to annul a deed </span>of sale
executed by Laureano Estefanio in favor of his co-defendant <span style="">Jose </span>L.
Talens involving a parcel of land (a<span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: black; vertical-align: baseline;"> </span></span>homestead)
in Laur, Nueva Ecija, (2) to compel Laureano Estefanio to convey the property
to him, and (3) to recover damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
appears that after selling the lot to Felipe Garcia in 1938, Estefanio sold it
again to Jose L. Talens in 1943.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
lower court ruled in favor of Garcia; but on appeal, the Court of Appeals found
for the defendant Jose L. Talens, and said:</p>

<blockquote>"Wherefore, the decision appealed from <span style="">is </span>hereby reversed and defendant-appellant Jose Talens absolved
from the complaint, with costs against the plaintiff-appellee, Felipe
Garcia."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Upon finality of the decision, Talens
filed with the lower court a motion for <span style="">an
</span>order to the provincial sheriff "for the possession of the
controverted land by Jose L. Talens by evicting the plaintiff therefrom"
and for collection of costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court
denied the peti­tion as to possession, explaining that <span style="">after </span>having gone "over the decision of the Court of
Appeals we have found no disposition regarding the return of the possession to
defendant Jose L. Talens".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Talens
instituted an action for mandamus in this Court to compel the respond­ent judge
to order the delivery of the land to him, but the same was denied by this Court
in the following rationale:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"It may be admitted that the judgment ab­solving defendant
Talens was <span style="">in </span>effect a declar­ation
that the sale to him was valid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may
also be admitted, though with some reluctance or reservation, that it <span style="">was </span>a declaration of ownership of the
lot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But it is doubtful whe­ther it also
included a direction to surrender it to him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Although it is true that the owner is generally entitled to possession,
it <span style="">is </span>equally true that there
may be cases where the actual pos­sessor has some rights which must be
respected or defined.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A lessee is not
the owner; yet a declaration of ownership in another person does not
necessarily mean his ouster.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Touching the <span style="">case at
</span>bar, if the possessor Garcia had made necessary improvements for which
he is entitled to compensation, an order of possession would deprive him of
such payment with­out having had an opportunity to claim for them and prove
their value.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His Honor, the trial judge,
obviously foresaw this possibility among others, and refused to decree the
restitution, taking 'into consideration that said decision (of the Court of
Appeals) seems not to close all doors for the parties to protect their
respective in­terests, if they still have <span style="">any.'"<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The same rationale was echoed in Jabon, et al. v. Alo,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
where <span style="">this </span>Court held:</p>

<blockquote>“x x x Rule 39, section 45, provides that 'that only is deemed to
have been adjudged in a former judgment which appears upon its face to <span style="">have </span>been so adjudged, or which <span style="">was </span>actually and neces­sarily included
therein or necessary thereto’.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here
there has been only a declaration of ownership.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">No </span>other relief is
awarded to the plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the absence
of any other declaration, can we con­sider a mere declaration of ownership <span style="">as necessarily </span>including the
possession of the property adjudicated?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We do not believe so, for ownership <span style="">is </span>different from possession.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A person may be declared <span style="">owner, </span>but
he may not be entitled to possession.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The possession may <span style="">be in </span>the
hands of another either as a lessee or a tenant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A person may have improvements thereon of
which he may not be deprived without due hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He may have other valid defenses to resist
surrender of possession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We therefore,
hold that a judgment for ownership, does not necessarily include possession <span style="">as </span>a necessary incident."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As correctly pointed out in the Perez v. Evite case,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
"it <span style="">may
</span>be observed that in both decisions (referring to the Talens and Jabon
cases just cited), this Court underscored the possibility that the actual
possessor <span style="">has
</span>some rights which must be respected and defined", and that
"the pronouncement was made having in mind cases wherein the actual
possessor <span style="">has
a </span>valid right over the property enforceable even against the owner
thereof".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is <span style="">Our </span><span style="">view </span>that this doctrine is squarely
applicable to the present case where, admittedly, petitioner <span style="">came </span>into
the possession of the property in dispute with prior consent of and agreement
with herein private respondents' predecessor-in-interest, and upon the promise
of the former to the lat­ter to pay "the reasonable rental
thereof".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is Our conclusion then
that petitioner is legally in possession of the <span style="">property and </span>its right of possession <span style="">must </span>be respected by private <span style="">respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>If at all,
the alleged non-payment of rents <span style="">may </span>be the basis of an action for ejectment;
but the declaration of ownership in <span style="">the
</span><span style="">action
</span><span style="">for reconveyance </span><span style="">here</span><span style=""> </span>involved does not justify the <span style="">issuing of a writ </span>of possession under
the circumstances of this case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, We hold that the respondent judge acted in excess of
jurisdiction in granting herein private respondents' motion for a writ of
possession.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Incidentally, </span>it
may be stated before closing, the <span style="">writ </span>of
possession issued by respondent judge could not be the appropriate remedy, even
<span style="">if </span>it
were assumed that the judgment of the Court of Ap­peals carries with it a
recognition of respondents' right to have possession of the disputed land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The writ of possession is available to an
applicant for registration and his successors-in-interest only as against a
party who has acquired possession thereof adversely to such applicant prior to
the issuance of the decree, but not against one who has been legitimately given
such possession <span style="">like </span>petitioner
in this case who, by respondents' own admission is a lessee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pro­per remedy against a lessee is
ejectment under Rule 70.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, <span style="">a </span>writ of
possession is supposed to be issued by the court issuing the decree of
registration <span style="">as a </span><span style="">consequence </span>thereof and not by virtue
of a counterclaim in ordinary action <span style="">as </span>in this case.</p>
