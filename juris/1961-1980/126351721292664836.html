				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Fausto</span> Varela was the Deputy
Commissioner of Civil Ser­vice on February 21, 1962 when he was suspended from
office by the President of the Philippines on charges of grave misconduct in
office, insubordination, discourtesy, and violation of adminis­trative order
46, series of 1937 (regarding undue publicity), filed against him by the then
Commissioner of Civil Service <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> del Rosario.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="11" month="11">November 11, 1965</st1:date>
Varela filed a petition for <u>certiorari</u> and mandamus with the Court of
First Instance of Manila against Salvador <span class="SpellE">Mariño</span>
(then Executive Secretary), Civil Service Com­missioner <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Subido</span> and Acting Deputy Commissioner of Ci­vil
Service <span class="SpellE">Alipio</span> Buenaventura, seeking the
nullification of the administrative proceedings against him and his
reinstatement to his position as Deputy Commissioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his petition, docketed as civil case
63245, Varela alleged that he was suspended on the ba­sis of an unverified
complaint; that his suspension was lifted only after 85 days had elapsed; that
thereafter he was detailed successively to different positions in the
Government, everyone of which was of a much lower rank than that of Deputy
Civil Service Com­missioner; and that such reassignments "operated to
impose upon [him] the administrative penalty of demotion and removal from his
office for a cause not provided by law and without due process, in flagrant
violation of Section 1 of Art. III, Section 4 of Art. XII of the Constitution
and of Section 32 of Republic Act No. 2260 (Ci­vil Service Act of 1959),"
and were made "in excess of jurisdic­tion and with grave abuse of
discretion." He, therefore, prayed that he be reinstated as Deputy
Commissioner of Civil Service.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon his motion, the court issued its injunctive order of
November 16, 1965, and, two days later, on November 18, issued a writ of
preliminary mandatory injunction directing Secretary Marino and the herein
petitioners <span class="SpellE">Subido</span> and Buenaventura to re­instate him
to his former position.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners herein protested the issuance of the man­datory
injunction and asked the court to reconsider its order, but because the matter
might take some time to resolve, they agreed to abide by the order and allow
Varela's reinstatement in the mean­time.</p>

<p class="BODY">Varela subsequently filed an opposition, and the petitioners in
turn filed their reply.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, Secretary Marino and the petitioners filed a motion to
dismiss Varela's suit, contending that the petition sta­ted no cause of action;
that the cause of action, if any, was bar­red by prescription; and that Varela
had waived his claim to re­instatement.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Varela filed an opposition.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="11" month="12">December 11, 1965</st1:date>
the motion for reconsideration and the motion to dismiss were submitted for
resolution.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="21" month="12">December 21, 1965</st1:date>,
the President found Varela guilty of misconduct in office, insubordination and
"presumptuous con­duct," and accordingly considered him resigned from
the service "without prejudice to recovering retirement and leave benefits
... and without prejudice to his appointment to another position equivalent in
rank to his present post." The President's decision was contained in
Administrative Order 171, dated <st1:date year="1965" day="21" month="12">December
 21, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Following the
issuance of the President's order, the peti­tioners asked the court to dissolve
the writ of preliminary man­datory injunction on the ground that the case had
become moot.</p>

<p class="BODY">Varela countered by filing a motion for a restraining order
against the enforcement of the President's order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He averred that the administrative
proceedings against him were void because he was suspended without being
afforded an opportunity to explain; that he was suspended even before the
investigation could be started; that his suspension was effected not by the
President but only by the Executive Secretary acting "by authority of the
President;" that at any rate the power to suspend had been transferred to
the Civil Service Commissioner; that administrative order 171 was not based on
the evidence presented at the investigation but on a mere affidavit; and that
contrary to executive order 370, series of 1941, the case against him was not
terminated within 15 days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Varela re­produced
these allegations in a supplementary petition he filed on <st1:date year="1966" day="31" month="1">January 31, 1966</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="4" month="1">January 4, 1966</st1:date>
the court granted Varela's motion and enjoined the petitioners from enforcing the
President's adminis­trative order and from otherwise disturbing Varela in the
discharge of his duties and functions as Deputy Commissioner of Civil Service.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners moved for reconsideration on the ground that the
case had become moot and that enforcement of the Presi­dent's order could no
longer be enjoined as it was earlier executed when a copy thereof was served on
Varela on December 27, 1965 and when, on the following day, December 28, the
petitioner Bue­naventura was sworn in office as Deputy Civil Service
Commissioner in place of Varela.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Actually, <st1:city><st1:place>Buenaventura</st1:place></st1:city>'s
appointment was made on December 22, but because the office was not yet vacant
as Vare­la had not by then been informed of his relief, <st1:city><st1:place>Buenaventura</st1:place></st1:city>
did not take his oath until the day, after Varela was served a copy of the
President's order.</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 25, 1966, the court, in two separate orders, denied
the petitioners' motion for reconsideration, their earlier mo­tion to dissolve
the writ of preliminary mandatory injunction of No­vember 18, 1965 (by virtue
of which Varela was reinstated-to his position), and their motion to dismiss
Varela's suit in the lower court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the present petition for <u>certiorari</u> and prohibition
to set aside the trial court's injunctive order of November 16, 1965, the
mandatory injunction of November 18, 1965 directing the peti­tioners to
reinstate Varela to the office of Deputy Civil Service Commissioner, and the
order of January 4, 1966 enjoining the, pe­titioners from enforcing
administrative order 171 and disturbing Varela in the discharge of his
office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners, in conse­quence,
likewise seek the nullification of the proceedings in civil case 63245.</p>

<p class="BODY">We gave due course to the petition and required the res­pondents
to answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the meantime, on <st1:date year="1966" day="18" month="2">February 18, 1966</st1:date>, we issued a writ
of preliminary injunction enjoining the enforcement of the disputed order of <st1:date year="1965" day="16" month="11">November 16, 1965</st1:date> and the writ of
preli­minary mandatory injunction of <st1:date year="1965" day="18" month="11">November
 18, 1965</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="NUM">1. In assaying the legality of the <st1:date year="1965" day="16" month="11">November 16, 1965</st1:date> injunc­tive order and the writ of
preliminary mandatory injunction of <st1:date year="1965" day="18" month="11">No­vember
 18, 1965</st1:date>, we take for our text a rule long settled in this
jurisdiction:</p>

<blockquote>"[S]<span class="SpellE">ince</span> an
injunction mandatory in its nature usual­ly tends to do more than to maintain
the <u>status</u> <u>quo</u>, it is generally improper to issue such an
injunction prior to the final hearing; ... on the other hand, in cases of
extreme urgency; where the right is very clear; where considerations of
relative inconvenience bear strongly in complainant's favor; where there is a
willful and unlawful invasion of plaintiff's right against his protest and
remonstrance, the injury be­ing a continuing one; and where the effect of the
man­datory injunction is rather to reestablish and main­tain a preexisting
continuing relation between the par­ties, recently and arbitrarily interrupted
by the de­fendant, than to establish a new relation, ... the ju­risdiction to
grant such injunction undoubtedly exists; and while caution must be exercised
in its issuance, the writ should not be denied the complainant when he makes
out a clear case, free from doubt and dispute."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As the issuance of a mandatory injunction is the exception rather
than the rule, the party applying for it must show a clear legal right the
violation of which is so recent as to make its vindi­cation an urgent one.</p>

<p class="BODY">Did the respondent Varela demonstrate such a clear legal right to
be returned to his former post?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Was
there an urgent need to grant him relief?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In his petition Varela alleged that his suspen­sion was not lifted until
after the lapse of more than sixty days and that instead of reinstating him to
his position as Deputy Civil Ser­vice Commissioner he was detailed to several
offices, one after the other, of a much lower rank, contrary to the following
provi­sions of the Civil Service Act of 1959:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 32.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Disciplinary
Action</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- No officer or employee in
the civil service shall be removed or suspended except for cause as provided by
law and after due process: <u>Provided</u>, That a transfer from one position
to another without reduction in rank or salary shall not be considered
disciplinary when made in the interest of public service: ..."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SEC. 35.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Lifting of
Preventive Suspension Pending Administrative Investigation</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- When the administrative case against the officer
or employee under preventive suspension is not finally decided by the
Commissioner of Civil Service within the pe­riod of sixty (60) days after the
date of suspension of the respondent, the respondent shall be reinsta­ted in
the service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the respondent officer
or em­ployee is exonerated, he shall be restored to his position with full pay
for the period of suspension."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">But as the Solicitor General correctly argues, the detail of
Varela to the different offices of the Government was merely temporary, and was
done in order to clear the atmosphere in the Civil Service Commission of the
animosity between Varela and Commissioner Del Rosario and other employees.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
After all Va­rela Continued to receive his salary as Deputy Commissioner of
Civil Service. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>What is more, section 35
above-quoted clearly states that in the event an administrative case is not
decided within sixty days, a suspended employee must "be reinstated in the
<u>service</u>," and only if he is finally exonerated must he be
"restored to <u>his position</u> with full pay for the period of
suspension."</p>

<p class="BODY">Nor did the respondent's case come to court with such urgency as
to call for a mandatory injunction to restore relations so recently
ruptured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Varela was suspended from
office on <st1:date year="1962" day="21" month="2">February 21, 1962</st1:date>,
and reinstated in the service on September 28 of the, same year, but it was not
until <st1:date year="1965" day="11" month="11">November 11, 1965</st1:date>
that he went to court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently,
restoration of the respondent to his former position, assuming <span class="SpellE"><u>arguendo</u></span> that this is required by law, had ceased to
be an urgent need, especially considering that the court should have foreseen
that by then the administrative case would most proba­bly not take much longer
to decide, as in fact it was decided a month after the issuance of the
mandatory injunction in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Absent a showing of a clear, urgent legal duty to restore the
respondent to his position, we hold that the court gravely abused its
discretion in issuing its injunctive order of <st1:date year="1965" day="16" month="11">November 16, 1965</st1:date> and the writ of preliminary mandatory
injunction of <st1:date year="1965" day="18" month="11">November 18, 1965</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="NUM">2. The propriety and legality of the preliminary manda­tory
injunction aside, the court should have dissolved it following the promulgation
of administrative order 171.</p>

<p class="BODY">The basic assumption underlying the issuance of the writ of preliminary
mandatory injunction, be it recalled, was that Va­rela's transfer from one
office to another, while his administra­tive case was still pending, was
equivalent to removal without cause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
although his petition contains allegations which in a way disparage the
administrative proceedings against him, yet the main thrust of his case was
that his assignment to various of­fices all of which are of a lower rank than
his former position, was a virtual removal without cause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As stated earlier, it was not until after the
promulgation of administrative order 171 that the petitioner directly
challenged the legality of the administra­tive proceedings by filing a
so-called supplementary petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
is why the injunctive order and the writ of mandatory injunc­tion issued
pursuant thereto were directed not against the admi­nistrative proceedings but
only against Varela's detail from one office to another.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The result was that the administrative case
pro­ceeded to final judgment without any interruption from the court,
culminating in the promulgation of administrative order 171.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The issuance, therefore, by the court of the
order of January 4, 1966, which maintained the writ of preliminary mandatory
injunction, was a negation of the corollary assumption implicit in the earlier
order that the injunction issued <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span> was to
last only for as long as Varela was not adjudged guilty in the administrative
case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, the situation here is similar to that of <u>City of <span class="SpellE">Butuan</span> v. Ortiz</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
in which a court of first instance rendered judgment ordering the reinstatement
of the petitioner pending termination of the administrative case filed against
him upon the court's finding that his suspension had been continued for more
than sixty days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the petitioner
did not ask for the execution of the judgment until after the administrative
case had been decided against him and he was about to be removed from the
service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court held that execution
of the judgment of the court was barred by the decision of the Civil Service
Commissioner.</p>

<blockquote>"It is true that the judgment was
correct because the suspension was ordered on <st1:date year="1954" day="11" month="3">March 11, 1954</st1:date>, and by <st1:date year="1954" day="1" month="6">June 1, 1954</st1:date>, when the petition for man­damus was filed in
the Court of First Instance, more than 60 days have already expired without the
case having been decided.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is also
true that the decision of the Court of First Instance in said special civil
action continued to be <span class="SpellE">executory</span> when the motion for
execution was presented, because the 5-year period within which a decision of the
court may be enforced by motion had not yet ex­pired, but as it was alleged and
shown in the mo­tion for the reconsideration of the order granting execution,
that the Commissioner of Civil Ser­vice had already affirmed the decision <i>of
</i>the Mu­nicipal Board finding <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> guilty on
November 29, 1954, the right to reinstatement was barred by the decision of the
Commissioner of Civil Ser­vice. ... In other words, a supervening cause or
reason had arisen which has rendered the decision of the court ordering reinstatement,
no longer enforceable."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The "supervening cause" was a
superior cause, superseding the basis of the judgment and making its execution
untenable.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that the President's order is not as yet final because
Varela filed a motion for reconsideration,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
but it is equally true that decisions of this nature may be executed even
before they become final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason for
this is that public interest would be jeopardized if the Government were forced
to retain in its service, during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the
motion for reconsideration (or appeal), an employee who has been adjudged unfit
for retention in the service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
other hand, by making execution a matter of administrative discretion, public
interest would be properly sub-served and safeguarded, without prejudice, in
the event of exonera­tion, to the employee's reinstatement with <span class="SpellE">backpay</span> and full restoration of his rights and privileges.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>
