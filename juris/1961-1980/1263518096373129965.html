<p class="BODY">Reasons in support of <span style="">said

its Special Proceeding No. 6344, <u><span style="">supra</span></u><span style="">, </span>and failing to declare itself 'the

<p class="BODY">The writ of preliminary injunction prayed for was granted and
issued by this Court on October 24, 1963.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 22, 1964 petitioner filed against the <span style="">same </span>respondents
<span style="">a </span>pleading
entitled SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION FOR <i>MANDAMUS</i> - docketed <span style="">in this Court as G. R. No. L-21939 -</span>praying,
for the reasons therein stated, that judgment be rendered <span style="">annulling </span>the orders issued by the
Negros Court on December 7, 1963 and February 26, 1964, the first disapproving
his record on appeal and the second denying motion for reconsideration, <span style="">and </span>further commanding said court to
approve his record on appeal and to give due course to his appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On July 15, 1964 We issued a resolution defe<span style="">rring action </span>on this Supplemental <span style="">Petition until </span>the ori­ginal action
for <i>certiorari</i> (G. R. L-21938) is taken up on the merits.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On October 21, 1963 the </span>respondents
in G. R. L-21938 filed their answer traversing petitioner's contention that the
<span style="">respondent courts had committed grave
abuse </span>of discretion in relation to the matters alleged in <span style="">the petition for <i>certiorari</i></span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears <span style="">that </span>on
November 6, 1961 petitioner filed <span style="">with
the Negros </span><span style="">Court a petition for the settlement of the </span><span style="">estate of the late Don Juan Uriarte y Goite (Special Pro­</span>ceeding
No. 6344) alleging therein, inter alia, that, as <span style="">a </span>natural son of the latter, he was
his sole heir, and that, during the life time of said decedent, petitioner had
insti­tuted Civil Case No. 6142 in the same Court for his compul­sory
acknowledgment <span style="">as
</span><span style="">such natural son.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon </span>petitioner's <span style="">motion the </span>Negros Court appointed the
Philippine National Bank <span style="">as special </span>administrator on November 13, 1961 and two days later
it set the date for the hearing of the petition and ordered that the requisite <span style="">notices be published in </span>accordance <span style="">with </span>law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record discloses, however, that, <span style="">for one reason or
another, the Philippine National Bank never actually qualified </span><span style="">as special </span><span style="">administrator.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On December 19, 1961, Higinio Uriarte, one of the two private
respondents herein, filed an opposition to the above-mentioned petition
alleging that he was a nephew of the deceased Juan Uriarte y Goite who had
"executed a Last Will and Testament in Spain, <span style="">a </span>duly authenticated copy whereof <span style="">has </span>been
requested and which shall be submitted <span style="">to
this Honorable Court upon receipt thereof", and further questioning
petitioner's capacity and interest </span>to commence the <span style="">intestate proceeding.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On August 28, 1962, Juan Uriarte Zamacona, the other <span style="">private respondent, commenced Special
Proceeding No. 51396 in the </span>Manila Court for <span style="">the probate of </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">document
alleged to be the </span><span style="">last will of
the deceased Juan Uriarte <span style="">y </span>Goite,
</span><span style="">and on
</span><span style="">the same date he filed in
Special Proceeding No. 6344 of </span><span style="">the
Negros Court a motion to dismiss the same on </span>the following grounds: (1)
that, <span style="">as </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">deceased Juan Uriarte y Goite </span><span style="">had left a last will, there was no legal basis to proceed with said </span>intestate
proceedings, and (2) that petitioner Vicente Uriarte had no legal personality <span style="">and interest to </span>initiate said
intestate proceedings, he <span style="">not being an
acknowledged natural son of the decedent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A </span>copy of the Petition for Probate and of the alleged Will were
attached to the Motion to Dismiss.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner opposed the
aforesaid motion to dismiss </span>contending that, as the Negros Court was
first to take <span style="">cognizance of the </span>settlement
of the <span style="">estate of the deceased Juan
Uriarte y Goite, it had acquired exclusive jurisdiction over the same pursuant
to Rule 75, Section 1 of the Rules of Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On April 19, 1963, the Negros Court sustained Juan Uriarte
Zamacona's motion to dismiss and dismissed the Special Proceeding No. 6344
pending before it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">His </span>motion
for reconsideration of said order having been denied on<span style=""> </span>July 27, 1963, petitioner proceeded to file his notice of <span style="">appeal, appeal bond </span>and record on
appeal for the purpose of appealing from said orders to this court on questions
of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The administrator with the will
annexed appointed by the Manila Court to Special Proceeding No. 51396 objected
to the approval of the record on appeal, and under date of December 7, 1963 the
Negros Court issued the following order:</p>

<blockquote>"Oppositor prays that the record on appeal filed by the
petitioner on July 27, 1963, be dismissed for having been filed out of time and
for being incomplete.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">In the meantime, </span>before the <span style="">said </span>record
on appeal was approved by this Court, the petitioner filed a petition for cer<span style="">tiorari before the Supreme Court entitled Vi­cente
Uriarte, Petitioner, vs. Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental, et al,
G. R. No. L-21938, bringing this case squarely before </span>the Supreme Court
on questions of law which is <span style="">tantamount
to petitioner's abandoning his appeal from this Court.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"WHEREFORE,
in order to give way to the certiorari, the record on appeal filed by the peti­tioner
</span><span style="">is </span><span style="">hereby disapproved."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In view of the above-quoted order, petitioner filed the
supplemental petition for <i>mandamus</i> mentioned heretofore.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 15, 1963 Vicente Uriarte filed an Omnibus Motion in
Special Proceeding No. 51396 <span style="">pending in
the </span>Manila Court, asking for leave to intervene therein; for the
dismissal of the petition and the annulment of the proceedings had in said
special proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion was
denied by said <span style="">court in its order of
July 1 of the </span>same year.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is admitted that, as alleged in the basic petition filed in
Special Proceeding No. 6344 of the Negros Court, Vicente Uriarte filed in the
same court, during the life time of Juan Uriarte y Goite, Civil Case No. 6142
to obtain judgment for his compulsory acknowledgment as <span style="">his </span>natural child.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Clearly inferrable from this is that at the time he filed the action, as
well as when he commenced the aforesaid special proceeding, he had not yet been
acknowledged as natural son of Juan Uriarte y Goite.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Up to this time, no final judgment to that
effect appears to have been rendered.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record further discloses that the special pro­ceeding before
the Negros Court has not gone farther than the appointment of a special
administrator in the person of the Philippine National Bank who, as stated
heretofore, failed to qualify.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, it is not disputed that, after proper
proceedings were had in Special Proceeding No. 5139, the Manila Court admitted
to probate the document submitted to it as the last will of Juan Uriarte <span style="">y </span>Goite, <span style="">the petition for probate appearing not to
have been </span>contested.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears
further that, as stated heretofore, the order issued by the Manila Court on
July 1, 1963 denied petitioner Vicente Uriarte's Omnibus Motion for
Intervention, Dismissal of Petition and Annullment of said proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">Likewise, it is not denied that to the motion to dis­miss the
special proceeding <span style="">pending before the
Negros Court filed by Higinio </span>Uriarte were attached a copy of the
alleged <span style="">last will of Juan Uriarte y
Goite and of the petition filed </span>with the Manila Court for its
probate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is clear, there­fore, that
almost from the start of Special Proceeding No. 6344, the Negros Court and
petitioner Vicente Uriarte knew of the existence of the aforesaid last will and
of the pro­ceedings for its probate.</p>

<p class="BODY">The principal legal questions raised in the <span style="">petition </span>for <i>certiorari</i> are (a)
whether or not the Negros Court erred in dismissing Special Proceeding No.
6344, <span style="">on the one </span>hand, and on
the other, (b) whether the Manila Court simi­larly erred in not dismissing
Special Proceeding No. 51396 <span style="">notwithstanding
proof of the prior filing of Special Pro­</span>ceeding No. 6344 in the Negros
Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the Judiciary Act of 1948 [<span style="">Section </span>44, paragraph (e)], Courts of First Instance have
original exclusive juris­<span style="">diction over
"all </span>matters of probate", that is, over special <span style="">proceedings for the </span>settlement of the
estate of deceased persons - whether they died testate or intestate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While their jurisdiction over such subject
matter is beyond question, the matter of <u>venue</u>, or the particular Court
of First Instance where the special proceeding Should be commenced, <span style="">is </span>regulated by former Rule 75,
Section 1 of the Rules of Court, now Section 1, <span style="">Rule </span>73 of the Revised Rules <span style="">of Court, which provides that the </span>estate
of a decedent in­<span style="">habitant of </span>the
Philippines at the time of his death, whether a citizen or an alien, shall be
in the court of first instance <span style="">in the
province in which he resided at the time of his death, </span>and <u>if he is </u><u><span style="">an </span>inhabitant of a </u><u><span style="">foreign country the court </span>of </u><u><span style="">first <span style="">instance
of any province in </span>which he had estate</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly, when the
estate to be settled <span style="">is </span>that of <span style="">a </span>non­resident alien - like the
deceased Juan Uriarte y Goite - the <span style="">Courts
of First Instance in </span><span style="">provinces </span><span style="">where the
deceased </span>left any property <span style="">have </span>concurrent
jurisdiction to take cogni­zance of the <span style="">proper
</span>special proceeding for the settlement of his estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span style="">the
</span>case before Us, these Courts of First Instance <span style="">are </span>the Negros and the Manila Courts
- province <span style="">and city where the deceased
Juan Uriarte y Goite left con­siderable properties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From this premise petitioner argues that, as </span>the
Negros Court had first taken <span style="">cognizance
of the special proceeding for the </span>settlement of the estate of said <span style="">decedent (Special Proceeding No. 6344), the
Manila Court </span><span style="">no longer had
jurisdiction to take cognizance of Special Pro­</span>ceeding <span style="">No. </span>51396 intended to settle the
estate of the same decedent in accordance with his alleged will, <span style="">and that con­</span>sequently, the first
court erred in dismissing Special Pro­ceeding No. 6344, while the second court
similarly erred in not dismissing Special Proceeding No. 51396.</p>

<p class="BODY">It can not be denied that a special proceeding intended to effect
the distribution of the estate of a deceased person; <span style="">whether in accordance with the law on intestate </span>succession or in
accordance with his will, is a "probate matter" or a <span style="">proceeding </span>for the settlement of his
estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="">is </span>equally <span style="">true, however,
that in accordance with settled jurisprudence in this jurisdiction, testate
proceedings for the settlement of the estate of a </span>deceased person take
precedence over in­testate proceedings for the same purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus it has been <span style="">held repeatedly that, if in the course of intestate proceed­ings
pending before a court of first instance it is found that the decedent had left
a last will, proceedings for the probate of the latter should replace the
intestate proceed­ings <span style="">even </span>if
at that stage an administrator had already been appointed, the latter being
required to render final account and turn over the estate in his possession to
the executor subsequently appointed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This, however, is understood to be without prejudice that should the
alleged last will be rejected or is disapproved, the proceeding shall continue
as an intestacy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As already adverted to,
this is a clear indication that proceedings for the probate of a will enjoy
priority over intestate proceedings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the facts before <span style="">Us </span>the question arises as to whether Juan
Uriarte Zamacona should have filed the peti­tion for the probate of the last
will of Juan Uriarte <span style="">y </span>Goite with the Negros Court - particularly in Special Pro­ceeding
No. 6344 - or was entitled to commence the corresponding separate proceedings,
as he did, in the Manila Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The following considerations and the facts of record would seem
to support the view that he should have submitted said will for probate to the
Negros Court, either in a sepa­rate special proceeding or in an appropriate
motion for said purpose filed in the already pending Special Proceeding No.
6344.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first place, it is not in
accord with public policy and the orderly and inexpensive administration of
justice to unnecessarily multiply litigation, especially <span style="">if </span>several
courts would be involved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">This, in effect,
was </span>the result of the submission of the will aforesaid to the Manila
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the second place, when
respondent Higinio Uriarte filed an opposition to Vicente Uriarte's petition
for the issuance of letters of administration, he had already informed the
Negros Court that the deceased Juan Uriarte y Goite had left a will in Spain,
of which a copy had been re­quested <u>for submission to said court</u>; and
when the other respondent, Juan Uriarte Zamacona, filed his motion to dismiss
Special Proceeding No. 6344, he had submitted to the Negros Court a copy of the
alleged will of the decedent, from which fact it may be inferred that, like
Higinio Uriarte, he knew before filing the petition for probate with the Manila
Court that there was already a special proceeding pending in the Negros Court
for the settlement of the estate of the <span style="">same </span>deceased person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As far as Higinio Uriarte is concerned, it
seems quite clear that in his opposition to petitioner's petition in Special
Proceeding No. 6344, he had expressly promised to submit said will for probate
to the Negros Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">But the fact <span style="">is </span>that instead of the aforesaid will being presented for
probate to the Negros Court, Juan Uriarte Zamacona filed the petition for the
purpose with the Manila Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We can
not accept petitioner's contention in this regard that the latter court had no
jurisdiction to consider said petition, albeit we say that it was not the <u>proper
venue</u> therefor.</p>

<p class="BODY">It <span style="">is </span>well
settled in this jurisdiction that <u>wrong</u> <u>venue</u> <span style="">is </span>merely a <u>waiveable</u>
procedural defect, and, in the light of the circumstances obtaining in the
instant case, we are of the opinion, and so hold, that petitioner has waived
the right to raise such objection or is pre­cluded from doing so by
laches.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is enough to consider in this
connection that petitioner knew of the existence of a will executed by Juan
Uriarte y Goite since December 19, 1961 when Higinio Uriarte filed <span style="">his </span>opposition to the initial
petition filed in Special Proceeding No, 6344; that petitioner likewise was
served with notice of the existence (presence) of the alleged last will in the
Philippines and of the filing of the petition for its probate with the Manila
Court since August 28, 1962 when Juan Uriarte Zamacona filed a motion for the
dismissal of Special Proceeding No. 6344.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All these notwithstanding, it was only on April 15, 1963 that he filed
with the Manila Court in Special Proceeding No. 51396 an Omnibus motion asking
for leave to intervene and for the dismissal and annulment of all the
proceedings had therein up to that date; thus enabling the Manila Court not
only to appoint an administrator with the will annexed but also to admit said
will to probate more than five months earlier, or more specifically, on October
31, 1962.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To allow him now to assail the
exercise of jurisdiction over the probate of <span style="">the </span>will by the Manila Court and the validity of all the pro­ceedings
had in Special Proceeding No. 51396 would put a premium on his negligence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, it must be remembered that this
Court is not inclined to annul proceedings re­gularly had in a lower court even
if the latter was not the <u><span style="">proper
venue</span></u><span style=""> </span>therefor, if
the net result would be to have the same proceedings repeated in some other
court of similar jurisdiction; more so in a case like the present where the
objection against said proceedings is raised too late.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In his order of April 19,
1963 dismissing Special Proceeding No. 6344, Judge Fernandez of the Negros
Court said that he was "not inclined to sustain the contention </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the petitioner that inasmuch as the herein
petitioner has instituted Civil Case No. 6142 for compulsory acknowledgment by
the decedent such action justifies the institution </span><span style="">by him of </span><span style="">this proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the petitioner is to be consistent with
the authorities cited by him in support of his contention, </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">proper thing for him to do would be to
intervene in the certain estate</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">proceedings
entitled Special Proceedings No. 51396 in the Court of First Instance of Manila
instead of maintaining an independent action, for indeed his supposed interest </span><span style="">in the </span><span style="">estate of the decedent is of his doubtful
character pending </span><span style="">the final decision of the action for compulsory acknowledgment".<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We believe in connection with the above matter that petitioner is
entitled to prosecute Civil Case No. 6142 until it is finally determined, or intervene
in Special Proceeding No. 51396 of the Manila Court, if it <span style="">is </span>still
open, or to ask for its reopening if it has already been closed, so as to be
able to submit for determination the question of his acknowledgment as a natural
child of the deceased testator, said court having, in its <span style="">capacity as a </span><span style="">probate court, jurisdiction to declare who
are the heirs of the deceased testator and whether or not a particular party is
or should be declared his acknowledged natural child (II Moran on Rules of
Court, 1957 Ed. p. 476; Conde vs. Abaya, 13 Phil. 249, Severino vs. Severino,
44 Phil. 343; Lopez vs. Lopez, 68 Phil. 227, and Jimoga-on vs. Belmonte, 47 O.
G. 1119).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Coming now to the supplemental petition for <i>mandamus</i> (G.
R. <span style="">No. </span>L-21939), We are <span style="">of </span>the
opinion, and so hold, that in view of the conclusions heretofore stated, the <span style="">same has become moot and academic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the said supplemental petition is
successful, it will only result in compelling the Negros Court to give due
course to the appeal that peti­tioner was taking, from the orders of said court
dated Decem­ber 7, 1963 and February 26, 1964, the first being the order of
said court dismissing Special Proceeding, No. 6344, and the second being an
order denying petitioner's motion for the reconsideration of said order of
dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said orders being, as </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">result of what has been said heretofore,
beyond petitioner's power to contest, the conclusion can not be other than that
the intended appeal would serve no useful purpose, or, worse still, would
enable petitioner to circumvent our ruling that he can no longer question the
validity of said orders.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b style="">IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING
