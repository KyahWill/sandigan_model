				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Certiorari and prohibition to nullify the contempt charge
initiated by respondent Judge against the Mayor, Vice-Mayor, Councilors, City
Treasurer and City Auditor of <span class="SpellE">Ozamiz</span> City, and to
stop said respondent from proceeding with the contempt case.</p>

<p class="BODY">On application, this Court on March 25, 1966, issued a
cease-and-desist order transmitted to respondent Judge by telegram that same
day.</p>

<p class="BODY">Following are the events that spawned the present proceedings:</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 11, 1966, respondent Judge of the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Occidental, Branch I, issued
[Special Case No. 9, for con­tempt, initiated by him against petitioners
herein] an order, directing petitioners, amongst others, to appear before him
in the morning of March 19, 1966, to show cause why they should not be held in
contempt of court for alleged contumacious refusal to provide a "detention
cell or room" for, and to maintain, "all persons who are detention
prison­ers pending trial of their cases" at Branch II of said court at <span class="SpellE">Ozamiz</span> City.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the same date, March 11, the respondent Judge, in a separate
communication, warned petitioners, that if by Friday, March 18, 1966, the
latter should fail "to establish and maintain a well-secured deten­tion
cell" in <span class="SpellE">Ozamiz</span> City, "the citation for
contempt of court will pro­ceed as scheduled''.</p>

<p class="BODY">In response to this order and <span style="">as a </span>gesture of cooperation with the province of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Occidental, the Municipal Board of <span class="SpellE">Ozamiz</span> City adopted, on March 14, 1966; Resolution No. 159 <span class="SpellE">whereunder</span> the city offered the temporary use by the
province of one cell or room in the city jail, "for provincial detention
prisoners" <span class="SpellE">triable</span> in Branch II afore­said,
"until the province shall have constructed its own jail or extension of
the provincial jail".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The board,
however, made of record its belief that "this duty belongs to the <st1:place><st1:placetype>province</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Occidental</st1:placename></st1:place>
and not to the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Ozamiz</span></st1:place></st1:city>".</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="17" month="3">March 17, 1966</st1:date>,
petitioners filed in Special Case No. 9 their answer to the March 11 contempt
charge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They averred that they have
established and maintained a detention cell as required by law, for all city
prisoners; admitted not having provided a detention cell for those coming from
other towns also within the jurisdiction of Branch II, and claimed that this
duty devolves upon the <span style="">provincial
authorities.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="19" month="3">March 19, 1966</st1:date>
<span style="">petitioners appeared, as scheduled, </span>before
res­pondent Judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The proceedings on
that date terminated without definite results, except that petitioners were
told:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"I may consider this case
closed, but <span style="">officially, I will </span>transfer
this on Saturday.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You may not
come".</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 22, 1966, the Clerk of Court, by direction of respondent
Judge, wrote the City Mayor, one of petitioners, advising the latter that
failure on petitioners' part to "remedy the situation <span style="">obtaining" </span>in the city jail
(which was proposed to house detention provincial prisoners), as reported to
respondent Judge by the provincial warden, "within two days from today,
the contempt charges will continue as scheduled this coming Saturday, March 26,
1966".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mayor received this
letter on <st1:date year="1966" day="23" month="3">March 23, 1966</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The present petition <span style="">was </span>verified
on <st1:date year="1966" day="24" month="3">March 24, 1966</st1:date>, and
filed in this Court on <st1:date year="1966" day="25" month="3">March 25, 1966</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, on <st1:date year="1966" day="24" month="3">March 24,
 1966</st1:date>, the City Mayor sent a rush telegram to the Clerk of Court, as
follows: </p>

<blockquote>"In connection with your letter March twenty-two re
construction of city jail please furnish us written copy of the direction of
Judge <span class="SpellE">Catolico</span>"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">At <st1:time minute="15" hour="15">3:15 p.m.</st1:time> on the
same day, March 24, the Deputy Clerk of Court answered Mayor <span class="SpellE">Bernad</span>, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Retel</span> please be informed that upon
consultation with Judge <span class="SpellE">Catolico</span> comma he told me to
inform your honor that court opinion regarding security detention cell is joint
venture both city and provincial officials stop Court order shall be issued on
Saturday March 26 on warden's report depending provision compliance full
security cell stated in my letter"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="25" month="3">March 25, 1966</st1:date>,
Mayor <span class="SpellE">Bernad</span> wired back:</p>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Reurtel</span> am surprised because Judge <span class="SpellE">Catolico</span> had never informed us of any duty to provide cell
for provincial detention prisoners stop On the contrary in people versus de
Guzman his honor Judge <span class="SpellE">Catolico</span> ren­dered opinion
quote all these are an after effect of the indecision of the provincial board
to build a provincial prison house within the territorial limits of Branch II
comma upon the excuse of lack of funds for the project and for the purpose of
maintenance of detention prisoners period This province should provide for the
maintenance of those prisoners confined in the detention prison at <span class="SpellE">Ozamiz</span> City comma or any other place within the territo­rial
division of the province among the three branches of the court of first
instance unquote Also in open court last Saturday his honor Judge <span class="SpellE">Catolico</span> emphasized that we need not attend in court on
Saturday March 26, 1966 stop"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">At about <st1:time minute="55" hour="17">5:55 p.m.</st1:time> on <st1:date year="1966" day="25" month="3">March 25, 1966</st1:date>, the Deputy Clerk of
Court wired Mayor <span class="SpellE">Bernad</span>, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">ReUrtel</span> upon consultation Judge <span class="SpellE">Catolico</span> <span style="">says </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Ozamiz</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> officials need not come
tomorrow"<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="26" month="3">March 26, 1966</st1:date>,
respondent Judge signed an order starting with -</p>

<blockquote>"When this case was called today, for the continuation of the
hearing hereof (referring to the contempt case) x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">and</span> ending with -</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Done in open court, this 26th day of March,
1966, at <span class="SpellE">Oroquieta</span>, <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span>
Occidental".</span> </blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">But because of the restraining order
issued by this Court, the foregoing order remains <span class="SpellE">unpromulgated</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This order of respondent Judge directed that
petitioners are "hereby ordered dropped from the herein [contempt]
charges" and that this case is "dismissed with regard to
them".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Judge's reason is that,
by the city board's Resolution No. 159 adopted March 14, 1966, petitioners
"have shown their avowed readiness to co­operate in providing a cell for
the detention prisoners of the four munici­palities of the province and the
City of <span class="SpellE">Ozamiz</span> proper, awaiting trial in Branch
II," and that said petitioners have "shown amazing readiness to
cooperate with the officials of the province, thus showing lack of de­sire to
incur official responsibilities amounting to contempt of court."</p>

<p class="NUM"><span style="">1. The core of the case is
this:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is it petitioners' duty to provide
</span>a detention cell for, and maintain, provincial detention prisoners whose
cases are cognizable by Branch II of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Mi­samis</span> Occidental?</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">For, if the answer be in
the affirmative, and upon demand petitioners refused to comply, then they are
indeed guilty of disobedience </span>of a lawful command of a court and deserve
punishment for contempt.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We go to the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Ozamiz</span> city
charter enumerates the gene­ral powers and duties of the mayor, the powers and
duties of the mu­nicipal board.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> <span class="GramE">Nothing in the charter as
much as intimates a duty on the part of </span></span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE"><span style="">Ozamiz</span></span></span></st1:placename><span class="GramE"><span style=""> </span></span><st1:placetype><span class="GramE"><span style="">City</span></span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span class="GramE"><span style=""> to provide for a detention
cell for, or maintain, provincial prisoners.</span></span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Or,
for that matter, those accused of crimes cognizable by Branch II, Court of
First Instance, stationed </span>at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Ozamiz</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Congress has seen fit to authorize the
municipal board of said city, in clear express language, to establish and
maintain <span style="">school, engine houses,
municipal pounds, public markets, and slaughter houses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And yet, such an important function as is to
establish a detention cell for provincial detention prisoners or maintain them
was excluded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A court of justice may not
recast the <span class="SpellE">Ozamiz</span> city charter to include therein a
provision which would place upon the city authorities such an obligation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is a function clearly out­side the
jurisdictional boundaries of courts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Implicit then in the lack of statutory duty, is that petitioners have
none.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That obligation is withheld; it is
not imposed.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Not that the views
expressed herein are without justification.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The <span class="SpellE">Ozamiz</span> city charter commands that all
taxes and revenues of the city be expended upon appropriations "to the
payment of municipal expenses".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
the authority of the city board to appropriate is narrowed down to "the
expenses of the government of the city".</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Upon the other hand, the
Revised Administrative Code makes it a mandatory duty of provinces to maintain
at their own expense jails at their respective capitals for provincial
prisoners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And persons detained pending
preliminary investigation or pending trial before the Court of First Instance
and persons sentenced to imprisonment of not more than one year or a fine of
not more than P500.00, or both, come within the category of provincial
prisoners.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">But if more were needed,
there is the marked delineation of responsibility in reference to the expenses
for the maintenance of prison­ers:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
municipal prisoner, by the city or municipality in which the offense with which
he is charged or of which he stands convicted was committed; the province, in
the case of a provincial prisoner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
this, not to speak of national prisoners whose maintenance is the con­cern of
the Bureau of Prisons.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Finally, the Revised
Administrative Code enjoins that, except as allowed by law, municipal funds <span class="GramE">be</span> devoted "exclusively to local public purposes".</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">2. With the foregoing legal precepts as guidelines, we come to the
conclusion that where no legal duty is imposed, no legal obligation
exists.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is then no legal
justification for the March 11 order de­manding that petitioners comply with
the non-existing obligation to provide a detention cell or room for, and to
maintain, provincial de­tention prisoners.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And, in requiring petitioners so to do on pain of contempt of court,
respondent Judge acted without jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Cer­tiorari will lie.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
And, prohibition will follow as a matter of course.</p>

<p class="NUM">3. We now take stock of the <span class="SpellE">unpromulgated</span>
order of <st1:date year="1966" day="26" month="3">March 26, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Standing in bold relief is the fact that
respondent Judge therein directed that petitioners be dropped from contempt
charges and that the contempt case as to them <span class="GramE">be</span>
dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This, in effect, writes <u>finis</u>
to the certiorari and prohibition proceedings before this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b style="">Accordingly</b><span style="">, with the declaration that respondent's
order of </span><st1:date year="1966" day="11" month="3"><span style="">March 11, 1966</span></st1:date><span style="">, insofar as it affects petitioners, is
hereby de­clared null and void, the petition herein is hereby dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
