<p class="BODY"><span style="">The alleged offending
news item was a reproduction of a news item coming from the Philippine News

were the Publisher and Assistant Publisher and <span class="SpellE">Prudencio</span>
R. <span class="SpellE">Europa</span> was the Editor-in-Chief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It reads thus: "Jaime Jose implicated Tuesday
Vincent <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span>, son of Rep. <span class="SpellE">Floro</span>
<span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span> (N, <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>) as among his four companions the night of the alleged
rape of a former nightclub hostess last year.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Jose, one of four principal accused in the celebrated Maggie de la Riva
rape case, denied, however, the charges of forcible abduction with rape and
robbery filed against ham and his companions </span>by <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span>
de <span style="">la </span>Cruz, 28, and <span class="SpellE">Araceli</span> <span class="SpellE">Sy</span>, both nightclub

defense before Judge Francisco de la Rosa of the local court of first

of <st1:date year="1966" day="4" month="7">July 4, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jose said <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span> went to a room together.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, Jose said, the two girls complained

This was the continuation of such news item: "The girls charged that they
were robbed by Jose and his friends of cash and jewelry inside the hotel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In their original complaint filed with the <span class="SpellE">fiscal's</span> office, the two girls named Vincent <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span> as among the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The taxi driver, whose vehicle was used by
Miss de la Cruz, also identified Vincent <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span>
among the five youths in the incident.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But the girls later executed an affidavit saying that they were mistaken
in identifying <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span> as among the five men who
allegedly abused them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jose testified
that he and Tillman were about to go to a party in <span class="SpellE">Mandaluyong</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, on the night of <st1:date year="1966" day="3" month="7">July 3, 1966</st1:date>, when <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span>

his car would be used by his congressman father.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jose said that after the party they proceeded

The alleged offended party, according to the information filed by respondent
Provincial Fiscal, Jesus F. Guerrero, is Vincent <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The information is dated <st1:date year="1970" day="5" month="2">February 5, 1970</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, there was a motion to quash filed by petitioners on <st1:date year="1970" day="14" month="8">August 14, 1970</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An opposition was then filed by an assistant
provincial fiscal on <st1:date year="1970" day="25" month="9">September 25,
 1970</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The order by
respondent Judge denying the motion to quash came on <st1:date year="1970" day="17" month="12">December 17, 1970</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An extensive motion for reconsideration
submitted on <st1:date year="1971" day="23" month="2">February 23, 1971</st1:date>
having proved futile in view of an order of denial a month later from
respondent Judge, this petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition was filed
with this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As noted at the outset, <i>certiorari</i>
and prohibition lie.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">1. Petitioners were prosecuted for libel because the Evening News
carried in its issue of <st1:date year="1967" day="1" month="9">September 1,
 1967</st1:date> a news item furnished it by the Philippine News Service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a faithful and accurate summary of
what was testified to by a witness in a pending rape case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was all.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The name of the alleged offended party, Vincent <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span>,
was repeatedly mentioned in such testimony.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It would have been a plain and simple distortion thereof if such a fact
were omitted by the Philippine News Service.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Evening News in turn published such item.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is a case therefore that falls squarely
within the protection of the free press provision found in the
Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That such news item
possessed a defamatory aspect is beside the point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot justify a prosecution for
libel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even prior to the 1935
Constitution, under the previous organic act, the Philippine Autonomy Act of
1916, which contained a similar provision mandating a free press, this Court,
in the epochal Malcolm opinion in United States v. <span class="SpellE">Bustos</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
decided almost sixty years ago, to be precise on March 8, 1918, enunciated the
principle that the freedom of the press is "so sacred to the people of
these Islands and won at so dear a cost, [that it] should now be protected and
carried forward as one would protect and preserve the covenant of liberty itself."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus it is clear that a prosecution for libel lacks justification if the
offending words find sanctuary within the shelter of the free press
guarantee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court has since then
been committed to such an authoritative doctrine.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
The opinion of Chief Justice <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> in <span class="SpellE">Quisumbing</span> v. Lopez,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
a 1955 decision, is even more explicit on the matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus: "The newspapers should be given
such leeway and tolerance as to enable them to courageously and effectively
perform their important role in our democracy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the preparation of stories, press reporters and edition usually have
to race with their deadlines; and consistently with good faith and reasonable
care, they should not be held to account, to a point of suppression, for honest
mistakes or imperfection in the choice of words."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
At the beginning of this decade, this Court in Lopez v. Court of Appeals<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
expressed its commitment to such a principle in these words: "No inroads
on press freedom should be allowed in the guise of punitive action visited on
what otherwise could be characterized as libel whether in the form of printed
words or a defamatory imputation resulting from the publication of respondent's
picture with the offensive caption as in the case here complained of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * * If the cases mean anything at all then,
to emphasize what has so clearly emerged, they call for the utmost care on the
part of the judiciary to assure that in safeguarding the interest of the party
allegedly offended, a realistic account of the obligation of a news media to
disseminate information of a public character and to comment thereon as well as
the conditions attendant on the business of publishing cannot be ignored."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">2. To be more specific, no culpability could be imputed to
petitioners for the alleged offending publication without doing violence to the
concept of privileged comÂ­munication implicit in freedom of the press.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As was so well put by Justice Malcolm in <span class="SpellE">Bustos</span>: "Public policy, the welfare of society, and
the orderly administration of government have demanded protection for public
opinion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The inevitable and
incontestable result has been the development and adoption of the doctrine of
privilege."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
He then quoted this excerpt from an American Supreme Court decision, Abbott v.
National Bank of Commerce: "The doctrine of privileged communication rests
upon public policy, 'which looks to the free and unfettered administration of
justice, though as incidental result, it may in some instances afford an immunity
to the evil-disposed and malignant slanderer."<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
Considering how ample is the protection afforded a person alleged to have
injured another's reputation, it appears quite obvious that respondent Judge
did infringe on the constitutional right of petitioners to press freedom when
it denied the motion to quash.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
apparently was equally unaware of this relevant paragraph in the Malcolm
opinion: "A privileged communiÂ­cation should not be subjected to
microscopic examination to discover grounds of malice or falsity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such excessive scrutiny would defeat the
protection which the law throws over privileged communications.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ultimate test is that of <u>bona</u> <u>fides</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
By no stretch of the imagination then could it be said that the Philippine News
Service and the Evening News exhibited <span class="SpellE"><u>mala</u></span> <u>fides</u>
by the mere fact of narrating in a news item the testimony of a witness in a
rape case just because it did cast a reflection on the conduct of a third
party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The prosecution in its pleadings
before the lower court could not deny the accuracy of what was reported.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners then ought not to have been
subjected to the annoyance, inconvenience, and trouble of going to a distant
province and defend themselves against a charge unwarranted under well-settled
norms of constitutional dimension.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
doctrine of privileged communication moreover is explicitly provided for in the
Revised Penal Code, as an exception to the general principle that every
defamatory imputation is presumed to be malicious, even if it is true in the
absence of "good intention" and "justifiable motive" thus:
"A fair and true report, made in good faith, without any comments or
remarks, of any judicial, legislative, or other official proceedings which are
not of confidential nature, or of any statement, report, or speech delivered in
said proceedings, or of any other act performed by public officers in the
exercise of their functions."<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">3. There being a denial of a constitutional right, a
jurisdictional issue was raised.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has
been a well-settled doctrine since <span class="SpellE">Conde</span> v. Rivera,<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
that under such circumstances, the competence of a court to continue with a
pending case ceases.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>Nor is it to indulge merely in general
propositions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In People v. Andres,<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court precisely sustained a court of first instance when it quashed an
information for libel, the accused, respondent Andres, relying on press freedom
to show that the facts charged do not constitute an offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As pointed out in the opinion of Justice
Barrera, it was argued by the prosecution "that the trial court erred in
dismissing the case on a mere motion to quash, contending that the trial
judge's conclusion on the face of the information that defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> was prompted only by good motives assumes a fact
to be proved, and that the alleged privileged nature of defendantÂ­-<span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> publication is a matter of defense and is not a
proper ground for dismissal of the complaint for libel * * *."<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
That contention was rejected in this wise: "While there is some point to
this contention, yet when in the information itself it appears, as it does in
the present case, that the communication alleged to be libelous is contained in
an appropriate pleading in a court proceeding, the privilege becomes at once
apparent and defendant need not wait until the trial and produce evidence
before he can raise the question of privilege.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And if added to this, the questioned imputations appear, as they seem in
this case, to be really pertinent and relevant to defendant's plea for
reconsideration based on complainant's supposed partiality and abuse of power
from which defendant has a right to seek relief in vindication of his client's
interest as a litigant in complainant's court, it would become evident that the
facts thus alleged in the information would not constitute an offense of libel."<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>Similarly, a motion to quash was
sustained in the later case of People v. Alvarez.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
In the opinion of Justice <span class="SpellE">Regala</span>, it was pointed out:
"As heretofore stated, this Court has adopted a liberal attitude in favor
of the writer in matter of the relevancy of allegedly libelous statements in
judicial pleadings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
v. <span class="SpellE">Bustos</span>, et al., 37 Phil. 731, this Court found
occasion to express its opinion on privileged communications, to wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>â* * * A privileged communication should not
be subjected to <span class="SpellE">miscroscopic</span> examination to discover
grounds of malice or falsity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
excessive scrutiny would defeat the protection which the law throws over
privileged communication.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">* * *â<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
is worthy to mention here that in the information for libel, there is no allegation
of the irrelevancy or impertinency of the questioned statements to the
cause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering the above, We are of
the opinion and so hold that no error was committed by the lower court in
considering the questioned remarks of the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> as
privileged and in consequently dismissing the information for lack of cause of action."<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
In a third case, People v. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
reference was made to People v. Andres to demonstrate that it is fitting and appropriate
for a court of first instance to dismiss an information on a motion to quash
where the privileged character of the alleged offending publication is
apparent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Judge ought not to
have betrayed lack of sensitivity to the categorical pronouncements of this
Court in the above three decisions that call for application.</p>

<p class="BODY">4. Nor is a different conclusion called for just because the
heading of the news item arising from the testimony of Jaime Jose was worded
thus: "LINK <span class="SpellE">CRISOLOGO</span> SON TO <span class="SpellE">PASAY</span>
RAPE CASE." How else could it have been expressed?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was to portray with accuracy what was
contained in the news item.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What was
testified to was to that effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
succinctly set forth the facts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
was no attempt to sensationalize.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
tone is both neutral and objective.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Again there is relevance to the following excerpt from <span class="SpellE">Quisumbing</span> v. Lopez: "The Court of Appeals found 'that
the context of the article in question, is a fair, impartial and true report of
official or public proceeding authorized by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The news item was the result of a press
release in connection with an official investigation of the Anti-Usury
Division, N. B. I., and was a substantial, if not a faithful reproduction of
the said press release which was, in turn, an accurate report of the official
proceedings taken by the Anti-Usury Division.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The article merely reported a raid on the 'business offices of three
alleged money lenders;' and related the steps actually taken or to be taken by
the proper officials relative to the investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It did not go beyond the actual report of
official actuations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The theory of the
petitioner, stripped of incidentals, is that while the body of the news item
may be considered as being fair, impartial and accurate report of an official
investigation of the Anti-Usury Division of the National Bureau of
Investigation and therefore privileged, its headline <span class="SpellE">NBI</span>
MEN RAID OFFICES OF 3 CITY USURERS,' admittedly not forming part of the basic
press release but merely added by the respondents, is libelous <u>per</u> <u>se</u>,
because the petitioner had thereby been branded and condemned as a 'usurer'
when as a matter of fact no criminal charge was even filed against him for the
crime of usury in any court of justice."<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
Nonetheless, the newspaper publisher was not held liable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Chief Justice then explained why:
"We are of the opinion that the appealed decision is correct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner, while assuming that the
article in question is privileged, argues that the headline (libelous <u>per</u>
<u>se</u>) added by the respondents rendered the same actionable, because said
headline is not borne out by the facts recited in the context.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We believe that nobody reading the whole news
item would come to the conclusion that the petitioner had been accused or
convicted of usury.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We agree with the
Court of Appeals that the headline complained of may fairly be said to contain
a correct description of the news story.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The fact that the raid was conducted by anti-usury agents following
receipt of a complaint against the petitioner and two others, coupled with the
announcement by the Chief of the <span class="SpellE">NBI</span> Anti-Usury
