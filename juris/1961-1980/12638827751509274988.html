				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The Court of First Instance of Manila in Civil Case No. 62976
found that a cargo of nylon and cotton piece goods was damaged before it was
discharged from the vessel <span class="SpellE"><u>Tagaytay</u></span> in the <st1:place><st1:placetype>port</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Manila</st1:placename></st1:place> in February, 1965.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The damage amounted to $18.50 (equivalent to
fifty pesos).</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court ordered defendants Barber Steamship Lines and <span class="SpellE">Macondray</span> &amp; Co., Inc., as agents of the carrying
vessel, to pay fifty pesos to plaintiff Travelers Indemnity Company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That entity had insured the cargo against all
risks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It had paid to the consignee,
Royal Undergarment Corporation of the Philippines, Inc., the sum of $807.68,
which was the amount of the loss and damage claimed by the said consignee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The insurance company was subrogated to the
consignee's right to claim the damage (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. H).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The lower court also
found that the Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> Service failed to
deliver to the consignee a part of the said cargo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The value of the missing cargo was $56.23.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">But the lower court did
not order </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span style="">defendants</span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">Republic</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style=""> of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> and Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span>
Service to pay the Travelers Indemnity Company the sum of $56.23.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court sustained the government's
contention that the State is exempt from suit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The court further observed that the Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span>
Service, an agency of the Bureau of Customs in the </span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span style="">port</span></st1:placetype><span style=""> of </span><st1:placename><span style="">Manila</span></st1:placename></st1:place><span style="">, is not a juridical person and that any suit
against it is a suit against the State.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Travelers Indemnity
Company appealed from the lower court's decision to this Court "insofar
only as it dismisses the case against </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span style="">defendants</span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">Republic</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style=""> of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> and Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span>
Service".<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Appellant Travelers
Indemnity Company did not confine its brief to that legal issue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It insisted that the consignee had suffered a
loss in the sum of $807.68 and that the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
operator should pay the sum of $789.18 which is the difference between $807.68
and the sum of $18.50 that was adjudged against the agents of the carrying
vessel.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We hold that appellant
insurance company is precluded from <span class="GramE">raising</span> in its
third assignment of error the factual issue of whether the liability of the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operator for the missing cargo is $789.18 and not
$56.23, as found by the trial court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Appellant company is
bound by the fact found by the trial court that the loss occasioned by the shortage
or <span class="SpellE">nondelivery</span> amounts only to $56.23 (Sec. 2, Rule
42, Rules of Court; Millar vs. <span class="SpellE">Nadres</span>, 74 Phil. 307).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As to the question </span>of
the suability <span style="">of the State (the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operator), which is the legal issue raised in
appellant's first and second assignments of error, the trial court did not err
in dismissing the company's action for the recovery of loss or damage amounting
to $789.18.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is settled that the
Bureau of Customs, acting as part of the machinery of the national government
in the operation of the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> service, is immune
from suit under the doctrine of <span class="SpellE">nonsuability</span> of the
State.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The claimant's remedy to recover
the loss or damage to the goods under the custody of the customs <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> service is to file a claim with the Commission on
Audit as contemplated in Act No. 3083 and Commonwealth Act No. 327 (<span class="SpellE">Gloren</span>, Inc. vs. Republic, L-26811, July 31, 1970, 34 SCRA
26 and cases cited in Vol. 1, SCRA Quick Index Digest, pp/ 165-7).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">, the trial court's judgment is
affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
