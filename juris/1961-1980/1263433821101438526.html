				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for <i>certiorari</i> filed by Bruno <span class="SpellE">Pacoli</span> as grandfather of the minor children of deceased <span class="SpellE">Aurea</span> <span class="SpellE">Pacoli</span> <span class="SpellE">Caguring</span>,
for review of the decision of the Workmen's Compensation Commission in
R09-WC-Case No. 13924, reversing the outright award of WCC Regional Office No.
9.</p>

<p class="BODY">The deceased <span class="SpellE">Aurea</span> <span class="SpellE">Pacoli</span>
<span class="SpellE">Caguring</span> had her first assignment as public school
teacher at Barrio <span class="SpellE">Mancares</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarangnan</span>,
<st1:place>School District</st1:place>, <span class="SpellE">Tarangnan</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place>, on <st1:date year="1962" day="27" month="8">August 27, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>From <span class="SpellE">Catbalogan</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place>, where the deceased was residing, to her
station at Barrio <span class="SpellE">Mancares</span>, she had to negotiate the
distance by small motorized <span class="SpellE">bancas</span>, for no land
transportation plies between these two places.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime on <st1:date year="1969" day="5" month="6">June 5, 1969</st1:date>,
when the deceased was <span class="SpellE">travelling</span> from <span class="SpellE">Catbalogan</span> to her station at Barrio <span class="SpellE">Mancares</span>,
the motor <span class="SpellE">banca</span> she was riding capsized because of
big waves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From that tragedy the
deceased developed a phobia -- fear of sea travel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From then on, she was compelled to hike on
foot from <span class="SpellE">Catbalogan</span> to Barrio <span class="SpellE">Mancares</span>,
a distance of 18 mountainous kilometers every weekend.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These long hikes sapped her strength little
by little.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At her request, she was
transferred on <st1:date year="1971" day="1" month="7">July 1, 1971</st1:date>
from her station at Barrio <span class="SpellE">Mancares</span> to Barrio <span class="SpellE">Bahay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarangnan</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Samar</span></span></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">While teaching in her new station at Barrio <span class="SpellE">Bahay</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Tarangnan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>, the
deceased had to go home to <span class="SpellE">Catbalogan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Samar</span> every Friday and return the following Monday.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a result of such strenuous travels from <span class="SpellE">Catbalogan</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place>
to her station, she became thinner and thinner <span class="GramE">everyday</span>
until she finally succumbed to pulmonary tuberculosis on <st1:date year="1974" day="23" month="5">May 23, 1974</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1974" day="16" month="8">August 16, 1974</st1:date>
the claimant filed his claim for compensation in behalf of the minor children
of the late <span class="SpellE">Aurea</span> <span class="SpellE">Pacoli</span> <span class="SpellE">Caguring</span> with Unit of Regional Office No. 9 Workmen's
Compensation Office, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span></st1:placename>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1974" day="19" month="10">October 19, 1974</st1:date>,
the claim was heard at the Office of the Bureau of Labor, <span class="SpellE">Catbalogan</span>,
<st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Samar</span></span></st1:place>
where the Assistant Provincial Fiscal of <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place>,
<span class="SpellE">Justo</span> M. Sultan appeared in behalf of the Solicitor
General.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1975" day="7" month="8">August 7, 1975</st1:date> an award was issued in favor of the
claimant ordering respondent Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
to pay:</p>

<blockquote>(1)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>P5<span class="GramE">,400.00</span> as
compensation;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>P260.00 as attorney's fee, pursuant to
Section 31 of the Act; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>(3)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>P53.00 as fee pursuant to the provisions of
Section 55 of the Act.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon motion for reconsideration filed by respondent the Workmen's
Compensation Commission <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> rendered the following decision:</p>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1975" day="7" month="8">August 7, 1975</st1:date>
an award was issued by Acting Referee ALFONSO E. PAA of Regional Office No. 9, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
granting claimants death compensation benefits in the amount of P5<span class="GramE">,200.00</span> for the death of <span class="SpellE">Aureau</span> <span class="SpellE">Caguring</span>, who, during her lifetime was employed with the
Bureau of Public Schools and assigned in the Division of <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Assailing the award, respondent filed its Motion to Set Aside
the same and contended that the Regional Office did not acquire jurisdiction
over the respondent for the reason that the Office of the Solicitor General was
not furnished with a copy of the Notice and Claim for Compensation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent further contended that the Hearing
Officer of the Regional Office committed fatal procedural error in issuing the
present Award without first serving the Office of the Solicitor General with a
copy of the Notice and Claim for Compensation in this case (Celia <span class="SpellE">Ligan</span> vs. Republic, RO-X, WCC, Case No. 10823, <span style="">April </span>4, 1973).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence, this review.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"An examination of the records shows that claimant filed this
claim with the Unit of Regional Office No. 9, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
on <st1:date year="1974" day="16" month="8">August 16, 1974</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1974" day="30" month="8">August
 30, 1974</st1:date>, a letter of transmittal with the Notice and Claim for
Compensation was prepared addressed to the Office of the Solicitor
General.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No copy was transmitted to the
Bureau of Public Schools.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clear from the
records, there is no proof that the Office of the Solicitor General ever
received the copy of the Notice and Claim.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Despite lack of proper <span class="SpellE">joinder</span> of issues, the
Acting Chief of Unit set the case for hearing on <st1:date year="1974" day="19" month="10">October 19, 1974</st1:date>, at the <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>
Labor Office, <span class="SpellE">Catbalogan</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Samar</span></span></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently, notices of hearing were sent to
the Office of the Solicitor General and the Division Superintendent of
Schools.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Similarly, there is no proof of
service that respondent has been sufficiently notified of such hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, the referee proceeded with the
reception of evidence for the claimant ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> and
issued an Award.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Award was
prematurely issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Failure, therefore,
of the Regional Office to transmit copy of the Notice and Claim for
Compensation to the Office of the Solicitor General has not vested the Hearing
Unit with jurisdiction over this case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was, therefore, no justification for the hearing officer in
conducting an ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> reception of claimant's
evidence, without first assuring himself that a copy of the Notice and Claim
for Compensation was transmitted and received by the Office of the Solicitor
General and that subsequent notices of hearing have been received by the
respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Obviously, the Hearing
Officer proceeded with the ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> reception of
claimant's evidence in violation of procedural process and devoid of
jurisdiction.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We find merit in the respondent's Motion to Set Aside the
Award and that the Hearing Officer committed error in issuing the Award despite
lack of jurisdiction.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the light of all the foregoing, the Award appealed from is
hereby set aside and this case is hereby ordered dismissed" (pp. 7-8, WCC
rec.).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><span style="">Hence,
this petition.</span></span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">WE rule that respondent
Commission acted arbitrarily and unreasonably in setting aside the </span><st1:date year="1975" day="7" month="8"><span style="">August 7,
 1975</span></st1:date><span style=""> Award of the
Hearing Officer, which <span class="GramE">We</span> find in order as it is
supported by law and the controlling jurisprudence on work compensation cases.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM"><b><span style="">I.</span></b> <span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be underscored that, as found by the
Hearing Officer, the claimant's right to compensation was not <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> by the respondent employer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And as a matter of fact, until this very late
stage, respondent employer has not complied with its mandatory duty under
Sections 37 and 45 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, as amended, of filing
with the Workmen's Compensation Commission a report or notice of the death of
its employee (<span class="SpellE">Aurea</span> <span class="SpellE">Pacoli</span> <span class="SpellE">Caguring</span>) and of <span class="SpellE">controverting</span>
the right to compensation either on or before the fourteenth day of disability
or within ten days after it had knowledge of the death.</p>

<p class="BODY">The aforesaid duty of <span class="SpellE">controverting</span> the
right to compensation, it must be stressed, lies on the employer or the Heads
of the Departments, Bureaus or Offices concerned (Memo-Circular No. 210, Office
of the President [1968]; <span class="SpellE">Lizardo</span> vs. WCC, L-42995,
March 14, 1979; Francisco vs. WCC, 83 SCRA 536 [1978]); not on their counsel (<span class="SpellE">Lizardo</span> vs. WCC, <u>supra</u>; Francisco vs. WCC, <u>supra</u>;
and Republic vs. WCC, 45 SCRA 60[1972]).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, such duty arises immediately upon <u>actual</u> knowledge
of the illness or death of the employee by the employer or its agents (Republic
vs. WCC, 37 SCRA 619, 620, 624 [1971]), not from its counsel's knowledge or
notice, even without any formal notice given by the claimant to the employer
under Section 24 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, as amended; because Section
27 of the same Act dispenses with such formal notice where the employer, like
herein respondent employer, had <u>actual</u> knowledge of the death or illness
basis of the compensation claim (<span class="SpellE">Gallemit</span> vs.
Republic, 75 SCRA 382, 383, 385, 386 [1977]; <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>
Trans. Co., Inc. vs. WCC, 8 SCRA 352, 355 [1963]; and Luzon Stevedoring Co. vs.
de Leon, 106 Phil. 562, 565, 566 [1959]).</p>

<p class="BODY">That respondent employer through its agents -- principal,
supervisor and superintendent -- had actual knowledge of the death of <span class="SpellE">Aurea</span> <span class="SpellE">Pacoli</span> <span class="SpellE">Caguring</span>
is manifested by its undisputed act of hiring a substitute teacher to take her
place for the school year 1974-75 (p. 34, rec.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the allegation of petitioner that
the fact of death of <span class="SpellE">Aurea</span> <span class="SpellE">Pacoli</span>
<span class="SpellE">Caguring</span> was immediately relayed to her immediate
superiors in the office of the Division Superintendent of Schools, at <span class="SpellE">Catbalogan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Samar</span> (pp. 34, 60,
rec.) was never disputed by respondent employer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>,
that knowledge was sufficient to charge respondent employer with its duty under
Sections 37 and 45 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, as amended; failure of
which results in the renunciation of its right to controvert the claim; as a
consequence of which all its defenses are deemed barred and the compensability
of the claim considered admitted by the employer.</p>

<p class="NUM"><b><span style="">II. </span></b>Consequently,
the defense of the respondent employer that no <u>copy of the claim for
compensation</u> was ever furnished to the Solicitor General was barred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the respondent Commission was in clear
error in entertaining and sustaining that defense.</p>

<p class="NUM"><b><span style="">III.<span style=""> </span></span></b>Even on the merits of that defense,
respondent employer's position, as sustained by the respondent Commission,
cannot be maintained.</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both the Solicitor
General and the respondent employer submitted to the jurisdiction of the
Regional Office when they appeared at the initial hearing of the death
compensation claim on October 19, 1974 before the Hearing Officer, with the
Solicitor General represented by Assistant Provincial Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Justo</span> M. Sultan of <span class="SpellE">Samar</span> (pp.
21-22, WCC rec.; pp. 33, 34, 45, 61, 75-76, <span class="SpellE">rollo</span>)
and respondent employer, by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Hilario</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Carpina</span>, District Supervisor of <span class="SpellE">Catbalogan</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Samar</span> (<u>ibid</u>); and neither of them raised the
issue of non-service of a <u>copy of the claim for compensation</u> to their
respective offices.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Verily, that
omission then to raise or plead the issue (at that earliest opportunity)
amounts to a waiver thereof; and consequently, the same can no longer be
successfully invoked at any subsequent stage of the proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the respondent Commission, in the
exercise of its power to review the Award of the Hearing Officer of the
Regional Office, gravely abused its discretion when it still entertained and
favorably considered the said issue.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Parenthetically, the aforesaid appearances negate, as the same is
inconsistent with, the finding of the respondent Commission in its questioned
order that the respondent employer and the Solicitor General were not served
copies of the <u>notice of hearing</u> and its characterization of the hearing
of <st1:date year="1974" day="19" month="10">October 19, 1974</st1:date> as <u>ex</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In his memorandum, the Solicitor General admitted receipt of the notice
of hearing (pp. 75-76, <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">rollo</span></u></span><span style="">) and
that he authorized the <span class="SpellE">abovenamed</span> Fiscal to appear at
that hearing by reason thereof (<u>ibid</u>).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">As a matter of fact, a stipulation of facts --?
1.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Employer-Employee
relationship admitted; 2.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Filing
within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period admitted --- was made
by the parties in that </span><st1:date year="1974" day="19" month="10"><span style="">October 19, 1974</span></st1:date><span style=""> hearing (see pp. 21-22, WCC rec.); and
petitioner there</span>after testified thereat and was cross-examined (<u>ibid</u>.)</p>

<p class="NUM"><span style="">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that <u>no copy of the compensation claim</u> was
furnished to and received by the Solicitor General and the respondent employer
before the initial hearing as required by GAO Circular No. 68, dated October 6,
1959, may not be taken against petitioner </span>because the duty of
transmitting <span style="">a </span>copy of the claim
to them devolves not on the petitioner, but on the Workmen's Compensation Unit
or Agency pursuant to Section 1 of Rule 8 of the 1973 Workmen's Compensation
Rules and the Workmen's Compensation Circular (10), Series of 1973.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>WE have ruled that such failure will not
render the decision of the Regional Office Hearing Officer invalid for want of
jurisdiction (<span class="SpellE">Pantoja</span> vs. WCC, L-43317, December 28,
1978; <span class="SpellE">Paraiso</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Castelo</span>-Sotto,
85 SCRA 419 [1978]; Francisco vs. WCC, 83 SCRA 536, 539 [1978]; <span class="SpellE">Solite</span> vs. WCC, 75 SCRA 388 [1977]; <span class="SpellE">Gallemit</span>
vs. WCC, 75 SCRA 382 [1977]; and <span class="SpellE">Dinaro</span> vs. WCC, 70
SCRA 292 [1976]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, that
omission cannot be the instrument of injustice against the petitioner (<span class="SpellE">Dinaro</span> vs. WCC, <u>supra</u>, pp. 292-293, 296), who
undoubtedly has no control over said agency or unit (<span class="SpellE">Pantoja</span>
vs. WCC, <u>supra</u>; <span class="SpellE">Paraiso</span> <span style="">vs. </span><span class="SpellE">Castelo</span>-Sotto,
<u>supra</u>); nor override the statutory sanction for non-<span class="SpellE">controversion</span>,
which has been consistently applied by Our doctrinal jurisprudence (<span class="SpellE">Dinaro</span> vs. WCC, <u>supra</u>).</p>

<p class="NUM"><b><span style="">IV.</span></b> Finally,
the records support petitioner's claim for compensation.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to claimant (1st par., p. 26, rec.), due to the
strenuous travels from <span class="SpellE">Catbalogan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>, to the teaching station of <span class="SpellE">Aurea</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pacoli</span> <span class="SpellE">Caguring</span>, the latter
became thinner and thinner everyday until she finally succumbed to pulmonary
tuberculosis despite her taking of all prescribed medical treatment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The physician's Report of Sickness issued by Modesto <span class="SpellE">Villareal</span>, Jr., attending physician, of <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Cat</span><span style="">balogan</span></span><span style="">, </span><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Samar</span></span></st1:place><span style="">, shows that the illness of the late</span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Aurea</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Caguring</span> started as of December, 1972.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She </span>complained of dizziness
accompanied by occasional nausea and <span class="SpellE">vomitting</span>,
general body weakness and malaise.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Although treated by injections and tablets, her condition showed no
improvement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One year after, she
complained of difficulty of urination.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Sometimes she had occasional chills and fever, posterior lumbar pains
radiating to the lower extremity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
shows that the deceased suffered a long lingering illness before she died.</p>

<p class="BODY">With such condition of health of <span class="SpellE">Aurea</span> <span class="SpellE">Caguring</span> as of <span style="">1972,
</span>her continuous reporting for duty as a classroom teacher hiking 18
mountainous kilometers more or less every weekend from her residence to her
teaching <span class="GramE">station,</span> would certainly be very taxing for
her body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a result, she became
thinner and thinner until she died on <st1:date year="1974" day="23" month="5">May
 <span style="">23, 1974</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In their memorandum, the Solicitor General claims that the
deceased did not die of tuberculosis but of septicemia or blood poisoning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The death certi­ficate of <span class="SpellE">Aurea</span>
<span class="SpellE">Caguring</span> shows that the cause of her death is
septicemia.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact remains that when
she entered the service in <span style="">1962, </span>ten
years before she complained of her first sickness, she was in good health.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a line of cases, this Court has consistently ruled that once
the illness supervened in the course of employment, a <span class="SpellE">rebuttable</span>
presumption arises that such illness arose out of or was at least aggravated by
such employment and that the burden to overthrow such presumption shifts to the
employer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This the employer did not do,
even in this late stage of the proceedings.</p>
