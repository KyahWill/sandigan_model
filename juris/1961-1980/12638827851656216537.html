				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">What is being assailed in these special civil actions of <i>certiorari</i>,
prohibition and <i>mandamus</i> is the actuation of Presidential Assistant <span class="SpellE">Ronaldo</span> B. Zamora in entertaining a motion for the
reconsideration of the decision of Presidential Executive Assistant <span class="SpellE">Jacobo</span> C. Clave in an appealed labor case and staying the
execution thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The antecedents are
as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1974" day="18" month="6">June 18, 1974</st1:date>
the National Mines and Allied Workers' <st1:place>Union</st1:place> and one
hundred eighty-three employees filed with the old National Labor Relations
Commission (NLRC) a complaint against C. Q. Johnson Enterprises, Inc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They charged that company with unfair labor
practice and illegal dismissal of the 183 complainants without prior clearance
from the Secretary of Labor as required in Presidential Decree No. 21.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was alleged in that complaint that on June 14, 1974, or after
the 183 employees had affiliated with the union and the union in its letter of
June 10, 1974 had proposed a collective bargaining agreement, C. Q. Johnson
Enterprises, a company manufacturing embroidery garments, laid them off on the
pretext of retrenchment but the real reason was to harass them because of their
union activities.</p>

<p class="BODY">After hearing, Diego P. <span class="SpellE">Atienza</span> and
Ricardo C. Castro, as acting chairman and member, respectively, of the old
NLRC, issued on <st1:date year="1974" day="4" month="9">September 4, 1974</st1:date>
a brief order for reinstatement with <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>, which
reads:</p>

<blockquote>“Due to a violation of Presidential Decree No. 21 and its
implementing Rules and Regulations committed by the respondent when it laid off
the complainants within ten (10) days after the filing of the application to
dismiss, respondent is hereby ordered to reinstate the complainants with full <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> from the date of their respective dismissals to
the date of their actual reinstatement."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The company appealed to the Secretary of Labor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On motion of the union and the 183
complainants and over the company's opposition, the Secretary of Labor
dismissed the appeal for being <u>pro</u> <u>forma</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He affirmed the <span class="SpellE">NLRC's</span>
order for reinstatement with <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The company filed a motion for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Secretary of Labor denied it in his
resolution of <st1:date year="1975" day="14" month="2">February 14, 1975</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The company appealed to the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The union and the 183 complainants filed
motions to dismiss the appeal and for execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The company opposed the motion for execution.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1976" day="12" month="1">January 12, 1976</st1:date>
Presidential Executive Assistant <span class="SpellE">Jacobo</span> C. Clave, by
authority of the President, rendered a decision affirming the resolution of the
Secretary of Labor which dismissed the company's appeal for being <u>pro</u> <u>forma</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appeal was <u>pro</u> <u>forma</u>
because the company merely stated in its appeal that the <span class="SpellE">NLRC's</span>
order was contrary to law and the evidence and did not specify what conclusions
in the order were not supported by the evidence or were contrary to law.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Presidential Executive Assistant added that he examined the
substantive aspects of the case and he was satisfied that the order of
reinstatement was "morally just".</p>

<p class="BODY">The company received a copy of that decision on <st1:date year="1976" day="20" month="1">January 20, 1976</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ten days later, or on <st1:date year="1976" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1976</st1:date>, it filed a motion for
reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that motion, C. Q.
Johnson Enterprises stressed that it was a distressed company as shown by the
fact that on <st1:date year="1976" day="6" month="1">January 6, 1976</st1:date>
the Secretary of Labor approved its application for exemption from the
obligation to grant emergency allowances to its workers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <st1:place>Union</st1:place> and the 183
complainants filed a motion to strike out the motion for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, the record of the case was remanded to the new
NLRC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An examiner found that the 183
complainants were entitled to <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> in the
aggregate sum of P538<span class="GramE">,060.50</span> for the period from <st1:date year="1974" day="23" month="12">December 23, 1974</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1976" day="29" month="2">February 29, 1976</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The labor arbiter on <st1:date year="1976" day="24" month="3">March 24, 1976</st1:date> ordered the company to deposit
that amount with the NLRC within ten days from notice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The company appealed that order of the NLRC.</p>

<p class="BODY">The NLRC in its resolution of <st1:date year="1976" day="10" month="5">May 10, 1976</st1:date> directed the labor arbiter to afford the
company a chance to prove the amounts deductible from the <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The labor arbiter in his order of <st1:date year="1976" day="26" month="7">July 26, 1976</st1:date> approved the revised examiner's report,
granting <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> only to 121 claimants and reducing
the total amount thereof to P359<span class="GramE">,128</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The claimants asked the NLRC to issue a writ
of execution for that amount.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, on that same date, <st1:date year="1976" day="26" month="7">July 26, 1976</st1:date>, Presidential Assistant Zamora, by authority
of the President, acted on the company's motion for reconsideration of <st1:date year="1976" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1976</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:city><st1:place>Zamora</st1:place></st1:city>
found that the company was not entirely to blame for the laying-off of its
employees, since it was severely distressed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He observed that if the execution was pushed through, the company's
assets might be totally wiped out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
ordered a stay of execution and required the NLRC to elevate the record so that
the case could be restudied (OP Decision No. 1951).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of that order, the labor arbiter denied
the motion for execution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Presidential Assistant Zamora's order is the bone of contention
in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The issues are whether the
company could ask for the reconsideration of <span class="SpellE">Clave's</span>
decision, which was authorized by the President, and whether respondent Zamora
could stay the execution of the decision and review the merits of the company's
appeal, notwithstanding that the original question raised in the Office of the
President was whether the company's appeal from the <span class="SpellE">NLRC's</span>
order of reinstatement was <u>pro</u> <u>forma</u> or not.</p>

<p class="BODY">As correctly pointed out by the Solicitor General, the
reconsideration of <span class="SpellE">Clave's</span> decision is governed by
the rules regulating appeals to the Office of the President and providing for
the finality of the decisions on such appeals (Executive Order No. 19, Series
of 1966, 62 O. G. 2940-2).</p>

<p class="BODY">Under section 4 of Executive Order No. 19 a petition for
reconsideration of the decision of the Office of the President may be filed
within fifteen days from receipt of a copy thereof by the parties involved
based on grounds similar to those found in Rule 37 of the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Among those grounds is that the decision is
not in conformity with the applicable law or evidence presented.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under section 5 of the same Executive Order, a petition for
reconsideration in exceptionally meritorious cases may be entertained even if
filed beyond the fifteen-day period.</p>

<p class="BODY">The unavoidable conclusion is that the Office of the President
has jurisdiction to entertain the company’s motion for reconsideration which
was filed on the tenth day following its receipt of Presidential Executive
Assistant <span class="SpellE">Clave's</span> decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to respondent Zamora's directive, by authority of the
President, staying the execution of Presidential Executive Assistant <span class="SpellE">Clave's</span> decision and requiring the Secretary of Labor to
elevate the record, that power, as noted by the Solicitor General, may be
implied from the provision of article 222 of the Labor Code that "the
decision of the Secretary of Labor shall be immediately <span class="SpellE">executory</span>,
even pending appeal, unless stayed by an order of the President".</p>

<p class="BODY">During the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of this case, or on
<st1:date year="1977" day="4" month="3">March 4, 1977</st1:date>, <st1:city><st1:place>Zamora</st1:place></st1:city>
resolved the oft-mentioned motion for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that resolution he noted that the motion
was filed within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> fifteen-day period fixed
in Executive Order No. 19.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He ruled that
technicalities should be disregarded and that the merits of the company's
appeal should be passed upon.</p>

<p class="BODY">After finding that the company is financially distressed and that
it violated section 11 of Presidential Decree No. 21 by laying off employees
without prior clearance from the Secretary of Labor, Zamora, by authority of
the President, modified the <span class="SpellE">NLRC's</span> decision by
ordering the company to reinstate all dismissed regular employees, with at
least one year of service, without loss of seniority, and to pay them <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> equivalent to six months' salary.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of that resolution, a supervening fact, this Court
required the parties to manifest whether the instant case has become moot and
academic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent public officials
manifested that the instant case has become moot because in this Court the
union wanted to stop Zamora from reviewing the NLRC decision but he modified it
as above indicated (we did not issue any restraining order).</p>

<p class="BODY">The company manifested that it was in conformity with the said
resolution and that the instant case has become moot.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the respondents that the issue of whether the
Office of the President should resolve the company's motion for reconsideration
is no longer <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span> in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">We cannot accede to petitioners' prayer in their manifestation
and motion of <st1:date year="1977" day="6" month="4">April 6, 1977</st1:date>
that we should modify the said resolution by ordering the reinstatement of all
the dismissed employees with full <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> (an <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> <u>in <span class="SpellE">toto</span></u> of the
NLRC decision) because, under the pleadings, that resolution is not before this
Court for review.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> this case is dismissed for having become
moot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>

<span style="font-style: italic;"><span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>, Antonio, <span style="font-style: normal;">and</span> Martin, <span class="GramE">JJ.,</span><span style="font-style: normal;"> concur.</span></span><br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">Fernando, J.,<span style="font-style: normal;"> concurs in the
opinion of </span><span style="font-style: normal;">Justice
Aquino</span><span style="font-style: normal;"> and in addition expresses the
view that the Presidential authority to reconsider its order has a
constitutional sanction and that the modified order of Presidential Assistant
Zamora does not suffer from any taint of arbitrariness.</span></span><br>
