Panay Allied Workers Union (PAWU) is a duly registered labor organization, with
membership composed of employees of the <span class="SpellE">Strachan</span>

(Taller </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Bisayas</span></span><span style="">) at </span></span><st1:address><st1:street><span class="GramE"><span style="">de</span></span><span style=""> la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> Street</span></st1:street><span style="">, </span><st1:city><span style="">Iloilo</span></st1:city></st1:address><span style=""> City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1963" day="17" month="12"><span style="">17
 December </span><span style="">1963</span></st1:date><span style=""> it filed with the </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Iloilo</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> office of the Court of Industrial Relations
a petition for direct certification as the exclusive bargaining representative
of the employees alleging that there was no other labor organization in </span><span style="">existence to bargain for them with the
employer, herein</span><span style="">after referred
to as the Company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In its </span><span style="">answer to the </span><span style="">petition </span><span style="">the Company
opposed the petition for direct </span><span style="">certification
but proposed instead that a certification election be conducted, with notice to
all interested parties.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span>28 <span style="">January </span><span style="">1964 a </span><span style="">hearing was held,
at which PAWU and the Company agreed on a certification election </span>and
stipulated on<span style=""> </span>certain matters,
particularly on the question of who should be allowed to vote and who should be
disqualified from voting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="">same </span>morning, after the stipulations
had been entered into, the Taller <span class="SpellE">Bisayas</span> Employees
and Workers Association (TALBEWA), represented by its president and its
counsel, arrived on the scene and verbally moved that it be allowed to inter­vene.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The hearing examiner of the court denied the
motion, also verbally, on the ground that TALBEWA had not yet been granted a
permit by the Department of Labor at that time and therefore was not qualified
to participate in a proceeding to select the appropriate bargaining repre­sentative
of the workers and/or employees.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On 24 February 1964 the
Court of Industrial Relations, </span><span style="">through
Presiding Judge Jose S. Bautista, issued </span><span style="">an order </span><span style="">affirming in
effect the denial of <span class="SpellE">TALBEWA's</span></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">motion
for </span><span style="">intervention by the hearing
Examiner and requesting the Department of Labor to conduct a certification
election in the office of <span class="SpellE">Strachan</span> &amp; McMurray at
de la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> Street, Iloilo City.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On 2 March 1964, </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">formal motion for intervention dated 27 February was filed by TALBEWA,
this time alleging that it was a duly registered labor organization
(certificate of registration is dated 3 February 1964) and </span><span style="">reiterating its desire to participate in the
certification </span>election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On 17
April 1964 the court, through the same Presiding Judge, denied the motion, as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Considering that the instant motion was filed only on March
2, 1964, or more than one month after <span class="SpellE">movant's</span> <span style="">verbal motion was denied by the Hearing
Examiner, it is believed that the </span><span style="">same
is too late to be given due course, especially so when the Court has already
issued an Order directing the holding of a certification election in the re­spondent
Company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, a certi­fication
election was</span> <span style="">conducted by the
Department of Labor on March </span><span style="">30,
</span><span style="">1964."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">A subsequent motion for
reconsideration was likewise denied by the Court <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> on the
ground that it did </span>not <span style="">find
"sufficient </span><span style="">justification </span><span style="">for altering or modifying the aforesaid
order." The different orders of denial are the subject of the instant
appeal by certiorari which TALBEWA has seasonably interposed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It appears that in the
certification election conducted by the Department of Labor on 30 March 1964 </span><span style="">a total </span><span style="">of seventy-eight ballots were cast.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span>Four <span style="">of </span>them <span style="">were segregated upon order of the court,
their validity to be resolved later should they </span>be <span style="">determinative of the result.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of the seventy-four (74) votes considered,
forty-eight (48) were for PAWU, twenty-two were for NO UNION, and four (4) were
held spoiled and hence were not counted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>PAWU thus obtained more than the absolute majority.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We are not convinced that
the Court of Industrial Relations committed a reversible error or grossly
abused its discretion in the premises.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the first place, petitioner's first and verbal motion to intervene
was filed when it was not yet a duly registered labor organ­ization.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The denial thereof by the hearing examiner
was therefore in order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Secondly,
petitioner filed its formal motion for the same purpose after the lapse of more
than one month following the denial, and by then the court had already affirmed
the same and requested the Department of Labor to conduct the certification
election agreed upon between PAWU and the Company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, there </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">no clear showing that
petitioner's intervention would have altered the result of that election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A mere allegation that petitioner counted
with a majority of the employees and/or <span class="GramE">workers is</span> not
enough ground to set the election aside.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>In the absence of an express allegation that <span style="">a </span>new hearing will change the facts
found, the new trial or cross-examination demanded would be idle ceremony; it
would not serve the ends of justice at all, especially so in a
quasi-administrative body like the Court of Industrial Relations, where the
rules of confrontation and cross-examination have not been expressly granted,
as in a trial against an accused in a criminal case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(National City Bank of </span><st1:state><st1:place><span class="GramE">New York</span></st1:place></st1:state><span class="GramE"> vs.
