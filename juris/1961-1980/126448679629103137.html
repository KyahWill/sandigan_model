Tan, a citizen of 
the Republic of China, filed a petition for naturalization to the Court in the 
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span> alleging, among 
others, that he was a resident of <span class="SpellE">Abuyog</span>, <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span> since his birth in 1937; that he was single, and an 
employee with an average annual income of P2<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>. 
After its due publication, the petition was heard during which, it was 
established that petitioner was employed as salesman in a commercial 
establishment in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> since 1958, 
although he often goes home to visit his parents, relatives, and friends in 
<st1:place><span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place>; that since July, 1961, 
his income had increased to P250.00 a month aside from bonus and allowance. 
Pedro <span class="SpellE">Gallego</span>, a former mayor of <span class="SpellE">Abuyog</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place> and school teacher for 14 years, and <span class="SpellE">Nazario</span> <span class="SpellE">Closa</span> alias <span class="SpellE">Esperidion</span> <span class="SpellE">Herboso</span>, former chief 
of police of <span class="SpellE">Mahaplay</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place>, and also a former school teacher, 
testified and vouched for petitioner's good moral character while in 
<st1:place><span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place>. On <st1:date month="1" day="27" year="1962">January 27, 1962</st1:date>, the court granted the petition 
upon the finding that petitioner possesses all the qualifications for 
naturalization and has complied with the requirements prescribed by law. The 
Staid appealed.</p>
<p>The Solicitor General first raises the question of improper venue. It is 
claimed that as petitioner has been residing in 
<st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> since 1958, the petition 
should have been filed therein and not in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>, pursuant to Section 8 of the Revised Naturalization 
Law.</p>
<p>As held by this Court, the residence requirement for purposes of determining 
the venue of a petition for naturalization, refers not to petitioner's presence 
or actual or physical stay in the province, but to legal residence from which he 
could or might depart or be absent temporarily, and to which he always intended 
to return.<span class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> In the instant case, 
petitioner not only alleges that he does not intend to abandon his legal 
residence in <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>, but such intention was really 
indicated by his occasional return to <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span> to visit 
his relatives and friends.</p>
<p>The petition, nevertheless, must be denied. As afore-stated, petitioner 
declared in the application, which was published, that his present residence was 
in <span class="SpellE">Abuyog</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place>. It may be pointed out that under Section 
7 of the Revised Naturalization Law (Comm. Act 473), the petitioner is required 
not only to state his present address, but even his L actual residence.<span class="style1"><sup>[2]</sup></span> or places where petitioner has actually 
resided. The purpose of the law, as already declared, is to facilitate the 
tracking or checking up, by private individuals or government agencies, on the 
different activities of petitioner, that may be material to the petition.<span class="style1"><sup>[3]</sup></span> And, the failure to state in the petition all 
the places where petitioner has resided is fatal to his application for 
naturalization.<span class="style1"><sup>[4]</sup></span> </p>
<p>Furthermore, it may be said, that while his character witnesses may have 
personal knowledge of petitioner's behavior during his stay in <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>, these witnesses cannot be considered qualified to 
become "insurers" of his good moral character while in Manila, where he has 
stayed for the last three years immediately preceding the filing of the 
petition.<span class="style1"><sup>[5]</sup></span> And, since the law requires 
proof of proper and irreproachable conduct during the entire period of the 
alien's residence in the Philippines,<span class="style1"><sup>[6]</sup></span> 
the evidence herein presented falls short of the requirement of the law.</p>
<p>Neither has applicant proven that he has a lucrative occupation within the 
contemplation of the Revised Naturalization law. His basic or regular income is 
only from P2<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> to P3,000.00 annually, which, in 
view of the present high cost of living and prevailing low value of our 
currency, is deemed insufficient to meet the requirement of the law.</p>
<p><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from is hereby reversed, and the 
petition is dismissed. No costs. </p>
<p><span class="GramE"><b>SO ORDERED.</b></span></p>
