				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal by <i>certiorari</i> to review the Decision of the
respondent Court of Appeals<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
in CA-G.R. No. 38142-R entitled "Jose O. Barrios versus <span class="SpellE">Heracleo</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Villacin</span>, Jr. and
Vicente B. <span class="SpellE">Villacin</span>" and from its order denying
the motion for reconsideration of the petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">Originally, there were two (2) cases appealed to the Court of
Appeals:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>CA-G.R. No. 38138-R (Civil Case No. 223)
entitled "Jose O. Barrios v. <span class="SpellE">Apolonia</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Alegre</span>, et al.,";
and 2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>CA-G.R. No. 38142-R (Civil Case
No. 229) entitled "Jose O. Barrios v. <span class="SpellE">Heracleo</span>
B. <span class="SpellE">Villacin</span>, Jr. and Vicente <span class="SpellE">Villacin</span>."
Both are ordinary actions for the recovery of possession of a parcel of land,
damages and attorney's fees originating from the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental where they were tried jointly on the
ground that the land in controversy is the same, although different portions
thereof were respectively claimed by the two (2) sets of defendants, and the
issues raised therein are identical.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a decision dated May 12, 1966 as modified on June 16, 1966,
the trial court found the defendants in the said two cases as possessors in bad
faith and ordered them to vacate the premises and to pay the plaintiff
(petitioner herein) damages, which in the case of the present respondents is
the sum of P18,000.00 per year from 1964 until they vacate the property.</p>

<p class="BODY">On appeal by both the defendants, the Court of Appeals, in a
decision dated <st1:date year="1970" day="15" month="5">May 15, 1970</st1:date>,
affirmed the findings of the trial court in Civil Case No. 223 entitled
"Jose Barrios v. <span class="SpellE">Apolonia</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.
de <span class="SpellE">Alegre</span>, et al." dec足laring the defendants
possessors in bad faith, but reversed that in Civil Case No. 229 entitled
"Jose O. Barrios v. <span class="SpellE">Heracleo</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Villacin</span>, Jr. and Vicente <span class="SpellE">Villacin</span>."
The Appellate Court now found the respondents <span class="SpellE">Villacins</span>
possessors in good faith and ordered the petitioner to exercise the options
available to him under Article 448 of the New Civil Code, that is, either to
appropriate the improvements introduced by the said defendants on the area in
controversy and to pay the value thereof in the amount of P22,000.00, or to
compel these defendants (respondents herein) to pay the reasonable price of
that area.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner now comes to Us seeking the review only of the
decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. No. 38142-R (Civil Case No. 229).</p>

<p class="BODY">In said Civil Case No. 229 entitled "Jose O. Barrios v. <span class="SpellE">Heracleo</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Villacin</span>, Jr. and
Vicente B. <span class="SpellE">Villacin</span>," the following facts
appear:</p>

<p class="BODY">A certain <span class="SpellE">Lorenza</span> <span class="SpellE">Monta単o</span>
was the original registered owner of a large tract of land with an area of
188,212 sq. meters, more or less, situated in Barrio <span class="SpellE">Mabini</span>,
<st1:city><st1:place>Cadiz</st1:place></st1:city>, <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
Occidental.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her ownership was evidenced
by Original Certificate of Title No. F-1670 entered under her name pursuant to
Free Patent V-4415 issued to her on <st1:date year="1956" day="13" month="6">June
 13, 1956</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, prior to <st1:date year="1960" day="25" month="3">March
 25, 1960</st1:date>, the area in controversy was part of the <span class="SpellE">forestal</span> zone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
notwithstanding and before its release from the <span class="SpellE">forestal</span>
zone, a certain <span class="SpellE">Graciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Lamis</span>
entered the same and from then on, was known to be in continuous and
uninterrupted possession and occupation thereof, continuing the cultivation of
the land begun by the <span class="SpellE">Alegres</span> (defendants in Civil
Case No. 223).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1960" day="25" month="3">March 25, 1960</st1:date>, that area was released from the <span class="SpellE">forestal</span> zone and declared part of the disposable patrimony
of the State.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="6" month="9">September 6, 1962</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Lorenza</span> <span class="SpellE">Monta単o</span> sold her
land to the petitioner herein as a consequence of which her Original
Certificate of Title was cancelled and in lieu thereof Transfer Certificate of
Title No. T-33012 was issued in the name of petitioner, Jose O. Barrios, by the
Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="27" month="3">March 27, 1963</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Graciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Lamis</span> sold his
rights over the area in controversy to a certain <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Butaz</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, on March 5, 1964, <span class="SpellE">Lamis</span> repurchased
the same from <span class="SpellE">Butaz</span>, and on the same day, <span class="SpellE">Lamis</span> sold all his rights and interests in the <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> area and all the improvements found therein to
respondents <span class="SpellE">Villacins</span>, the sale being unsupported by
any kind of evidence of title of the vendor, <span class="SpellE">Lamis</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, petitioner received information that his land was
being sold by one Valentine <span class="SpellE">Botas</span>, whom he
erroneously thought to be the vendor, to Mayor <span class="SpellE">Heracleo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Villacin</span>, Sr. of <st1:place><st1:placename>Cadiz</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> and the father of herein
respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1964" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1964</st1:date>, petitioner thru his lawyer, sent
a letter to Mayor <span class="SpellE">Villacin</span> informing the latter of
the true ownership of the land, to wit,</p>

<blockquote>"<st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place></blockquote>

<st1:place><span class="SpellE">Negros</span></st1:place> Occidental</blockquote>

<blockquote>Dear Mayor <span class="SpellE">Villacin</span>:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">Last week, my client Mr. Jose O. Barrios informed me that he
received an information that you bought from a certain Valentine <span class="SpellE">Botas</span> a piece of land located at Barrio <span class="SpellE">Mabini</span>,
<st1:city><st1:place>Cadiz</st1:place></st1:city>, <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
Occidental.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That incidentally, the land
sold to you by this person who professes to be the owner thereof is Lot No. 209
covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-33012 issued in the name of my
client, Mr. Jose O. Barrios.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence this
letter.</p>

<p class="2Q">To protect your rights and interest, I suggest that you make an
inquiry from the Office of the Register of Deeds, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
about the description and ownership of the property sold to you by this
Valentine <span class="SpellE">Botas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Otherwise, you will be left holding an empty bag.</p>

<p class="2Q">I am sending you a <span class="SpellE">photostatic</span> copy of
Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-33012 issued in the name of Mr. Barrios to
help guide you in deter足mining whether the land sold to you by Mr. Valentine <span class="SpellE">Botas</span> located at Barrio <span class="SpellE">Mabini</span>,
Cadiz, is the very one described therein or not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>May you be guided accordingly.</p>

<blockquote>Yours truly,</blockquote>

RAYMUNDO M. LOZADA, JR."</blockquote>

<blockquote>(p. 14, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, Exhibit B)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Despite this letter, the mayor's men using
tractors bearing the mayor's initials, entered and occupied, on April 7, 1964,
nine (9) hectares of the middle portion of the petitioner's property and
threatened petitioner's <span class="SpellE"><u>encargado</u></span>, <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> <span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span> with bodily
harm unless he vacates the premises.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="15" month="4">April 15, 1964</st1:date>,
another letter was sent by the petitioner reiterating his ownership and
demanding that the mayor vacate the premises, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"<st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place></blockquote>

<blockquote>Dear Mayor <span class="SpellE">Villacin</span>:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">I have been informed by Mr. Jose O. Barrios that his land situated
at Barrio <span class="SpellE">Mabini</span>, <st1:city><st1:place>Cadiz</st1:place></st1:city>,
<span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental, is being worked by your men with
the use of two tractors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
lamentable because notwithstanding my letter to you dated <st1:date year="1964" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1964</st1:date>, in which you were fully apprised
of the ownership of the land as evidenced by Transfer Certificate of Title No.
T-33012 issued in the name of Mr. Jose O. Barrios, you persisted in forcibly
entering the place with intent to gain.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, this is manifestly an act done in bad faith.</p>

immediately and to return to the owner the peaceful possession and occupation
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We will be expecting your wise
judgment to guide you in this matter before we will be forced, much to our
regret, to invoke the law to protect the rights and interests of our client.</p>

<blockquote>Yours truly,</blockquote>

<blockquote>(SGD.)
RAYMUNDO M. LOZADA, JR."</blockquote>

<blockquote>(p. 15, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, Exhibit C)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There being non-compliance with said demand, petitioner
filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Civil Case No. 472 before the
Municipal Court against the Mayor for forcible entry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The inferior court dismissed the complaint
upon agreement of the parties and for the purpose of filing the proper pleading
before the competent court; and on July 16, 1965, petitioner filed Civil Case
No. 229 in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Silay</span> City,
<span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental against Mayor <span class="SpellE">Villacin</span>,
the complaint later amended to include the sons of the Mayor, <span class="SpellE">Heracleo</span> Jr. and Vicente, as the real defendants.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his brief, petitioner makes the following assignment of
errors, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>I.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals erred in holding the
respondent buyers and possessors in good faith of the land in dispute.</blockquote>

<blockquote>II.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals erred in ordering
petitioner to exercise the option under Article 448 of the New Civil Code
either by appropriating the improvements introduced by the respondents or to
compel them to pay the price of the land.</blockquote>

<blockquote>III. The Court of
Appeals erred in disregarding the letters sent to respondent's father, Mayor <span class="SpellE">Heracleo</span> <span class="SpellE">Villacin</span> advising him of
the ownership of the land in dispute.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After perusal of this assignment of errors and considering that
all are closely related, We deem that the lone issue presented to Us is whether
or not the Court of Appeals was correct in interpreting the facts and
circumstances attending the possession of the <span class="SpellE">Villacins</span>
of the area in question as constituting possession in good faith.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the very outset, We must hold that there is no merit to the
contention of the respondents <span class="SpellE">Villacins</span> that the
aforesaid issue is a question of fact, the finding of the Court of Appeals
being binding on this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>True,
except for some exceptions, findings of facts made by the Court of Appeals are
conclusive on this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But in the
case at bar, whether or not the facts, as found by the Court of Appeals, are
constitutive of possession in good faith or possession in bad faith, is a
question of law which may properly be brought before Us.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals in imputing good faith to respondents <span class="SpellE">Villacins</span> declared, and We quote:</p>

<blockquote>"Consequently, considering that portion B of the plan Exhibit
F had been in the possession of <span class="SpellE">Graciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Lamis</span> publicly and continuously since time immemorial,
without anyone disturbing him in his possession, and considering further that
this particular parcel was released from the <span class="SpellE">forestal</span>
zone only on March 5, 1960, defendants <span class="SpellE">Villacins</span> had
certainly no reason to suspect that such land could have been included in the
free patent of <span class="SpellE">Lorenza</span> <span class="SpellE">Monta単o</span>
issued in 1956.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under these circumstances,
when they bought the rights of <span class="SpellE">Lamis</span> over that land
on <st1:date year="1964" day="5" month="3">March 5, 1964</st1:date>, they must
have done so in good faith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
especially so in view of the fact that the evidence has not clearly proved the
bad faith of said defendants."</blockquote>

<blockquote>(p. 38, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We do not agree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Several
facts, as disclosed by the records and taken together, are reasonably
suspicious to have put the respondents <span class="SpellE">Villacins</span> in
inquiry as to the alleged rights of the vendor, <span class="SpellE">Lamis</span>,
over the area in controversy.</p>

<p class="BODY">Firstly, when respondents bought the land from <span class="SpellE">Lamis</span>, the latter could not and did not at any time produce
any title or application to said land.</p>

<p class="BODY">Well settled is the rule that,</p>

<blockquote>"The law protects to a greater degree a purchaser who buys
from the registered owner himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Corollarily</span>, it requires a higher degree of prudence from
one who buys from a person who is not the registered owner, <span class="SpellE">altho</span>
the land object of the transaction is registered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While one who buys from the registered owner
does not have to look behind the certificate of title, one who buys from one
who is not the registered owner is expected to examine not only the Certificate
of Title but all factual circumstances necessary for him to determine if there
are any flaws in the title of the transferor, or in his capacity to transfer
the land."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">If such a degree of prudence is required of a purchaser of
registered land from one who shows a Certificate of Title but who appears not
to be the registered owner, more so should the law require the utmost caution
from a purchaser of registered land from one who could not show any title nor
any evidence of his capacity to transfer the land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Failing to exercise caution of any kind
whatsoever, as in the case of the respondents <span class="SpellE">Villacins</span>,
is tantamount to bad faith.</p>

<p class="BODY">Secondly, petitioner sent letters to the father of the
respondents informing him of the true ownership of the aforesaid land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals in disregarding this
fact said, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"The registered letter dated <st1:date year="1964" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1964</st1:date> xxx is not proof that herein defendants <span class="SpellE">Villacins</span> were also apprised of the information supposedly
given by said plaintiff to the Mayor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
will be observed that Mayor <span class="SpellE">Villacin</span> is not a party
to this case and is a person different from the herein two defendants <span class="SpellE">Villacins</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
such advise, was given after defendants <span class="SpellE">Villacins</span> had
already bought the rights of <span class="SpellE">Lamis</span> over the <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> area on <st1:date year="1964" day="5" month="3">March
 5, 1964</st1:date>."</blockquote>

<blockquote>(p. 21, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We deem this untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the normal course of daily life, it is very probable, if not decidedly certain,
that sons and father had occasion to talk about the aforesaid letters
containing this information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be
noted that it was never <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> in the trial
that men of the mayor entered the premises of the petitioner and that land
tractors bearing the initials of the mayor were used.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This being so, the mayor had knowledge that
his sons bought the land and it is difficult for Us to imagine that he withheld
the information of the true ownership of the land from his sons, unless he was
not acting in their interest, which is quite remote.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Learning of this information, the more must
We require of the respondents that exercise of prudence required by law in
inquiring as to the status of the land they bought.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But instead, they did nothing but took
possession of the land and started planting sugar cane thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of a case similarly situated, the Supreme
Court ruled:</p>

<blockquote>"Defendant's bad faith began after the warning given in a
letter by the plaintiff's daughter in March 1909, for after having received it,
she then had ground to doubt that <span class="SpellE">Sotera</span> and Juan <span class="SpellE">Ca単o</span> could transfer any title of possession in the
following December."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thirdly, respondents herein knew of the case of forcible entry
brought by petitioner against their father, Mayor <span class="SpellE">Villacin</span>,
Sr., under the impression that the latter was the vendee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such knowledge was a warning to them that the
land they bought is subject to the claim of other parties, but again they
continued in their possession of the land and planting thereon.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering these facts, We are constrained to hold that the
respondents cannot now come to this Court claiming the benefit of being
purchasers of registered land in good faith.</p>

<p class="BODY">Art. 526 of the New Civil Code is clear.</p>

<blockquote>'"Art. 526:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is
deemed a possessor in good faith who is not aware that there exists in his
title or mode of acquisition any flaw which inva足lidates it.</blockquote>

<blockquote>He is deemed a possessor in bad faith who possesses in any case
contrary to the foregoing."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In interpreting the above quoted provision, We have repeatedly
ruled that if circumstances exist that require a prudent man to investigate,
and he does not, he is deemed to have acted in <span class="SpellE"><u>mala</u></span><u>
fide</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A party's mere refusal to
believe that a defect exists or his willful closing of his eyes to the
possibility of the existence of a defect in his vendor's title will not make
him an innocent purchaser for value, if it afterwards develops that the title
was in fact defective.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Similarly, a buyer of registered land who fails to act with the diligence of a
prudent man cannot be a purchaser in good faith.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Lastly, as a special defense in the proceedings below,
respondents <span class="SpellE">Villacins</span> alleged the non-efficacy and
nullity of the title of <span class="SpellE">Lorenza</span> <span class="SpellE">Monta単o</span>
from which the title of the petitioner stemmed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We need not pass upon this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Court of Appeals is correct in holding that this is a collateral attack on a
Torrens Title which under our laws and estab足lished jurisprudence is not
permitted and cannot be legally done.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Premises considered, We now apply Art. 449, 450, 451 and 452, New
Civil Code.</p>

<blockquote>Art. 449.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He who builds,
plants or sows in bad faith on the land of another, loses that is built,
planted, or sown without right to indemnity.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Art. 450.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The owner of the
land on which anything has been built, planted or sown in bad faith may demand
the demolition of the work, or that the planting or sowing be removed, in order
to replace things in their former condition at the expense of the person who
built, planted or sowed; or he may compel the builder or planter to pay the
price of the land and the <span class="SpellE">sower</span> the proper rent.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Art. 451.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the cases of
the two preceding articles, the landowner is entitled to damages from the
builder, planter or <span class="SpellE">sower</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Art. 452.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The builder,
planter, or <span class="SpellE">sower</span> in bad faith is entitled to
reimbursement for the necessary expenses of the preservation of the land.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As the records show that the <span class="SpellE">Villacins</span>
planted sugar cane which is harvested every crop year and, therefore, cannot be
considered as a necessary expense for the preservation of the land, they are
not entitled to any such reimbursement of amount expended by them.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records also indicate that the parties, at the pre-trial
hearing, agreed to the payment of liquidated damages to the prevailing party
the amount of P18,000.00 per year until the final adjudication of the case
(Record on Appeal, pp. 37-38), which the trial court incorporated in its
modified Decision dated June 16, 1966, ordering the <span class="SpellE">Villacins</span>
to pay liquidated damages of P18,000.00 per year beginning 1964.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Record on Appeal, pp. 84-90).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We hold that the amount agreed as liquidated

to restore possession of the land to the petitioner and to pay to the
petitioner liquidated damages in the amount of P18,000.00 per year beginning
1964 until the time said land is restored to the possession of the
