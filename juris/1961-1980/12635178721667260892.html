				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Tomas and Alexander <span class="SpellE">Lacandazo</span> were
charged with murder and frustrated forcible abduction of <span class="SpellE">Matilde</span>
<span style="">Sandoval in </span>the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Palawan</span> (Criminal Cases Nos. 3115 and
3196, respectively).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After due trial
upon <span style="">a </span>plea of not guilty, they
were convicted only of "homicide through simple negligence", as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING CONSIDERETIONS, the Court holds
that the charges under Criminal Cases Nos. 3115 and 3196, against Alexander <span class="SpellE">Lacandazo</span> and against Tomas <span class="SpellE">Lacandazo</span>
in Criminal Case No. 3196 have not been proven beyond reasonable doubt and,
therefore, acquits them of the crime charged.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under Criminal Case No. 3115, the Court holds that Tomas <span class="SpellE">Lacandazo</span> is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of
<span class="SpellE">Homicide</span> thru simple negligence, and not murder,
penalized under the 2nd paragraph of Article 365 of the Revised Penal Code, and
sentences him to an imprisonment of <span style="">SIX
(6) </span>MONTHS of <span class="SpellE">arresto</span> mayor, to indemnify the
heirs of the deceased in the amount of SIX THOUSAND (P6<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>)
PESOS, with subsidiary <span style="">im</span>prisonment
in case of insolvency, and to <span style="">pay </span>the
cost.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bonds posted by the two
accused are ordered cancelled, and the <span style="">bondsmen
absolved from any responsibility </span>whatsoever thereon."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Felizarda</span> Sandoval, mother of the
deceased <span class="SpellE">Matilde</span> <span style="">Sandoval, appealed from </span>the decision in so far as the civil
indemnity awarded therein was concerned, contending that it should have been in
the amount of P12<span class="GramE">,000</span> <span style="">or more, </span>in accordance with the later decisions of this <span style="">court on </span>the matter.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case was submitted for decision without any brief submitted
by the defendants.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering <span style="">the </span>circumstances
of the case, particularly the trial court's own finding that it "could not
believe that the shooting was accidental under the circumstances testified to by
the accused <span style="">Tomas </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Lacandazo</span></span><span style="">", </span><span style="">We are of the opinion </span>and so hold that
the <span style="">civil indemnity </span>should be
increased to P12,000.00 to <span style="">be paid,
jointly and severally, </span>by Tomas and Alexander <span class="SpellE">Lacandazo</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The decision appealed from, therefore, <span style="">is modified </span>as above indicated, with costs.</p>
