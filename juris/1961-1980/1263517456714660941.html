				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In this appeal certified to this Court by the Court of Appeals as
involving purely issues of law, we hold that the Court of First instance which
has pending and unresolved before it a civil case between the parties for the
resolution of their conflicting claims of ownership of a certain parcel of land
by virtue of the same having been sold twice to them by the original owner,
cannot assume juris­diction as a court of land registration over a subsequent
summary petition filed in the land registration case by petitioner, and order
respondent to surrender the original owner's duplicate certificate of title in
the latter's possession for cancellation and registration of the disputed sale
and issuance of a new certificate of title in favor of petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellate court gives the following background facts and
issues: "There was filed in the court below Civil Case No. 2221 which
involves the partition and recovery of a certain parcel of land.</p>

<p class="BODY">"It appears that the original owner of this land, Cornelio <span class="SpellE">Balbin</span>, had sold the same to several persons, two of whom
were <span class="SpellE">Segunda</span> Mina and <span class="SpellE">Tranquilino</span>
Valdes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The corresponding <st1:place>Tor­rens</st1:place>
title was delivered to Valdes.</p>

<p class="BODY">"While said civil case was pending in court, <span class="SpellE">Segunda</span> Mina sought to have her deed of sale registered in
the office of the Re­gister of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> <st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Sur</span>.</st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because <span class="SpellE">Tranquilino</span>
Valdes also sought the registration of his deed of sale of the same land, the
Register of Deeds brought the matter <u>en</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>consulta</u></span>
to the Land Re­gistration Commission for resolution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commission ruled that the deed of sale in
favor of <span class="SpellE">Segunda</span> Mina was <span class="SpellE">registerable</span>
on condition that the owner's duplicate certificate of title of the land be
produced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the basis of this ruling by
the Land Regis­tration Commission, <span class="SpellE">Segunda</span> Mina filed
a petition with the court below praying that an order be issued requiring <span class="SpellE">Tranquilino</span> Valdes, who was in possession of the owner's
duplicate certificate of title of the land, to surrender the same and to have
it cancelled, and a new one, in lieu thereof, issued in favor of <span class="SpellE">Segunda</span> Mina.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">"This petition was opposed by <span class="SpellE">Tranquilino</span>
Valdes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Acting on Mina's petition, the
lower court issued the following order of <st1:date year="1962" day="19" month="2">February 19, 1962</st1:date> –</p>

<blockquote>‘Considering the resolution of the Honorable Commissioner, Land
Registration Commis­sion in LRC <span class="SpellE">Consulta</span> No. 359 of
the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>
that the deed of sale executed in favor of the spouses Juan Miranda and <span class="SpellE">Segunda</span> Mina may be registered; and it appearing further
that the said land is not delinquent in the payment of real property taxes as
shown by the certificate of the municipal treasurer.</blockquote>

<blockquote>'WHEREFORE, as prayed for, the respondent <span class="SpellE">Tranquilino</span>
Valdes and his wife Rosalina Gallon are hereby required to surrender within 10
days from receipt of copy of this Order, Owner's Dup­licate Certificate of
Title No. 30 for its cancella­tion and the issuance of a new Certificate of
Title in favor of the spouses Juan Miranda and <span class="SpellE">Segunda</span>
Mina, after the payment of the proper fees.</blockquote>

<blockquote>'It appearing from the written and verbal manifestation of counsel
for the respondent that Duplicate Certificate of Title No. 30 is presently in
the Office of the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> and that he has no objection if said title remain in
that Office pending the resolution of this motion, the Register of Deeds is au­thorized
to comply with the order of this Court adverted to above if the said
manifestation is correct.</blockquote>

<blockquote>'SO ORDERED.'</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">"Assailing the order as against the law, <span class="SpellE">Tranquilino</span>
Valdes interposed the present appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
testimonial evidence in rela­tion to this petition was presented.</p>

<p class="BODY">"We find the issues raised to be purely of law, namely: (1)
Is the order in question <span class="SpellE">appealable</span>?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(2) May the holder of a certificate of title
be compelled to surrender the same for the purposes mentioned and under the
circumstances given?"</p>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">The first issue as to the <span class="SpellE">appealability</span> of the questioned order, cited by the
appellate court, is actually a counter-argument of petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
without merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court has long held
that such orders of the land registration court, which resolve important
questions as to the respective rights of the parties and require the surrender
of the Certificate of Title for cancellation and issuance of a new one in favor
of a different owner, are <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> orders.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">The second and main issue cited by
the appellate court has likewise been long resolved by the Court to the effect
that where the same property is sold twice, it is precipitate and improper for
the land registration court, under a petition filed under section 111 of the
Land Registration Act</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
to order the party in possession of the title to surrender it to the Register
of Deeds for cancellation and registration of the disputed sale in favor of the
adverse party, un­til the conflicting claims of the parties have been
definitely resolved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the similar case
of <span class="SpellE"><u>Oliveros</u></span><u> vs. <span class="SpellE">Catot</span></u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
the Court thus held: 'According to the facts, the controversy arose from the
circumstance that the same lands were sold twice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not now decide which of these two sales
is preferred and valid, but we do hold that until this question has been
definitely resolved, it cannot be con­tended that the appellant holds transfer
certificate of title with­out, just cause or right thereto, wherefore, it is
not just that she be compelled to part with said document by surrendering it to
the Register of Deeds."</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">3.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">Here, where the ownership of the
same property was being directly litigated between the same parties and other
ad­verse claimants to whom the original owner had likewise sold the same, in
Civil Case No. 2221 pending before the same lower court as a regular court of
general jurisdiction, it was jurisdic­tional error on the lower court's part to
take cognizance of the summary petition filed by petitioner as a land
registration pro­ceeding and order respondent to be summarily dispossessed of
the owner's duplicate certificate of title in the latter's possession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The question of which of the various sales
executed by the ori­ginal owner in favor of the contending parties here and
various other vendees was certainly a prejudicial question which had to be
finally decided on its merits, and the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of
the civil case before the lower court barred it and any other court from assum­ing
jurisdiction and taking cognizance of any subsequent case or proceeding
involving directly the same question and issue.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Fur­thermore, as the Court has consistently ruled in numerous cases,
controversial issues, which may not be considered a mere inci­dental matter in
the land registration case but should be the ob­ject of a personal action
between the parties, such as the con­flicting claims to the land here in
question of the contending par­ties and other adverse vendees thereof, should
be adjudicated by the Court of First Instance only in ordinary actions and not
under the summary proceedings provided in the Land Registration Act.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">The lower court was obviously
misled into issuing its questioned order by the representation in the land
registration proceeding that the Land Registration Commissioner had ruled in
the <span class="SpellE"><u>consulta</u></span> elevated to him by the Register
of Deeds as to the conflicting deeds of sale presented for registration by the
parties "that the deed of sale executed in favor of the spouses Juan Mi­randa
and <span class="SpellE">Segunda</span> Mina may be registered." This was
not exact­ly accurate for what the Commissioner had ruled was: 'With res­pect
to the first point raised in the first question (1-a) of the Register of Deeds,
the Commission believes that the deed of sale executed in favor of the spouses
Juan Miranda and <span class="SpellE">Segunda</span> Mina, on the assumption that
the clerical defects pointed out by the Re­gister of Deeds have already been
rectified and the evidence of non-delinquency in the payment of realty taxes is
available, may be registered under Act No. 496 under a new entry if the spouses
can present the owner's duplicate of Original Certificate of Title No. 30 which
of course poses a problem because said owner's duplicate Certificate, although
presently in the possession of the Register of Deeds, is actually under the
control and disposition of <span class="SpellE">Tranquilino</span> Valdes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the latter surrendered it for the spe­cific
purpose of registering the sale made in his favor as well as to allow the
registration of the earlier notice of <span class="SpellE"><u>lis</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">pendens</span></u>, no other party may take advantage of such
surrender, and the Register of Deeds may not annotate on said owner's duplicate
certificate any other transaction in favor of some other per­son.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Segunda</span> Mina is not
precluded though from availing her­self of any legal recourse she may deem
appropriate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 111 of Act No. 496
may be one remedy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
The Commissioner was further careful to caution the Register of Deeds and state
in his conclusion that: "Let it be made plain that the Commis­sion has
merely passed upon the <span class="SpellE"><u>registrability</u></span> of the
documents subject of this <span class="SpellE">Consulta</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their validity is for a Court of compe­tent
jurisdiction to determine."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It should be noted that such resolutions of <span class="SpellE"><u>consultas</u></span>
from registers of deeds "shall be conclusive and binding upon all Re­gisters
of Deeds" alone, and not upon other parties, much less upon the lower
court where the validity and <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the con­flicting
deeds of sale were being directly litigated, as acknow­ledged by the
Commissioner himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the Court held
in <span class="SpellE"><u>Noblejas</u></span><u> vs. <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span></u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
"(I)t will be noted that by specific provision of the section, the
decision of the Land Registration Commissioner 'shall be conclusive and binding
upon all Registers of Deeds' alone, and not upon-other parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This limitation in effect identifies the
resolutions of the Land Registration Com­missioner with those of any other
bureau director, whose reso­lutions or orders bind his subordinates alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'That the Com­missioner's resolutions are <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> does not prove that they are not administrative;
any bureau director's ruling is likewise <span class="SpellE">appealable</span>
to the corresponding department head."</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent was under no constraint to appeal from the Com­missioner's
Resolution, as contended by petitioner, since by its own terms, no document not
submitted by respondent, who had delivered the same to the Register of Deeds,
could be annotated thereon without the corresponding court order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was from the lower court's order to
surrender the title that respondent proper­ly appealed from.</p>

<p class="NUM">5. The supplementary order issued by the lower court on March 27,
1962,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
directing the Register of Deeds to refrain from delivering to respondent the
owner's duplicate certificate of title and ordering respondent not to withdraw
the same from the office of the Register of Deeds must likewise be set aside,
for lack of jurisdiction and authority on the lower court's part in the summary
land registration proceeding, as held hereinabove.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Until the issue of ownership shall have been
finally decided in the pending civil case, respondent is entitled to possession
of said certificate of title, as his possession thereof has not been shown to
have been unlawfully obtained; on the contrary, in ac­cordance with his
averments, said title was delivered to him upon the execution of the deed of
sale in his favor by the original owner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At any rate, the interests of all the parties, in­cluding the other vendees,
<span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> as defendants in the pend­ing civil case,
have been amply protected with the annotation on the title, caused by
petitioner, of the corresponding notice of <span class="SpellE"><u>lis</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>pendens</u></span>, giving notice <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>rem</u></span> of the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of
said civil case.</p>
