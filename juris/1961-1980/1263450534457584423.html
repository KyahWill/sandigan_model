<p class="BODY"><span style="">On February </span>23,

<span style="">of the specific tax of P21,452.42 paid
by Standard-Vacuum on the aforesaid oils.<span style="">&nbsp;

<blockquote><span style="">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span>

</span><st1:date year="1961" day="28" month="9"><span style="">September 28, 1961</span></st1:date><span style=""> the Commissioner denied the claim for having been interposed beyond
the two-year period provided for in Section 306 of the Tax Code.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="17" month="2">February 17, 1962</st1:date>,
after its motion for reconside­ration was denied by the Commissioner, Insular
Lumber Com­pany appealed to the Court of Tax Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1965" day="13" month="1">January
 13, 1965</st1:date> the Court of Tax Appeals rendered the following judg­ment:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the decision appealed from is reversed, and
respondent Commissioner of Internal Revenue is hereby ordered to refund to
petitioner Insular Lumber Company the amount of P5,363.22 representing 25% of
the specific tax paid on the manufactured oils and fuels used by it in its
logging and timber operations during the year 1958.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">From
said judgment, the Commissioner has appealed to this Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The main issue is whether or not the right to file the instant
claim for refund has prescribed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant supports the affirmative view for the rea­son that the
claim in question, which was filed on <st1:date year="1961" day="23" month="2">February
 23, 1961</st1:date>, was made more than two years from 1958 - the year the tax
was paid and the year the mineral oils and fuels were used - citing Sections
306 and 309 of the Tax Code, which read:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"SEC. </span>306.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Recovery of tax erroneously or illegally
collected</u>. - No suit or proceed­ing shall be maintained in any court for
the recovery of any national internal revenue tax hereafter alleged to have
been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected or of any pe­nalty claimed
to have been collected without authority, or of any sum alleged to have been
excessive or in any manner wrongfully collec­ted, until a claim for refund or
credit has been duly filed with the Commissioner of In­ternal Revenue; but such
suit or proceeding may be maintained, whether or not such tax, penalty, or sum
has been paid under protest or duress.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In any case, no such suit or pro­ceeding shall be begun after the
expiration of two years from the date of payment of the tax or penalty."</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"SEC. 309.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><u>Authority of Commissioner to make
compromises and to refund taxes</u>. - The Commissioner of Internal Revenue may
compromise any civil or other case arising under this Code or other law or part
of law administered by the Bureau of Internal Revenue, may creditor refund
taxes erroneously or illegal­ly received, or penalties imposed without
authority, and may remit before payment any tax that appears to be unjustly
assessed or excessive.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"He shall refund the value of internal-revenue stamps when the
same are returned in good condition by the purchaser, and may, in his
discretion, redeem or exchange unused stamps that have been rendered unfit for
use, and may refund their value upon proof of des­truction.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The authority of the Commissioner of In­ternal Revenue to
credit or refund taxes or penalties under this section can only be exercised if
the claim for credit or refund is made in writing and filed with him within two
years after the payment of the tax or penalty."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On the other hand, <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> subscribe to the view that Sections </span>306 <span style="">and </span>309, <span style="">quoted above, apply to refund of taxes erroneously or illegally
collected; and that since in this case the collection of the tax was not er­roneous
or illegal, said sections should not be applied herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Appellees</span> rely on
Muller &amp; Phipps (</span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">) Ltd. v. Collector of Internal Revenue, </span>103 <span style="">Phil. 145.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Sections </span>306 <span style="">and </span>309 <span style="">of the National Internal Reve­nue Code were intended to govern all
kinds of refunds of internal revenue taxes - those taxes imposed and collected
pursuant to the National Internal Revenue Code.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, this Court stated that "this provision", referring to
Sec­tion </span>306, <span style="">"which is
mandatory, is not subject to qualifi­cation, and, hence, </span><u><span style="">it applies regardless of the conditions under
which payment has been made</span></u><span style="">."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">And
to hold that the instant claim for refund of a specific tax, an internal
revenue tax imposed in Section 142 of the National Inter­nal Revenue Code, is
beyond the scope of Sections </span>306 <span style="">and
</span>309 <span style="">is to thwart the aforesaid
intention and spirit under­lying said provisions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Note that the case at bar
is not the only instance in the Tax Code when a tax is initially collected
legally, but later becomes refundable to the taxpayer by the happen­ing of a </span><u><span style="">supervening cause</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">Section 146 grants refund of specific tax on
negative films, unprinted positive films and reversal films of sixteen
millimeters or less used in ama­teur photography.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second paragraph of Section </span><span style="">182(B)(2), </span><span style="">as amended by Republic Act </span><span style="">1856,
</span><span style="">allows refund of occupa­tion tax
paid in excess of the rates in effect prior to </span><st1:date year="1957" day="1" month="1"><span style="">Ja­nuary </span>1, <span style="">1957</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">Section </span>53(2)(d) <span style="">authorizes refund of the excess of the tax
withheld at source at rates therein pro­vided over the tax subsequently
determined in the income tax return.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
all those instances the law specifically subjects the refund to the provisions
of Section </span><span style="">309.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">Sec­tion
142(d), as amended by Republic Act </span><span style="">755,
</span><span style="">allows re­fund of </span><span style="">50% </span><span style="">of the specific tax on denatured alcohol used for motive power in
agriculture and aviation during the five years from </span><st1:date year="1952" day="18" month="6"><span style="">June </span><span style="">18, 1952</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">In said instance, however, like in the case
at bar, the law does not state </span>that <span style="">such refund shall be subject to Section </span><span style="">309.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">Said silence not­withstanding, the intention
is clear that refunds of inter­nal revenue taxes are generally governed by
Sections 306 and </span>309 <span style="">of the Tax
Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since in those cases the tax
sought to be refunded was collected legally, the running of the two-year
prescriptive period provided for in Section </span>306 <span style="">should commence, <u>not from the date the tax was paid, but from the
happening of the supervening cause which enti­tled the taxpayer to a tax refund</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the claim for refund should be filed with
the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, and the subsequent appe</span>a<span style="">l to the Court of Tax Appeals must be
instituted, within the said two-year period.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In this case, it was the <u>use in 1958</u> of the manufac­tured
mineral oils and fuels in the operation of its fo­rest concession which gave
Insular Lumber Company the right to claim refund of 25% of the specific tax
paid thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The claim for refund was
filed with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue on <st1:date year="1961" day="23" month="2">February 23, 1961</st1:date> and the petition for review was
filed in the Court of Tax Appeals on <st1:date year="1962" day="17" month="2">February
 17, <span style="">1962</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Both
the aforesaid dates are more than two years after 1958, the year the oils and
fuels were actually used.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently,
the right to claim refund of the tax in ques­tion has prescribed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The effect of the lower court's decision would be to subject the
right to file a similar claim for refund with the Commissioner of Internal
Revenue to a prescriptive pe­riod of ten years as provided for in paragraph (2)
of Article 1144 of the Civil Code.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Considering that under Sec­tion <span style="">337
</span>of the Tax Code the taxpayer is required to keep his books and records
for only five years, the Commissioner will have no way of verifying with the
books and records of the taxpayer any claim filed after the fifth year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Cer­tainly, the legislators did not intend to
so handicap the Commissioner, for whose benefit the period of limitations was
obviously devised.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, public policy demands that tax adjustments be made as
early and expeditiously as possible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
rea­son is that it is on taxes that the government depends for its operation
and that any uncertainty or controversy on those matters will somehow impair
the smooth function­ing of the governmental machinery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lengthening, therefore, of the period of
limitations on refund from two to ten years would be adverse to public
policy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, when our legislators
codified our internal revenue laws in 1939 they intended to concentrate national
tax matters in the Tax Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For Us to
look elsewhere for provisions govern­ing taxes would be to veer away from such
legislative in­tent.</p>

<p class="BODY">In fine, when the tax sought to be refunded is illegal­ly or
erroneously collected, the period of prescription starts from the date the tax
was paid; but when the tax is legally collected, the prescriptive period
commences to run from the date of occurrence of the supervening cause which
gave rise to the right of refund.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
ruling in <u><span style="">Muller &amp; Phipps</span></u><span style=""> </span>is accordingly modified.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from is reversed, and the
petition for refund is dismissed on the ground of prescription.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">SO</span></b><span style=""> <b>ORDERED</b>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
