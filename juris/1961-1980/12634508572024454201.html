for relief from judgment in Civil Case No. 37757.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The matter is before <span class="GramE">Us</span>
on appeal from the order of denial.</p>

<p class="BODY">The proceedings which took place below are <span style="">as </span>follows:</p>

<p class="BODY"><st1:date year="1958" day="13" month="9">September 13, 1958</st1:date>
- Plaintiff filed a complaint for recovery of P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>

<p class="BODY"><st1:date year="1958" day="22" month="10">October 22, 1958</st1:date>

- Defendant moved ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> for extension of time
within which to file his answer to the complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY"><st1:date year="1958" day="8" month="11">November 8, 1958</st1:date>
- The Court issued an order denying plaintiff's motion for default, "there
being no showing that defendant has received a copy of the order of this Court
denying the motion to dismiss."</p>

<p class="BODY"><st1:date year="1958" day="12" month="11">November 12, 1958</st1:date>
- Defendant filed an answer.</p>

<p class="BODY"><st1:date year="1958" day="17" month="11">November 17, 1958</st1:date>
- Plaintiff filed an <u><span style="">ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span></span></u> motion for reconsideration praying that
the order of November 8 be set aside and another one be issued declaring
defendant in default.</p>

<p class="BODY"><st1:date year="1958" day="19" month="11">November 19, 1958</st1:date>
- The Court issued the following order:</p>

<blockquote>"Finding the reasons adduced by Attorney Ramon de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes to be well-taken, the Order of this Court of <span class="SpellE">Novemer</span> 8, 1958 is hereby reconsidered and set aside.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The defendant Segundo Fernandez is declared in default, it
appearing that he had filed an extension of time to file his answer on <st1:date year="1958" day="7" month="11">November <span style="">7, </span>1958</st1:date> which is 5 days after
the expiration of the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period required by
law and his answer filed on <st1:date year="1958" day="12" month="11">November
 12, 1958</st1:date>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><st1:date year="1959" day="22" month="1">January 22, 1959</st1:date>
- The court beard the case for plaintiff <u><span style="">ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span></span></u><span style=""> </span>and on the same date decided it, as fol­lows:</p>

<blockquote>"IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, this Court hereby renders judgment
condemning the herein defendant to pay the sum of P10,000.00, value of the pro­missory
note, plus interest at 6% per annum from the filing of this com­plaint and 10%
of the total amount due as attorney's fees and to pay the costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><st1:date year="1959" day="7" month="4">April <span style="">7, </span>1959</st1:date>
- Defendant filed with the trial court a verified petition for relief from
judgment, which plain­tiff opposed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
petition was denied on <st1:date year="1959" day="11" month="4">April 11, 1959</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Defendant seasonably appealed to the Court of Appeals, which
certified the case to <span class="GramE">Us</span> on the ground that the issues
involved are purely legal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's main point is that when <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
filed its motion for reconsideration <u>ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span></u>
on <st1:date year="1958" day="17" month="11">November 17, 1958</st1:date>,
appellant was not in default and hence was entitled to notice of said motion so
as to be able to oppose it and be heard on his opposition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rule 26, Section 6 (of the old Rules)
provided that "no motion shall be acted upon by the Court, without proof
of service of the notice thereof."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Appellee</span> answers this argument by
emphasizing the fact that appellant was actually in default by reason of his
failure to file his answer within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The following circumstances are
cited:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Summons was served on appellant
on <st1:date year="1958" day="20" month="9">September 20, 1958</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He filed his motion to dismiss eleven (11)
days later, or on <st1:date year="1958" day="1" month="10">October 1, 1958</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only four (4) days then remained of the
15-day period within which to answer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The four days started to run again on <st1:date year="1958" day="29" month="10">October 29, 1958</st1:date>, when appellant received copy of the
order denying his motion to dismiss, and expired on <st1:date year="1958" day="2" month="11">November 2, 1958</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Therefore, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> submits, appellant was
already in de­fault by five (5) days when he filed, on November 7, 1958, a
motion for extension of time within which to answer and when he did file his
answer on November 12.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such being the
case, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> continues, appellant was not entitled
to notice of the motion for reconsideration, for under Rule 27, Section 9 (old
Rules of Court) "no service of papers shall be necessary on a party in
default except when he files a motion to set aside the order of default, in
which event he is entitled to notice of all further proceedings."</p>

<p class="BODY">Technically appellant's position appears well-founded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">As </span>of
<st1:date year="1958" day="12" month="11">November 12, 1958</st1:date> when he
filed his answer, or even as of <st1:date year="1958" day="17" month="11">November
 17, 1958</st1:date>, when <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> filed its motion
for reconsideration, the effective order which defined the standing of
appellant was that of November 8 denying <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
motion to declare appellant in default.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In other words, by express court order appellant was not in default when
he filed his answer to the complaint on <st1:date year="1958" day="12" month="11">November 12, 1958</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">As </span>a matter of fact,
however, the ground on which that order was based was erroneous, and it was to <span style="">show </span>such
error that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> filed his motion for
reconsideration on <st1:date year="1958" day="17" month="11">November 17, 1958</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be sure, appel­lant had <span style="">a </span>right to
be heard on the matter, but such hear­ing would not alter the fact, which
appellant does not now dispute, that his answer was really filed late.</p>

<p class="BODY">In any event, this being an appeal from an order denying relief
from judgment, it is pertinent to inquire whether or not appellant has a
meritorious defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This <span style="">is </span>the
reason why the Rules require that a petition for such relief be accompanied by
an affidavit of merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have examined
appellant's answer to the complaint and found that the only defense alleged
therein which has any relevance is that of prescription; but then the answer
itself shows that the defense is untenable, for it admits that appellant
received from <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> written demands for payment
before the prescriptive period of ten years expired, and according to Article
1155 of the Civil Code prescription of actions is interrupted when there is a
written extra­judicial demand by the creditor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We therefore see no point in granting the <span class="SpellE">reliefs</span>
sought by appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the order appealed from is affirmed, with
costs.</p>
