				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> of the
resolution dated May 28, 1973 of the Workmen's Compensation Commission <u>en

members affirming the decision dated January 2, 1970 of the Acting Referee of
the Regional Office No. 8 of the Department of Labor in <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
City, which decision awarded death and related benefits to <span class="SpellE">Eladio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Contratista</span> in the total amount of P12,196.80.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 17, 1968 <span class="SpellE">Eladio</span> <span class="SpellE">Contratista</span> (hereinafter referred to as the claimant) filed
with the Regional Office No. 4 of the Department of Labor in Manila a, notice
and claim for compensation against the <span class="SpellE">Artex</span>
Development Co., Inc. (hereinafter referred to as ARTEX) for the death of his
son Alexander who worked as a doffer at the textile mill of- ARTEX with a daily
wage of p6.40.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date month="8" day="13" year="1968">August 13, 1968</st1:date> the Acting Chief Referee of the
Regional Office No. 4 notified ARTEX of the claim and requested it to submit
its employer's report within ten days from receipt of the said notice: On <st1:date month="9" day="13" year="1968">September 13, 1968</st1:date>, ARTEX filed its report
wherein it admitted knowledge of Alexander's death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, the claimant requested the
trans­fer of the case to the Regional Office No. 8 of the Department of Labor
in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that at about four o'clock in the afternoon of July 10,
1968, Alexander, with <span class="SpellE">Cristobal</span> <span class="SpellE">Contratista</span>
(a co-employee), repaired to the store-boarding house managed by <span class="SpellE">Anastacia</span> Albino (mother of the personnel manager of ARTEX)
inside the ARTEX compound at Barrio <span class="SpellE">Panghulo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inside the store-boarding house, <span class="SpellE">Gervacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Antojado</span>, one of <span class="SpellE">Anastacia's</span> helpers, stabbed Alexander.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Shortly thereafter, members of the <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span> Police Department, called by <span class="SpellE">Anastacia</span>,
arrived and arrested Alexander.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Three of
them brought Alexander to the municipal hall, but before reaching the said hall
he died.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Acting Referee, in a
decision dated </span><st1:date year="1970" day="2" month="1"><span style="">January 2, 1970</span></st1:date><span style="">, declared the death of Alexander compensable
under the provisions of the Workmen's Compensation </span>Act, as amended, and
awarded death and related benefits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
motion for reconsideration tiled by ARTEX on the ground that the findings
therein contradicted the <span style="">evidence
presented by the claimant, including the NBI certificate on the post-mortem
examination of Alexander, the Acting Referee, in an order dated </span><st1:date month="2" day="24" year="1970"><span style="">February
 24, 1970</span></st1:date><span style="">, set aside
the said decision and reopened the case for reception of <span class="SpellE">ARTEX's</span>
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the date set for the
reception of its evidence, ARTEX omitted to do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the Acting Referee, in a
resolution dated </span><st1:date month="9" day="2" year="1970"><span style="">September 2, 1970</span></st1:date><span style="">, set aside the order dated </span><st1:date month="2" day="24" year="1970"><span style="">February

the decision dated </span><st1:date month="1" day="2" year="1970"><span style="">January 2, 1970</span></st1:date><span style="">, and denied <span class="SpellE">ARTEX's</span>
motion for reconsideration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After referral of the decision of the Acting Referee to the
Workmen's Compensation Commission for review, Associate Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> I.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Sagmit</span>, in a decision dated <st1:date month="2" day="14" year="1973">February 14, 1973</st1:date>, affirmed the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>ARTEX then, in a two-page motion, sought
reconsideration by the Commission en banc of the decision of Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Sagtit</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>ARTEX
insisted on the non-compensability of Alexander's death, attaching to its
motion a <span class="SpellE">photostatic</span> copy of the report of the <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span> Police Department dated <st1:date year="1968" day="13" month="7">July 13, 1968</st1:date> regarding he circumstances
resulting in Alexander's death.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Subsequently, the

dated </span><st1:date month="2" day="14" year="1973"><span style="">February 14, 1973</span></st1:date><span style=""> of Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Sagmit</span> and absolved ARTEX
from liability.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the present recourse.</p>

<p class="NUM"><u>1</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the outset,
ARTEX points out that the claimant failed to file any notice of appeal with the
Workmen's Compensation Commission as required by section 1 of Rule 43 of the
Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>ARTEX contends that the
failure of the claimant to comply with this requirement rendered the decision
sought to be reviewed final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This, then, according to ARTEX, precludes
this Court from taking cognizance of the case at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">This contention is without merit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In <u>Vargas vs. Philippine American Embroideries </u><u><span style="">Inc.</span></u><span style="">,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">this
</span><span style="">Court, resolving the same
jurisdictional problem, ruled that<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"there is a difference in phraseology between ...section [<span style="">1] </span>of Rule 44 of the former Rules of
Court and section 1 of Rule 43 of the present Rules, and this difference is by
no means an inconsequential one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
while the former <u>explicitly required</u> a notice of appeal for the <u>perfection</u>
of the appeal, the latter does not say so.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, that a new perspective regarding the filing of the notice of
appeal has been intro­duced is reflected in section 2 of Rule 43 of the present
Rules which, while requiring the fact of the date of the filing on time of the
petition for review to be stated on its face, does not demand that the same
statement be made with respect to the fact of filing of the notice of
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The point clearly suggested then
is that the filing of the notice of appeal is no longer compulsory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, were the filing of the notice of
appeal an indispensable act, then the present Rules would have simply said so
in the same manner that they do with regard to the petition for review."</blockquote>

<p class="NUM"><u>2</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The claimant
points out that ARTEX failed to controvert his right to compensation within the
period fixed by section 45<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>of the Workmen's Compensation Act, as
amended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He alleges that although ARTEX
knew of Alexander's death, it filed the prescribed form of <span class="SpellE">controversion</span>
notice (the employer's report) only on September 13, 1968, sixty-five (65) days
after it acquired knowledge of the decedent's death, and after the Acting Chief
Referee of the Regional Office No. 4 had notified it of his claim and required
it to submit the said report.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The failure of ARTEX to
seasonably controvert the right of the claimant to compensation was brushed
aside by the Commission <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> as "an issue of secondary
importance." The</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">Commission completely overlooked the
significant consequence of such omission on the part of ARTEX.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, section 45 of the Workmen's
Compensation Act, as amended, explicit in its terms, states that failure of the
employer to comply with the <span class="SpellE">controversion</span>
requirement, in the form prescribed and within the period provided, "shall
constitute a renunciation of his right to controvert the claim."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">Guilty

<p class="BODY">True it is that the Acting Chief Referee of the Regional.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Office No. 4 required ARTEX to submit its
employer's report, the Acting Referee of the Regional Office No. 8 heard the
case on the merits and scheduled a hearing purposely for reception of <span class="SpellE">ARTEX's</span> evidence, and the Commission en banc admitted in
evidence the <span class="SpellE">photostatic</span> copy of the report of the <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span> Police Department ARTEX submitted to it as an annex

in the manner prescribed by section 45 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, as
amended, and section 3 of Rule 8 of the Rules of the Workmen's Compensation
Commission, ARTEX nevertheless failed to do so.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM"><u>3</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The claimant
assails as erroneous the admission in evidence by the Commission <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>
of the <span class="SpellE">photostatic</span> copy of the report of the <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span> Police Department submitted in the compensation
proceedings for the first time by ARTEX as an annex to its motion when it
sought reconsideration by the Commission <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> of the decision
of Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Sagmit</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The claimant<span style=""> </span><span style="">points </span>out <span style="">ARTEX never formally offered the copy of the
police report in evidence during the hearing of the case on its merits nor
during the hearing scheduled, after the reopening of the case by the Acting
Referee of the Regional Office No. 8 at the instance of the said ARTEX,
specifically for reception of its evidence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span>These omissions notwithstanding, the claimant avers, the
Commission en banc considered the copy of the police report and predicated its
factual findings solely on the basis thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its questioned resolution, the Commission <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>
categorically names Alexander as the "assailant" and <span class="SpellE">Anastacia</span> and <span class="SpellE">Gervacio</span> as the
"victims" in the stabbing incident inside the ARTEX compound.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It states that three members of the <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span> Police Department "arrested" Alexander,
then under custody of the ARTEX security guard, and brought him to the police
headquarters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It relates that along <st1:street><st1:address>M.H.
  del <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span> street</st1:address></st1:street>, on the
way to the police headquarters, Alexander "assaulted the policemen and it
was at this time that after several attempts to stop him from further assault
/failed7, Alexander <span class="SpellE">Contratista</span> was fired upon by
Patrolman Bautista causing him to fall and die on the spot." The
Commission <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> then concludes that "when Alexander <span class="SpellE">Contratista</span> died, he was not in the course of his
employment nor can his death be attributed to a factor or cause incidental to
his employment or an off-shoot of the same."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Workmen's Compensation
Commission enjoys ample discretion in the conduct of compensation pro­ceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, section 1 of Rule 10 of its Rules</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">frees

Commis­sion in its procedural operations in no way includes the license to
capriciously disregard substantial, nay essential, evidentiary rules designed
to insure an irreducible minimum of fair play.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Among these rules is that which dictates that all parties must be fully
apprised of the evidence submitted for consi­deration and <span style="">must </span>be afforded opportunity to object
to the evidence adduced or to proffer evidence in explanation or rebuttal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar, the Commission <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>
admitted and thereafter considered the <span class="SpellE">photostatic</span>
copy of the report of the <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span> Police Department
(submitted to it by <span style="">ARTEX </span>as an
annex to its motion for reconsideration of the deci­sion of Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Sagmit</span>) without according the claimant any opportunity at
all to object to it or to present evidence in explanation or rebuttal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Conse­quently, the submitted copy of the

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Acting Referee

 2, 1970</span></st1:date><span style="">, revived his
decision in favor of the claimant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Sagmit</span> rendered his decision affirming that of the Acting
Referee on </span><st1:date month="2" day="14" year="1973"><span style="">February 14, 1973</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>ARTEX sought reconsideration by the Commission en banc of Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Sagmit's</span> decision </span>on <st1:date month="3" day="9" year="1973">March 9, 1973</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
its motion for reconsideration ARTEX attached a <span class="SpellE">photostatic</span>
copy of the police report involved herein.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Significantly, ARTEX
presented the copy of the police report as evidence only <u>after the lapse of
more than three (3) years</u> after the Acting Referee had rendered his
decision, and after Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Sagmit</span> had rendered
his.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It seems rather strange that ARTEX,
despite the opportunity afforded it when the Acting Referee reopened the case
and despite the long intervening period from January 2, 1970 (when the Acting
Referee rendered his decision) to February 14, 1973 (when Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Sagmit</span> rendered his deci­sion) failed or omitted to
seasonably submit in evidence the copy of the police report.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>True it is that the members of the <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span> Police Department who executed or prepared the
police report could still be called to identify it, authenticate it, and
testify </span>on <span style="">the circumstances
attendant to its execution or prepara­tion as well as on the contents thereof,
but could such testimony, particularly with reference to the contents of the
said report, be at all reliable, considering that no factor more strongly tends
to obscure memory than the lapse of time?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Moreover, ARTEX offers no
explanation whatsoever for its delay in presenting the copy of the police
report.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It merely attached a <span class="SpellE">photostatic</span> copy of the said report to its motion for
reconsideration of Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Sagmit's</span>
decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Could it not then be that
ARTEX presented the copy of the report as a mere afterthought, expectant that
the same might sway the Commission en band in its favor?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">More, the verity of the
factual recitals in the police report is open to serious doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The report pinpoints Alexander as the
"assailant" not only of <span class="SpellE">Gervacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Antojado</span> but also of the three members of the <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span> Police Department who were taking him to the police
headquarters. Alexander's assault on the policemen, according to the report,
prompted the </span>said policemen to shoot him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the circumstances, would an unarmed and
wounded man <span style="">risk </span>his life by
challenging the combined armed might of three policemen?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, even assuming that Alexander
"assaulted" the three policemen, could it be said that in shooting
him they employed reasonable means to repel Alexander's
"assault"?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The policemen could
<span style="">have easily overwhelmed Alexander
without resort to unjustified violence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The facts that a member
of the <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span> Police Department conducted the
inquiry into the circums­tances attendant to Alexander's death and that he
likewise prepared the police report strongly suggest a disposition, in the
reporting, in favor of his colleagues in the service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, as aptly observed by Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Sagmit</span> ?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Nothing is more natural than for the police investigators,
under a mis­guided <u>esprit de corps</u>, to shield their own co-policemen
from a report that would indict them for the crime of homicide, if not
cold-blooded murder of a 'suspect' who <span style="">was
a plain nobody and a </span>transient <span style="">in
<span class="SpellE">Malabon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under
the circumstances, it was not difficult for the 'killer' policemen to concoct a
story to justify their felony considering that /Alexander </span>7 <span style="">was alone and unarmed against three armed
policemen of the so-called <span class="SpellE">Malabon's</span> finest x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">All these considerations
subject to grave doubt, to an immeasurable extent, the veracity of the account
in the police report regarding the circumstances surrounding Alexander's
death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, if the report reflected

policemen, there could have been no reason then for ARTEX to have delayed
presenting in evidence the said report.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

or an off-shoot of the same."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Of course, the Commission

the way to the said headquarters, not in or about the premises of ARTEX.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

that the Commission <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> predicated its factual findings <u>solely</u>
on the </span><span style="">basis </span><span style="">of the copy of the police report.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, as heretofore discussed, the copy of the
report </span>carries no probative value, considering all the highly suspicious
and dubious circumstances attendant to its preparation and submission, which
circumstances in effect negate the veracity of the factual recitals therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">There only remains, then, on record, the evidence presented at
the hearing before the Acting Referee.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The totality of this evidence establishes that at about <st1:time hour="16" minute="0">four o'clock</st1:time> in the afternoon of <st1:date month="7" day="10" year="1968">July 10, 1968</st1:date>, Alexander, with a
co-employee, repaired to the store-boarding house managed by <span class="SpellE">Anastacia</span> inside the ARTEX compound.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inside the store-boarding house, one of <span class="SpellE">Anastacia's</span> helpers stabbed Alexander. <span class="SpellE">Anastacia</span>
sought help from the <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span> Police Department.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the three policemen arrived, they took
Alexander, instead of <span class="SpellE">Anastacia's</span> helper who stabbed
him, into custody and brought him to the municipal hall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before reaching the said hall, Alexander
died.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">That Alexander wanted to
take refreshments to satisfy his thirst or to relieve his hunger may be
reasonably inferred from the fact that he repaired </span>to the store-boarding
house inside the ARTEX compound during walking hours.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>True it is that the act of taking
refreshments constitutes more a personal act rather than an act of
service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This notwithstanding, <span style="">an act and other acts of an employee
necessary to his life and comfort while at work as well as conducive to the
proper conduct of his work constitute acts related to his employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And any injury and the ensuing death
occurring while in the performance of such acts can be justifiably
characterized as compen­sable for having arisen out of and in the course of the
employment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, it matters none that Alexander's death
occurred on the way to the municipal hall or outside his place of employment.
For, Alexander's death resulted from a compensable injury he suffered within
his place of employment while he was engaged in an act related thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And even conceding as true that Alexander's
death resulted from the fatal wound he sustained when the policemen taking him
to the police headquarters shot him because he allegedly assaulted them, still
his death bears intimate connection with the original injury.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, without the original injury -- the stabbing
-- which <span style="">started the chain of
causation, Alexander's death at the hands of the policemen would not have
resulted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">SEPARATE CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">TEEHANKEE, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I concur.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Aside from the
respondent-employer's failure to seasonably controvert the claim and the
consequent waiver of all jurisdictional defenses, it seems clear that the chain
of tragic events resulting in the death of petitioner's son, Alexander <span class="SpellE">Contratista</span>, arose out of and in the course of Alexander's
employ­ment during working hours and has therefore been properly held to be
compensable.</p>

<p class="BODY">What is most disturbing in this <span class="GramE">case,</span>
however, are the highly questionable acts of the three policemen from the <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span> Police Department.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They had been summoned to the store-boarding house where the deceased
employee Alexander <span class="SpellE">Contratista</span> had been stabbed by a
store helper <span class="SpellE">Gervacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Antojado</span>,
and yet instead of taking custody of <span class="SpellE">Gervacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Antojado</span>, they arrested the stabbing victim Alexander and
were taking him to police headquarters in­stead of to the hospital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Worse, according to the police report itself,
on the way to the police headquarters Alexander allegedly "assaulted the
policemen and it was at this time that after several attempts to stop him from
further assault [failed], Alexander <span class="SpellE">Con­tratista</span> was
fired upon by Patrolman Bautista, causing him to fall and die on the spot"
(at page 7, main opinion).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly,
under these circumstances the shooting to death of Alexander to stop his
alleged assaults could hardly be deemed justifiable.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, the Chief Justice plainly states in his main opinion that
"the verity of the factual recitals in the police report is open to
serious doubt" (at page 9) and cites Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Sagmit's</span>
rejection of the police report as a "concoction" to
"shield" the three policemen from "the crime of homicide, if not
cold-blooded murder of a 'suspect' who was a plain nobody and transient in <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span>" and "to justify their felony considering
that [Alexander] was alone and unarmed against three armed policemen of the
so-called <span class="SpellE">Malabon's</span> finest x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>." (<span class="GramE">at</span> page 10).</p>

<p class="BODY">The uncalled for acts on the part of the three peace officers
who, having arrested and taken into their custody the very stabbing victim and
named him in their report as the "assailant" and the stabber as the
"victim", killed him on the spot in the course of taking him to
police headquarters instead of to the hospital are therefore properly referred
to the Department of Justice for proper investigation and prosecution as facts
may warrant.</p>
