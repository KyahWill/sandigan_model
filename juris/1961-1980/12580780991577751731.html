				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Plaintiffs brought this action before the Court of First Instance of
Manila to recover moral, compensatory, exemplary and corrective damages
in the amount of P94,000.00, exclusive of attorney's fees and expenses
of litigation.</p>
<p>Defendant, after denying some allegations contained in the
complaint, set up as a defense that the facts alleged therein, even if
true, do not constitute a valid cause of action.</p>
<p>After trial, the lower court, after finding that defendant had
carried on a love affair with one Lolita Pe, an unmarried woman, being
a married man himself, declared that defendant cannot be held liable
for moral damages it appearing that plaintiffs failed to prove that
defendant, being aware of his marital status, deliberately and in bad
faith tried to win Lolita's affection. So it rendered decision
dismissing the complaint.</p>
<p>Plaintiffs brought this case on appeal before this Court on the ground that the issues involved are purely of law.</p>
<p>The facts as found by the trial court are: Plaintiffs are the
parents, brothers and sisters of one Lolita Pe. At the time of her
disappearance on April 14, 1957, Lolita was 24 years old and unmarried.
Defendant is a married man and works as agent of the La Perla Cigar and
Cigarette Factory. He used to stay in the town of Gasan, Marinduque, in
connection with 'his aforesaid occupation. Lolita was staying with her
parents in the same town. Defendant was an adopted son of a Chinaman
named Pe Beco, a collateral relative of Lolita's father. Because of
such fact and the similarity in their family name, defendant became
close to the plaintiffs who regarded him as a member of their family.
Sometime in 1952, defendant frequented the house of Lolita on the
pretext that he wanted her to teach him how to pray the rosary. The two
eventually fell in love with each other and conducted clandestine
trysts not only in the town of Gasan but also in Boac where Lolita used
to teach in a barrio school. They exchanged love notes with each other
the contents of which reveal not only their infatuation for each other
but also the extent to which they had carried their relationship. The
rumors about their love affair reached the ears of Lolita's parents
sometime in 1955, and since then defendant was forbidden from going to
their house and from further seeing Lolita. The plaintiffs even filed
deportation proceedings against defendant who is a Chinese national.
The affair between defendant and Lolita continued nonetheless.</p>
<p>Sometime in April, 1957, Lolita was staying with her brothers and
sisters at their residence at 54-B Espana Extension, Quezon City. On
April 14, 1957, Lolita disappeared from said house. After she left, her
brothers And sisters checked up her things and found that Lolita's
clothes were gone. However, plaintiffs found a note on a crumpled piece
of paper inside Lolita's <em>aparador</em>. Said note, written on a
small slip of paper approximately 4" by 3" in size, was in a
handwriting recognized to be that of defendant. In English it reads:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Honey, suppose I leave here on Sunday night, and
that's 13th of this, month and we will have a date on the 14th, that's
Monday morning at 10 am.<br><br><table Â ="" align="center" border="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">Reply</div></td> <td valign="top"><div align="right"> <div align="right">Love"</div></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br></p></blockquote><p>The disappearance of Lolita was reported to the police authorities
and the NBI but up to the present there is no news or trace of her
whereabouts.</p>
<p>The present action is based on Article 21 of the new Civil Code which provides:</p><blockquote>
<blockquote>
  </blockquote><p>"Any person who wilfully causes loss or injury to
another in a manner which is contrary to morals, good customs or public
policy shall compensate the latter for the damage."</p><blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote><p>There is no doubt that the claim of plaintiffs for damages is based
on the fact that defendant, being a married man, carried on a love
affair with Lolita Pe thereby causing plaintiffs injury in a manner
contrary to morals, good customs and public policy. But in spite of the
fact that plaintiffs have clearly established that an illicit affair
was carried on between defendant and Lolita which caused great damage
to the name and reputation of plaintiffs who are her parents, brothers
and sisters, the trial court considered their complaint not actionable
for the reason that they failed to prove that defendant deliberately
and in bad faith tried to win Lolita's affection. </p><blockquote>
<p>Thus, the trial court said: "In the absence of proof on this point,
the court may not presume that it was the defendant who deliberately
induced such relationship. We cannot be unmindful of the uncertainties
and sometimes inexplicable mysteries of the human emotions. It is a
possibility that the defendant and Lolita simply fell in love with each
other, not only without any desire on their part, but also against
their better judgment and in full consciousness of the disastrous
consequences that such an affair would naturally bring on both, of
them. This is specially so with respect to Lolita, being an unmarried
woman, falling in love with defendant who is a married man."</p>
<p>We disagree with this view. The circumstances under which defendant
tried to win Lolita's affection cannot lead to any other conclusion
than that it was he who, thru an ingenious scheme or trickery, seduced
the latter to the extent of making her fall in love with him. This is
shown by the fact that defendant frequented the house of Lolita on the
pretext that he wanted her to teach him how to pray the rosary. Because
of the frequency of his visits to the latter's family who was allowed
free access because he was a collateral relative and was considered as
a member of her family, the two eventually fell in love with each other
and conducted clandestine love affairs not only in Gasan but in Boac
where Lolita used to teach in a barrio school. When the rumors about
their ilicit affair reached the knowledge of her parents, defendant was
forbidden from going to their house and even from seeing Lolita.
Plaintiffs even filed deportation proceedings against defendant who is
a Chinese national. Nevertheless, defendant continued his love affairs
with Lolita until she disappeared from the parental home. Indeed, no
other conclusion can be drawn from this chain of events than that
defendant not only deliberately, but through a clever strategy,
succeeded in winning the affection and love of Lolita to the extent of
having illicit relations with her. The wrong he has caused her and her
family is indeed immeasurable considering the fact that he is a married
man. Verily, he has committed an injury to Lolita's family in a manner
contrary to morals, good customs and public policy as contemplated in
Article 21 of the new Civil Code.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is reversed. Defendant is
hereby sentenced to pay the plaintiffs the sum of P5,000.00 as damages
and P2,500.00 as attorney's fees and expenses of litigation. Costa
against appellee.</p>
