  <p>
The object of this litigation is a parcel of land located in the barrio
of Sagana, municipality of Laur, province of Nueva Ecija. Angel
Baltazar filed therefor a homestead application which was approved by
the Director of Lands on August 14, 1940. Subsequently, on or April 1,
1941, he mortgaged the present and future improvements on said land to
Pastor Tolentino, for the sum of P1,500, with the understanding that if
the same were not paid, with interest thereon at the rate of 12% a
year, within six (6) years, Tolentino could elect, either to foreclose
the mortgage or to compel the debtor to execute a deed of absolute sale
of said improvements. After the death of Angel Baltazar in 1945, his
widow and children conveyed to his son Basilio Baltazar their rights
and interest in and to said land. Apparently relying upon this
conveyance, on August 28, 1946, Basilio Baltazar filed with the Bureau
of Lands a petition praying that the homestead application in his
father's name be cancelled, and that, in lieu thereof, his own
(Basilio's) application be admitted. This petition was soon granted.
Subsequently, Homestead Patent No. V-8832 was issued to Basilio
Balltazar, and upon the authority thereof, he secured, on October 23,
1951, Original Certificate of Title No. P-790 in his name.</p>
  <p>
On October 20, 1952, Tolentino instituted the present action against
the estate of Angel Baltazar, deceased, his son Basilio Baltazar, and
the Director of Lands, for the cancellation of said Original
Certificate of Title No. P-790, upon the ground that Basilio Baltazar
had secured it by fraud. The Director of Lands filed a cross-claim,
joining Tolentino in praying for the aforementioned relief. Basilio
Baltazar denied the allegation of fraud and maintained that Tolentino
had no cause of action except against the deceased, Angel Baltazar, and
that this is neither the proper action nor the proper court to settle
Tolentino's claim.</p>
  <p> Subsequently the complaint was amended by
including Monica Marcelo, the widow of Angel Baltazar, and their
children, Damiana, Mariano, Amando and John Doe, all surnamed Baltazar,
as defendants. Mariano and Amando filed an answer admitting some
allegations and denying other allegations of the amended complaint and
setting up a counterclaim. Although Monica Marcelo submitted herself to
the jurisdiction of the court by filing a motion to dismiss, which was
eventually denied, neither she nor her other children (Damiana and John
Doe Baltazar) appear to have answered the amended complaint.</p>
  <p>
In due course, the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija rendered a
decision holding that Basilio Baltazar had not been guilty of fraud in
securing the homestead patent and certificate of title in his name;
that the Director of Lands was estopped from imputing fraud to Basilio
Baltazar, it being the duty of said office to know that the land in
question had been originally applied for, not by Basilio Baltazar, but
by Angel Baltazar; that said land is no longer part of the public
domain, and, hence, beyond the jurisdiction and concern of said
officer, a patent and a certificate of title having already been issued
to Basilio Baltazar; that Tolentino has merely a money claim that
should be filed against the estate of the deceased, Angel Baltazar, and
does not warrant cancellation of Basilio Baltazar's patent and
certificate of title and consequently, dismissing plaintiff's
complaint, as well as the cross-claim of the Director of Lands, and
sentencing Tolentino to pay P1,000.00 to Basilio Baltazar "as damages
for attorney's fees", apart from the costs.</p>
  <p> Tolentino
appealed from, this decision. The Director of Lands, likewise, gave
notice of his intent to appeal therefrom and then asked that
Tolentino's record on appeal be considered as his (Director of Lands')
own record on appeal. Although this request had not been officially
approved by the court, the clerk thereof later notified the parties
that said record on appeal had been forwarded to the Court of Appeals
for purposes of the appeal taken by Tolentino and the Director of
Lands. Subsequently, however, the Court of Appeals excused the
Solicitor General from filing a brief on behalf of the Director of
Lands, upon the ground that his appeal had not been duly perfected.</p>
  <p>
After appropriate proceedings, the Court of Appeals affirmed the
decision of the Court of First Instance—except as to the P1,000.00
award of damages in favor of Basilio Baltazar—upon the ground that
Tolentino has no personality to bring the present action, the same
being, In effect, one for reversion under section 101 of Commonwealth
Act No. 141, which may be initiated only by the Solicitor General, and
the Director of Lands not having appealed from the decision of the
court of first instance; that an action for cancellation of a title
issued by virtue of a homestead patent should be instituted within one
(1) year from he issuance thereof, which had elapsed prior to the
commencement of this case; that section 105 of Commonwealth Act No. 141
does not prohibit the issuance of a patent in the name of one of the
heirs of the applicant for Homestead patent who died prior thereto;
that the instrument executed by Angel Baltazar in favor of Pastor
Tolentino seems to partake of the nature of a chattel mortgage; that as
such it is defective and cannot be registered owing to its failure, to
describe properly the improvements sought to be encumbered thereby;
that a homestead cannot become liable for the satisfaction of a debt
contracted within five (5) years from and after the date of issuance of
the corresponding patent; that the monetary obligation of Angel
Baltazar in, favor of Pastor Tolentino was contracted within said
period of time, and, hence, the homestead in question cannot be
annotated on Basilio Baltazar's certificate of title, even if it had
been issued in favor of the heirs of Angel Baltazar, for otherwise,
said mortgage would be an encumbrance upon the very homestead, and
would thus contravene the spirit of Commonwealth Act No. 141; that,
although there is a valid and subsisting obligation in favor of Pastor
Tolentino in the sum of P1,500,00, it is not proper to sentence the
heirs of Angel Baltazar to pay said amount, for the court did not know
whether the deceased had left sufficient properties to pay the
aforementioned, debt; and that Tolentino had brought this action in
good faith and, should not be sentenced, therefore to pay damages.</p>
  <p>  The case is now before us on plaintiff's petition for review by certiorari.</p>
  <p>  Section 118 of Commonwealth Act No. 141 reads:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"Except
in favor of the Government or any of its branches, units, or
institutions, or legally constituted banking corporations, lands
acquired under the free patent or homestead provisions shall not be
subject to encumbrance or alienation from the date of the approval of
the application and for a term of five years from and after the late of
issuance of the patent or grant, nor shall they become liable to the
satisfaction of any debt contracted prior to the expiration of said
period; but the improvements or crops on the land may be mortgaged or
pledged to qualified persons, associations, or corporations."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
Pursuant to this provision a land acquired by homestead patent may
neither be encumbered or alienated from the date of the approval of the
corresponding homestead application and for a period of five (5) years
liter the issuance of the patent, nor be held liable for any debt
contracted within such period of time. However, said section 118
explicitly permits the encumbrance, by mortgage or pledge, of the <i>improvements and crops</i>
on the land, without any limitation in point of time. Although the
parties to a contract may treat certain improvements and crops as
chattels, insofar as <i>they</i> are concerned, it is now settled in
this jurisdiction that, in general, and insofar as the public are
concerned, such improvements, if falling under the provisions of
Article 415 of the Civil Code of the Philippines, are immovable
property (Evangelista <i>vs</i>. Alto Surety &amp; Insurance Co., Inc., 103 Phil., 401; 55 Off. Gaz., [20] 3672; Manarag <i>vs</i>. Ofilada, 52 Off. Gaz., 3954; Republic vs. Ceniza, et al., 90 Phil., 5445; Leung Yee <i>vs</i>. Strong Machinery Co., 37 Phil., 644). As a consequence, a mortgage constituted on said <i>improvements</i> must be susceptible of registration as a <i>real estate</i> mortgage and of annotation on the certificate of title to the <i>land</i> of which they form part, although the <i>land</i> itself may <i>not</i>
be subject to said encumbrance, if the debt guaranteed thereby was
contracted within the period stated in said section 118 of Commonwealth
Act No. 141. Otherwise, the provision authorizing the mortgage of the
improvements would be defeated.</p>
  <p> The Court of Appeals held
that Tolentino had no personality to bring this action, and that it
could not order the cancellation of the certificate of title of Basilio
Baltazar because the only person who could apply for such relief, the
Director of Lands, had abandoned his appeal from the decision of the
court of first instance. However, the legal provision granting said
right exclusively to the Director of Lands affects plaintiff's cause of
action, not his personality to institute the present case. Moreover,
the Director of Lands did not abandon his appeal. The record shows that
he gave notice of his intention to appeal and asked that plaintiff's
record on appeal be considered as his own record on appeal. It is true
that this petition was not officially approved by the court. However,
it would appear that the Director of Lands had been led to believe the
contrary, for the clerk of court of Nueva Ecija notified the parties
that the record on appeal had been forwarded to the Court of Appeals
for purposes of the appeal taken by the plaintiff <i>and the Director of Lands</i>.
Although such belief was erroneous, and the appeal of such officer had
not been duly perfected, this condition was the result, evidently, not
of <i>intent</i> to abandon the appeal, but of <i>error or negligence</i> of the officer called upon to take the steps necessary therefor.</p>
  <p>
At any rate, even if Basilio Baltazar had not been guilty of fraud in
securing the homestead patent and the certificate of title in his
favor, it has been established that when plaintiff saw the children of
Angel Baltazar shortly after his death, they promised to pay his debt
in favor of Pastor Tolentino. In other words, Basilio Baltazar knew,
before he got said patent and the certificate of title, that the
present and future improvements of the land were subject to a valid and
subsisting mortgage in favor of Pastor Tolentino and acknowledged the
same. Hence, he must be deemed to have secured such patent and title
subject to a subsisting trust, insofar as plaintiff's mortgage is
concerned, and, under plaintiff's prayer for such relief as may be
deemed just and equitable, this action may be considered as one to
compel the defendant to execute the instrument necessary for the
registration of said mortgage and its annotation on plaintiff's
certificate of title.</p>
  <p> Wherefore, the decision appealed from
is hereby reversed, and another one shall be entered sentencing
defendant Basilio Baltazar to execute, within one (1) month from the
date on which this decision shall have become final, the corresponding
deed of mortgage of said improvements in favor of plaintiff Pastor
Tolentino and, should Basilio Baltazar fail to execute said deed of
mortgage within the aforementioned period, authorizing the Clerk of
Court of the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija to execute said
deed on behalf of Basilio Baltazar, with the same force and effect as
if he had personally signed it. Upon demand by the Register of Deeds of
Nueva Ecija, Basilio Baltazar shall moreover, surrender to him the
owner's duplicate of Original Certificate of Title No. P-790, for
annotation thereon of the mortgage thus constituted. Costs against
defendant Basilio Baltazar. It is so ordered.</p>
