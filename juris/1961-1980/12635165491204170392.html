AND THE DIRECTOR OF PATENTS, RESPONDENTS.
<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>FERNANDO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The dispute in this controversy centered around the right to use
the trademark KAYNEE.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner Lim <span class="SpellE">Kiah</span>, on <st1:date year="1957" day="5" month="4">April 5,
 1957</st1:date>, filed an application with the Philippines Patent Office to
register such a trademark allegedly being used by him on under­shirts, polo
shirts, T-shirts, pants, sporting wear and handkerchiefs, asserting further
that the date of its first use went back to <st1:date year="1957" day="7" month="1">January 7, 1957</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such an application was opposed by the <span class="SpellE">Kaynee</span>
Company, one of the respondents here, a <st1:state><st1:place>South Carolina</st1:place></st1:state>
corpo­ration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It claimed ownership by
virtue of a registration with the United States Patent Office on <st1:date year="1913" day="18" month="2">February 18, 1913</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was likewise alleged by it that it had
used the same in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
as far back as 1951, on goods similar to those being sold by the
applicant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its opposition likewise
stressed that such a trademark had by then became exceedingly popular in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
enjoying tremendous amount of goodwill arising from newspaper, radio and
television advertising as well as the high and superior quality of its
products.</p>

<p class="BODY">Both testimonial and documentary evidence were introduced before
the Philippines Patent Office.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent <span class="SpellE">Kaynee</span> Company adduced proof to the
effect that late in 1949 or early 1950, the <span class="SpellE">Aguinaldo's</span>
Department Store sold therein knitted shirts as well as polo shirts, cotton
sports shirts, swimming trunks and cotton pajamas coming from it and so
identified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was also testimony to
the effect that KAYNEE products were advertised in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The assertion as to such advertisement was
confirmed by one official of a public relations and management firm and another
from an advertising agency.</p>

<p class="BODY">The applicant testified on his own behalf asserting that as of
1957 he had started using such trademark on his products, the word in Chinese,
according to him, being equivalent to <u>fast</u> in English or <span class="SpellE"><u>mabilis</u></span> in <span class="SpellE">Tagalog</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He referred to the due investigation he made
before filing such application for registration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He ascertained that no one had previously
registered such trademark in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He spoke of his advertising his products in
at least two <st1:place>Manila</st1:place> newspapers and a weekly magazine.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Director of Patents concluded that from the facts of record
and the exhibits presented, the opposition by the <span class="SpellE">Kaynee</span>
Company was without merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It is clear from the testimony of the <span class="SpellE">Opposer's</span> witnesses that it had never used the trademark in
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
through its own initiative but because of <span class="SpellE">Aguinaldo's</span>
importation and retail activities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
does not appear of record that <span class="SpellE">Opposer</span> had a direct
hand in the introduction of the goods bearing its trademark into this country.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no distri­butorship agreement
between The <span class="SpellE">Kaynee</span> Company and <span class="SpellE">Aguinaldo's</span>,
or for that matter, any local outlet.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Neither has there been shown a license or dealership agreement, an
assignment, or any other document to prove that the <span class="SpellE">Opposer</span>
had authorized <span class="SpellE">Aguinaldo's</span> to market the KAYNEE goods
locally.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If ever the word <span style="">KAYNEE </span>has been known to exist in this
country, it is because of <span class="SpellE">Aguinaldo's</span> trade
activities and not those of the <span class="SpellE">Opposer</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is incumbent upon <span class="SpellE">Opposer</span>
not only to establish prior use of its mark but prior use thereof for goods
related to those of applicant as to be likely to result in purchaser's
ascribing to a common origin."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the prior <span style="">use should exist on the part of the <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span>
and </span>as in this case it had not done so, there being no showing either
that it authorized the <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Aguinaldo's</span></span><span style="">
Department Store to use its trademark, its opposition was dismissed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It did not result, however, in petitioner Lim <span class="SpellE">Kiah</span>
emerging as the victorious party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
noted in the aforesaid decision of the Director of Patents of <st1:date year="1965" day="22" month="2">February 22, 1965</st1:date>, "sufficient
grounds exist for the <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>
rejection of [<span style="">petitioner's]
</span>application." The <span style="">decision explained </span>why:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The <span class="SpellE">Opposer</span>
was able to prove that the Respondent-Applicant is not the owner of the
trademark KAYNEE.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under Rule 34 of the
Revised Rules of Practice in Trademark Cases, only the owner of a trademark may
apply for its regis­tration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has been
proven by the evidence for the <span class="SpellE">Opposer</span> that the
trademark KAYNEE had been advertised in newspapers as early as the year 1953 *
* * through <span class="SpellE">Aguinaldo's</span> advertising activities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From that and subsequent years it has been at
least known to <span style="">some </span>segment of the purchasing public that <span class="SpellE">Aguinaldo's</span>
was continuously using the trademark KAYNEE as among those sold in its
store.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under Section 4(d) of Republic
Act No. 166, a trademark shall not be <span class="SpellE">registrable</span> if
it consists of or comprises a mark which so resembles a mark registered in the
Philippines or a <u>mark or </u><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">tradename</span></u></span><u> previously used in Philippine by another
and not abandoned</u>, * * *.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot
be denied that in this particular case the word ‘another' used by the Statute
can refer to <span class="SpellE">Aguinaldo's</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
As to his authority to reject <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">parte</span></u></span> application for
registration, respondent Director of Patents relied on Englander v. Continental
Distilling Co.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of the above decision was worded thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"* * *, the opposition is dismissed for lack of [merit], but the
application of Lim <span class="SpellE">Kiah</span> is rejected <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">parte</span></u></span><span style="">."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Then came this petition for the review of the above decision of
the Director of Patents, likewise included as <span style="">respondent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner </span>Lim <span class="SpellE">Kiah</span> assigned three
alleged errors, namely, that he had presented evidence "clearly and fully
establishing his ownership" of the trademark, that no evidence existed to
support the ruling that the <span class="SpellE">Aguinaldo's</span> Department
Store had been using such a trademark, and that the construction fastened on
Section 4(d) of Republic Act No. 166 by respondent Director of Patents ignored
other relevant sections.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appeal cannot prosper.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The decision of the Director of Patents must be sustained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The errors assigned do not call for its
reversal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first two of the above errors are factual in character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is well-settled that we are precluded from
making such an inquiry as the finding of facts of the Director of Patents in
the absence of any showing that there was a grave abuse of dis­cretion is
binding on us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As set forth by Justice <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span> in Chung Te v. Ng <span class="SpellE">Kian</span>
<span class="SpellE">Giab</span>:<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
"The rule is that the findings of fact by the Director of Patents are
conclusive on the Supreme Court provided they are supported by substantial
evidence."</p>

<p class="BODY">That leaves only the third assigned error, petitioner main­taining
the view that when the Director of Patents relied on the explicit and literal
language of the appropriate section,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
to the effect that a trademark shall not be <span class="SpellE">registrable</span>
if it "consists of or comprises a mark or trade-name * * * previously used
in the Philippines by another and not abandoned," it ignored other
relevant provision which could have called for a different con­clusion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such an assertion flies in the face of the
explicit and categorical terminology of the act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is unequivocal in character and does not
call for any interpretation that may result in modify­ing or changing its meaning.</p>

<p class="BODY">As early as 1913, in <span class="SpellE">Lizarraga</span> <span class="SpellE">Hermanos</span> v. Yap <span class="SpellE">Tico</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
it was stressed that our first and fundamental duty is to apply the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Construction and interpretation come only
"after it has been demonstrated that application is impossible and in­adequate
without them." Such a principle has since then commended itself for
acceptance and has been invariably followed, especially so in not a few of our
recent decisions.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is apparent, therefore, why, as above noted, the appeal is
doomed to failure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision of the
Director of Patents is not only sound in law but also commendable for its
consonance with the appropriate ethical standard which by no means should be
excluded from the business world as an alien, if not a hostile, force.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While in the fierce, competitive jungle which
at times <span style="">constitutes the arena of
commercial transactions, shrewdness and ingenuity are at a premium, the law is
by no means called upon to yield invariably its nod of approval to schemes
frowned upon by the concept of fairness.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Here, petitioner engaged in manufacturing and selling the same kind </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">products would rely on a trademark, which undeniably was previously
registered abroad and which theretofore had been used and advertised
extensively by one of the leading department stores in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philip</span>pines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner would have the
Director of Patents believe reliance on what KAYNEE stands for as understood in
the language of his land, possibly even as a mark of ancestral piety, caused
him to make use of it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a solemn
avowal did not inevitably call for assent, considering that </span><span style="">such a trademark
had long stood for similar </span>products which undoubtedly were well-known
and patronized locally.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It did not
improve his standing at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter
of fact, without his so intending it, the legitimate suspicion did arise that
such a plea while perhaps a tribute to his ingenuity hardly seemed to betray
fidelity to fact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He ought to have been
aware then that both the administrative agencies and the Judiciary can be
trusted to possess enough discernment not to be taken in by so transparent a
verbal ploy.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">,</span><span style=""> the decision is affirmed, with costs against
petitioner Lim <span class="SpellE">Kiah</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
