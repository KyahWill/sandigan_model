				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petitioner commissioner of customs has filed the instant petition
either as an original action for <i>certiorari</i> or as an appeal via <i>certiorari</i>
by way of challenging the validity of the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals
dated April 23, 1971 and of its resolution of May 3, 1971 granting the pri­vate
respondent's petition in the case below<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
and ordering petitioner commissioner to release on P550,00.00 bond an alleged
no-dollar shipment of 37,042 cartons of fresh apples without the cor­responding
Central Bank release certificate.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court accepted the petition as an original action, requir­ing
an answer thereto which was filed in due course, and issued, as prayed for, the
order restraining until further orders the en­forcement and execution of the
tax court's question decision and resolution.</p>

<p class="BODY">The material facts are undisputed, having been stipulated and
documented in the proceedings below.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
tax court thus restated the facts in its decision (referring to herein
respondent importer as petitioner before it and to herein petitioner
commissioner as respondent before it):<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"(P)<span class="SpellE">etitioner</span> is a domestic corporation
duly organized and existing under and by virtue of the laws of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1970" day="22" month="12">December
 22, 1970</st1:date>, the vessel M/V '<st1:place><st1:placename>Mindanao</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Sea</st1:placetype></st1:place>' arrived at the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Port</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Manila</st1:placename></st1:place> carrying 37,042 cartons
of fresh apples consigned to herein petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After payment of the taxes and duties on the portion of the shipment
consisting of 10,000 car­tons of fresh apples, covered by Bills of Lading Nos.
PM-1, PM-2, PM-3 and PM-4, the necessary transfer permits were issued by the
Collector of Customs of Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Thile</span> this portion of the importation as being unloaded
from the carrying vessel and transported to the designated cold storage house,
the Collector of Cus­toms, on December 22, 1970, issued warrants of seizure and
de­tention (S.I. Nos. 11993 to 11996) ordering the seizure of a portion of the
goods already unloaded and their detention for allegedly having been imported
in violation of Central Bank Circulars Nos. 289, 294 and 295, in relation to
Section 2530 (f) of the Tariff and Customs Code 'pending termination of the
seizure proceedings hereof and/or until further orders.' <u>Before the entire
shipment could be unloaded, the Collector of Customs apparently changed his
mind and ordered that the goods already unloaded be returned to the vessel</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">"On <st1:date year="1970" day="23" month="12">December 23,
 1970</st1:date>, petitioner, through its broker, requested the discharge of
said articles from the carrying vessel and their delivery to it under
bond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was denied by the Col­lector
of Customs on the same day on the ground that 'the matter is under advisement
by the proper government authorities, and therefore, this Office regrets that
for the moment, it can not grant (its) request.' On appeal from this decision
of the Collector, the Commissioner, in his letter dated <st1:date year="1971" day="20" month="1">January 20, 1971</st1:date>, refused to render a decision
until the Collector shall have rendered a 'definite ruling on the matter.'</p>

<p class="BODY">"On <st1:date year="1971" day="22" month="1">January 22,
 1971</st1:date>, petitioner again requested the Col­lector of Customs to have
the goods discharged from the vessel and their delivery to it under bond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his letter of <st1:date year="1971" day="26" month="1">January 26, 1971</st1:date>, <u>the Collector denied the
request on the ground that the im­portation of said goods is prohibited under
Circulars Nos. 289, 294 and 295 of the Central Bank and are, therefore,
articles of prohibited importation under Section 102(k) of the Tariff and
Customs Code</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For convenience, the
pertinent portions of the said decision of the Collector are reproduced below.</p>

<blockquote>'The subject shipment, undoubtedly, belongs to a commodity
classification of merchandise the importation of which is prohibited under
Central Bank Circular Nos. 289, 294 and 295.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Since CB circulars form part of the Tariff and Customs Law (Sec. 3514,
R.A. 1937, as amended); the aforementioned importation may be considered
prohibited under Section 102 (k) of the Tariff and Customs Code.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"'In this connection, the pertinent provision of the Tariff
and Customs Code on the matter is quoted hereunder:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"Sec. 1207.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Jurisdiction
of Collector Over Articles of Prohibited Importation</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- ­Where articles are of prohibited
importation or subject to importation only upon conditions prescribed by law,
it shall be the duty of the Collector to exercise such jurisdiction in respect
thereto as will <u>prevent importation</u> or otherwise secure compliance with
all legal requirements.' (Underscoring supplied.)</p>

<blockquote>"Under this particular section, it is obvious, that where the
importation is prohibited, or subject to the conditions prescribed by law, the
Collector is duty bound to exercise two options - either to prevent the
importation of the cargo or require compliance with all the requirements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appearing that the latter alternative is
not feasible under the circumstances now prevailing, this Office is constrained
to enforce the former by not allowing the discharge of the shipment in
question.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"'In view of the foregoing, and in pursuance of the strict
policy of the Central Bank of the Philippines relative to the importation of
commodities of this nature, <u>the request of your client regarding the dis­charge
of the cargo from the vessel 'Mindanao Sea' is hereby denied</u>, thus,
rendering the request for an authority to release the same under bond
premature.'</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">"Respondent Commissioner of Customs, on appeal from said
decision of the Collector of Customs, sustained the decision of the latter in
an order dated <st1:date year="1971" day="29" month="1">January 29, 1971</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">"It will be noted that the principal issue raised in this
appeal is the decision of the Collector, sustained by respondent, to the effect
that the goods in question are articles of prohibited importation under Section
102(k) of the Tariff and Customs Code.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Since importation of such articles is prohibited, delivery thereof to
the importer can not be authorized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>For
this reason, the Collector took the necessary steps to prevent their entry or
impor­tation by authority of section 1207 of the Tariff and Customs Code by
ordering the portion of the goods previously unloaded returned to the carrying
vessel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The effect of this order is the
abandonment of the seizure proceedings which were started pre­viously by the
issuance of warrants of seizure and detention</u>." (pp. 46-50 CTA
record.)</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon respondent's filing on February 2, 1971 of its appeal with
the lower court from the customs commissioner's decision affirming that of the
Manila customs collector denying said res­pondent's request for the discharge
of the shipment of 37,042 cartons of fresh apples with a stated value of U. S.
$66,675.60 from the vessel M/V "Mindanao Sea" and their release to
res­pondent under bond, it renewed its move, through motion for a preliminary
injunction, for immediate discharge from the carry­ing vessel and release under
bond of the said shipment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The tax
court, per its resolution of <st1:date year="1971" day="16" month="2">February
 16, 1971</st1:date>, correctly denied respondent's motion, "for to do so
would be to prejudge the main issue raised in this appeal."</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent's motion for reconsideration of the denial order was
denied anew by the tax court per its resolution of February 26, 1971, wherein
expounding on its first resolution abjuring a pre­judgment of the main issue,
it ruled that "(S)<span class="SpellE">ince</span> articles of pro­hibited
importation are not subject to the right of redemption by the claimant or
owner,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
it is obvious that the motion of [respondent company] to have said goods
delivered to it pending final determination of its appeal is without merit, for
to do so would in effect be a declaration that the goods are not articles of
prohibited importation."</p>

<p class="BODY">On another urgent motion of respondent alleging malfunc­tioning
of the reefer machinery of the carrying vessel, however, the tax court per its
order of March 4, 1971, allowed the imme­diate discharge of the fruits and
their deposit in a customs bonded warehouse "under conditions as to
prevent or arrest spoilage or deterioration pending final determination of the
case on the merits." The fruits were thus deposited since <st1:date year="1971" day="19" month="3">March 19, 1971</st1:date><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
at the refrigerated storage compartments of the Ice &amp; Cold Storage
Corporation at Plaza Lawton, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the parties' submittal of their stipulation of facts and
respective memoranda, the tax court rendered its decision, wherein after
upholding its challenged jurisdiction over the case, it ruled that:</p>

<blockquote>"We are, therefore, of the opinion that the fresh apples in
question are not absolutely prohibit­ed to be imported into the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
under the aforesaid Circulars of the Central Bank, in relation to Section 102
of the Tariff and Customs Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However,
while said goods are not articles of prohibited impor­tation, <u>they may be
held liable for forfeiture for failure of petitioner to secure a release
certificate from the Central Bank, which liability may be deter­mined in an
appropriate seizure proceeding to be conducted by the Collector of Customs</u>,
pursuant to Sections 2301, et seq. of the Tariff and Customs Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the meantime, considering the perishable
nature of said goods, and in the interest both of petitioner and the
Government, the goods should be released to petitioner under bond to secure pay­ment
of the appraised value thereof in case they are finally declared forfeited in
favor of the Govern­ment."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">and rendered judgment as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, respondent is hereby ordered to release to
petitioner the 37,042 cartons of fresh apples in question, now deposited with
the Ice &amp; Cold Storage Corporation at Plaza Lawton, Manila, after
petitioner shall have filed a sufficient bond to guarantee payment of the
appraised value thereof."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The tax court thereafter issued its resolution of <st1:date year="1971" day="3" month="5">May 3, 1971</st1:date> for the immediate release
of the apples, on the basis of respondent's surety bond for P550,000.00
"to guarantee payment of the appraised value of said goods in case the
same are finally declared forfeited in favor of the Government." As
already stated, such release was enjoined by the Court's restraining order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to the hearing held on <st1:date year="1971" day="21" month="5">May 21, 1971</st1:date>, the par­ties filed on <st1:date year="1971" day="27" month="5">May 27, 1971</st1:date> their joint
manifestation to the effect that some of the apples had been found totally
rotten and the rest in various stages of deterioration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In respondent's last urgent motion of <st1:date year="1971" day="20" month="7">July 20, 1971</st1:date>, it prayed for
resolution of the case at bar "for the reason that the fresh fruits .. are
already in grave danger of totally deteriorating."</p>

<p class="NUM"><b>I.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b>The preliminary
issue of jurisdiction raised by petitioner may readily be disposed of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The tax court correctly overruled petitioner
commissioner's contention that his ruling denying release under bond of the
fresh apples partook of the nature of an interlocutory order "pending
seizure proceedings against said importation" which was not <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> to and could not be taken cognizance of by the
tax court, in this wise:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"(T)his is
not correct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is being appealed is
the decision declaring the articles in question as 'articles of prohibited
importation' and the order prohibiting entry thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is a final decision and is in no sense
an interlocutory order because it was not issued in connection with a pending
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As stated heretofore, and as shown
by the records of the case, the seizure proceeding which was at first started
by the Collector of Customs of Manila was discontinued, the Collector having
elected to prevent importation of said articles under Section 1207 of the
Tariff and Customs Code."</p>

<p class="BODY">The tax court properly maintained its jurisdiction over the case
which, as it pointed out, "precisely involves seizure, detention or
release of property belonging to [respondent company] consisting of fresh
apples imported from abroad, which property is under <u>detention </u>by [the
commissioner] who refuses to release the same to [respondent]." As
reaffirmed by the Court in the latest case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Señeres</u></span><u>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Frias</span>, L-32921-40, June 10, 1971</u>, in customs
cases, "(T)he collector's decision may be appealed to the commissioner of
customs, whose decision, <u>inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span></u>, in cases
involving <u>seizure, detention or release of property affected</u>, may in
turn be reviewed only by the Court of Tax Appeals under the <u>exclusive
appellate jurisdiction</u> conferred on said Court under section 7 of Republic
Act 1125."</p>

<p class="NUM"><b>II.</b><span style="">&nbsp; </span>We thus come to
grips with the linchpin issue:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>did the
tax court act within its authority and in accordance with the applicable law
and jurisprudence in ordering the release under bond of the questioned shipment
of fresh apples - admittedly imported on a "no dollar" basis -
notwithstanding the lack of the required Central Bank release certificate?</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner commissioner submits that since the importa­tion of
fresh apples and other goods similarly classified by the Central Bank as
non-essential consumer (NEC) products is prohibited under Central Bank
Circulars Nos. 289, 294 and 295, the questioned importation is considered a
prohibited importa­tion under Section 102 (k) of the Tariff and Customs Code,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
and he was but complying with his mandate under section 1207 of the same Code,
quoted <u>supra</u>, page 3, "to exercise such jurisdiction in respect
thereto <u>as will prevent importation</u>" by refusing to allow the
discharge of the said shipment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent importer in turn contends quite naturally that the tax
court "committed no error when it found that the imported fresh apples are
not absolutely prohibited importation and there­fore may be released to the
(importer) under bond."</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue reduces itself quite simply and essentially to whether
or not the fresh apples in question are "articles of pro­hibited
importation." If so, as the Court holds, then the tax court acted in
excess of its jurisdiction in overturning the cus­toms authorities' proper
exercise of their jurisdiction under section 1207 of the Customs Code, in <u>preventing
importation and refusing to allow the discharge of the shipment of apples,
which admittedly is not covered by the required Central Bank permit or release
certificate</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By the same token,
since the importation of said apples is banned under the cited Central Bank
circulars which have the force and effect of law, the tax court acted without
authority of law in ordering the commis­sioner to release the apples to the
importer under bond, for under the very section 2301 of the customs code
invoked by it, "<u>articles the importation of which is prohibited by law
shall not be released under bond</u>."<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The huge shipment of 37,042 cartons of fresh
apples, with a stated value of $66,675.60 and a total weight of about 671,942
kilos,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
is concededly one of fruits classified as NEC goods, the importation of which
is barred under Central Bank Circular No. 289 dated <st1:date year="1970" day="21" month="2">February 21, 1970</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
As for "no-dollar" imports, Central Bank Circular No. 247 dated July
21, 1967, after referring to previous circulars which required release
certificates from the Central Bank for certain "no-dollar"
importations, expressly enumerates the items which are exempt from the
requirement of such release certificates, e.g. personal effects in reasonable
quantities, gifts sent from abroad not ex­ceeding $100.00 unless there is
evidence of abuse in the use of the privilege, etc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Central Bank Circular No. 295, amending
Circular No. 294, promulgated on March 20 and 10, 1970, res­pectively,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
reiterates the exemption of the "no-dollar" imports covered by
Circular No. 247 from the release certifi­cate requirements, but imposes an
express ban on all other "no-dollar" imports, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"No-dollar imports not covered by Circular No. 247 shall not
be issued any release certifi­cates and shall be referred to the Central Bank
for official transmittal to the Bureau of Customs for appropriate seizure
proceedings.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Section 2 of said Circular No. 295,
however, provides certain conditions for the issuance of release certificates
for "n<u>o-dollar imports which arrived on or before </u><st1:date year="1970" day="21" month="2"><u>February 21, 1970</u></st1:date>", the
date that the floating rate system and foreign exchange restrict­ions were
instituted under Circular No. 289 of the same date.</p>

<p class="BODY">The customs authorities clearly acted then within their authority
and mandate under section 1207 of the customs code, quoted <u>supra</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
in "<u>preventing importation</u>" and entry of the shipment of
apples by not allowing its discharge from the carry­ing vessel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As noted by the Court in the recent case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Señeres</u></span>,<u> supra</u>, "When the goods are
challenged as being of prohibited importation and the collector questions the
legality of the impor­tation ... the law expressly imposes upon the collector
the obli­gation 'to exercise such jurisdiction in respect thereto as will
prevent importation.'" The second alternative granted by the cited section
to the port collector of "securing compliance with all legal
requirements" with respect to "articles subject to im­portation only
upon conditions prescribed by law" was patently not available, for under
the categorical terms of Circular No. 295 above quoted, no release certificate
could be issued for the apples in question and the questioned import could only
be "referred to the Central Bank for official transmittal to the Bureau of
Customs for appropriate seizure proceedings."</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The pertinent and applicable provisions of
the tariff and customs code quite indubitably prohibit the importation of the
apples in question as "<u>prohibited importations</u>" since their
importation is "<u>prohibited by law</u>" under section 102, while
sec­tion 1207, quoted, <u>supra</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
expressly enjoins the port collector "<u>to exercise such jurisdiction in
respect thereto as will prevent importation</u>." Sections 2301 et seq.
make the apples liable to seizure and detention; they may <u>not be released
under bond</u> since they are "<u>articles the importation of which is prohibited
by law</u>" but they may be subjected to forfeiture in the specific
appropriate cases provided in section 2530:</p>

"articles of prohibited importation" as envi­saged by section 102 of
the tariff and customs code has been long rejected by the settled doctrine and
jurisprudence of the Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
contention that to be deemed articles of prohibited importa­tion, the
questioned articles must partake of the same nature as those specifically
declared prohibited in said section 102 (formerly section 3 of the Philippine
Tariff Act of 1909) such as explosives, etc. was discarded by the Court in the <u>1959

prohibited by Section 3 of the Philippine Tariff Act of 1909, such as fire­arms
and explosives, obscene and subversive arti­cles, gambling outfits, falsely
marked gold and silver articles, adulterated foods, lottery tickets, opium and
opium pipes, and as gold bars do not fall under any of the enumeration, they
conclude that the aforementioned <span class="SpellE">codal</span> provision can

the Court, in upholding the penalty of forfeiture for such importations made
without the required Central Bank release certificates, stressed that
"since the importations in question were made without the necessary import
license issued by the Monetary Board pursuant to Circular No. 45 and the rel­ease
certificates issued by the Central Bank or its authorized agent bank in the
prescribed form pursuant to Circular No. 44, they fall within the class of
'merchandise of prohibited importa­tion' or merchandise 'the importation x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> of which is effected x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> contrary to law' that the
Commissioner of Customs may seize and order forfeited.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To sustain the appellant theory of the case
would render nugatory the aim and purpose of the law when it authorizes the
Central Bank to temporarily suspend or restrict the sale of foreign exchange
and subject all transactions in gold and foreign exchange to licensing during an
exchange crisis in order to protect the international reserve and to give the
Mone­tary Board and the Government time in which to take construct­ive measures
to combat such a crisis." The Court emphasized therein that "every
import of goods or merchandise requires an immediate or future demand for
foreign exchange" and that the Central Bank circulars in question
requiring its permit and release certificates for so-called
"no-dollar" imports were "measures taken to check the unregulated
flow of foreign exchange from the country and are within the powers of the
Monetary Board."</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(c)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Numerous cases thereafter have elevated the

the Court, through the Chief Justice, declared that "it is now well
settled that goods imported without the release certificates required in
Circulars Nos. 44 and 45 are 'merchandise of pro­hibited importation' as this
expression is used in said section No. 1363 (f).<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>

the Court, per Mr. Justice Castro, in reiterating the same doctrine, noted that

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The tax court thus failed to take note that
articles of prohibited importation under section 102 of the code are of two categories,
<span class="SpellE"><u>viz</u></span>, those which are <u>absolutely prohibited
or more commonly known as contraband</u>, such as explosives or prohibited
drugs, and other articles which are considered <u>qualifiedly prohibited</u>
referring to those which may be imported subject to certain res­trictions or
limitations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But as has been observed,
the legal effects of an unauthorized importation of <u>qualifiedly prohibited</u>
articles are the same as those of an importation of <u>contraband</u>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"an article imported or attempted to be
imported in violation of regulations of the Central Bank is considered an
article of prohibited importation and is subject to forfeiture in like manner
as an article the importation of which is absolutely prohibited under Section
102 of the Tariff &amp; Customs Code."<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">None of the above-cited pertinent provisions of the tariff and
customs code requires that the questioned importation be of articles of <u>absolutely
prohibited </u>importation for the customs authorities to prevent their entry
or importation or enforce their seizure and forfeiture.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, it will be noted that even as to articles of <u>absolutely
prohibited </u>importation under section 102 of the code, e. g. explo­sives or
prohibited drugs, their limited importation is nevertheless permitted
"when authorized by law" in the case of dynamite and other
explosives, and by duly authorized persons "for medicinal purposes
only" in the case of prohibited drugs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The granting of limited importation of such absolutely prohibited articles
in the "exceptional circumstances" authorized by law (to use the tax
court's own phrase) no more nullifies the standing prohibition against their
importation than the release on December 1, 1970, cited by the tax court, of a
small shipment of 100 cartons of fresh apples with a dollar value of $897.50
and a total weight of 2,087 kilos)<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
to the Savoy Philippines Hotel would serve to annul the Central Bank's
subsisting ban against such so-called "no-dollar" imports; neither
may it be used as a lever to allow the release under bond of the present enormous
shipment of 37,042 cartons of apples.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">5.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The President's Executive Order No. 282,
dated <st1:date year="1971" day="4" month="1">January 4, 1971</st1:date>,
increasing the tariff duty on apples, as cited in the tax court's decision,
does not serve in law to bring down the barrier against the importation of
fresh apples as "no-dollar" imports under Circular No. 295.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is obvious that the increased tariff duty
thereby imposed on fresh apples would be applicable and collectible only on
lawful and valid importations thereof duly made in accordance with law, more
specifically, after full com­pliance with Central Bank requirements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this regard, the Court has taken note that
it is stated in the pertinent Central Bank circulars that "no-dollar
imports not covered by Circular No. 247, shall not be issued any release
certificates" (per Circular No. 295, quoted supra.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>)
Yet, respondent takes the Central Bank to task for having in some instances
disregarded "its own circulars by granting "prior specific
approvals" for banned "no-dollar imports" or by issuing release
certificates <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> as exceptions for "favored
parties", as in the Savoy Hotel impor­tation of fresh apples.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The clearance granted Savoy Hotel for the
small shipment of fresh apples may be readily justifiable as one having been
given to a tourist hotel as a dollar earner catering to the country's tourist
industry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But it might perhaps be desir­able
that the Central Bank spell out such exceptions and the cases where it will
grant "prior specific approvals" as against the stand­ing prohibition
for the guidance of all concerned, so that it may not be charged with acting
arbitrarily and without any definite set of rules and guidelines that assures
equal treatment and equal application of its circulars to all.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent importer in its answer at bar contends that since its
contract with the <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> supplier for the
importation of fresh apples was entered into since <u>March 26, 1969</u>, when
Central Bank Circulars 289, 294 and 295 had not yet been issued (the earliest
thereof instituting the floating rate system having been issued and taken
effect on February 21, 1970), that the alleged shipment thereof which arrived
at Manila <u>one year and seven months later on December 22, 1970</u> should
not be deemed covered by the Central Bank ban.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The tax court gave no credit to this contention, since the contract
presented covering assorted goods and foodstuffs with a total value of US
$2,288,977.00 called by its own terms for payment "by letters of credit
from the Phil­ippines or from other countries" and provided a "life or
term of contract" of "<u>six months period after signing of this
agreement</u>" <u>on May 22, 1969</u>, <u>within which</u> the importer
had to order the commodities and the supplier had to have the goods ordered
available.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
Clearly, the term of the alleged contract of <st1:date year="1969" day="26" month="5"><u>May 26, 1969</u></st1:date> had expired seven months thereafter by
the end of the year 1969.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">7.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The tax court in fact rejected the importer's
contention and ruled that while the apples "are not articles of prohibited
importation, <u>they may be held liable for forfeiture for failure of
petitioner to secure a release certificate from the Central Bank</u>, which
liability may be determined in an appropriate seizure pro­ceeding",
ordering in the meantime the release of the fruits to the importer under bond
in view of their "perishable nature."</p>

<p class="BODY">The tax court, however, incurred itself in contradiction in that
under our settled doctrine and jurisprudence, <u>supra</u>, goods imported
without the corresponding release certificates required by Central Bank
circulars are "articles of prohibited importation" as the term is
used in section 2530-f of the Customs Code (formerly section 1363-f of the
Revised Administrative Code), which subjects them to <u>forfeiture</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No Central Bank permit or release certificate
could be issued for the apples by virtue of the express ban against them in
Circular 295<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, they fell under the <u>explicit
prohibition</u><i> </i>in the proviso of the very sec­tion cited by the tax
court, <span class="SpellE">viz</span>, Section 2301, "<u>that articles the
importation of which is prohibited by law shall not be released under bond</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a><u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">8.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The tax court had noted at the beginning of
its decision that the customs authorities had opted to act under the authority
of section 1207 and <u>prevent the entry or importation of the ship­ment of apples
by refusing to allow its discharge from the carrying vessel</u>, thus
abandoning in effect the seizure proceedings started previously by the issuance
of warrants of seizure and de­tention.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
Respondent importer however did not take advantage thereof and instead insisted
on effecting entry and importation and on the unloading, storage and release
under bond of the fruits pending these proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the apples have deteriorated in storage,
the importer has only itself to fault for its wrongful insistence on the entry
and release of the shipment, notwithstand­ing its being prohibited and contrary
to law.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">9.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The case at bar presents a timely occasion
for the Court to clear certain past misconceptions and fallacies in regard to
the release under bond of seized or detained properties, "condi­tioned for
the payment of the appraised value of the article and/or any fine, expenses and
costs which may be adjudged in the case", as provided in section 2301 of

<p class="BODY">It is utterly fallacious, therefore, when such banned goods are
nevertheless sought to be imported in violation of law, to assume that it is to
the interest of the Government, where the goods are perishable, to release them
to the importer under bond to secure payment of the appraised value thereof in
case they are finally declared forfeited in favor of the Government.</p>

<p class="BODY">For the code expressly prohibits the release under bond of such
articles of prohibited importation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Government expects no revenue from such banned articles, since they are not
allowed to be imported.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, the
law's prohibition would be ren­dered totally nugatory, since such banned
articles, which are mostly luxury items, are in great demand and command
sky-high prices assuring great profit to the smuggler.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The smuggler would have the greatest profit
motive to wreak havoc upon our currency by purchasing dollars at the highest
black market rates to purchase and bring in these high-profit luxury
items.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Should he succeed in smuggling
them in, his venture is a complete success.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If he is caught, then all he has to do is put up a bond for the release
of the goods "to secure payment of the appraised value thereof" to the
Government, and he can still realize a substantial profit from the sale of the
banned goods thus released to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All
the measures designed by the Central Bank to strengthen and stabilize our peso
and to check the unregulated flow of foreign exchange from the country with the
ultimate end of setting aright the country's economy and financial position

1970, <u>supra</u>, declar­ing that "<u>all importations seized and
forfeited for violation of Central Bank circulars shall not be allowed to be

Such an outright ban on release of seized goods in accordance with the law's
