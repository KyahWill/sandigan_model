<p class="BODY">In the companion case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Ampil</u></span>, <u>supra</u>,
pursuant to a similar so-called motion for partial execution thereafter filed
by Perez and his son, <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span>, with the domestic
court in February, 1967, said court issued an order requiring <span class="SpellE">Ampil</span> as the former lawyer of Angela to surrender three
titles ceded to them by Angela in the compromise agreement, notwithstand­ing <span class="SpellE">Ampil's</span> asserted attorney's retaining lien over the said
certificates of title.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court
therefore issued at <span class="SpellE">Ampil's</span> instance a writ of <i>certiorari</i>
and set aside the domestic court's order disregarding <span class="SpellE">Ampil's</span>
asserted lien over the titles and ruled on the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
of the compromise agreement likewise invoked in the case at bar, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondents' argument that the compro­mise
agreement was executed since May 2, 1958, over eight years before petitioner's
discharge as Angela's counsel and that petitioner as Angela's counsel pursued
interests adverse to them and 'sought to obtain the discharge of the compromise
agreement' (which, in fact, petitioner successfully blocked until his discharge
as counsel) -- implying thereby that petitioner should be held bound by said
com­promise agreement -- does not change the legal picture.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be remembered that the said
compromise agreement was executed by one Roberto Della Rosa as Angela's
attorney-in-fact to settle Civil Case 34626 in the Manila court of first
instance; that one of Angela's grounds in denouncing the same was that it was
not freely or validly entered into by her represen­tative; and that this Court,
speaking through Mr. Jus­tice <span style="">Reyes, </span>rejected
respondents' contention that the Manila court should have held that Angela was
in <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>, by the execution and submittal of the
com­promise agreement, to question the jurisdiction of said court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Subsequently, when the same compromise agreement was sought
to be <span style="">submitted </span>by<span style=""> </span>respondents in the proceedings below
for the limited objective of seeking respondent court's approval thereof, said
court dismissed the proceedings on the ground of lack of jurisdiction over the
subject-matter, since Civil Case No. 34626 of the Manila court which was
presumably to be settled amicably by the compromise agreement was dismissed by
final decision of that court as affirmed by this Court and 'there was no more
case to be settled by compromise.'"</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The only question then appealed to this Court <span style="">in the </span>second case, No. 19711, was the
correctness of <span style="">respondent court's order
of</span><span style=""> dismissal; </span>if the <span style="">same </span>was set aside, the case would be
remanded to respondent court for trial and hearing on the myriad built-in
issues.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When pending said appeal and
after petitioner's discharge, the same compromise agree<span style="">ment (of dismissed Civil Case No. 34626) was
submitted <u>anew</u> in <u>November</u>, <u>1966</u>, to this Court by her <u>new</u>
attorney-in-fact, assisted by <u>new</u> counsel, </span><span style="">manifesting <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>
that Angela '<u>now</u> confirms the (said) compromise agreement', the picture
that clearly emerges is that in legal contemplation, Angela and respondents <span class="SpellE">Perezes</span> has <u>then</u> executed a <u>new</u> <u>agreement</u>
for the transfer of her said proper­ties to respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The transfer </span><span style="">of said properties to respondents could in
no way be deemed to retroact to over 8 years back on May 2, 1958, when the com­promise
agreement was <u>originally</u> executed, presumably to settle Case No. 34626
which was eventually dismissed in 1960 for lack of jurisdiction of the Ma­nila
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The transfer of the said
properties as provided in the compromise agreement as <u>now</u> con­firmed in <u>November</u>,
<u>1966</u> by Angela and approved by this Court in its Resolution of </span><st1:date month="11" day="17" year="1966"><span style="">November 17, 1966</span></st1:date><span style=""> was effective
only as of this much later date.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"There
can be no question, then, that these properties were <u>exclusively</u>
Angela's prior to <u>Nov­ember, 1966</u> and that respondents could lay no
claim thereto by virtue of the transfers provided in the compromise agreement
until after its confirmation by Angela and approval in <u>November</u>, <u>1966</u>;
and that respondents' contention that petitioner could not exercise his
retaining lien over the titles which had properly come into his possession
during his </span><span style="">engage­</span><span style="">ment as Angela's counsel long before November, 1966 is untenable."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

of the dismissal order was dismissed by this Court's resolution of June 26,

the compromise agreement, as between the parties to the agreement themselves,
it cannot resolve a controversy regarding the title to some of the properties
covered by the said compromise agreement between a third person and one of the
parties or both parties to the compromise contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">The dis­missal of the
complaint filed by <span class="SpellE">Monserrat</span> Enterprises, Co., Inc.
before the Supreme Court in G.R. No.</span> L-27171 cannot be construed as a
ruling against the merits of said company's claim."</p>

<p class="BODY">If further properly ruled that "(I<span class="GramE">)n</span>
synthesis, therefore, we have a situation where a person (TUASON) has
previously sold his property to a second party (MONSERRAT).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the person had been declared an
incompetent, the guardianship court approved the transfer of the <span style="">same </span>property to a third party
(PEREZ).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because of the conflict of
rights between the second party, on one hand, and the estate of the incompetent
and the third party, on the other hand" the situation should be properly
resolved in an independent action filed with the regular court of competent
jurisdiction since it has no juris­diction as a guardianship court to determine
the ownership of property claimed to belong to the incompetent but likewise
claimed by a stranger, and that "(T)he transfer to the third party,
approved by the guardianship Court, should be construed only as a transfer of
whatever rights the incompetent may have in the property."</p>

compromise agreement appearing in <span class="SpellE">Monserrat's</span> five

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Perez' contention that

</span>As clearly stated in this Court's Resolution of November 17, 1966 in
Case L-19711, the Court approved the compromise agreement on Angela's
manifestation through her daughter, Angela Perez de Staley, that she "<u>now</u>
<span style="">confirms </span>the compromise
agreement entered into by her husband and her son on May 2, 1958"<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
which was eight years after the original date of execution on May 2, 1958.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is self-evident that any transfer of her <span class="SpellE">paraphernal</span> properties which Angela might have executed
during the intervening period of eight years could not be and were not passed
upon by this Court, all the more so, with regard to transfers that Angela might
have exe­cuted even before she executed the said compromise agreement <span style="">on </span>May 2, 1958 as appears to be the
case with the sales of the properties in question which she had personally
executed in favor of <span class="SpellE">Monserrat</span> since October 29,
1957.<span style="font-size: 11pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Perez' contention that
"<span class="SpellE">M<span style="">o</span>nserrat</span>
acquired the five titles referred to hereinabove subject to the notice of
compromise agreement which was annotated on all its new titles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Monserrat</span> is
therefore bound by the order of this Supreme Court approving said compromise
agreement"<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
is equally untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whe­ther <span class="SpellE">Monserrat's</span> purchase of the properties was effective as of
the date of the execution of the deeds in his favor on October 29, 1957 or only
after the registration thereof subsequent to the execution of the compromise
agreement on May 2, 1958 is a question that cannot be settled by a mere motion
before the guard­ianship court which has no jurisdiction over the subject
matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The domestic court's lack of
jurisdiction over the controversy is further made more evident by the
intervening rights of fourth parties, namely, the City of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
and four other vendees who had in the meantime purchased from <span class="SpellE">Monserrat</span> the five proper­ties free from any and all liens
and encumbrances and who hold clean titles thereto in their respective names.</p>

<p class="BODY">5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While petitioner is free
to file his independent action before the regular court of competent
jurisdiction with respect to his claim to the properties by virtue of the
compromise agreement, it would not be amiss to point out for the purpose of avoid­ing
future needless wasteful litigation that on the basis of the documents
submitted to this Court in the companion case of <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Ampil</span></u></span><u><span style=""> vs. <span class="SpellE">Agrava</span></span></u><span style="">, <u>supra</u>, </span>(where Perez was a
party respondent), this Court held therein that "(T)he transfer of said
properties to respondents could in no way be deemed to retroact to over 8 years
back on May 2, 1958, when the compromise agreement was <u><span style="">originally</span></u><span style=""> </span>executed, presumably to settle Case No. 34626 which was
eventually dismissed in 1960 for lack of jurisdiction of the Manila court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The transfer of the said properties as
provided in the compromise agreement as <u>now</u> confirmed in <u>November,
1966</u> by Angela and approved by this Court in its Resolution of <st1:date month="11" day="17" year="1966">November 17, 1966</st1:date> was effective only
as of this much later date." This finding of the Court would hold true and
equally apply to the present claims of Perez, absent any new material facts or
documents not submitted to the Court in the <span class="SpellE">Ampil</span>
case and in the case at bar that would radically alter the facts already of
record in all the related cases referred to herein and warrant a contrary
conclusion.</p>
