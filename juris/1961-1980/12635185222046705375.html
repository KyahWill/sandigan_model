				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1956" day="2" month="11">November 2, 1956</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> <span class="SpellE">Layug</span>, a customs
examiner at the <st1:place><st1:placename>Manila</st1:placename> <st1:placename>International</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Airport</st1:placetype></st1:place>, conducted the required
examination of cargoes that were to be shipped on a KLM plane.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He examined, among others, a package
supposedly containing only two <span class="SpellE">Minifons</span> (wire
recorders) consigned to a certain priest in <st1:place><st1:city>Rome</st1:city>,
 <st1:country-region><span style="">Italy</span></st1:country-region></st1:place><span style=""> </span>by the petitioner Manuel <span class="SpellE">Bastida</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He found
two cardboard boxes therein, each containing a <span class="SpellE">Minifon</span>,
and, upon opening one of them, found concealed at the bottom thereof, covered
by a piece <span style="">of cardboard, various
checks, money orders, and traveler’s checks - all payable in US dollars -
amounting to a total of $13,780.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the </span><span style="">other box, he </span><span style="">found, concealed in the same manner, two money orders in the total
amount of $3,149.50 and several US dollar bills of different denominations in
the total amount of $630.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Customs authorities seized the two cardboard boxes and all
the contents thereof, alleging violation of Section 1363(f) and (m)
sub-paragraphs 3 and 4, of the Revised administrative <span style="">Code,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> as well as Central Bank Circular 20 as
implemented by Circular 42</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> (in relation to Section 1363[f] of the same
Code) because although an Export Control Committee permit and Central Bank
export license covered the exportation of the <span class="SpellE">Minifons</span>,
the various checks, money orders and dollar bills were not covered by any
Central Bank license.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On June 25, 1957, due hearing having been had, the Collector of
Custom decreed the forfeiture of the two <span class="SpellE">Minifons</span> as
well as the checks, money orders and dollar bills in favor of the Government of
the Republic of the Philippines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
petitioner appealed to the Commissioner of Customs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pending resolution <span style="">by </span>the Commissioner of Customs of the petitioner's appeal, the
Central Bank, on <st1:date year="1962" day="21" month="1">January 21, 1962</st1:date>,
promulgated Circular 133 permit<span style="">ting</span><span style=""> any</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">person to buy US dollars
at the prevailing market rate and export the same without prior specific
licensing from the Central Bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
said circular furthermore repealed all previous circulars inconsistent
therewith.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, on<span style=""> </span><st1:date year="1962" day="22" month="3"><span style="">M</span>arch
 22, 1962</st1:date>, the Acting Commissioner of Customs affirmed the decision
of the Collector of Customs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his
appeal to the Court of Tax Appeals, the petitioner contended, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, that the bulk of the property seized consists
of checks <span style="">which are not subject to
forfeiture because they are not "merchandise" as contemplated by Sections
1363 and 1419 of the Revised Administrative Code, and that even assuming <span class="SpellE"><u>arguendo</u></span> that the properties seized fail within the
meaning of "merchandise" as defined by the said Code, their
forfeiture has become academic in view of the repeal of Central </span><span style="">B</span><span style="">ank
Circulars 20 and 42 by Circular 133.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Tax Appeals, on November 25, 1964, affirmed the
decision of the Acting Commissioner of Customs.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the present petition for review of the Tax Court's
decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">Tendered for resolution are the following issues: (1) Are the
checks and money orders payable in US dollars <span style="">and </span>the US dollar bills in question
"merchandise" within the purview of Section 1363 of the Revised<span style=""> </span>Administrative Code? (2) Did the petitioner
violate Central <span style="">B</span>ank Circular 20
as implemented by Circular 42? (3) On the assumption that the checks, money
orders and dollar bills are "merchandise," are they still subject to
forfeiture in view of the repeal of Central Bank Circulars 20 and 42?</p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the <u>first issue</u>,
it is to be noted that Section 1363(f) of the Revised Administrative Code,
under which the checks, <span style="">mo</span>ney
orders and dollar bills were ordered forfeited, specifically makes reference to
"merchandise." Section 1419 of the same Code defines
"merchandise" thus: "'Merchandise,' when used with <span style="">re</span>ference to importations or
exportations, includes goods, wares, and in general anything that may be made
the subject of importation or exportation."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner argues that the Revised
Administrative Code provides only a general and vague definition of
"merchandise," and that "'merchandise,' (actually) connotes some
<span style="">thing tangible, such as goods, wares,
commodities, as distinguished from intangibles, such as <span class="SpellE">choses</span>
in action, credits, rights, services."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The question whether the various dollar bills <span style="">in controversy fall
</span>within the proscription of Section 1363 of the Revised Administrative
Code, presents no special difficulty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">In <u>Com</u></span><u><span style="">missioner of Customs vs. Capistrano,</span></u><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>we held that US dollars, having
ceased to be legal tender in the Philippines, fall within the meaning of the
term "merchandise" as used in the Revised Administrative Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dollar bills in the case at bar are
therefore subject to forfeiture.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the checks, the petitioner forgets that as bills of
exchange they are, fundamentally, negotiable instruments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And a negotiable instrument "is more
like money than a contract right or chose in action."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>As such, it may be the "subject of
conversation (Knight vs. <span class="SpellE">Seney</span>, 290 Ill. 11) or a <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> (<span class="SpellE">Roth<span style="">well</span></span><span style=""> vs. </span>Taylor, 303 III.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>226)."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may also be the "subject of sale,
like any other goods or wares."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the Tax Court aptly observed, "checks
may be bought and sold like a commodity.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As a matter of fact in the United States the deposit of a check with a
bank is considered a sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Helvering</span> vs. Stein [CA 4],115 F 2d 468; <st1:city><st1:place>Burton</st1:place></st1:city>
vs. <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
196 <st1:country-region><st1:place>US</st1:place></st1:country-region> 283, 49
L ed 482)."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Money orders, also
considered as bills of exchange of limited negotiability, possess the same
attributes as other negotiable instruments.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, they may be bought and sold like checks.</p>

<p class="BODY">In addition, that part of the definition of
"merchandise" which states, "in general anything that may be
made the subject of importation or exportation," is sufficiently clear and
comprehensive to include checks and money orders.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the basis of the foregoing discussion, authorities cited, and
observations made, this Court holds that the checks, money orders and dollar
bills in question properly fall within the concept of "merchandise"
as this term is used in Section 1419 of Revised Administrative Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <u>second issue</u>
involves Central Bank Circulars 20 and 42.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Circular 20 requires prior licensing <span style="">by </span>the Central Bank of all transactions in foreign exchange,
while Circular 42 makes any person who causes the placing of foreign exchange
in any outgoing international carrier liable for the exportation thereof unless
he has obtained prior license from the Central Bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner argues that the attempted
exportation of the checks and money orders in question without prior license
from the Central Bank does not constitute a violation of the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> circulars because check and money orders are
not, and do not involve, foreign exchange.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This contention is directly and pointedly refuted by the Tax Court, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"The U.S. money orders and U.S checks in question directly in
involved foreign exchange whose flow the Central Bank, by fiat of law (Republic
Act No. 265), was empowered to regulate (see <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>
v. Commissioner Customs, G.R. No. L-10979, June <span style="">30, </span>1959) <span style="">in order to
protect the international reserve of the country.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The simple fact that the money orders and
checks were not legal tender or currency is of no mo­ment, for they represented
and were substitute for the currency bearing on their face."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The petitioner’s attempt to export the
checks, money orders and dollar bills without the requisite prior license
constituted an indubitable violation of Central Bank circulars 20 and 42.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Finally</u>, </span>the petitioner argues that in view of the
repeal of Circulars 20 and 42 by Circular 133, the possession and exportation
of dollars, without prior license from the Central Bank, <u>is</u> no longer
prohibited.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While this may be true in
the context of present day foreign exchange transactions, <span style="">we </span>nevertheless must recognize the
dual character of proceedings that could be instituted for violation of Central
Bank circulars 20 and 42, during the time that these were in <span style="">force, under the authority of Republic Act
265 (Central Bank Act).</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner loses sight of the fact that his attempt to export
the checks, money orders and dollar bills in question, in violation of the
aforementioned provisions of the Revised Admi<span style="">nistrative Code and Central Bank circulars, entailed two penalties: (a)
a penalty for violation of Circular 42, prescribed by </span><span style="">Sec</span><span style="">tion 8</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> of Circular 20 in relation to Section 34</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> of Republic Act 265, directed principally
against the person of the offender </span>and which<span style=""> may be imposed in a criminal prosecution (an action <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>personam</u></span>), and (b) a penalty of forfeiture imposed
by Section 1363(f) of the Revised Administrative Code directed primarily
against the merchandise rather than the offender (an action <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>rem</u></span>).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the repeal of Circulars 20 and <span style="">42 </span>by
Circular 133 did not have the effect of abating the forfeiture case instituted
against the petitioner, for the simple reason that the forfeiture proceedings
undertaken here are civil - not criminal - in nature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this sense, therefore, the repeal cannot
be given retroactive effect and cannot infuse the attribute of legality into
the <span style="">petitioner'</span>s<span style=""> </span>attempt to export the checks, money
orders and dollar bills in question.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, the petitioner overlooks or misinterprets the
provisions of Section 1363(m), sub-paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Revised
Administrative Code, which decree the forfeiture of any merchandise the
exportation of which is attempted <span style="">in any of the </span>following ways:</p>

<p class="BODY">“3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the wrongful
making by the owner, importer, exporter or consignee of any merchandise, or by
the agent of either, of any false declaration or affidavit, touching such
merchandise and in connection with the importation or exportation of the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">“4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the wrongful
making or delivery by the same person or persons, of a false invoice, letter or
paper touching such merchandise and in connection with the importation or exportation
of the same."</p>

<p class="BODY">The record conclusively shows that the petitioner made a false
declaration in his application for export license (exhibit D).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the said document, he mentioned only the
two <span class="SpellE">Minifons</span>, but omitted to declare the checks,
money orders and dollar bills.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
regards this point, the Tax Court especially noted the "total Silence of
petitioner on respondent's charge of false declaration under Section 1363(m) 3
and 4 of the Revised Administrative C<span style="">ode."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As to the <span class="SpellE">Minifons</span>, although they are
covered by a Central Bank export license, they are subject to forfeiture
because they were utilized by the petitioner as the means in his attempt to
export illegally the checks, money orders and dollar bills.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals
appealed from is affirmed, at petitioner's cost.</p>
