				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BARRERA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition to review the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals in 
C.T.A. case No. 313, denying petitioner's claim for refund of the sum of 
P1,782.72 alleged as illegally collected advanced sales tax on goods purchased 
by him from the United States Military Bases in the Philippines at Sangley 
Point, Clark Field, and Olongapo from 1954 to 1956.
<p>Petitioner is a merchant doing business under the name and style of St. 
Luke's Trading. On several occasions during the years 1954 to 1956, petitioner 
purchased through public auctions various articles from the United States 
military authorities in the military bases, removed the goods therefrom and 
subsequently sold the same to other third parties. On these transactions which 
were treated as importations, the respondent Collector of Internal Revenue, 
imposed and collected the advance sales tax in question, under the provisions of 
Section 183(B) of the National Internal Revenue Code, in relation to Sections 
184, 185 and 186 of the same Code.</p>
<p>It is the contention of the petitioner that he is not liable for the payment 
of said advance sales tax because it is argued, he is not an importer, not 
having engaged in the business of importation, and that there was no importation 
by him inasmuch as the goods "did not come to the country from a foreign 
country", Sangley Point, Clark Field, and Olongapo not being considered as 
foreign territory. Moreover, the petitioner claims that the sales to him by the 
U.S. authorities in these bases were the original sales mentioned in the law 
subject to the tax and, that therefore the subsequent sales by him were not 
taxable. And finally the petitioner maintains that before Republic Act No. 1612 
came into effect on August 24, 1956, purchasers of tax-free articles were not 
considered the importers thereof, and invoked in support of his contention the 
decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Collector of Internal Revenue, et 
al. vs. Marcelino Viduya, et al., 103 Phil., 93.</p>
<p>The issue herein raised is not new. It has already been settled contrary to 
the contention of petitioner, in a series of decisions of this Court in cases 
involving similar factual situations, wherein it was held in effect that goods 
and materials while in the army bases or installations in the Philippines are, 
in contemplation of law, on foreign soil (Saura Import &amp; Export Co. vs. 
Meer, 88 Phil., 199) that one who acquires title to surplus equipment found in 
U.S. Bases or installations within the Philippines by purchase, and then brings 
them out of those bases or depots, is an importer; that the bringing out of such 
goods and materials, after acquiring titles to such goods, is importation in the 
legal sense (A. Soriano &amp; Cia vs. Collector of Internal Revenue, 97 Phil., 
505) and that the said materials removed from these bases and depots were, for 
purposes of the internal revenue taxes, purchased or received from "outside the 
Philippines," (Bisaya Land Transportation Co. Inc. vs. Collector of Internal 
Revenue, G. R. No. L-12100, &amp; L-11812, May 29, 1959).</p>
<p>It is true that the areas covered by the United States Military Bases are not 
foreign territories both in the political and geographical sense. But because of 
the special arrangements regarding their status and the resulting legal 
relations and situations obtaining therein by reason of the Military Bases 
Agreement with the United States, this Court has ruled, for the purposes of 
Section 183 (B) of the National Internal Revenue Code, in the manner set forth 
in the cases heretofore adverted to. The reason is, in synthesis, stated in the 
case of Go Cheng Tee vs. Meer, 87 Phil. 18, in the following language:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Como ya hemos dicho, el ejercito americano no estaba obligado a pagar ningun 
impuesto sobre tales efectos, porque no habian sido traidos aqui para fines de 
comercio sino comp objetos de abastecimiento militar. Solamente se convirtieron 
en mercancias de comercio cuando el demandante los obtuvo en compra para 
dedicarlos al negocio, y solamente desde entonces quedaban sujetos a impuesto. 
La <i>venta original</i> de que habla el articulo 5 de la ley No. 503<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> es la realizada por el demandante al 
publico de Filipinas y no la venta hecha a el por el "Foreign Liquidation 
Commission". En esta transaccion el demandante <i>compro</i>; <i>no</i> vendio * 
* * La venta hecha por el demandante a sus parroquianos es la <i>venta 
original</i> y no la compra hecha por el de la "Foreign Liquidation Commission." 
(p. 24)</p></blockquote>
<p>Hence, under this ruling, the original sale is not the sale made by the U.S. 
authorities to the petitioner but the subsequent sale that the herein petitioner 
makes to his customers. To hold otherwise would be to bring about the very 
situation which the law intends to avoid, that is, the influx of articles free 
of tax into the military bases, and the subsequent indiscriminate and unchecked 
distribution and sale thereof to the general public also free of tax. It is in 
this spirit that the decisions herein cited were conceived and formulated. 
Besides, for the purposes of our customs and tax laws, the sale by the U.S. 
authorities to the petitioner is considered but a continuation of the 
importation of the goods to the Philippines. As was held in the case of Go Cheng 
Tee vs. Meer, <i>supra</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * pero la importacion no termin6 con la entrega al demandante por la 
"Foreign Liquidation Commission" de dichos efectos sino hasta cuando se hubiese 
pagado el impuesto correspondiente. * * * Mientras estaban bajo el control del 
ejercito y para uso militar, los efectos no debian pagar ningun impuesto al 
Gobierno Filipino. Pero inmediatamente despues de transferidos al demandante 
para fines comerciales, desde ese momento nacio el derecho del gobierno de 
gravar sobre ellos el impuesto correspondiente, <i>y mientras no lo pague el 
demandante no termina la importacion. Por eso el demandante que negocio con 
ellos es el importador bajo los terminos precisos de la ley</i>." (p. 
22)</p></blockquote>
<p>Applying this ruling to the case at bar, the importation therefore, continues 
and is not completed until the petitioner pays the taxes due on the articles. 
For that long, therefore, in contemplation of law the petitioner is the 
importer.</p>
<p>However, it is argued by the petitioner that before the amendment of Section 
183 (B) of the National Internal Revenue Act by Republic Act 1612, incorporating 
therein the provision</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In the case of tax-free articles brought or imported into the Philippines by 
persons, entities or agencies exempt from tax which are subsequently sold, 
transferred, or exchanged in the Philippines to non-exempt private persons or 
entities, the purchasers shall be considered the importers thereof. The tax due 
on such articles shall constitute a lien on the article itself superior to all 
other charges or liens, irrespective of the possessor thereof." (Sec. 5, 
Republic Act No. 1612)</p></blockquote>
<p>the purchasers of tax-free articles brought into the Philippines by persons 
or agencies exempt from tax were not considered the importers of said tax-free 
articles. He then concludes that, having purchased the tax-free articles before 
Republic Act No. 1612 took effect on August 24, 1956, his purchases were not 
taxable as he was not then the importer thereof.</p>
<p>This contention is incorrect because the Saura and Soriano cases 
(<i>supra</i>) were decided in 1951 and 1955 respectively, long before the 
enactment of Republic Act 1612. In fact the amendment merely adopted an existing 
ruling of the Bureau of Internal Revenue, which is in line with the decisions of 
this Court, that purchasers of articles brought or imported tax-free into the 
Philippines, shall be subject to the payment of advance sales tax. This clearly 
appears in the explanatory note to House Bill No. 5809 now Republic Act 1612, 
which enumerates the features of the proposed amendments, among which is the</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"4. Incorporation into the provision of Section 183 (B) <i>the existing 
ruling of the Bureau of Internal Revenue considering as the importers, 
purchasers of articles brought w imported tax-free into the Philippines</i>, and 
establishing a lien for the tax on such articles <i>irrespective of the 
possessors thereof</i>. This provision will merely place said purchasers in the 
same footing as those purchasing similar articles from taxable persons, 
entities, or agencies." (Congressional Record, House of Representatives, page 
2946, May 17, 1956) (<i>Italics supplied</i>).</p></blockquote>
<p>The case of Collector of Internal Revenue vs. Viduya, 103 Phil., 93 invoked 
by petitioner is not a point. That case concerns the purchase by Viduya, who was 
not a merchant, of an automobile apparently for his own use, from a member of 
the staff of the American Embassy in Manila who brought the car from the United 
States also for his personal use here. The issue there involved relates to the 
payment by end-users of compensating tax under Section 190 of the Tax Code. The 
advance sales tax is levied upon merchants, importers and manufacturers who 
resell, barter or exchange the articles purchased or imported or who use them in 
the manufacture or preparation of articles subject to specific tax or those for 
consignment abroad. The end-users do not pay the advance sales tax; the 
merchants, importers and manufacturers do not pay the compensating tax. The 
compensating tax is not an import tax.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> 
Obviously, a ruling on the question of the payment of compensating tax, as the 
one in the Viduya case, can not have application to a case involving the payment 
of advance sales tax, as is the issue in the present case.</p>
<p>The appealed judgment of the Court of Appeals being in accordance with law, 
the same is hereby affirmed with costs against the appellant. So ordered.</p> <i>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.
