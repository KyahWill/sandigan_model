				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Eugene Moss appealed from the decision of the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>, <span class="SpellE">Carigara</span>
Branch VI, denying his application for the registration of a ten-hectare island
on the ground that, being an American citizen or an alien, he is disqualified
to acquire lands under section 5, Article XIII of the 1935 Consti­tution, as
held in <span class="SpellE">Krivenko</span> vs. Register of Deeds, 79 Phil. 461
(Land Registration Case No. N-68, LRC Record No. <span class="GramE">N-27971).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General, disagreeing with the trial court,
recommends in his brief for the Director of Lands that the decision be reversed
and that the application of Moss be granted.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Carigara</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Bay</st1:placetype></st1:place> there is an islet known as <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Calumpihan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Island</st1:placetype></st1:place>
within the jurisdiction of Barrio <span class="SpellE">Calumpihan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Capoocan</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Leyte</span></span></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is planted to coconuts more than sixty to
eighty <span class="GramE">years</span> old in 1966.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fruit trees, corn and tobacco are also grown
on the land.</p>

<p class="BODY">That land was already declared for tax purposes in 1930.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was then owned by Vicente <span class="SpellE">Pragas</span> who had possessed and cultivated it since 1894.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1932" day="14" month="11">November
 14, 1932</st1:date> <span class="SpellE">Pragas</span> sold the island to
Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Cecilio</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1937" day="23" month="3">March 23, 1937</st1:date> <span class="SpellE">Cecilio</span> sold it to Catalina <span class="SpellE">Pabilion</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, on <st1:date year="1944" day="23" month="12">December 23, 1944</st1:date> the spouses Catalina <span class="SpellE">Pabilion</span> and Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Dadizon</span>
sold the land to <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>
who, in turn, sold it on <st1:date year="1945" day="20" month="1">January 20,
 1945</st1:date> for P1<span class="GramE">,200</span> to Eugene Moss and Albert
Boyd Cassidy, American nationals.</p>

<p class="BODY">In an action to quiet title filed by Moss against Cassidy, an
absentee, Moss was adjudged the sole owner of the land in a decision dated <st1:date year="1962" day="27" month="3">March 27, 1962</st1:date> rendered by the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span> in Civil Case No. 645.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moss declared the land for tax purposes on <st1:date year="1950" day="27" month="6">June 27, 1950</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He paid the realty taxes on the said land for the years 1945 to
1966.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had it surveyed on <st1:date year="1962" day="20" month="11">November 20, 1962</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="3" month="4">April 3, 1965</st1:date>
Moss, through Dr. <span class="SpellE">Teodorico</span> H. <span class="SpellE">Jaceldo</span>,
his administrator and attorney-in-fact, filed an application for the
registration of the said land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moss is a
retired army colonel, an American citizen, married to Eileen Moss, and a former
resident of <st1:address><st1:street>504 Glen Park Drive</st1:street>, <st1:city>Nashville</st1:city>,
 <st1:state>Tennessee</st1:state></st1:address> and now <st1:place><st1:city>Los
  <span class="SpellE">Fres­nos</span></st1:city>, <st1:state>Texas</st1:state></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">As already stated, the trial court denied the application for
registration because Moss is an alien.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That holding is erro­neous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
erroneous because while aliens are disqualified to acquire lands under the 1935
Constitution (Levy <span class="SpellE">Hermanos</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Ledesma</span>,
69 Phil. 49; <span class="SpellE">Krivenko</span> vs. Register of Deeds, <u><span style="">supra</span></u><span style="">), </span>citizens of the United States can acquire lands like Filipino
citizens.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court overlooked the Ordinance which was appended to
the 1935 Constitution by Resolution No. 39 of the National Assembly dated <st1:date year="1939" day="15" month="9">September 15, 1939</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That resolution was approved by the President
of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
on <st1:date year="1939" day="10" month="11">Novem­ber 10, 1939</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It provides as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"ORDINANCE APPENDED TO THE CONSTITUTION</blockquote>

all the civil rights of the citizens and corporations, respectively,
thereof." (1 Philippine Annotated Laws, pp. 31-34).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">That Ordinance was made a part of the 1935 Constitution as
directed in section 2 of the <span class="SpellE">Tydings</span>-McDuffie Law or
the Independence Law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsection (17)
quoted above is a reproduction of subsection (16) of section 2(a) of the
Independence Law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moss validly acquired the island in question under the provisions
of subsection (17), section 1 of the aforementioned Ordinance (See sec. 127 of
Public Land Law; Republic vs. <span class="SpellE">Quasha</span>, L-30299, <st1:date year="1972" day="17" month="8">August 17, 1972</st1:date>, 46 SCRA 160,
172-173.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Note that the instant case is
not covered by section 11, Article XVII of the 1973 Constitution and by
Presidential Decree No. 713 dated <st1:date year="1975" day="27" month="5">May
 27, 1975</st1:date>, 71 O.G. 4115 re residential lands of American citizens).</p>

<p class="BODY">The proclamation of Philippine independence on July 4, 1946 did
not impair Moss' proprietary rights over the said land because the 1935
Constitution provides that upon the proclamation of Philippine independence
"all existing property rights of citizens or corporations of the United
States shall be acknowledged, respected, and safeguarded to the same extent as
property rights of citizens of the Philippines" (Sec. 1[1], Article XVII).</p>

<p class="BODY">That constitutional provision is implemented in Article VI of the
Treaty of General Relations entered into between the Re­public of the
Philippines and the United States on July 4, 1946 which provides that all
existing property rights of citizens and corporations of the United States in
the Republic of the Philippines shall be acknowledged, respected and
safeguarded to the same extent as property rights of citizens and corporations
of the Republic of the Philippines (42 O.G. 1651.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:place><st1:placename>See</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Republic</st1:placetype></st1:place> Act No. 76).</p>

<p class="BODY">When Moss purchased the land, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place>
was already liberated as shown in the proclamation of General Douglas <span class="SpellE">MacArthur</span> dated <st1:date year="1944" day="23" month="10">October
 23, 1944</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Moss and Cassidy
were allegedly members of the American liberation forces that landed in <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place>).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>See <span class="GramE">41 O.G. 147</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since Moss and his predecessors in interest have been in
possession <u>en <span class="SpellE">concepto</span> de <span class="SpellE">dueño</span></u>
of <span class="SpellE">Calumpihan</span> Island for more than thirty years
immediately preceding the filing of his application for confirmation of his
title, he is entitled to the registration of his title to the island (Sec.
48[b], Public Land Law, as amended by Republic Act No. 1942).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the trial court's decision is reversed and set
aside arid the application of Eugene Moss, of age, citizen of the United
