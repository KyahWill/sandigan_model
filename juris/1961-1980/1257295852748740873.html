				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from an order of dismissal of the Court of First Instance 
of Tarlac, which has been forwarded to us by the Court of Appeals, only one 
question of law being involved in the appeal.
<p>This case was instituted in said Court of First Instance on October 8, 1958. 
Plaintiff Alfredo Hilario alleged in the complaint that on January 11, 1958, 
defendant Marciano D. Bautista, as Under-Secretary of Public Works and 
Communications, rendered a decision granting the former thirty (30) days from 
receipt thereof—March 6, 1958—within which to demolish and remove the dam 
illegally constructed by him (plaintiff) across a given creek in Mayantoc, 
Tarlac, and stating that otherwise the Director of Public Works and 
Communication or his authorized agents would effect such removal at his 
(plaintiff's) expense, in pursuance of section 4, of Act No. 2152, as amended; 
that said decision was rendered in connection with Water Right Case No. 1958-2, 
filed by Cesar A. Manganaan—one of the defendants herein—for Water Right 
Concession, with the Department of Public Works and Communication on December 
17, 1957; that plaintiff had no opportunity to present evidence in the 
investigation conducted in relation to said water right case; that he had 
acquired the right to use the water of the aforementioned creek since time 
immemorial; that since September 23, 1958, defendant Bautista, and the other 
defendants herein—namely, the Acting Director of Public Works, the Supervising 
Project Engineer of the Central Luzon Irrigation District, and the Irrigation 
Superintendent of the Tarlac River Irrigation Project—had threatened to demolish 
said dam of the plaintiff, if he failed to destroy and remove the same within a 
specified period; and that said contemplated action constitutes an invasion of 
plaintiff's aforementioned right, which he had acquired by prescription, to the 
damage and prejudice not only of the plaintiff, but, also, of numerous farmers 
who derive water, through his dam, for the irrigation of their respective 
fields. Plaintiff prayed, therefore, that a writ of preliminary injunction be 
issued ordering the defendants or their agents to refrain from carrying out the 
threatened demolition of said dam and that, after due trial, judgment be 
rendered declaring that plaintiff has the rightful and beneficial use of that 
portion of the waters of the creek above referred to where plaintiff's dam is 
and sentencing defendant Cesar A. Manganaan to pay attorney's fees and 
costs.</p>
<p>In due course, the defendants filed motions to dismiss the complaint, which 
were granted by the lower court. A reconsideration of the order of dismissal 
having been denied, plaintiff interposed the present appeal.</p>
<p>Sections 2 and 4 of Act No. 2152, otherwise known as the Irrigation Act, 
read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sec. 2.—The power to giant appropriations of public waters is hereby vested 
in the Secretary of Commerce and Police (now Secretary of Public Works and 
Communication) in accordance with the provisions of this law, upon the 
recommendation and approval of the irrigation council hereinafter created."</p>
<p>"Sec. 4.—Any controversy between the persons claiming right to use of water 
of any stream shall be submitted to the Secretary of Commerce and Police (now 
Secretary of Public Works and Communication) through the Director of Public 
Works, and his decision thereon shall be final unless appeal therefrom be taken 
to the proper court within thirty days after the date of the notification of the 
parties of said decision. In case of such appeal the court having jurisdiction 
shall try the controversy <i>de novo</i>."</p></blockquote>
<p>It is not disputed that the administrative proceedings and the decision of 
the Undersecretary of Public Works and Communication in said Water Right Case 
No. 1958-2 were conducted and rendered upon the authority of said section 4 of 
Act No. 2152. It is, likewise, conceded that plaintiff had filed his complaint 
herein by way of appeal from the aforementioned administrative decision. The 
only issue before us is whether said appeal has been taken "within thirty days 
after the date of the notification of the parties of such decision", as provided 
in the above quoted section 4. The lower court decided the question in the 
negative, but plaintiff maintains otherwise. He contends that, although copy of 
said decision was served upon him on March 6, 1958, he (plaintiff) had not been 
notified of the denial of his motion for reconsideration of said decision until 
September 24, 1958, and that, from this date to October 8, 1958, when the case 
at bar was commenced, only fourteen (14) days had elapsed, and, hence, he 
concludes, within the 30-day period prescribed in said section 4.</p>
<p>The fallacy of this argument is obvious. Said period of thirty (30) days, 
should, pursuant to said section 4, be computed from receipt of copy of the 
<i>decision</i> of the Department of Public Works and Communication, on March 6, 
1958. Although the filing of plaintiff's motion for reconsideration on March 28, 
1958, or twenty-two (22) days later, suspended the running of the period to 
appeal, the same <i>continued</i> to run upon receipt of notice of the denial of 
the motion, on September 24, 1958. Said period did <i>not begin</i> to run once 
more (Centenera vs. Hon. Nicasio Yatco, et at, 106 Phil., 1064; 57 Off. Gaz. 
[27] 4923; Lloren vs. Hon. Jesus de Veyra, G. R. No. L-13929, March 28, 1962; 
Roska vs. Hon. Modesto Ramolete, G. R. No. L-18266, June 30, 1962). The 
twenty-two (22) days that had elapsed from notice of the decision to the filing 
of the motion for reconsideration must be added to the fourteen (14) days that 
had run from notice of the denial of the motion for reconsideration to the 
institution of this case. In short, the same was filed thirty-six (36) days 
after notice of said decision, and, hence, beyond the statutory period.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the order appealed from is hereby affirmed, with costs against the 
plaintiff. It is so ordered.</p> <i>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J. B. L., 
Barrera, Paredes, Dizon, Regala,</i> and <i>Makalintal, JJ.</i>, concur.</div>
