				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal, taken by plaintiff Pedro <span class="SpellE">Gayon</span>,
from an order of the Court of First Instance of Iloilo dismissing his complaint
in Civil Case No. 7334 thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records show that on July 31, 1967, Pedro <span class="SpellE">Gayon</span>
filed said complaint against the spouses Silvestre <span class="SpellE">Gayon</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Genoveva</span> de <span class="SpellE">Gayon</span>,
alleging substantially that, on October 1, 1952, said spouses executed a deed -
copy of which was attached to the complaint, as Annex "A" - whereby
they sold to Pedro <span class="SpellE">Gelera</span>, for the sum of P500.00, a
parcel of unregistered land therein described, and located in the barrio of <span class="SpellE">Cabubugan</span>, municipality of <span class="SpellE">Guimbal</span>,
province of Iloilo, including the improvements thereon, subject to redemption
within five (5) years or not later than October 1, 1957; that said right of
redemption had not been exercised by Silvestre <span class="SpellE">Gayon</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Genoveva</span> de <span class="SpellE">Gayon</span>, or any
of their heirs or successors, despite the expiration of the period <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>; that said Pedro <span class="SpellE">Gelera</span>
and his wife <span class="SpellE">Estelita</span> <span class="SpellE">Damaso</span>
had, by virtue of a deed of sale - copy of which was attached to the complaint,
as Annex "B" - dated March 21,1961, sold the aforementioned land to
plaintiff Pedro <span class="SpellE">Gayon</span> for the sum of P614.00; that
plaintiff had, since 1961, introduced thereon improvements worth P1,000; that
he had, moreover, fully paid the taxes on said property up to 1967; and that
Articles 1606 and 1616 of our Civil Code require a judicial decree for the
consolidation of the title in and to a land acquired through a conditional
sale, and, accordingly, praying that an order be issued in plain­tiff's favor
for the consolidation of ownership in and to the afore­mentioned property.</p>

<p class="BODY">In her answer to the complaint, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Gayon</span>
alleged that her husband, Silvestre <span class="SpellE">Gayon</span> died on
January 6, 1954, long before the institution of this case; that Annex
"A" to the complaint is fictitious, for the signature thereon
purporting to be her signature is not hers; that neither she nor her deceased
husband had ever executed "any document of whatever nature in plaintiff's
favor"; that the complaint is malicious and had embarrassed her and her
children; that the heirs of Silvestre <span class="SpellE">Gayon</span> had to
"employ the services of counsel for a fee of P500.00 and incurred expenses
of at least P200.00"; and that being a brother of the deceased Silvestre <span class="SpellE">Gayon</span>, plaintiff "did not exert efforts for the
amicable settlement of the case" before filing his complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She prayed, therefore, that the same be dismissed
and that plaintiff be sentenced to pay damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">Soon later, she filed a motion to dismiss, reproducing substantially
the averments made in her answer and stressing that, in view of the death of
Silvestre <span class="SpellE">Gayon</span>, there is a "necessity of amend­ing
the complaint to suit the genuine facts on record."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Presently, or on <st1:date year="1967" day="16" month="9">September 16, 1967</st1:date>, the lower court issued the
order appealed from, reading:</p>

<blockquote>"Considering the motion to dismiss and it appearing from
Exhibit 'A' annexed to the complaint that Silvestre <span class="SpellE">Gayon</span>
is the absolute owner of the land in question, and considering the fact that
Silvestre <span class="SpellE">Gayon</span> is now dead and his wife <span class="SpellE">Genoveva</span> de <span class="SpellE">Gayon</span> has nothing to
do with the land subject of plaintiff's complaint, as prayed for, this case is
hereby dismissed, without pronouncement as to costs."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A reconsideration of this order having been denied, plaintiff
interposed the present appeal, which is well taken.</p>

<p class="BODY">Said order is manifestly erroneous and must be set aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To begin with, it is not true that Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Gayon</span> "has nothing to do with the land subject of
plaintiff's complaint."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the
widow of Silvestre <span class="SpellE">Gayon</span>, she is one of his
compulsory heirs<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>;
and has, accordingly, an interest in the property in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, her own motion to dismiss indicated
merely "a necessity of amending the complaint," to the end that the
other successors-in-interest of Silvestre <span class="SpellE">Gayon</span>,
instead of the latter, be made parties in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In her opposition to the aforesaid motion for
reconsideration of the plaintiff, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Gayon</span> alleged,
<u>inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span></u>, that the "heirs cannot
represent the dead defendant, unless there is a declaration of <span class="SpellE">heirship</span>."<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Inasmuch, however, as succession takes place, by operation of law,
"from the moment of the death of the decedent''<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
and "(t)he inheritance includes all the property, rights and obligations
of a person which are not extinguished by his death,"<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
it follows that if his heirs were included as defendants in this case, they
would be sued, not as "representatives” of the decedent, but as <u>owners</u>
of an aliquot interest in the property in question, even if the precise extent
of their interest may still be undetermined and they have derived it from the
decent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, they may be sued without
a previous declaration of <span class="SpellE">heirship</span>, provided there is
no pending special proceeding for the settlement of the estate of the decedent.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As regards plaintiff's failure to seek a compromise, as an
alleged obstacle to the present case, Art. 222 of our Civil Code provides:</p>

<blockquote>"No suit shall be filed or maintained between members of the
same family unless it should appear that earnest efforts toward a compromise
have been made, but that the same have failed, subject to the limitations in
article 2035."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is noteworthy that the impediment arising from this provision
applies to suits "filed or maintained between <u>members of the same
family</u>."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This phrase,
"members of the same family," should, however, be construed in the
light of Art. 217 of the same Code, pursuant to which:</p>

<blockquote>"Family relations shall include those:</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(1)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">Between husband and wife;</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(2)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">Between parent and child;</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(3)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">Among other ascendants and their
descendants;</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(4)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">Among brothers and sisters."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Gayon</span> is plaintiff's
sister-in-law, whereas her children are his nephews and/or nieces.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch as none of them is included in the
enumeration contained in said Art. 217 - which should be construed strictly, it
being an exception to the general rule - and Silvestre <span class="SpellE">Gayon</span>
must necessarily be excluded as party in the case at bar, it follows that the
same does not come within the purview of Art. 222, and plaintiff's failure to
seek a compromise before filing the complaint does not bar the same.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order appealed from is hereby set aside and
the case remanded to the lower court for the inclusion, as defendant or
defendants therein, of the administrator or executor of the estate of Silvestre
<span class="SpellE">Gayon</span>, if any, in lieu of the decedent, or, in the
absence of such administrator or executor, of the heirs of the deceased
Silvestre <span class="SpellE">Gayon</span> and for further proceedings, not
inconsistent with this decision, with the costs of this instance against
defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, <span class="SpellE">Genoveva</span>
de <span class="SpellE">Gayon</span>.</p>
