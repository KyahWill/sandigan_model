				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal from the decision of the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Leyte</span></span><span style="">, in its Civil Case No. 3033, relating </span>to
a petition for declaratory relief filed by the City Mayor, the Chief of Police,
and the Chief of the Secret Service, of the City of <span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span>,
against the Chief of the Philippine Constabulary, the Commanding Officer of the
IIIRD P.C. Zone and the Provincial Commander of the Philippine Constabulary in
the province of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts are undisputed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent Col. Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Palencia</span>, Commanding
Officer of the 3rd PC Zone, believing that the Philippine Constabulary has
concurrent jurisdiction with the City Police Department within the City of <span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span> in the enforcement of gambling and anti-vice laws,
issued an order to the Provincial Commander of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>,
under the provisions of Section 2 of Commonwealth Act No. 343, to exercise
police powers and conduct raids on gambling places and other places of vice
within the city without informing the petitioners herein of such raids.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Acting on said order, the officer-in-charge
of the <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span> PC Command, together with other PC
officers and policemen from <span class="SpellE">Jaro</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place>, conducted, without the previous call
from, nor notice to, the City Mayor, a series of raids <span style="">in the City of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Tacloban</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
February 2, 1962, they raided the house of <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span> <span class="SpellE">Cinco</span>; on February 14, 1962, the house of <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> <span class="SpellE">Rubillos</span>; on February 17,
1962, the cockpit; and on February 22, 1962, the house of <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span>
<span class="SpellE">Custodio</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioners vehemently
protested against this</span> exercise of police jurisdiction claiming that it
was in direct contravention of the provisions of the Charter of the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span></st1:place></st1:city> (Rep. Act 3068).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondents having lent a deaf ear to
said protest, petitioners filed a petition before the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>, praying that an order issue restraining the
Philippine Constabulary from exercising police authority within the City of <span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span> during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of
the case, and after trial on the merits, that judgment issue interpreting the
duties and responsibilities of the parties under the Charter of the City of <span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span> and determining the extent of the powers of the
parties therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondents opposed
the issuance of an order for a writ of injunction basing their stand on the
authority and powers of the Philippine Constabulary as provided in Section 2 of
Commonwealth Act No. 343 and Sections 825, 831 and 848 of the Revised
Administrative Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After hearing, the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span> rendered, on <st1:date year="1962" day="2" month="4">April 2, 1962</st1:date>, its decision, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, this Court holds and renders
judgment as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"a.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Declaring that,
under existing laws, the Philippine Constabulary and its agents could enter the
City of <span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span>, exercise police authority, and
conduct police operations within its territorial limits without the consent of
the City <span style="">Mayor first obtained;</span><o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“b.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Declaring that under
the purview of Section 37, Article XI of Republic Act 3068, known as the
Charter of the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
notice to the City Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span> or the Chief of

just </span><span style="">as any private individual </span><span style="">can, under the circumstances enumerated in

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Their motion for
reconsideration of said decision having been denied, petitioners took the </span>present
appeal directly to <span style="">this Court on purely
questions of law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioners contend, in
their first and second assignments of error, that as per provisions of Sections
40 and 37(b) of Republic Act No. 3068 (Charter of the </span>City of <span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span>) police jurisdiction and supervision, and the
preservation <span style="">of peace and order within
the City of <span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span> pertain <u>exclusively</u> to
the Police Department of the City of <span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span>, and
consequently the Philippine Constabulary may not exercise police authority and
conduct police operations therein except when the Mayor "shall deem it
necessary to avert danger or to protect life and property, in case of riot, disturbance,
or public calamity, or when he has reason to fear any serious violation of law
and order."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Respondents, on the
contrary, contend that the Philippine Constabulary can conduct police
operations and exercise police authority, anywhere in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philip</span><span style="">pines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> irrespective of territorial limits, and without need of giving prior,
notice to, and even without the previous request for help from, the Mayor of
the City of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Tacloban</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondents also aver that petitioners' contention had already been
answered </span>by Opinion No. 270, series of <span style="">1958 of </span>the Secretary of <span style="">Justice
which, </span>although said opinion refers to the extent of the power of the
Philippine Constabulary to exercise police functions in the City of Manila, is
applicable to the City of <span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span> because the
Charters of the City of <span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span> and of <span style="">the City of Manila </span>both provide that
the Chief of Police has "exclusive police supervision" within the territorial
limits of the city.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The opinion of the
Secretary of Justice cited Sections 825, 831 and 848 of the Revised
Administrative Code <span style="">and Section 2 of
Commonwealth </span>Act No. 343 in support of the view that "As <span style="">peace officers the members (of the </span>Philippine
Cons<span style="">tabulary) are authorized and
empowered, without statutory limitation with respect to place, to prevent and
suppress violations of law and make arrests and seizures, </span><span style="">and ‘</span><span style="">to cooperate with and </span>to <span style="">assist
the city, municipal, and other duly established bodies of local police in the
Philippines.’”</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The opinion however concluded "that
notice to the City Mayor or the Chief of Police of any police action
contemplated by the Philippine Constabulary within the territorial limits of
Manila may be required." Respondents furthermore contend that petitioners'
theory "would virtually limit </span><span style="">or
</span><span style="">curtail the exercise by the
President of his inherent constitutional powers as commander-in-chief of all
armed forces of the Philippines, of which the Philippine Constabulary </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">a part, to ‘call out such armed forces to prevent or suppress lawless
violence, invasion, insurrection or rebellion’ (Art. </span>VII, <span style="">Sec. 10, Constitution)," which power was
impliedly exercised by the President when he issued Executive Order No. 153, series
of 1938, and Executive Order No. 389, series of 1950, constituting a segment of
the Armed Forces of the Philippines (Philippine Constabulary) as a National
Police Force charged with the enforcement of law and order throughout the
Philippines.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Revised Charter of the City of <span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span>
(R. A. No. 3068)<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
expressly provides that police jurisdiction and supervision and the
preservation of peace and order exclusively pertains, <u>notwithstanding </u><u><span style="">existing law to the contrary</span></u><span style="">, </span>to the mayor, the chief of police,
the deputy chief of police, the chief of the secret service and all members of

members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines." The Chief of Police,
furthermore, shall exercise exclusive police supervision over all land and

<p class="BODY">The provision regarding the exclusive police jurisdiction and
supervision in the Revised Charter of the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span></st1:place></st1:city> is new, in the sense that
the old charter did not expressly grant the same to the officers mentioned, as
can be seen by a perusal of Sections 26 and 28 of Republic Act No. 760 (the old
charter).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This new provision, embodied
in Republic Act No. 3068, indicates that a change and departure from the old
charter was intended, and the same must be given significance and effect.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
The language of the grant used in the statute being plain and unambiguous, its
clear and obvious meaning must control.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What is the clear meaning conveyed by the language of the statute?</p>

<p class="BODY">The term "exclusive" in its usual and generally
accepted sense, means possessed to the exclusion of others; appertaining to the
subject alone, not including, admitting or pertaining to another or others, undivided,
sole.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(15 Words and Phrases p. 510,
citing Mitchell v. Tulsa Water, Light, Heat and Power Co., 95 P. 961, 969, 21 <span class="SpellE">Okl</span>. 243; and p. 513, citing Commonwealth v. Superintendent
of House of Correction; 64 Pa. Super, 613, 615).</p>

<p class="BODY">The term "police" of the state, in a comprehensive
sense, <span class="GramE">embraces</span> its whole system of internal re<span style="">gulation for the preservation of public order
and prevention of offenses against the state. "Police" </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">an organized civil force for maintaining order, preventing and detecting
crime, and enforcing the law (32A Words and Phrases, p. 366, citing Levine </span>v.
State, 166 A. <span style="">300, 301, 110 N.J.L. 467,
and Green v. City of </span>Bennettsville, <span style="">15 S.E. 2d, 337, 197 S.C. 313).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">"Supervision"
is the act of one who supervises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
Court has had occasion to give the connotation of "</span>supervise,"
<span style="">when it said thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"'To supervise' is to oversee, to have oversight of, to
superintend the execution of or the performance of a thing, or the movements or
work of a person; to inspect with authority; to inspect and direct the work of
others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Fluet</span> vs. </span><st1:place><st1:city><span class="GramE">McCabe</span></st1:city><span class="GramE">, </span><st1:state><span class="GramE"><span style="">Mass.</span></span></st1:state></st1:place><span class="GramE"><span style="">, </span>12 N. E. 2d 89, 93.)</span> It is to
be noted <span style="">that there are two senses in
which the term ‘supervision’ has been understood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In one, it means superintending alone or the
oversight of the performance of a thing, without power to control or to
direct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the other, the inspection </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">coupled with the right to direct or even to annul.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decisions of courts in the United States
distinguish between supervision exercised by an official of </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">department over subordinates of that department, and supervision for
the purpose only of preventing and punishing abuses, discriminations, and so
forth." (Rodriguez, et al. v. <span class="SpellE">Montinola</span>, et al.,
94 Phil., 964, 972)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Supervision to be conscientious
must be based on actual facts and conditions which can be disclosed only after
careful study and investigation, and consequently supervision implies the power
to inquire into those facts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in <span class="SpellE">Planas</span> v. Gil, 67 Phil., 62, 65, this Court said that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>Supervision <span style="">is </span>not a meaningless thing. It is an active power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is certainly not without limitation, but
it at least implies authority to <span style="">inquire
</span>into facts and conditions in order to render the power real and
effective.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If <span style="">supervision is to be conscientious and rational, and not automatic and
brutal, it must be founded upon <span class="GramE">a knowledge</span> of actual
facts and conditions disclosed after careful study and investigation."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">When the Revised Charter
of the City of <span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span>, therefore, granted,
notwithstanding provision of existing law to the contrary, police jurisdiction
and supervision and the preservation of peace and order in the city exclusively
to the peace officers named therein, it meant that these peace officers named <u>and
no other</u>, shall have the power to oversee and superintend the preservation
of the public order within the city, and inasmuch as such power of supervision
cannot be exercised conscientiously without knowledge of facts and conditions
obtaining, it includes the power to require prior notice of any police action
contemplated to be carried in the city even by the Philippine
Constabulary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without such prior notice
the statutory power of supervision cannot be real and effective.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To whom the law </span>has <span style="">granted the power in him it must remain, and
by him must it be exercised.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where the
statute grants a right or imposes </span>a <span style="">duty, it also confers by implication every particular power and every
reasonable means necessary for the exercise of the one and the performance of
the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contention, therefore,
that the Philippine Constabulary has concurrent jurisdiction with the Police
Department of the City of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Tacloban</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> within the city in the enforcement of
gambling and anti-vice </span>laws, <span style="">is
untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anent this matter it </span>may
<span style="">be stated, further, that the members of
the Philippine Constabulary are not charged with the functions of the local
police.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, Section 848 of the Revised
Administrative Code provides, in part -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The Philippine Constabulary shall not, however, be charged
with the duty of enforcing the ordinances of any municipality, and shall not
make arrests for violations of the same, unless the Department Head or the
Provincial Governor shall, in writing, request the senior Constabulary officer
of the province to direct his subordinate to enforce the ordinances, or any
particular ordinance or ordinances <span style="">of
any or all the</span><span style=""> municipalities </span><span style="">of the province."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The exclusive police authority and supervision granted by the
Revised Charter to the peace officers mentioned in Section 40 of Republic Act
3068 is not, however, absolute, for the same section provides an exception,
namely:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
Whenever the Mayor shall deem it necessary to avert danger or to pro­tect life
and property, in case of riot, disturbance, or public calamity, or when he has
reason to fear any serious violation of law and order, he may call upon the
provincial commander or other members of Armed Forces of the Philippines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Except upon the occurrence of any of such
conditions, police jurisdiction and supervision and the preservation of peace
and order shall pertain exclusively to the peace officers herein mentioned, and
existing law to the contrary notwithstanding."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It should be understood, moreover, that the Charter was not
intended to make the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span></st1:place></st1:city>
a sanctuary to which a law offender may find refuge and his person would
therein be protected against pursuit and arrest by a member of the Philippine
Constabulary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The demands of public
order, public safety and security would not permit such an implication. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>After all, members of the Philippine
Constabulary are peace officers, empowered to make arrests even without a
warrant for breaches of the peace and other violations of law (Sec­tion 848,
Revis<span style="">e</span>d Administrative Code),
and pursuit of a law offender is something done not as planned before hand but
as urgently demanded by the exigencies of a given situation.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is also obvious, for the reason given above, that the grant of
exclusive police jurisdiction and supervision, as is provided in the Charter of
the City of <span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span>, in no way deprives even <span style="">a </span>private person of his right to
arrest without a warrant <span style="">a </span>person
committing a crime in his presence or under circumstances as provided in
Section 6 of Rule 113 of the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, <span style="">a </span>member of the
Philippine Constabulary may make arrest within the limits of the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span></st1:place></st1:city> just like any private
person under the circumstances just mentioned.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We do not </span>see <span style="">how the grant of exclusive police supervision
and jurisdiction to the peace officers mentioned in Section 40 of the Charter
of the City of <span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span> can be considered as a
limitation or curtailment of the constitutional power of the President to call
out the armed forces to prevent or suppress lawless violence, invasion,
insurrection or rebellion, as contended by <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>,
unless, of course, the Commanding Officer of the Philippine Constabulary
believes that his orders are automatically the orders of the President of the
Philippines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A distinction must be made
between an order of the commanding officer of any unit or command of the
Philippine Constabulary to conduct once operations within the City of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Tacloban</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> and the order which emanates from the
President, or by authority of the President, to conduct the police operations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case of the order that solely comes
from the commanding officer of a </span><span style="">unit
of the Philippine Constabulary, or even </span><span style="">from the Chief of the Philippine Constabulary himself, police
operations by the members of the Philippine Constabulary within the City of <span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span> cannot be undertaken in disregard of the
provisions of the Charter of the city.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But if the order comes from the President, certainly the power of the
Presi­dent as provided in the Constitution has to prevail over any power
granted by statutes to local authorities.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It would be stating the
obvious when We say that the grant of exclusive police </span><span style="">supervision and </span><span style="">jurisdiction to the peace officers of the
City of <span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span> cannot in any way affect the
constitutional duty of the </span>President of the Philippines "to take
care that the laws be faithfully executed", and from his constitutional
power to call out, in case of necessity, "such armed forces to prevent or
suppress lawless violence, invasion, insurrection, or rebellion" [Article
VII, Sections 10(1) and (2), Constitution of the Philippines].<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Philippine Constabulary, it should be
noted, <span style="">is </span>one of the major
services of the Armed <span style="">Forces </span>of
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Consequently, where peace
and order have so de</span><span style="">teriorated
that local authorities are powerless to enforce the </span>laws, <span style="">or unwilling, or afraid, to do so, the power </span>of
the President, to call out the Philippine Constabulary or any segment of the
armed forces, may be exercised - certainly not to supersede the <span style="">law </span>but rather to enforce it.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is merit, therefore, in the contention of the appellants,
in their third assignment of error, that the provisions of Sections 825, 831
and 848 of the Revised Administrative Code and also of Commonwealth Act No. 343
have been repealed by Republic Act 3068 insofar <span style="">as </span>the latter Act has provided for special conditions or
restrictions relative to police supervision and jurisdiction in the City of <span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Revised Administrative Code and Commonwealth Act No. 343 are general laws,
while Republic Act 3068 is a special law.</p>

<p class="BODY">There can be no question that a special law must be considered <span style="">as an </span>exception to the general law (<span class="SpellE">Baga</span> v. Philippine National Bank, 99 Phil., 889), and to
the extent of the necessary repugnancy between Republic Act No. 3068, which is
a special law, and Sections 825, 831, and 848 of the Revised Administrative
Code <span style="">as </span>well as Commonwealth Act
No. 343, which are general laws, the former will modify, or prevail over, the
latter (<span class="SpellE">Cassion</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Banco</span> <span class="SpellE">Nacional</span> Filipino, 89 Phil., 560; <span class="SpellE">Laxamana</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span>, 92 Phil,, 32).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the provision of Republic Act No. 3068
regarding the grant to the peace officers of the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span></st1:place></st1:city> of exclusive police
jurisdiction and supervision must prevail, as <span style="">stated above, over the contrary provisions of the </span><span style="">Re­</span><span style="">vised </span>Administrative Code and Commonwealth Act No. 343.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">From what has </span>been
said above, it is clear that <span style="">the prayer
