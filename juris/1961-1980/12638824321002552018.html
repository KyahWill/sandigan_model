Certificate of Title No. 25195 in the name of the defendants void and to
declare the plaintiffs as the absolute owners of said Lot 1083.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The complaint alleged that plaintiff, Julia <span class="SpellE">Duque</span>,
is a niece of Juana <span class="SpellE">Duque</span> who died in 1928; that the
defendants are the children of Mariano <span class="SpellE">Duque</span>, a
deceased nephew of Juana <span class="SpellE">Duque</span> and natural brother of
the plaintiff, Julia <span class="SpellE">Duque</span>; that sometime in 1908, Juana
<span class="SpellE">Duque</span>, through her other nephew, Faustino <span class="SpellE">Duque</span>, whom she had employed as her agent, purchased from
the government Lot 1083 of the <span class="SpellE">Malinta</span> Estate at
Polo, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> assessed under Tax Declaration No. 8724
at P1,600.00, more particularly described in Original Certificate of Title No.
374; that Lot 1083 was then a part of the Friar Estate of the government disposable
by the Director of Lands on installment pursuant to the Friar Land Act; that
Faustino <span class="SpellE">Duque</span>, the agent, caused the document of
purchase, Sale Certificate No. 1138, to be issued by the government in his name
with the consent <span style="">of </span>his
principal, Juana <span class="SpellE">Duque</span>; that under the terms of Sale
Certificate No. 1138, the price of Lot 1083 was P503.00 payable in 20 annual
installments of P25.00 each; that the original of the sale certificate was lost
in the files of the Bureau of Lands during the war and plaintiffs could not
secure a copy for attachment to the complaint; that on June 22, 1915, Faustino <span class="SpellE">Duque</span> transferred his Sale Certificate No. 1138 with the
permission of Juana <span class="SpellE">Duque</span> to his brother, Mariano <span class="SpellE">Duque</span>, who later received in 1931 Transfer Certificate No.
7501 for Lot 1083 from the government; that since the issuance of the sale
certificate in 1909, Juana <span class="SpellE">Duque</span> had been in the
exclusive possession of Lot 1083 as owner paying the installments stipulated in
the contract to the government through Faustino <span class="SpellE">Duque</span>
and Mariano <span class="SpellE">Duque</span> or reimbursing their advances <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>; that in 1927, Juana <span class="SpellE">Duque</span>
verbally donated and delivered Lot 1083 to plaintiff Julia <span class="SpellE">Duque</span>,
her niece; that from then on up to the present, the plaintiff Julia <span class="SpellE">Duque</span> has been in the exclusive possession of Lot 1083 as
beneficial owner thereof; that Mariano <span class="SpellE">Duque</span>, the
title holder, died and in 1957, his children, Emilio <span class="SpellE">Duque</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Potenciana</span> <span class="SpellE">Duque</span>, <span class="SpellE">Amadeo</span> <span class="SpellE">Duque</span> and <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Duque</span> registered Lot 1083
in their names under Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-19924 of the Registry
of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>; that subsequently Emilio <span class="SpellE">Duque</span> died without issue and the defendants had <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
1083 recorded in their names under Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-25195 in
1959; that plaintiff, Julia <span class="SpellE">Duque</span>, requested the de­fendants
to <span class="SpellE">reconvey</span> to her the title of Lot 1083 but they
refused and still refuse to comply with her request; that Juana <span class="SpellE">Duque</span>, the original owner of Lot 1083 died single, without
issue and intestate in 1928 survived by her nephews, as legal heirs, Mariano <span class="SpellE">Duque</span>, Domingo <span class="SpellE">Duque</span>, Faustino <span class="SpellE">Duque</span> and <span class="SpellE">Apolonio</span> <span class="SpellE">Duque</span>; that the foregoing legal heirs recognized the
donation of Lot 1083 made by Juana <span class="SpellE">Duque</span> to
plaintiff, Julia <span class="SpellE">Duque</span>, in or about 1927 and
repudiated and abandoned all rights to contest it, as in fact they caused Lot
1083 to be declared for tax purposes in the name of Paz Domingo, the only child
of Julia <span class="SpellE">Duque</span>, in or about 1933; and that the defendants
had recognized plaintiffs' beneficial ownership of Lot 1083 after the death of
their father, Mariano <span class="SpellE">Duque</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In their answer filed on October 5, 1966, the defendants averred
as affirmative and special defenses that Lot 1083 of the <span class="SpellE">Malinta</span>
Estate is owned in fee simple by defendants, <span class="SpellE">Potenciana</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Amadeo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span>, all
surnamed <span class="SpellE">Duque</span>, as evidenced by T.C.T. No. T-25195 of
the Registry of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>; that said property
was originall<span style="">y</span> purchased in 1915
by defendants' father and predecessor-in-interest, Mariano <span class="SpellE">Duque</span>,
from the government of the Philippine Islands; that the purchase price of the
land being payable in installment, it was only in 1931, after full payment of
said price, when Mariano <span class="SpellE">Duque</span> acquired ownership in
fee simple over Lot 1083 by the issuance in his favor of T.C.T. No. 7501 of the
Registry of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> by the government of the
Philippine Islands; that from 1915 up to the present, over a period of 51
years, Mariano <span class="SpellE">Duque</span>, his heirs and successors in
interest which include defendants herein have continuously treated, held and
possessed Lot 1083 as their sole and exclusive pro­perty and that no one among
them has recognized that the beneficial ownership thereof was vested in Julia <span class="SpellE">Duque</span>, Juana <span class="SpellE">Duque</span>, Paz Domingo
or any third person; that the validity of the grant in 1931 by the Government
of the Philippine Islands of T.C.T. No. T-7501 in favor of Mariano <span class="SpellE">Duque</span> was never questioned by the plaintiffs in spite of
their knowledge about it; that in fact the plaintiffs were aware that from the
issuance of said title in 1931 and in exercise of the rights of ownership over
the land, at least three conveyances involving Lot 1083 had been recorded in
the Office of the Registry of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> which
resulted in the grant of new certificates of title in the name of the proper
parties; that notwithstanding their knowledge about these conveyances, the
plaintiffs kept silent and never raised any objections thereto; that although
the plaintiffs and defendants belong to the same family, no allegation that
earnest efforts towards a compromise have been made by the former is contained
in the complaint; that under the circumstances, plaintiffs have no cause of
action against the defendants; that even assuming that they have a cause of
action, the same has been barred by the statute of limitations and/or by <span class="SpellE">laches</span> or it is unenforceable under the Statute of Frauds;
and that in any event, the plaintiffs are in <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>
from claiming <span style="">any </span>rights of
interest over Lot 1083.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The partial stipulation of facts and the evidence established that
the land in question, Lot 1083 of the <span class="SpellE">Malinta</span> Estate
was formerly a part of the Friar Land Estate of the Government; that on January
1, 1909 the Government of the Philippine Islands sold to Faustino <span class="SpellE">Duque</span> Lot 1083 by virtue of Sale Certificate No. 1138 for a
consideration of P503.00 payable in 20 annual installments of P25.00 per year,

Lot 1083 were inherited by the petitioners to whom Transfer Certificate of

taxation in the name of the respondent, Paz Domingo; that beginning with the
year 1949 the tax declaration embracing the land in question was in the name of
Mariano <span class="SpellE">Duque</span>; and that Tax Declaration No. 15214 is

employed as her agent, purchased from the Government Lot 1083 of the <span class="SpellE">Malinta</span> Estate in Polo, now Valenzuela, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>;
that Faustino <span class="SpellE">Duque</span>, the agent, caused the docu­ment
of purchase, Sale Certificate No. 1138, to be issued by the government in his
name with the consent of his principal, Juana <span class="SpellE">Duque</span>;

<p class="BODY">The theory of the private respondents that the land in question

Faustino <span class="SpellE">Duque</span> and that in 1927 she verbally donated said
land to Julia <span class="SpellE">Duque</span> is supported only by testimonial
evidence which cannot prevail over the petitioners' docu­mentary evidence
consisting of Sale Certificate No. 1138 issued in 1909 whereby the Director of
Lands sold Lot 1083 to Faustino <span class="SpellE">Duque</span> on a 20-year
installment of P25.00 per year for a total price of P503.00 and the transfer
certi­ficates of title in the name of Mariano <span class="SpellE">Duque</span>

1083 in Sale Certificate No. 1138.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From
1909 until her death in 1928 Juana <span class="SpellE">Duque</span> had never
taken any step to have the land in question transferred in her name despite the
fact that in 1915 Faustino <span class="SpellE">Duque</span> transferred his
right to the land under Sale Certificate No. 1138 to Mariano <span class="SpellE">Duque</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no
sufficient evidence to show that Juana <span class="SpellE">Duque</span> con­sented
to the transfer by Faustino <span class="SpellE">Duque</span> of his right to the
land in question in favor of Mariano <span class="SpellE">Duque</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, if Juana <span class="SpellE">Duque</span>
was the real owner of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 1083 she would not have

admitted that in 1931 Mariano <span class="SpellE">Duque</span> received Transfer
Certificate of Title No. 7501 for <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 1083 from the
government; that Mariano <span class="SpellE">Duque</span>, the holder, died and
in 1957 his children registered <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 1083 in their names
under Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-19924; and that upon the death of
Emilio <span class="SpellE">Duque</span> without issue, the defendants,
petitioners herein, had said <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 1083 recorded in their
names under Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-25195 in 1959.</p>

<p class="BODY">From 1931 the title to the land in question, Lot 1083, had always
been in the name of Mariano <span class="SpellE">Duque</span> and after his
death, in those of his children, the herein petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complaint was filed by Julia <span class="SpellE">Duque</span> only in September 1966 after the lapse of thirty-five
(35) years from the issuance of Transfer Certificate of Title No. 7501 to
Mariano <span class="SpellE">Duque</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The alleged possession by
the private respondents </span>of the land in question did not divest the
petitioners, as registered owners, of their rights to <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>

<p class="BODY">The alleged oral donation by Juana <span class="SpellE">Duque</span>
in favor of Julia <span class="SpellE">Duque</span> did not transfer any right
over <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 1083 to the <span class="SpellE">donee</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both under the Spanish Civil Code and the
Civil Code of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals must have realized the fatal infirmity of
the alleged verbal donation because it consi­dered the case "f<span style="">r</span>om the point of view of a verbal par­tition
among heirs made by the decedent and consented to by them."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There is no adequate showing that Mariano <span class="SpellE">Duque</span>
con­sented in 1927 to a verbal partition made by Juana <span class="SpellE">Duque</span>
wherein she gave the property in question, <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 1083, to
Julia <span class="SpellE">Duque</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the contrary, in 1931, after full payment of the purchase price,
Mariano <span class="SpellE">Duque</span> obtained in his name Transfer
Certificate of Title No. 7501 for <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 1083 from the

<p class="BODY">The improbability of the alleged oral partition be­comes more
evident when it is considered that <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 1083 is
registered land and any transaction affecting registered land should be
evidenced by a <span class="SpellE">registerable</span> deed.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>
