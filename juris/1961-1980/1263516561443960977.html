				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Direct appeal, by defendants Manila Port Service and/or Manila Railroad
Company, from a decision of the Court of First Instance of Manila - on appeal
from an adverse decision of the municipal court of Manila - sentencing them to
pay, jointly and severally, to plaintiff, <span class="SpellE">Filipro</span>,
Inc., the aggregate sum of P960.54, plus P100, as and for attorney’s fees, in
addition to the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">The pertinent facts are not disputed, the case having been
submitted for decision to the Court of First Instance of Manila upon a
stipulation of facts.</p>

<p class="BODY">This is an action to recover the value of imported goods
discharged, at the <st1:place><st1:placetype>port</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename>Manila</st1:placename></st1:place>,
unto the custody of the defend­ants, as operators of the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
service in that port, and not delivered, or delivered in bad order and
condition, to the plain­tiff, as consignee or owner of said goods.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no issue as to the amount of goods
lost or damaged, and the extent of defend­ants' liability, if any, <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The points
in controversy are: (1) whether plaintiff's claims had been filed within the
time pres­cribed in paragraph 15 of the management contract between the
defendants, which is, admittedly, binding upon the plaintiff; and (2) whether
the present action has been commenced within the periods specified in said
paragraph, the pertinent part of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> in
any event the CONTRACTOR<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
shall be relieved and released of any and all responsibility or liability for
loss, damage, <span class="SpellE">misdelivery</span>, and/or non-delivery of
goods, unless suit in the court of proper jurisdiction is brought within x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> one (1) year from the date of
discharge of the goods, or from the date when the claim for the value of such
goods has been rejected or denied by the CONTRACTOR, provided that such claim
shall have been filed with the CONTRACTOR within fifteen (15) days from the
date of discharge of the last package from the carrying vessel. <span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In order to hold the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operator
liable for goods lost or damaged, the claimant should, pursuant to this
provision, take two (2) steps, namely: 1) he must file with the operator a
claim for the value of said goods "within fifteen (15) days from the date
of discharge of the last package from the carrying vessel"<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>;
and 2) suit should be brought, in the court of proper jurisdiction,
"within x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> one (1)
year from the date of discharge of the goods or from the date when the claim
for the value of such goods has been rejected or denied. "</p>

<p class="BODY">The present action involves seven (7) shipments of condensed milk
and infant food.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
The last package of the first shipment was discharged from the carrying vessel
on <st1:date year="1962" day="15" month="1">January 15, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff filed a provisional claim on <st1:date year="1962" day="19" month="1">January 19, 1962</st1:date> and a formal claim
on <st1:date year="1962" day="16" month="3">March 16, 1962</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The last package of the second shipment was discharged on <st1:date year="1962" day="22" month="1">January 22, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff filed a provisional claim on <st1:date year="1962" day="2" month="2">February 2, 1962</st1:date> and a formal claim on
<st1:date year="1962" day="23" month="2">February 23, 1962</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The last packages of the third and fourth shipments were dis­charged
on February 1 and 5, 1962, respectively.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Plaintiff filed provisional claims on <st1:date year="1962" day="13" month="2">February 13, 1962</st1:date> and formal claims on <st1:date year="1962" day="23" month="2">Fe­bruary 23, 1962</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The last packages of the fifth and sixth shipments were dis­charged
on March 8 and 9, 1962, respectively.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Plaintiff filed pro­visional claims on <st1:date year="1962" day="15" month="3">March 15, 1962</st1:date> and formal claims on <st1:date year="1962" day="3" month="4">April 3, 1962</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The last package of the seventh and last shipment was dis­charged
on <st1:date year="1962" day="13" month="3">March 13, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff filed a provisional claim on <st1:date year="1962" day="20" month="3">March 20, 1962</st1:date> and a formal claim on <st1:date year="1962" day="10" month="4">April 10, 1962</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It thus appears that the <u>provisional</u> claims in connection
with each one of these seven (7) shipments were filed <u>within</u> 15 days
from the discharge of the last package.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Defendants maintain, however, that inasmuch as said period had expired
before the filing of the <u>formal</u> claims, plaintiff should be deemed
barred from recovering the corresponding indemnity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This pretense is predicated upon the theory
that the aforementioned provisional claims are not claims "for the
value" of the goods lost, damaged or not delivered to the plaintiff.</p>

<p class="BODY">Such theory is manifestly untenable, for: (1) it assumes that the
claim must <u>state the value</u> of said goods, which the above-quoted
paragraph 15 does <u>not</u> require; and (2) a provisional claim may be
sufficient, <u>even if the value of the goods involved were not stated therein</u>,
if it describes said goods sufficiently to permit its identification by the
operator and the determination by the latter of the facts relevant thereto,
such as the name of the carrying vessel, its date of arrival, the corresponding
bill of lading or other shipping documents in which the value of the goods is
set forth, etc., "while the facts are still fresh in the minds of the
persons who took part in the transaction and while the pertinent documents are
still available.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, in Domestic Insurance Co. v. Manila Railroad Co.,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
we explicitly declared that "x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> The circumstance that the provisional claim did not
specify the value of the loss" does not detract from the fact that said
claim "<u>still substantially fulfills</u> the requirements of the
contract aforementioned (State Bonding &amp; Insurance Co. vs. Manila Port
Service, <u>supra</u>), and is <u>not</u> a defense against the claim of the
consignee for recovery after it shall have ascertained later its actual loss or
damage. x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">x</span></span><span class="GramE"> .</span> "</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the question whether the present action has been
seasonably filed, it should be noted that, pursuant to the aforementioned
paragraph 15, the suit should be brought "within one year from the date of
discharge of the goods or from the date when the claim for the value of such
goods has been rejected or denied" by the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
operator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complaint in this case was
filed on <st1:date year="1963" day="7" month="10">October 7, 1963</st1:date>,
or over one (1) year from the dates of discharge of the goods involved therein
- from January 15 to <st1:date year="1962" day="13" month="3">March 13, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The issue thus narrows down to whether the
case has been commenced within one (1) year from the date when plaintiff's
claims have been "rejected or denied" by the contractor.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering, however, that said claims have not been ex­pressly
rejected or denied by the defendants, the latter argue that the period for the
filing of plaintiff's complaint should be computed <u>solely</u> from the date
of discharge from the carrying vessel.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This pretense is untenable for it conveniently overlooks the fact that
plaintiff has, under the management contract, <u>two</u> (2) periods within
which to file its action, namely: (a) one (1) year from the date of discharge
of the goods; <u>and</u> (b) one (1) year from the rejection or denial of its
claim for the value thereof.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Obviously, defendants cannot, by not acting on plaintiff's claims, one way or
another, <u>deprive</u> the plaintiff of <u>one</u> of these alternatives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, such would be the result, were we to
accept defendants' contention.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, in the absence of any act or omission
clearly indicating the rejection or denial of said claims by the de­fendants,
the right of the plaintiff to sue them might be questionable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, it has been repeatedly held, that, in
case of inaction on the part of the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
operator, he shall be deemed to have rejected or denied the importer's
provisional or formal claim <u>upon expiration of one (1) year</u> from the
date when the last package was discharged and that the period within which to
file suit shall <u>then</u> <u>begin</u> to run.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Inasmuch as the shipments under consideration were discharged
from January 15 to March 13, 1962, the claims <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
should not be considered denied or rejected <u>until January 15 to March 13,
1963</u>, so that plaintiff had one (1) year <u>from these dates</u> within
which to file suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The present action
was instituted within said period.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b><span style="">,</span>
the decision appealed from should be, as it is hereby affirmed, with costs
against defendants-appellants, Manila Port Service and/or Manila Railroad Co.</p>
