<span class="SpellE">Sia</span> and Alice <span class="SpellE">Sia</span>,
respectively.</span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="">On May 26, 1962 <span class="SpellE">Felimon</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tse</span> and Alice <span class="SpellE">Tse</span>, thru
their guardian <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>litem</u></span>, <span class="SpellE">Ismaela</span> <span class="SpellE">Dawat</span>, filed a petition
with the above-named court for <span style="">a </span>change
of their names to <span class="SpellE">Florimon</span> <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Sia</span></span><span style=""> </span>and Alice <span class="SpellE">Sia</span>, respectively, alleging
that they are brother and sister, 17 and 16 years old, respectively; that they
had been <u>bona</u> <u>fide</u> residents of <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span>
City for more than three years prior to the date of the filing of their
petition; that they had been using the names of <span class="SpellE">Florimon</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sia</span> and Alice <span class="SpellE">Sia</span>,
respectively, since birth and had used such names in school as well <span style="">as in </span>their social relations; that
unless their names are changed to those appearing in their school records, they
might encounter difficulties <span style="">in </span>their
pursuit for higher education.</p>

<p class="BODY">The City Attorney of <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> City, on
behalf of the Solicitor General, opposed the petition on the ground that the
principal reason relied upon in support thereof, namely, that they might
encounter difficulties in pursuing higher education if their names are not
changed, was not a sufficient cause for <span style="">a </span>change of name.</p>

<p class="BODY">After proper publication of the petition and due hear­ing, the
court rendered the appealed judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts alleged in the petition have been clearly established
by petitioners' evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">In </span>fact, raising no factual question at
all, the brief submitted by the Solicitor General urges Us to reverse the
appealed decision only upon the following grounds:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that the lower court erred in enter­taining
the petition <span class="SpellE">inspite</span> of the fact that it was verified
by petitioners themselves who were still minors at the time, and in holding
that there is sufficient reason for changing their names.</p>

<p class="BODY">In connection with the first ground, <span class="GramE">We</span>
find that Section 2 of Rule 103 of the Rules of Court provides that <span style="">a </span>petition
for change of name shall be signed and verified "by the person desiring
his name changed, or some other person on his behalf".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No provision contained in said rule requires
that <span style="">a </span>person
desiring to change his name should be of age and that if he is a minor the
verification made by him is of no legal effect.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, in accordance with Article 316, paragraph 1 of the New
Civil Code, the father and the mother have, with respect to their <span class="SpellE">unemancipated</span> children, the duty to re­present them in all
actions which redound to their benefit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the present case, the basic petition shows that the same was filed in
the name of the minor petitioners, assisted by their mother as their guardian <u>ad</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>litem</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Whether the latter was or was not actually appointed by the lower court
in that capacity seems to be of little consequence considering that under the
legal provision just cited she may be deemed to have filed the petition jointly
with her children or in their behalf.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lastly, it may not be amiss to remember that the jurisdiction of
courts over the subject matter depends upon the nature of the action or
proceeding and not upon the capacity or incapacity to sue on the part of one of
the parties; neither is it an absolute pre-requisite to juris­diction over an
action by <span style="">a </span>minor
that he sue by guardian <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>litem</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The action is not deemed void on such ground
alone because if the lack or absence of a guardian <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>litem</u></span> constitutes any defect at all, the same is
amendable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the present case, it is
clear that the lower court was fully cognizant of the fact that the mother of the
petitioners appeared as their guardian <u><span style="">ad</span></u><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>litem</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This being so, the </span>lack of any
positive proof that no order appointing her as such has ever been issued
justifies the presumption either that she was actually so appointed or that the
lower court inferentially authorized her appearance as such.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the question of whether or not there <span style="">is </span>sufficient reason to justify the
change of name, <span class="GramE">We</span> are clearly of the view that there
is such reasonable necessity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it is
true - as has been established by the evidence - that peti­tioners had been
using the names of <span class="SpellE">Florimon</span> <span class="SpellE">Sia</span>
and Alice <span class="SpellE">Sia</span> for school purposes and that their
respective school records are under the names <span class="GramE">aforesaid,
that,</span> in our opinion, constitutes by itself a valid ground upon which to
authorize the change of their names.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
this connection it must be taken into account that, according to the evidence,
the <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">chinese</span></span> surname <span class="SpellE">Tse</span> is really the same as or equivalent to <span class="SpellE">Sia</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the decision appealed from being in accordance
with law and the evidence, the same is hereby affirmed, without costs.</p>
