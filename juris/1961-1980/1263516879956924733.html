to us by the Court of Appeals for resolution as involving purely legal
questions, principally as to whether due process was denied to the
accused-appellants by the Justice of the Peace Court of <span class="SpellE">Virac</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Catanduanes</span>, in a criminal case <a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
wherein the latter, reacting to said accused-appellants' failure to appear and
adduce evidence in their defense at a scheduled hearing, despite seasonable
notice, and in view of previous repeated continuance, deemed the case submitted
for 'decision after rejecting the defense counsels' last-minute motion for continuance
on the ground that their clients were suddenly taken ill, and rendered a
judgment of conviction on the basis of the evidence already presented by the
prosecution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants Miguel Mendez and Segundo <span class="SpellE">Gianan</span>
were two of several persons<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
accused of the crime of slander by deed<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> in </span>a
complaint filed on 20 January 1962 in the Justice of the Peace Court of <span class="SpellE">Virac</span> by the aggrieved party, Alberto R. David.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Many postponements and continuances
characterized the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The proceedings
below liter­ally commenced and ended with motions seeking adjournment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The initial hearing set for 26 March 1962 was postponed upon
motion of the complainant on the ground that he would take his oath as director
of the League of Liberal Party Legal Officers in Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reset for 3 May 1962, it was again postponed
upon motion of the complainant on the ground that he would appear as counsel in
a certain administrative case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Set for
22 June 1962, it was postponed for the third time, for the reason that the
accused, Miguel Mendez and Castor Vargas, were absent and their co-accused,
Segundo <span class="SpellE">Gianan</span>, Pedro <span class="SpellE">Gianan</span>,
and Joel Vargas, although present in court, manifested through their counsel
that they were not ready for trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">Likewise suspended were the subsequent hearings set for 9 July,
10 July, 3 August, and 22 August 1962.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These were postponed for various reasons:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On 9 July, the defense questioned the
personality of the private prosecutor to conduct the prosecution without
authority from either the town chief of police or the Office of the Provincial
Fiscal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the 10th, the as­sistant
provincial fiscal assigned to handle the case requested for more time to study
the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On 3 August complainant got
sick, and on 22 August accused Segundo <span class="SpellE">Gianan</span> was sick
in his turn.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, on 10 October 1962, the lower court was able to start
the trial which it previously re-scheduled for three consecutive days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The prosecution began presenting evidence
until the following day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the 12th,
how­ever, accused Castor Vargas allegedly suffered a stroke and the parties
were forced to agree to a continuance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This was fixed on 5 November 1962 up to the 8th of the same month.</p>

<p class="BODY">But once again further continuance was prayed for by the defense,
giving as an excuse this time the inability of accused <span class="SpellE">Gianan</span>
to appear at the hearings set by the court due to the fact that he was in
Manila at­tending to his wife who was allegedly under medical treatment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was granted by the court.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="10" month="12">10 December 1962</st1:date>,
the trial was resumed and the prosecution continued presenting evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next hearing was also fixed and set for 3
January 1963 and the following two days.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 3 January 1963, the prosecution adduced some more
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, it rested its
case, with the court admitting all the exhibits.</p>

<p class="BODY">During the same hearing, the defense manifested its intention to
file a motion to dismiss the case on the ground of irregularity of the
complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The following discussion
transpired thereat:</p>

<blockquote>"Atty.
<span class="SpellE">Monjardin</span>:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Since there is no conspiracy in this case the accused herein cannot be
joined in one complaint and because of this representation will present a
memorandum to support our argument.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Court:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this connection, the Court gives you up to
Monday to submit and then we will proceed with this case.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Atty.
<span class="SpellE">Monjardin</span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
least ten days.</blockquote>

<blockquote>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <span style="">x
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Court:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I will give ten days, but if the case will be
again postponed the Court will be constrained to have the case deemed submitted
for decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I will give you up to
January 14.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Atty.
David:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We beg for further
enlightenment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After they fail to
submit, continuation of trial on the merits?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Court:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Failure of defense to do that, case is submitted.</blockquote>

<blockquote>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <span style="">x -
- - - - - - - - - - - - - -<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"</span>Court:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case is definitely scheduled on
Friday.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Memorandum must be submitted
Jan. <span class="GramE">14,</span> trial of this case is definitely on Jan. 23,

<p class="BODY">Came 23 January 1963, the date set for the next hearing, but the
accused-appellants were nowhere in court when their case was called.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this juncture, one of the defense counsels
asked for a thirty-minute recess to look for them.</p>

<p class="BODY">When the session was resumed, the accused-appellants were still
missing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason was supplied by
their counsel thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Atty.
<span class="SpellE">Monjardin</span>:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Your Honor, the defense wishes to manifest that two of the accused, the
persons of Miguel Mendez and Segundo <span class="SpellE">Gianan</span> could not
be present in Court because they thought the hearing of the case would be on
Jan. 24 . . . .<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Besides), no notice of
hearing was issued (to the bondsmen) and it is a matter of knowledge in criminal
cases that not only the <span class="GramE">accused are</span> to be notified of
the hearing but also the bondsmen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
improper to enter trial now.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Miguel Mendez
has sent me from <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> a medical
certificate which I request . . . . (<span class="GramE">to</span> be) made part
of the record; and Segundo <span class="SpellE">Gianan</span> was stricken ill
only this morning, however no medical certificate could be presented now by
this representation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are asking
permission to submit said medical certificate in due time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because of the absence of the two accused,
hearing cannot proceed because it is the right of the accused to be
present."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Acting on the foregoing manifestation, the lower court made the
following observation:</p>

<blockquote>"Court<span class="GramE">:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>. . . .</span> (L<span class="GramE">)<span class="SpellE">ast</span></span> January 3, 1963, . . . . (<span class="GramE">the</span> Court) acceded to counsel's manifestation to file a
memorandum to support their conten­tion for the dismissal of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this connection counsel for the accused
even committed himself to the Court that the memorandum would be submitted
within ten days and the Court was made to understand that (with his) failure to
file the same, the continuation of the hearing will definitely go on . . .
.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the accused was given
opportunity to file that memorandum . . . . <span class="GramE">yet</span> no
memorandum was filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And <span class="GramE">now, . . . .</span> <span class="GramE">the</span> defense (claims
that it) is not ready for trial (because neither the two accused Miguel Mendez
and Segundo <span class="SpellE">Gianan</span> nor their witnesses are present) .
. . .<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be borne in mind that
this case has been dragging on for a long time."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span class="GramE">;</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="GramE"><span style="">denied</span></span><span style=""> </span>the
motion for continuance as a mere subterfuge to delay the trial; and ruled that,
"under the circumstances", the case should be, as it was, deemed
submitted for decision.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After reviewing the evidence of the prosecution, the lower court
found the accused Miguel Mendez and <span style="">Segundo
</span><span class="SpellE">Gianan</span> guilty as charged, and sentenced them
to pay a fine of P<span style="">250.00 </span>each,
with subsidiary im­prisonment in case of insolvency, P180.00 as damages, and
costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other accused, Pedro <span class="SpellE">Gianan</span>, Castor Vargas, and Joel Vargas, were acquitted.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 15 March 1963, the judgment was promulgated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But present in court on that date was Segundo
<span class="SpellE">Gianan</span> only.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accused Miguel Mendez failed again, for unspecified reasons, to appear.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
He was merely provided with a copy of the decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">Both appealed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In their
common brief, three complaints were raised against the lower court:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) abuse of discretion in denying their
motion for continuance; (2) denial of due process in considering the case submitted
for decision without their evidence having been heard and duly appreciated; and
(3) unlawful promulgation of judgment insofar as Miguel Mendez is
concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Contending that a judgment
tainted with such "irre­gularities" is null and void, appellants now
want us to reverse their con­viction and to remand the case to the lower court
for reception of their evidence.</p>

<blockquote>(1)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The granting or
refusal of an application for continuance or postponement of the trial lies
within the sound discretion of the court.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
This rule is, even independently of statute, universally recognized.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
In this jurisdiction, the rule finds expression in the Rules of Court that
provides:</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 2.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><u>Continuance or
postponement of the trial</u>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>-
The court on the application of either party or on its own motion, may in its <u>discretion</u>
for good cause postpone the trial of the case for such periods as the ends of
justice and the right of the defendant to a speedy trial require."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Expounding on this judicial discretion, former Justice Malcolm
said:</p>

<blockquote>"Applications for continuances are addressed to the sound
discretion of the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this
respect, it may be said that the discretion which the trial court exercises
must be judicial and not arbitrary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is the guardian of the rights of the accused as well as those of the people at
large, and should not unduly force him to trial, nor for light causes
jeopardize the rights and interests of the public.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where he conceives it to be necessary for the
more perfect attainment of justice, it has the power upon the motion of either
party to continue the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But <u>a
party charged with a crime has no natural or inalienable right to a continuance</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>"<u>The ruling of the court will not be disturbed on appeal in
the absence of a clear abuse of discretion</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When the discretion of the court is exercised with a reasonable degree
of judicial acumen and fairness, it is one which the higher court is <span class="GramE">loathe</span> to review or to disturb.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial judge must be to a certain extent
free to secure speedy and expeditious trials when such speed and expedition are
not inconsistent with fairness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since
the court trying the case is, from personal observation, familiar with all the
attendant circumstances, and has the best opportunity of forming a correct opinion
upon the case presented, the presumption will be in favor of its action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>It would take an extreme case of abuse of
discretion to make the action of the trial court a denial of due process</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, we find no abuse of discretion on the part
of the Justice of the Peace Court of <span class="SpellE">Virac</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court <span style="">was, in fact, </span>too liberal in its grant of motions for
postponements and continuances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even
applications based on the most trivial causes which were usually not only unsubstantiated
but also prayed for only on the eleventh hour were granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the court had decided to put a stop to
this anomalous practice, its action should be, and it ought to be, upheld.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants asked for another continuance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether this request was made in good faith
was for the lower court to assess in view of its familiarity with the
surrounding circumstances of the case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If the court had reasons to doubt appellants' good faith and had a
well-founded belief that the application was merely intended for delay, its
denial thereof was no reversible error.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">During the next to the last hearing, appellants were duly
notified in court of the trial set for <st1:date year="1963" day="23" month="1">23
 January 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Aware of the
dozen postponements and continuances that had interrupted the proceedings, the
court even warned said appellants that it would no longer allow further delay
and would deem the case submitted for decision should attempt in this direction
be made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This warning was not contested
but was ignored.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellants absented
themselves in an obviously vain effort to force a continuance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their flimsy excuses that they thought that
the trial was on the 24th, that their bondsmen were not notified, and that they
suddenly got sick on the very day of the trial unmasked their scheme to defeat
the speedy and expeditious determina­tion of the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">While accused Miguel Mendez submitted a medical certificate
stating that he was suffering from <span class="SpellE">hematoma</span> and
swelling of the right leg and needed some rest, there was no showing that his
life or health would be endangered with his attendance of the trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His co-accused Segundo <span class="SpellE">Guianan</span>
did not even bother to submit a proof of his illness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under these circumstances, the lower court
wisely exercised its discretion<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
in denying the application in question.</p>

<blockquote>(2)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Appellants aver denial
to them of due process by the court below when the latter, after denying their
last minute plea for further continuance of the hearing, considered the case
submitted on <st1:date year="1963" day="23" month="1">23 January 1963</st1:date>
without receiving evidence for the defense.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This claim must be rejected, for the transcript clearly evidences that
the accused had waived their right to introduce evidence on their behalf.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The record (quoted in pages 3 and 4 of this decision) is clear
that on 23 January 1962 the defense had made its fourth successive move for continuance
on the plea that it wished to ask for the dismissal of the charges on the
ground of irregularity of the complaint (a step that should have been taken
before trial), and asked for ten days to file a memorandum in support of its
stand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court granted the accused
twelve days (up to 14 January), with the explicit warning that the case would
be considered submitted if no memorandum was filed, and reset the hearing for
the 23rd.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the accused made
no protest or remonstrance against the order.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="23" month="1">23 January 1963</st1:date>,
because the promised memorandum had not been filed, the trial court denied the
defense's further motions (its fifth since <st1:date year="1962" day="22" month="8">22 August 1962</st1:date>) for postponement and declared the case
submitted for decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead of
interposing a protest or motion for reconsideration, the defense merely stated
as follows (transcript, pages 97-98)</p>

<blockquote>"<u>Atty. <span class="SpellE">Monjardin</span></u>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We submit to whatever discretion the court
renders in regards to the case.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<u>Court:</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is the proper action for the court to
do.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defense being not ready to enter
trial today after having manifested during the last hearing that it will file a
memorandum to the effect that the case be dismissed and that counsel committed
himself that in case he could not file that memorandum up to January 14, 1963,
the case that is set for today, Jan. 23, 1963, will proceed without any further
postponement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the circumstances
wherein the defense is not ready as the two accused are not present and that
they have no witness, the court considers the case as submitted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view thereof, the case is submitted for
decision.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<u>Atty. <span class="SpellE">Monjardin</span></u>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Submitted</u>." (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE">Abriol</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Homeres</span>,
84 Phil. 525, 534, speaking of the right of the accused to be heard or to
present evidence in his defense before being sentenced, this Court ruled:</p>

<blockquote>"No court of justice under our system
of government has the power to deprive him of that right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>If the accused does not waive his right to
be heard</u> but on the contrary - as in this case - invokes that right, and
the court denies it to him, that court no longer has jurisdiction to proceed;
it has no power to sentence the accused without hearing him in his defense - -
- -." (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">But in this specific case now before us, the accused, instead of
invoking the right to submit evidence, waived said right and submitted the case
without proof in their behalf.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not only
this:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>they made no move for
reconsideration nor prayed for an opportunity to submit evidence before or after
the sentence <span class="GramE">was</span> promulgated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They raise the alleged violation of their
right to be heard for the first time on appeal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To grant that plea, reopen the case, and send it back for trial anew
would be to sanction the plainly dilatory tactics adopted by these appellants
to harass and tire out the complainant, who had had to travel all the way from <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
to <span class="SpellE">Virac</span> no less than twelve times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We refuse to be a party to such reprehensible
trifling with the orderly administration of justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A complainant is as much entitled to speedy
justice as the accused-appellants themselves.</p>

<blockquote>(3)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But there was no valid
promulgation of judgment in the case of appellant Miguel Mendez, because the
latter was not present during said promulgation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under section 6, Rule 116, of the old Rules
of Court, the defendant must be personally present during the promulgation of
judgment if <span style="">the </span>conviction is
for a grave or less grave offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
requirement is mandatory. "(I)n case of a failure to comply therewith the
sentence will be reversed, without disturbing the verdict, and the case
remanded with instructions to the court below to pronounce judgment in
accordance with the provisions of the statute."<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Considering that appellants were convicted of <span style="">a </span>less grave felony,<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
they having been sentenced to pay a fine of P250.00 each, the presence of every
one of them at the promulgation of the judgment below could not be dispensed
with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is, therefore, need to order
the trial court of <span class="SpellE">Virac</span> for proper promulgation of
its judgment against accused Mendez.</p>
