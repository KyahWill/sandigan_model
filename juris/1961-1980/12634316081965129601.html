				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">By this petition for <i>certiorari</i> filed on July 11, 1977,
petitioner seeks to set aside the orders of respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Vamenta</span> Jr. of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental - (1) dated March 25, 1977, granting a
Writ of Preliminary Mandatory Injunction, ordering herein petitioner to restore
to private respondents the possession of the land in question and to maintain
the status quo; restraining petitioner from harvesting and milling sugarcane,
and from further committing acts of dispossession, upon respondents filing a
bond in the sum of Five Thousand Pesos (P5,000); and (2) the order of May 19,
1977, which denied herein petitioners' "Motion for Reconsideration"
of the said order - which were issued in Civil Case No. 6469 for Specific
Performance With Preliminary Mandatory Injunction, entitled "<span class="SpellE">Genoveva</span> Gonzales, et al vs. Walter <span class="SpellE">Balasabas</span>,
et al.," on the grounds that respondent Judge acted with grave abuse of
discretion and there is no appeal or any plain, speedy and adequate remedy
available to petitioner (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 2-17).</p>

Judge reiterated the reasons and grounds stated in his Order sought to be set

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On January 18, 1978 after
pleadings have been filed - including the parties' respective memoranda -
private respondents, thru counsel, manifested that </span>on October 20, 1977,

of the Order dated March 25, 1977 subject of the petition <span style="">respondents . . . "have not actually
taken possession of the land in question and do not intend to do so" . . .
"that they . . . have no objection to petitioner's taking possession of

per Order of this Honorable Court dated March 25, 1977, defendants have been
ordered, among others, to restore plaintiffs to the possession of the land in
question the latter have not actually taken physical possession of the same and
do not intend to do so, considering that they have abandoned plans of cultivating
the area for sugarcane purposes in view of adverse economic conditions
affecting the sugar industry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>This
manifestation is made to inform this Honorable Court and defendants that
plaintiff would have no objection to defendants' taking possession of the
property in question, the aforesaid Order of the Court notwithstanding</u>."

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">Petitioner,
however, insists that the issues raised in the petition ". . . regardless
of the non-interest of the respondents to occupy the land in question . .

another inconsistent stand between now </span>and the time this petition is
restored." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 106;
