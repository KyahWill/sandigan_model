of his absence and tardiness, failed to bring out the <span class="SpellE"><i><span style="">expedientes</span></i></span><span style=""> </span>of cases on time during court hearings
causing, as a result thereof, undue delay in the termination of those cases;</p>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to a Resolution of this Court, <span style="">the </span>Executive Judge of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Catanduanes</span>, Hon. <span class="SpellE">Graciano</span> P. <span class="SpellE">Gayapa</span>, Jr., investigated the case on September 5, 8, 18
and 19, 1978.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After conducting the
investigation, said Investigating Judge submitted his findings and recommendations,
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Respondent without authority of law issued and signed an order
releasing from custody the accused in Criminal complaint No. 273 entitled 'People
of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
vs. Pedro San <span class="SpellE">Roque</span>'.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The receipt by respondent of the sum of P200.00 in civil case
No. 240 was <span style="">by </span>and upon the
authority of the plaintiff, which was in accordance with the compromise
agreement signed by the parties.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"No evidence was presented to substantiate the charge of
missing documents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, no evidence
was presented to show that a book in legal forms ever existed at all and that
there was no court calendar for two (2) years.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Respondent settled small money claims without any authority from
the complainant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In accordance with Sec.
17, Rule 5 of the New Rules of Court, small claims should be settled by the
judge himself.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Respondent gambled with some people on certain afternoons
inside the courthouse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, there
was no evidence presented to prove that <span class="SpellE">Sabido</span>
maintains a gambling den in his house.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The respondent in some instances disobeyed the orders of the
Judge and failed to attend meetings called by the former CFI Judge of the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Catanduanes</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"There was no evidence presented to substantiate the charge
that court proceedings were delayed due to frequent unauthorized absences of
respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, respondent was
found late in going to the office on the occasion of the official visit of CFI
Judge Jose <span class="SpellE">Nepomuceno</span> to the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Virac</span>, <span class="SpellE">Catanduanes</span> sometime in
1975.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The matter of reading newspaper during session was not so
serious a character to have disturbed the proceedings, otherwise respondent
should have been held in contempt of court at the time the afore-mentioned act
was done.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"There was no evidence to the effect that respondent's illness
was precipitated by his vicious habits or on account of his being addicted to
gambling." <span class="GramE">(Memorandum for the Chief Justice, dated
December 13, 1978, of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Macapagal</span>).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">The
Investigating Judge consequently recommends that respondent be reprimanded for
Charges Nos. 1, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9, and exonerated with respect to Charges Nos. 2,
3, 5 and 10.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There is no question that
the approval of the bail of an accused person and the authority to order his
release is purely a judicial function.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, this Court said in a previous case that the fiscal, unlike a
judicial authority, has no power to order either the commitment or the release
on bail of persons charged with penal offenses, and the confinement of such
persons after their case had been referred to the City Fiscal was but a mere
continuation of their illegal detention by the police officers.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">In
releasing the accused from custody, therefore, respondent unduly usurped the
judicial prerogative of the Presiding Judge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Respondent's </span><span style="">practice of summoning persons </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">the court for collection of debts and for settlement </span>of small
claims without authority from the presiding judge is again a clear case of
usurpation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to Section 17, Rule
5 of the Revised Rules of Court, the settlement of small claims should he done
by the judge himself.</p>

<p class="BODY">Further, the circumstances that respondent was seen gambling
inside the courthouse during office hours, had disobeyed the orders of the
judge, and had failed to attend official meetings and to perform his official
duties and obligations reflect gross irresponsibility, lack of discipline and a
patent unfitness for the position he is presently occupying.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of the afore-mentioned gross
misconduct, this Court hereby DISMISSES respondent Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Sabido</span>
from the service, effective upon receipt of a copy of this decision, with
forfeiture of retirement gratuity, if any.</p>
