				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On January 5, 1960, Rafael Mascariñas, Chief of Police of Davao City, 
received a copy of memorandum bearing the same date signed by City Mayor Carmelo 
L. Porras which, for ready reference, we quote hereunder:
<blockquote>
<p>"MEMORANDUM TO: <br>Patm. Angel Fuentecilla <br>Patm. 1st Class Domingo 
Larena <br>Patm. Flaviano Tinapay <br>Police Department <br>City of Davao</p>
<p>Effective immediately you are hereby detailed to the Illegal Fishing Unit of 
the Police Department. It is directed that you enforce to the limit the laws and 
ordinances on illegal fishing and to apprehend violators thereof. In the 
performance of your activities, you are entitled to the use of the outboard 
motor of the Police Department. It is also desired that periodic reports on the 
result of your activities be made to this Office.</p>
<p align="right">(Sgd.) CARMELO L. PORRAS<br>Mayor, City of 
Davao"</p></blockquote>
<p>In said memorandum the city mayor in effect ordered the detail of three 
members of the police force of the city to the Illegal Fishing Unit of the 
Police Department which was created to enforce the laws and ordinances on 
illegal fishing, requiring them at the same time to submit periodic reports to 
the Office of the City Mayor on the results of their activities.</p>
<p>Considering that the above-quoted memorandum in fringed his power as Chief of 
Police of the City of Davao and that, if not checked on time, might ultimately 
jeopardize his immediate direct control over the organization, government, 
discipline and disposition of the police force of Davao City, Rafael Mascariñas, 
in his capacity as chief of police, filed before the Court of First Instance of 
Davao a petition for prohibition with preliminary injunction seeking to annul 
the aforesaid memorandum and to prohibit respondent city mayor from enforcing1 
it as the same tends to strip him of his power over the affairs of the police 
department of the City of Davao.</p>
<p>The court <i>a quo</i> denied the prayer for a writ of preliminary injunction 
<i>ex parte</i> pending determination of the case, but required respondent to 
answer the petition within 10 days from receipt of the order.</p>
<p>Respondent, in his answer, justified the issuance of the disputed memorandum 
by intimating that it was issued in accordance with power of control and 
supervision given him by the Charter of the City of Davao in line with the 
ruling of the Supreme Court in the case of Porras vs. Avellana, 105 Phil., 1147. 
He also set up the defense that the aforesaid memorandum is but "the direct 
consequence of previous acts of petitioner which necessitated and justified its 
issuance."</p>
<p>On January 28, 1960, petitioner filed a motion for a bill of particulars 
asking that respondent be required to specify the alleged "previous acts of 
petitioner which necessitated and justified" the issuance of the memorandum in 
question so that petitioner could prepare a responsive reply, but relying on the 
assurance made by respondent that would present evidence on the alleged previous 
acts when the case is tried on the merits, petitioner desisted from pressing his 
bill of particulars and instead filed a reply denying knowledge of the alleged 
previous acts above adverted to. But, as the record discloses, no trial on the 
merits was had, and instead the case was Submitted for judgment on the 
pleadings, the issue involved being one of law. And on July 6, 1960, the court 
<i>a quo</i> rendered decision denying the petition based on our ruling in the 
case of Porras vs. Avellana, <i>supra</i>. In effect, the court <i>a quo 
</i>held that the respondent mayor has the power, under the charter of the city, 
to do directly what he is empowered to do thru his chief of police. It upheld 
the validity of the memorandum issued by respondent.</p>
<p>Petitioner has appealed.</p>
<p>It should be recalled that respondent mayor issued the memorandum in dispute 
detailing three members of the police force of the City of Davao to the Illegal 
Fishing Unit of the Police Department in order that they may exert efforts to 
enforce the laws and ordinances on illegal, fishing within the city, and 
requiring them to Submit periodic reports to his office on the results of their 
activities. It should also be noted that the memorandum was addressed directly 
to the patrolmen concerned and only a copy there of was furnished the chief of 
police. This action was resented by the chief of police who considered it as an 
invasion of his power, control and supervision over the police and detective 
force of the City of Davao. He contends that if such action is tolerated and not 
checked on time respondent mayor might ultimately strip him of his power and 
control over his organization.</p>
<p>The question that now arises is: Can the issuance of the memorandum in 
question be justified as a valid exercise of the power of control and 
supervision that the Charter of the City of Davao grants to the city mayor?</p>
<p>The answer to this question requires an analysis of the pertinent provisions 
of the City Charter of Davao which, or purposes of our discussion, merely refer 
to Sections 9, 16 and 33 of Commonwealth Act No. 51, as amended. Said sections 
provide:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SEC. 9. <i>General powers and duties of the Mayor</i>.—As chief exeutive of 
the city government, the Mayor <i>shall have immediate control over the 
executive and administrative functions of the different department</i>, subject 
to the supervision of the Secretary of the Interior, and shall be held 
accountable for the proper administration of all affairs of the city." (Italics 
supplied)</p>
<p>"SEC. 16. <i>City departments</i>—<i>Municipal Court</i>.—There shall be a 
department of engineering and public works headed by the city engineer; a law 
department headed by the city attorney; a finance department headed by the city 
treasurer; a police department headed by the chief of police; and a fire 
department headed by the chief of the fire department and such other departments 
as may fom time to time be established by law or ordinance approved by the 
proper Head of Department. * * *"</p>
<p>SEC. 33. <i>Powers and duties of heads of department</i>.—Each of the 
department of the city government shall be in control of such department, 
<i>under the supervision and control of the Mayor </i>and shall possess such 
power as may be prescribed therein or by ordinance. * * * (Italics 
supplied)</p></blockquote>
<p>Note that, under Section 9, the city mayor is given <i>immediate contro</i>l 
over the executive and administrative functions of the different departments, 
one of which being the police department headed by the chief of police (Section 
16), Note also that, under Section 33, each head of the department is given 
control of his department, subject to "the supervision and control of the 
mayor." It, therefore, becomes important to define the extent and scope of the 
terms "supervision" and "control" employed in the charter under 
consideration.</p>
<p>In Mondano vs. Silvosa 97 Phil., 143; 51 Off. Gaz. 2884; we said that "In 
administrative law, <i>supervision</i> means overseeing or the power or 
authority of an officer to see that subordinate officers perform their duties. 
If the latter fail or neglect to fulfill them the former may take such action or 
step as prescribed by law to make them perform these duties. <i>Control</i> on 
the other hand, means the power of an officer to alter or modify or nullify or 
set aside what a subordinate officer had done in the performance of his duties 
and to substitute the judgment of the former for that of the latter." (Italics 
supplied)</p>
<p>It is clear that respondent mayor not only can exercise supervision over the 
chief of police who comes under him in connection with the performance of his 
official duties in order that they may be properly fulfilled, but also immediate 
control in the sense that he can alter, modify nullify, or set aside what the 
latter may have done to the extent of substituting his own judgment for that of 
his subordinate officer in connection with the activities of the latter's 
office. This power of supervision and control is so broad that it may justify 
interference with the functions of a subordinate officer when such is necessary 
in the interest of the service. Because of such control and supervision, it is 
evident that respondent was justified in issuing the memorandum in question it 
appearing that its purpose is to fill the positions in the Illegal Fishing Unit 
of the Police Department in order that the same may carry out its function of 
enforcing the laws and ordinances concerning illegal fishing within the 
jurisdiction of Davao City. The fact that the action taken by respondent mayor 
was direct is of no moment. It is enough that petitioner was notified of the 
action taken so that he may act accordingly.</p>
<p>The court <i>a quo</i> was justified in invoking our ruling in the case of 
Porras vs. Avellana, (<i>supra</i>), promulgated July 24, 1959, for the same 
concerns an interpretation of the extent and scope of the power of control 
vested in the mayor of Davao City by its charter. In that case we justified the 
action taken by the mayor in ordering the transfer of the finance and supply 
officer of the chief of police to the field in view of the power of supervision 
and control of the mayor under the city charter. The facts obtaining in both 
cases are parallel.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is affirmed, with costs against 
petitioner.</p> <i>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., Barrera, 
Paredes, Dizon, Regala,</i> and <i>Makalintal, JJ.</i>, concur.</div>
