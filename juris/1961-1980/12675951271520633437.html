				<BR><BR><div align=""><div class="Section1"><b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"></span></b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><o:p></o:p></span>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Napoleon <span class="SpellE">Magalit</span>, et al., all employees of the Philippine Charity 
Sweepstakes Office, filed a complaint for unfair labor practice with the Court 
of Industrial Relations against Geronimo Quadra, et al., charging them with a 
violation of the Magna <span class="SpellE">Carta</span> of Labor in that being 
supervisors they joined a union formed exclusively of rank and file employees of 
said office. Having found merit in the charge, a prosecutor of the court filed a 
formal complaint averring therein the requisite acts constituting the unfair 
labor practice complained of.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Notified of the charge, 
respondents answered denying the commission of the act imputed to them and 
alleging that the charge is but an election gimmick to discredit respondents in 
connection with the election of officers of the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes 
Employees Association for the year 1962 in order to bolster the chances of 
complainants who themselves were aspirants for the same or similar positions. 
Incidentally, respondents prayed that they be awarded damages in the amount of 
P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Honorable Jose 
S. Bautista, presiding judge, heard the case, and, thereafter, rendered decision 
dismissing the complaint.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> He found that under the charter 
creating the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office<span class="GramE">,<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style11"><sup>[</sup></span></span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style11"><sup>1]</sup></span> 
the general powers of the office are lodged in a board of directors, composed of 
five members, being its policy-determining body, and the general manager created 
therein is given the direction and control of the office in all matters not 
specifically reserved to the board. In addition, he is given the power to 
appoint the personnel of the office except the auditor and the personnel 
assigned to him, and in implementing the policies of the board, the general 
manager acts thru the department managers whose recommendations are merely <span class="SpellE">routinary</span> since the policies are already defined and fixed 
by the board. In short, he is of the opinion that the general manager is the 
only official in that office who may be considered as supervisor within the 
meaning of the Magna <span class="SpellE">Carta</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This decision was affirmed by the 
court <i>en banc</i>, with the dissent of Judge <span class="SpellE">Amando</span> 
C. <span class="SpellE">Bugayong</span>. The case is now before us on a petition 
for review.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The issue now to be resolved is: 
Is there any factual basis for the conclusion that respondents are not 
supervisors within the meaning of the Magna <span class="SpellE">Carta</span> of 
Labor?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Under the law, supervisor means 
"any person having authority * * * to hire, transfer, suspend, lay-off, recall, 
discharge, assign, recommend, or discipline other employees * * * or effectively 
to recommend such acts if, in connection with the foregoing, the exercise of 
such authority is not of a merely <span class="SpellE">routinary</span> or 
clerical nature but requires the use of independent judgment" (Section 2 (k) 
Republic Act No. 875). This means that a person holds a supervisory position if, 
among others, he can recommend acts that are not merely <span class="SpellE">routinary</span> or clerical but require the use of independent 
judgment. Do the positions occupied by respondents include the performance of 
acts other than <span class="SpellE">routinary</span>, or which require the use of 
discretion? Do they have the power in connection with the duties of their office 
to recommend the performance of acts which requires the use of independent 
judgment? To answer these questions it is necessary that we go to the nature of 
their positions and the functions and duties incident 
thereto.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In this connection, it is 
important that we take note of the statements the respondents have submitted to 
the Wage and Position Classification Office, WAPCO for short, denominated 
Position Description Forms wherein they made a detailed relation of their 
functions and duties. While the entries contained therein were personally made 
by the personnel concerned, they were all approved by their Department Heads and 
confirmed by the General Manager of the office. They were submitted to the WAPCO 
in order that this office may classify the positions then existing and may give 
them their proper classification and salary range. These statements are, 
therefore, official in character and as such, can be considered as the true 
index of the functions and duties of the employees concerned, since the law 
creating the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office does not mention any position 
other than that of the general <span class="GramE">manager,</span> it merely 
empowers him to appoint the subordinate personnel that may be necessary. Hence, 
it can readily be seen that that position cannot be regarded as the only 
supervisor in legal contemplation for he alone cannot discharge and carry out 
the work envisioned by the law-makers 'in creating the Philippine Charity 
Sweepstakes Office.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Now, what do these Position 
Description Forms contain relative to the functions and duties of respondents. 
To this effect it is enough that we take a look at what it is related under the 
title "Statement of Duties" appearing in each and everyone of them and this much 
we will find: that each and everyone exercise general supervision over a group 
of executive assistants in performing a variety of research, administrative and 
technical duties, or is given the power to recommend action on a variety of 
matters pertaining to the operation of the business of the office and, in 
general, each performs such other duties as may be assigned to them by the 
general manager. These duties are given them in addition to other functions that 
are peculiar to the positions they hold. And judging from their nature there is 
no doubt that these officials come within the category of supervisors within the 
meaning of Section 2 (k) of Republic Act 875.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is true that respondent 
Geronimo Quadra, besides his duties as chief legal officer, likewise <span class="GramE">acts as liaison officer between the Sweepstakes Office and those of 
Congress, the Civil Service Commission and the Office of the President, but this 
assignment does</span> not strip him of his regular function as supervisor. In 
other words, notwithstanding this assignment, his supervisory power over the 
personnel working in his office is retained. His character as supervisor is not 
nullified.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, the decision appealed 
from is reversed. It is hereby ordered that respondents cease to be member of 
respondent union, and as such should resign from the offices to which they had 
been elected. No costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
