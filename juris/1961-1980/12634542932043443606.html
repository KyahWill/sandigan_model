to the Court of Appeals but certified by the latter to this Court as a case
involving only pure questions of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">As shown by the stipulation of facts and its annexes, <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Revilla</span> was appointed
as Chief of Police of Santa Cruz, <span class="SpellE">Marinduque</span> in 1945;
after a term as deputy assessor (from March 1, 1947 to June 30, 1953), <span class="SpellE">Revilla</span> <span style="">was </span>re-appointed
as Chief of Police on 1 July 1953; and served as such since then, his latest
appoint­ment being <span style="">that </span>of 16
July 1959 as temporary<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Chief of Police, which was<span style=""> </span>attested
as such by the Commissioner of Civil Service on <span style="">5 February </span>1960; on 27 February 1960, he took the patrolman
examination (Qualifying) and passed <span style="">it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1960" day="16" month="1">16 January 1960</st1:date>,
however, the Municipal Mayor of <st1:city><st1:place>Santa <span style="">Cruz</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> appointed the petitioner-appellant, Domingo <span class="SpellE">Manay</span>, as </span>Chief <span style="">of Police and <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Revilla</span>
as Police Sergeant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same day, </span><span style="">the appointees took their oaths of office and
assumed their respective positions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On 30 October 1960, the respondent Commissioner of Civil Service,
in a return <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> to the Municipal Mayor,
approved as provisional<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
the appointment of <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Revilla</span>
as Chief of Police, effective 16 July 1959; informed the mayor that <span class="SpellE">Revilla</span> was entitled to retention and not replaceable even
by an appropriate civil service eligible, for having served continuously as
Chief of Police for more than five (5) years prior to the approval on 19 June
1959 of the Civil Service Act, Republic Act No. 22 60; and returned <u>without action</u>
<span class="SpellE">Revilla's</span> appointment as Sergeant, for being a
demotion.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 4 March 1961, <span class="SpellE">Revilla</span> protested with
the respondent Commissioner the appointment of <span class="SpellE">Manay</span>
as Chief of Police on the ground of non-observance of the rules on seniority
and merit and gross discrimination; on 15 March 1961, the Municipal Mayor
informed the Commissioner that protestant <span class="SpellE">Revilla</span> was
physically unfit to perform the work of a police officer because he suffers
from a limping gait and subject to seasonal attacks of rheumatism and has failed
to submit a physical examination certificate.</p>

<p class="BODY">Acting upon <span class="SpellE">Revilla's</span> protest, the
Commissioner found both <span class="SpellE">Manay</span> and <span class="SpellE">Revilla</span>
to be eligible for appointment as Chief of Police.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the Commissioner approved <span class="SpellE">Manay's</span> appointment as Chief of Police, not as permanent,
but only "for the period of actual services rendered <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>," </span>saying:</p>

<blockquote>"It would appear that at the time Mr. <span class="SpellE">Revilla</span>
was replaced <span style="">as </span>Chief of Police
by Mr. <span class="SpellE">Manay</span>, the former had rendered more than five
years of continuous and satisfactory service prior to <st1:date year="1959" day="19" month="6">June 19, 1959</st1:date>, the date of the approval of R. A.
2260. He had, therefore, a right of retention to the position (Chief of Police)
he was holding on June 19, 1959, pursuant to Paragraph 4 of Section 23 of
Republic Act 2260, which provides ‘<span style="">x x </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style=""> That non-eligible employees who, upon the
approval of this Act have rendered five years of (sic) more of continuous and
satisfactory service in Classified position and who meet the other
qualifications for appointment to their position, shall be accorded preferred
consideration: Provided, further, that those who fail in these </span>examinations
<span style="">as well as those who fail or refuses to
take the examinations when offered shall be <span style="">replaced by <span class="SpellE">eligibles</span>: x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>." </span>For this reason and as Mr. <span class="SpellE">Revilla</span> took the Patrolman (Q) examination held on February
27, 1960 and passed it <span class="SpellE">it</span> would seem that this
demotion from Chief to Sergeant of Police is not in order."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Manay</span> requested a reconsideration but
the Commissioner denied it on <st1:date year="1962" day="4" month="10">4
 October 1962</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Unsatisfied, petitioner-appellant Domingo <span class="SpellE">Manay</span>
filed in the Court of First Instance of <span style="">Manila
a </span>petition for certiorari and mandamus (docketed as Civil Case No.
52149) seeking the annul­ment of the action taken by the Commissioner of Civil
Service and to have his (<span class="SpellE">Manay’s</span>) appointment
approved <span style="">as </span>permanent.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court denied the petition and <span class="SpellE">Manay</span>
interposed and appeal to the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The appellate court, as <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>, certified
the case to us.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find no merit in this appeal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No adequate factual premises exist for the petitioner-appellant's charge
that respondent Civil Service Commissioner acted with grave abuse of discretion
in disregarding the alleged physical unfitness of <span class="SpellE">Revilla</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the respondent passed the matter <u><span style="">sub</span></u><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>silencio</u></span> </span>but had approved <span class="SpellE">Revilla's</span> appointment as Chief of Police as provisional
only, the records do not show why the appointment was approved as provisional,
and it cannot be said that the respondent had, in fact, disregarded <span class="SpellE">Revilla's</span> physical condition and had abused his
discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyway, as <span style="">pointed out by the Solicitor General, the
alleged disability could hardly be true, because <span class="SpellE">Revilla</span>
not only served as Chief of Police for more than five years, but was appointed
by the protesting Mayor as Police Sergeant, a position that demands more
physical </span>exertion <span style="">on the p</span><span style="">a</span><span style="">r</span><span style="">t </span><span style="">of the appointee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner-appellant
argues that <span class="SpellE">Revilla's</span> protest is already barred by <span class="SpellE">laches</span> for having been filed after more than one </span>year
from the time the petitioner was appointed as Chief of Police on <st1:date year="1960" day="16" month="1">16 January 1960</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The cases relied upon by him (Madrid vs. Auditor
General, 108 Phil. 578; <span class="SpellE">Agapuyan</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Ledesma</span>, L-10535, 25 April <span style="">1957) do</span> <span style="">not apply in
the present case, because <span class="SpellE">Revilla’s</span> protest was an unnecessary
act; as early </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">30 October 1960, the Commissioner had </span><u>favorably</u>
acted <span style="">upon <span class="SpellE">Revilla's</span>
appointment as Chief of Police and disapproved his demotion to Sergeant. <span style="">&nbsp;</span><span class="SpellE">Revilla</span> could not
have brought suit in Court while the Civil Service Commissioner had not </span><span style="">acted on the appointment of <span class="SpellE">Manay</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Nor may <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> for accepting the
position as Sergeant operate to block <span class="SpellE">Revilla</span> in
assuming the position of Chief of Police because when <span class="SpellE">Manay</span>
was appointed as Chief of Police on 16 January 1960, he went on leave and <span class="SpellE">Revilla</span> continued to discharge the duties of Chief of
Police.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to the petitioner, he has passed the probationary
period of six months and, on this account, his appointment should already be
permanent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, the law which the
respondent Commissione<span style="">r</span>
implemented, as was his duty to do, gives preference to <span class="SpellE">Revilla</span>.</p>

<blockquote>"Qualifications in an appropriate examination shall be required
for appointment to positions in the <span style="">c</span>ompetitive
or classified service in accordance with the civil service rules, except as
otherwise provided for in this Act: Provided, That whenever there is a civil
service eligible available for appoint­ment, no person who is not such an
eligible shall be appointed even in a temporary capacity to any vacant position
in the competitive or classified government-owned or controlled corporation: <u>Provided,
further, That non-eligible </u><u><span style="">employ</span></u><u><span style="">ees who, upon the approval </span></u><u><span style="">of this Act, have rendered five years or more
of continuous and satisfactory service in classified positions and who </span></u><u><span style="">m</span></u><u><span style="">eet the other qualifications for appointment to their positions, shall,
within one year from the approval of this Act, be given qualifying examinations
in </span></u><u><span style="">which their length</span></u><u><span style=""> of satisfactory service shall be accorded
preferred consideration</span></u><span style="">:
Provided, further, That those who f</span><span style="">ail
</span><span style="">in those examinations as </span><span style="">well as those who fail or refuse </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">take the </span><span style="">examinations when offered shall be replaced by <span class="SpellE">eligibles</span>
x </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">x</span>." </span><span style="">(Par.
4, Sec.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>23, Republic Act </span><span style="">2260) </span><span style="">(Underscoring supplied)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Conversely, if <span class="SpellE">Manay’s</span></span> appointment is approved as permanent, such
approval would contravene the above legal <span style="">provision.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Since, by statute, the petitioner-appellant possesses an inferior
right to the position, a ruling as to the availability of the remedy of
mandamus to compel the respondent to approve the appellant's appointment as
permanent is unnecessary, petitioner having no right to permanence anyway.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>For the foregoing reasons</b>, the Appealed decision is hereby
affirmed, with costs against the appellant Domingo <span class="SpellE">Manay</span>.</p>
