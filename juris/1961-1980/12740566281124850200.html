				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This case originated in the Justice of the Peace Court of Guiuan, Samar. A 
complaint was filed there by the present appellants on April 12, 1950, alleging 
that the defendants, appellees here, were unlawfully detaining two (2) qounset 
huts owned by appellants and leased by them to appellees under a verbal contract 
entered into on November 1, 1949. It was further alleged that the rental agreed 
upon was P400.00 a month, but that appellees had failed to pay the same from the 
time the lease agreement started, notwithstanding repeated demands for such 
payment.
<p>A motion to dismiss was filed by appellees on the ground that the complaint 
did not allege facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The motion was 
denied by the Justice of the Peace Court. The hearing of the case was postponed 
several times upon motion of appellees. The last motion for postponement, 
however, was denied upon appellants' objection, and the trial proceeded in the 
absence of the adverse parties, after which, judgment was rendered, ordering 
them to vacate the premises described in the complaint and to pay the sum of 
P500.00 as rentals from November 1, 1949 to March 31, 1950.</p>
<p>The case was appealed to the Court of First Instance of Samar, where 
appellees filed their answer to the complaint. In the answer of Santiago 
Gangcayco he alleged as special defense that the quonset huts in question had 
been sold to Raymond Tomassi. In his separate answer Tomassi raised, among his 
special defenses, the question of jurisdiction on the part of the Justice of the 
Peace Court.</p>
<p>On December 27, 1950 the Court of First Instance of Samar issued an order 
dismissing the case on the ground that the Justice of the Peace Court had lost 
its jurisdiction by reason of the several postponements granted by it and 
therefore the Court of First Instance did not acquire appellate jurisdiction at 
all. An appeal from that order was taken to us (G. R. No. 9320), and this Court 
rendered judgment on January 31, 1956, stating that the case should have been 
tried on the merits by the Court of First Instance and remanding the record for 
that purpose.</p>
<p>On May 15, 1956 the Court of First Instance again issued an order dismissing 
the appeal of appellees and remanding the case in turn to the Justice of the 
Peace Court for execution of its judgment. From that order appellees elevated 
the matter to this Court by certiorari (G. R. No. L-11335 and G. R. No. 
L-11450); and on October 30,1958, we rendered judgment ordering the Court of 
First Instance to proceed with the trial on the merits. On June 23, 1959, the 
Court of First Instance, after conducting the trial as ordered, rendered its 
decision again dismissing the complaint, this time on the ground that the 
Justice of the Peace Court did not acquire original jurisdiction in view of the 
absence of any allegation in the complaint that the plaintiffs, appellants here, 
had made demand upon the defendants to vacate the two huts in question. 
Appellants filed a motion for reconsideration, and upon denial thereof, 
perfected the present appeal. Their prayer is that the dismissal be set aside 
and the court ordered to render judgment in accordance with the oral and 
documentary evidence adduced during the trial.</p>
<p>The issue here, is whether or not original jurisdiction was acquired by the 
Justice of the Peace Court, considering the allegations in the complaint. If 
it did acquire such jurisdiction, then the Court of First Instance, acting as 
appellate court, should consider the evidence presented. On the other hand, if 
the Justice of the Peace Court did not acquire jurisdiction, the only recourse 
for the Court of First Instance was to issue the order of dismissal, as it 
did.</p>
<p>We have gone over the allegations of the complaint and found nothing there to 
the effect that a demand had been made upon the defendants to vacate the 
premises in question. What allegation there was refers to a demand for payment 
of the rentals agreed upon. Such allegation, according to the consistent ruling 
of this Court, is insufficient to confer jurisdiction upon the Justice of the 
Peace Court. in an action of unlawful detainer. Thus in Canaynay vs. Sarmiento, 
79 Phil. p. 36, it was held:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The fact that it is alleged in the complaint that defendants failed to pay 
the rents since after August 25, 1923, does not make unlawful defendant's 
withholding of possession of the property. Mere failure to pay rents does not 
ipso facto make unlawful tenant's possession of the premises. It is the owner's 
demand for tenant to vacate the premises, when the tenant has failed to pay the 
rents on time, and tenant's refusal or failure to vacate, which make unlawful 
withholding of possession. There is no legal obstacle for the owner to allow a 
defaulting tenant to remain in the rented property one month, one year, several 
years, or even decades. That consent, no matter how long it may last, makes 
lawful tenant's possession. Only when that consent Is withdrawn and the owner 
demands tenant to leave the property is the owner's right of possession asserted 
and the tenant's refusal or failure to move out makes his possession unlawful, 
because it is violative of the owner's preferential right of possession." (See 
also Robles vs. San Jose, 99 Phil., 658; 52 Off. Gaz., 6193; Rickards vs. 
Gonzales, 109 Phil., 423).</p></blockquote>
<p>WHEREFORE, the judgment appealed from is affirmed, with costs,</p>
