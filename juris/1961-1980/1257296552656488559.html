				<H3>FLORENCIO REDOBOS, PETITIONER, VS. WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION COMMISSION, ET AL., RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Florencio Rebodos was an employee of the Benguet Consolidated, Inc. having 
worked it continuously from September 1, 1948 to April 17, 1958 in various 
capacities, such as mucker, miner, and miner <i>capataz</i>, and during said 
period he contracted tuberculosis with the result that he was separated from the 
service on the date last mentioned. Hence, he filed a claim for compensation 
with Regional Office No. 1, Department of Labor, Dagupan City, seeking to be 
paid the compensation to which he is entitled under the law consequent upon his 
separation from the service as a result of such sickness.
<p>The case was docketed as B.W.C. Case No. 422-ROI and was assigned to hearing 
officer Erudito E. Luna. Respondent company having controverted the claim, the 
same was set for hearing during which both parties presented their evidence. On 
December 7, 1960, the hearing officer rendered decision ordering respondent to 
pay claimant the sum of P2,170.26 as compensation benefit and a weekly 
compensation of P12.00 from December 8, 1960 up to the time his physical 
incapacity shall have ceased, less any amount already paid as advanced 
compensation.</p>
<p>Not satisfied with this decision, respondent filed a petition for review, to 
which petitioner filed an opposition. The hearing officer, finding no reason to 
modify his decision, elevated the entire record to the Workmen's Compensation 
Commission for review pursuant to Section 49 of Act 3428, as amended. The case 
was assigned to Associate Commissioner Cesareo Perez who rendered decision 
reversing that of the hearing officer and absolving respondent from the claim. 
This time petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration, to which respondent 
filed an opposition. Thereafter, the Workmen's Compensation Commission, sitting 
<i>en banc</i>, denied the motion for reconsideration. Petitioner interposed the 
present petition for review.</p>
<p>It appears that petitioner started to work with respondent on September 1, 
1948. He was subjected to pre-employnient examination and was found fit for 
work. His employment record shows that he acted as mucker from September 1, 1948 
to August 31, 1949; as miner from September 1, 1949 to June 15, 1951; and as 
<i>capataz</i> from June 16, 1951 to June 14, 1956, when he was 
hospitalized.</p>
<p>The first X-ray examination made on petitioner at the Notre Dame Hospital on 
November 7, 1950 revealed pulmonary tuberculosis, fibroid, left, probably 
non-active. He was allowed to continue working. Subsequent X-ray examinations 
made on March 4, 1954, February 3, 1955, September 12, 1955 and January 27, 1956 
showed the same results as the first examinations, that is, his pulmonary 
tuberculosis had apparently remained stationery or inactive. In the X-ray 
examination made on March 1, 1957, petitioner was found to have some lesion in 
his right lung. The same result was obtained in the X-ray examination taken on 
June 10, 1957.</p>
<p>On June 14, 1956, petitioner was advieed to take sick leave and seek medical 
treatment at the Notre Dame Hospital. He was confined in said hospital and later 
transferred to Balatoc Hospital on July 31, 1957. He was discharged on January 
31, 1958 with the diagnosis that he was suffering pulmonary tuberculosis, 
minimal, bilateral, chronic, and inactive. His illness was considered clinically 
and radiographically stable.</p>
<p>Considering the above facts, together with other evicU ence extant in the 
record, the Workmen's Compensation Commission made the following findings:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"From all these facts we have come to the inevitable conclusion that there 
existed no causal relationship between claimant's illness and his employment. 
Had the factors or conditions of claimant's employment contributed to the 
development of his illness, his tuberculosis would have worsened at the time 
when he was performing the work of a miner or mucker. There can be no doubt that 
the work of a miner or mucker is more strenuous than that of a capataz. The 
reverse is true in this case. As the work of the claimant became less strenuous 
his illness progressed faster. This can only mean that the worsening of 
claimant's illness is due to factors extraneous to the employment. A contrary 
view would be illogical. The evidence on record shows that the claimant used to 
stay late at night and sometimes, up to early hours of the following morning due 
to his gambling activities. This, no doubt, had contributed greatly to the 
development and progress of his illness. It cannot be denied that lack of sleep 
at night has a debilitating effect on one's health, especially, to one who like 
the herein claimant, is suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis."</p></blockquote>
<p>It appears, therefore, that while petitioner contracted tuberculosis during 
his employment to the extent that he has been under medical treatment for 
sometime at the Notre Dame Hospital and Balatoc Hospital his sickness was, 
however arrested, and if he suffered later some lesion in his lung thus causing 
minimal pulmonary tuberculosis, it was aggravated not because of the nature of 
his work, but because of other human factors, because at that time he was no 
longer a mine laborer but a <i>capataz</i> whose duties were merely to supervise 
the work of other laborers. The truth about the sickness of petitioner, 
according to the Workmen's Compensation Commission, is that his situation was 
aggravated not because of his employment, but because of personal dissipation 
caused by night gambling activities which eventually caused his dismissal. In 
this respect, the Workmen's Compensation Commission said: "The evidence on 
record shows that the claimant used to stay late at night and sometimes, up to 
early hours of the following morning due to his gambling activities. This, no 
doubt, had contributed greatly to the development and progress of his illness. 
It cannot be denied that lack of sleep at night has a debilitating effect on 
one's health, especially, to one who, like the herein claimant, is suffering 
from pulmonary tuberculosis."</p>
<p>Since the above findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence, the 
same are binding upon this Court and are no longer subject to review.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> We are, therefore, persuaded to conclude 
that the illness of petitioner even when contracted during his employment was 
not aggravated by the nature of his work but by factors that can only be 
attributed to his fault. In this sense, we find no reason to disturb the 
decision reached by the Commission.</p>
<p>The contention that the Workmen's Compensation Commission erred in not 
dismissing the petition for review filed by respondent on the ground that it was 
filed beyond the reglementary period provided for by the rules and regulations 
of said Commission is untenable, it appearing that respondent has filed two 
motions for extension which were granted and the petition for review was filed 
within the period extended. These motions had the effect of suspending the 
running of the reglementary period and were filed pursuant to pertinent 
provisions of the same rules and regulations.</p>
<p>We also find no merit in the contention that the Commission erred in 
entertaining the defense of respondent notwithstanding its failure to controvert 
petitioner's claim it appearing that petitioner has not raised this question 
either before the hearing officer or before the Workmen's Compensation 
Commission. This question cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is affirmed, without pronouncement as 
to costs.</p> <i>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., Barrera,
