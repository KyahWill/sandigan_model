				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal from a decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, originally taken to the Court of Appeals, but
subsequently certified by the latter to the Supreme Court, upon the ground that
only questions of law are involved therein, the facts having been stipulated by
the parties.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> <span class="SpellE">Alviar</span>,
the original plaintiff herein, and Belen <span class="SpellE">Alviar</span> were
legitimate children of <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> <span class="SpellE">Alviar</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Bibiana</span> <span class="SpellE">Carillo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometime after the latter's death on <st1:date year="1901" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1901</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Alviar</span> married Flora <span class="SpellE">Erasga</span>,
who begot him five (5) children, namely:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Cesareo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Fabiana</span>,
Luisa, <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> and Castor, all sur­named <span class="SpellE">Alviar</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1951" day="6" month="9">September 6, 1951</st1:date>, Belen <span class="SpellE">Alviar</span> died intestate.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She was single and had been survived by her brother <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span>
<span class="SpellE">Alviar</span>, and five (5) half brothers and sisters, said <span class="SpellE">Cesareo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Fabiana</span>, Luisa, <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> and Castor <span class="SpellE">Alviar</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Belen's estate consisted of two (2) par­cels
of agricultural land situated in the Barrio of <span class="SpellE">Sukol</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Calamba</span>, Laguna, with an area, respectively, of
17,199 and 6,422 square me­ters, more or less, otherwise known as lots 2 and 3
of subdivision plan Psu-3720, and more particularly described in TCT No. 3033
of the Province of Laguna, and a residential lot in <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span>
City, of about 237 square meters, otherwise known as Lot No. 223-D of
subdivision plan Psd-18972, and more particularly described in TCT No. 1578 of
the Province of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1955" day="28" month="6">June 28, 1955</st1:date>,
these six (6) brothers and sisters executed a deed of extrajudicial partition
adjudicating to <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> <span class="SpellE">Alviar</span>
the two (2) parcels of agricultural land in <span class="SpellE">Calamba</span>,
Laguna, and to the five (5) half brothers and sisters of the deceased the
residential lot in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pasay</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In pursuance of said deed, the parties took
posses­sion of their respective shares.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> <span class="SpellE">Alviar</span>
secured TCT Nos. 15307 and 15308 to said lots 2 and 3 of subdivision plan
Psu-3720 in <span class="SpellE">Calamba</span>, Laguna.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The residential land in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pasay</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
was, in turn, partitioned among his aforesaid half brothers and sis­ters and
subdivided into lots Nos. 223-D-1 and 223-D-2.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The first was <span class="SpellE">alloted</span> to Luisa and <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> <span class="SpellE">Alviar</span>, who secured
thereto TCT No. 8495 in their names, whereas the second was covered by TCT No.
8496 in the name of <span class="SpellE">Cesareo</span> <span class="SpellE">Alviar</span>,
his sister <span class="SpellE">Fabiana</span> having renounced her share therein
in his favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their brother Castor had,
likewise, waived his share in said residential land.</p>

<p class="BODY">Over five (5) years later, or on September 4, 1962, <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> <span class="SpellE">Alviar</span> commenced the
present action, against his half brother and sisters, <span class="SpellE">Cesareo</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Fabiana</span>, Luisa and <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> <span class="SpellE">Alviar</span>, and their mother, and his step-mother, Flora <span class="SpellE">Erasga</span>, to annul the deed of extrajudicial partition above
referred to and the aforementioned TCT Nos. 8495 and 8496, covering the
residential lot in <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City, as well as to recover
the possession thereof and the title thereto, upon the ground that, acting in
bad faith and conspiring, confederating and conniving with each other, as well
as "taking advantage of plain­tiff's lack of education, illiteracy and
ignorance, and knowing full well that" the "children by second
marriage of <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> <span class="SpellE">Alviar</span>
had no rights, participation and interest over" the three (3) lots left by
Belen <span class="SpellE">Alviar</span>, the defendants had "misled"
the plaintiff "into sign­ing" said deed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch as <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span>
<span class="SpellE">Alviar</span> died soon thereafter, his widow, <span class="SpellE">Paulina</span> <span class="SpellE">Pamulaklakin</span> and their
children, Ramon and Norma <span class="SpellE">Alviar</span>, substituted him as
plaintiff in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defendants having filed an answer denying specifically the
allegations of the complaint regarding the irregularities allegedly attending
the execution of the deed of extrajudicial partition, both parties later filed
a stipulation of facts on the relationship between them, the civil status of
Belen <span class="SpellE">Alviar</span>, the properties constituting her estate,
the execution of the deed of extrajudicial partition and the steps taken to
carry out its provisions, and submitted the case for the determination of only
one question, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"who are the
parties entitled to participate in the inheritance of Belen <span class="SpellE">Alviar</span>,
and in what proportion?"</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiffs maintained that since <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span>
<span class="SpellE">Alviar</span> was a full brother of Belen <span class="SpellE">Alviar</span>, whereas the main defendants herein are merely her
half brother and sisters, <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> is a relative of
Belen nearer in degree than said defendants, who are more distant to her, so
that they (defendants) are excluded by <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span>, and
he is entitled to succeed to the entire estate of Belen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court in effect overruled this
pretense and rendered a decision holding that both parties "are entitled
to inherit from Belen <span class="SpellE">Alviar</span>, x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> plaintiffs to receive two-seventh (2/7)" of
the residential lot in <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City, and "each of
the defendants" - <span class="SpellE">Cesareo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Fabiana</span>,
Luisa, Castor and <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> <span class="SpellE">Alviar</span>
- "one-seventh (1/7) thereof, with no pronouncement as to costs."</p>

<p class="BODY">The defendants moved for a reconsideration of this decision, upon
the ground that the same should have ordered the redistribution, not only of
the lot in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pasay</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, but, also, of the two (2)
parcels of agricultural land in Laguna.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This motion having been denied, the defendants appealed to the Court of
Appeals, which, as above pointed out, subsequently certified the case to the
Supreme Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main issue raised by the parties in this case is whether or
not, as a full brother of Belen <span class="SpellE">Alviar</span>, the degree of
relationship to her of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> <span class="SpellE">Alviar</span> was nearer than that of their half brothers and
sisters, the children of their father by second mar­riage, and he excluded them
in the succession to her estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
lower court decided this question in the negative and correctly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In­deed, "proximity of relationship is
determined by the number of ge­nerations" and "each generation forms
a degree."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
In relation to Belen <span class="SpellE">Alviar</span>, her full brother, <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> <span class="SpellE">Alviar</span>, is, therefore,
in the <u>same</u> degree of relationship as their half brothers and sisters,
the aforementioned defendants, for all of them constitute the first generation
of descendants of their common father, <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> <span class="SpellE">Alviar</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact,
this rationalization is rendered superfluous, apart from be­ing confirmed, by
the explicit language of Arts. 1003, 1004 and 1006 of our Civil Code, reading:</p>

<blockquote>"ART. 1003.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If there
are no descendants, ascen­dants, illegitimate children, or a surviving spouse,
the collateral relatives shall succeed to the entire estate of the deceased in
accordance with the following articles."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"ART. 1004.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Should the
only survivors be brothers and sisters of the full blood, they shall inherit in
equal shares."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"ART. 1006.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Should
brothers and sisters of the full blood survive together with brothers and
sisters of the half blood, the former shall be entitled to a share double that
of the latter."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">These provisions, particularly the last, leave no room for doubt
that brothers and sisters of full blood do not exclude those of half blood,
for, otherwise, there would be no occasion for the con­currence of both classes
and the application of said Art. 1006.</p>

<p class="BODY">More important than this, however, is the fact that <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> <span class="SpellE">Alviar</span> had entered into
a contract with his half brothers and sisters for the extrajudicial partition
of the properties of the deceased Belen <span class="SpellE">Alviar</span> and
that there is nothing in the stipulation of facts submitted by the parties to
warrant the annulment or rescission of said agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The validity thereof thus being indubitable,
there is absolutely no reason why the same should be disturbed.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from should be, as it is
hereby reversed, and another one shall be entered absolving the
defendants-appellants from the complaint, and dismissing the same, with costs
against the plaintiffs-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>.</p>
