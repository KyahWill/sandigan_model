				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Vicente and Francisco <span class="SpellE">Racaza</span> filed an
action <span style="">against Roberto </span>de <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> in the <st1:place><st1:placename>Municipal</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Court</st1:placetype> <st1:placename>of</st1:placename> <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
for the possession of <span style="">a </span>FORD Jeep fully described in <span style="">their </span>complaint, and for judgment sen<span style="">tencing </span><span style="">said </span><span style="">defendant to pay
the </span>unpaid rentals <span style="">agreed upon,
and costs of suit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The joint Record on Appeal filed by the <span style="">parties gives us no idea of </span>the exact nature of the <span style="">defense or defenses </span>interposed by the
defendant in the above-named court, although from the allegations made in his
answer filed in the Court of <span style="">First </span>instance
of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> it would <span style="">seem that he had</span> challenged the jurisdiction of the <span style="">Municipal </span>Court of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
City over <span style="">the case contending </span>that
the <span style="">plaintiffs were seeking to </span>recover
a <span style="">sum </span>of money in excess of the
jurisdictional amount for said court, <span style="">which
</span>contention was, however, overruled.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">Consequently, after a trial on
the merits, </span>said Municipal Court rendered judgment sentencing <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> to return and deliver the jeep <span style="">in </span>question to the plaintiffs and to
pay to the latter a monthly rental of P50.00 from the date of the filing of the
complaint until said jeep had been delivered to them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From this decision <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>
appealed to the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> where
he filed an answer where­in, after denying some of the averments of the complaint,
he pleaded special defenses and a counter-claim as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"AND AS SPECIAL DEFENSE, the Defendant alleges:</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">a)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">That the Court has no juris­diction

</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">That the plaintiff is guilty of <span class="SpellE">laches</span> and <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>;</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">d)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">That truth of the matter is that
the transaction is one of mortgage of the car in question, in order to secure
the right of the plaintiff of the amount loaned with usurious interest at
P50.00 a month.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In force and effect the
same document which is the basis </span><span style="">of
the Plaintiff's </span>complaint was executed in order to cover usurious
transaction.</blockquote>

<blockquote>AND AS COUNTERCLAIM, the Defendant alleges:</blockquote>

<blockquote>That by this unreasonable suit, bad faith and unlawful act of
plaintiff, the defendant was forced to hire the services of the undersigned
counsels in the sum of P300.00 to defend this suit."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon motion of the plaintiffs, however, the Court of <span style="">First </span>Instance ordered on <st1:date year="1955" day="25" month="8">August 25, 1955</st1:date> the striking out and
elimination from defendant's answer of the allegations contained in Paragraph
IV, sub-paragraphs b, c and d of his special defenses.</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the case
upon the ground that the Court of First Instance had no appellate jurisdiction
thereon for the reason that the original complaint filed with the <st1:place><st1:placename>Municipal</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Court</st1:placetype> <st1:placename>of</st1:placename> <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
was not within said court's original jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion was denied on <st1:date year="1957" day="28" month="1">January 28, 1957</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter and after due trial, the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> rendered the ap­pealed
judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Both parties appealed, the plaintiffs only from that portion of
the decision limiting the award of damages in their favor to the sum of P500.00
(as back rentals for the <span style="">use </span>of
the jeep in question), while the defendant appealed claiming that the trial
court had erred in not dismissing the case for lack of appellate jurisdiction
thereon because, in turn, the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
City did not have original jurisdiction over the case.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The following findings of
fact made by the trial court are fully substantiated by the evidence:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1952" day="22" month="12">December 22,
 1952</st1:date>, the plain­tiffs bought the jeep in question from the
defendant for P1<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span>
B)<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(</span>He needed
the money to repair the boom of a crane.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He later sold the crane for <span style="">a </span>good price.) The plaintiffs gave the
defendant an option to repurchase the jeep within two months from <st1:date year="1952" day="22" month="12">December 22, 1952</st1:date> or to sell it to a
third person at a profit which was to be split between them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span>
C).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In order to facilitate the
repurchase and the sale to third persons, the registration of the jeep in the
Motor Vehicle Office was allowed to remain in the name of the defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two-month period expired and the
defendant neither exercised his right of repurchase nor did he sell it to <span style="">a </span>third person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Notwithstanding the expiration of the two
months, he continued to possess the jeep, promising to <span style="">pay </span><span style="">fifty pesos a </span>month
as <span style="">rental.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">Then
the plaintiffs demanded the delivery of the jeep and the back rentals, for he
neither delivered the jeep nor paid the rentals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Despite repeated de­mands he refused to
deliver the jeep or pay the rentals.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>During the trial the defendant denied that he promised to pay any
rental.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As his special defense to the
effect that the contract was not a sale but a mere mortgage, was technically
ruled out, he could not prove it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As for
the rentals, the Court is of the considered opinion that the amount of P500.00
as rental or damages from the date of the filing of the complaint in the Muni­cipal
Court on January 5, 1956 until the date of this judgment would be reasonable,
considering the amount of money (P1<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>) paid by
the plaintiffs for the price of the jeep and the sur­rounding
circumstances."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It appears from the foregoing that the trial court found that the
parties had an agreement that if the defendant did not repurchase the jeep
within two months after the <span style="">sale, </span>he
would pay a monthly rental of P50.00 if he retained <span style="">possession </span>thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
the basis of said agreement – if applied <span style="">literally
– the </span>defendant should be held liable to pay the monthly rental
aforesaid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, in determining
whether the trial court erred in limiting plaintiffs' right to recover unpaid
rentals to the amount of P500.00, we cannot <span style="">lose </span>sight of the fact that the plaintiffs allowed more than two
years from the expiration of the two <span style="">months
</span>period for re­purchase to elapse before filing suit for the recovery of
the jeep and of unpaid rentals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This —
viewing the <span style="">case </span>from <span style="">the point of equity – would seem </span>to <span style="">justify the action taken by the </span>trial
court in limiting plain­tiffs' right to recover unpaid rentals up to the amount
<span style="">aforesaid </span>only.</p>

<p class="BODY">Turning now to defendant's own appeal, we find the same to be
without merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiffs' action commenced in the Municipal Court of the City
of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place></st1:city>
was one for the recovery of possession of the jeep mentioned heretofore, with
damages in the form of unpaid rentals at the rate of P50.00 monthly from the
expiration of defendant's right to retain said vehicle in his possession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the price at which the defendant sold said
jeep to the plaintiffs was P1<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> only, we are of
the opinion that the action was within the original ex­clusive jurisdiction of
the aforesaid court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That <span style="">the value of the jeep together with the
unpaid rentals claimed might give a total amount in excess of the
jurisdictional amount for the Municipal Court of the City of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> did not take the case out of its jurisdiction, the
unpaid rentals being a mere incident of the main action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The situation is analogous to the one
obtaining in an action for forcible entry or un­lawful detainment when the
rentals claimed by the plaintiffs would exceed the jurisdictional amount for
Municipal Courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That circumstance, it
has been repeatedly held by this Court, does not deprive said courts of their
original exclusive jurisdiction over that type of actions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the record shows that although the defendant objected <span class="GramE">against</span> the Court of First Instance exercising its <u>appellate</u>
jurisdiction over the <span style="">case, </span>he
did not <span style="">at any time </span>object
against said court exercising its original jurisdiction over it but instead,
after the denial of his motion to dismiss, went to trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We hold, therefore, that, by doing so, he
submitted the case for trial by the aforesaid court in the exercise of its
original jurisdiction (<span class="SpellE">Bachrach</span> et al. <span class="SpellE">vs</span> <span class="SpellE">Lejano</span> L-10910, January 6,
1959; Evangelista et al., <span class="SpellE">vs</span> Reyes, L-20416, January
30, 1964).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>In view of all the foregoing</b>, the appealed decision is
affirmed with cost against the defendant.</p>
