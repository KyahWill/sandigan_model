				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal by <i>certiorari</i>, from a decision of the Court of Ap­peals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The facts are set forth in said decision,
from which We quote:</p>

<blockquote>"The Marinduque Iron Mines Inc., is the consignee of one case
containing 5,000 pieces of Simonds High Speed Steel Saw Bits carried on board
the vessel Pioneer Minx from New York and discharged at the Port of Manila on
July 10, 1961 into the custody of the defendant Manila Port Ser­vice, a
subsidiary of the other defendant Manila Railroad Company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Manila Port Service is the arrastre operator
for the port of Manila pursuant to a management agreement entered into by the
Bureau of Customs and said defendant, copy of which appears in the records as
Exhibit 1.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"There is no dispute that contents of the case were lost while
in the custody of the Manila Port Service and the latter has not been able to
introduce any evidence to escape its liability for <span style="">such loss.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"In order to obtain the release of the cargo, the consignee
engaged the services of custom's broker Mr. Francisco Barretto who prepared and
submitted the necessary papers to the Manila Port Service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch as neither the bill of lading nor
the ship manifest indicated the value of the cargo, when Barretto applied with
the Manila Port Service for the processing of the papers with the end in <span style="">view </span>of receiving the cargo for and
in be­half of the consignee, said defendant charged him and he paid for the
account of the consignee the amount of P2.85 as defendant's fees for its ser­vices.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter the case was opened and found to
contain nothing.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Prior to the discovery of the loss of the cargo and in
compliance with the provisions of Section 15 of the Management Contract, the
consignee through its broker filed a provisional claim with the defendant
Manila Port Service within the 15-day limit set forth in said section.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Following the discovery of the loss, the
consignee demanded from the Manila Port Service the payment of the value of the
contents of the case but no such pay­ment was made up to the present.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It appears that said cargo has been insured in New York by
Sun Insurance Office, Ltd., for $2,750.00.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The consignee for its part also had the same cargo insured with the
South Sea Surety and Insurance Company, Inc., in Manila for the sum of P10,075.00,
Philippine Currency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The insurers paid <u>pro</u>
<u>rata</u> the value of the cargo to the assignee of the insured and in return
they obtained subrogation agreements transferring to the insurers, the herein
plaintiffs, all their rights of recovery on account of the loss or damage from
the carrier or from any other person or corporation that may be liable
therefor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The total amount paid by the
in­surers is the same amount they are now claiming in their complaint.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The plaintiffs allege that in failing to deliver to the
consignee or the latter's assignee the cargo above referred to because it was
lost while in the possession of the Manila Port Ser­vice, the latter became
liable to said plaintiffs in the sum of P10,532.31, plus attorney's fees,
expenses of litigation and costs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Manila Port Service refuses to pay the amount claimed by
the plaintiffs alleging that under the terms of Management Contract
particularly paragraph 15 thereof, its liability, if any, is limited <span style="">to P500.00 because the value of the cargo was
not specified or manifested and the arrastre charges paid by the consignee were
not based on said actual value."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After appropriate proceedings, the Court of First Instance of
Manila rendered a decision holding that the provisions of said paragraph or
section 15 of the management contract are inapplicable to the case at bar and
sentencing "the defendants to pay, jointly and severally, to the
plaintiffs the sum of TEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY-TWO PESOS and THIRTY-ONE
CENTAVOS (P10,532.31) with interest at the legal rate from the date of the
filing of the complaint until fully paid and further to pay the costs." On
appeal, taken by the defendants, said decision was modified by the Court of
Appeals, which reduced the award in favor of the plaintiffs to the sum of
P500.00, with the aforementioned rate of interest, but without costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the present petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>,
which was given due course.</p>

<p class="BODY">The only issue in this appeal is the applicability to the present
case of paragraph or section 15 of the management con­tract between the Bureau
of Customs and the Arrastre Contractors, the pertinent part of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"15.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x x x and the CONTRACTOR shall be solely
responsible as an independent contractor for, and promptly pay to the steamship
company, con­signee, consignor, or other interested party or par­ties the
invoice value of each package but which in no case shall be more than five
hundred pesos (P500) for each package unless the value is other­wise specified
or manifested, and the corresponding arrastre charges had been paid. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>x x x."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In finding that the aforementioned provision of the management
contract is not binding upon plaintiffs herein, the trial court acted upon the
theory that the consignee "had not made use of the delivery permit and
accepted the benefit of delivery of the cargo as this was not delivered because
it was lost while in the possession of the de­fendants."</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, the Court of Appeals held that:</p>

<blockquote>" x x x It is not correct to state x <span style="">x x </span>that the consignee did not make use of the delivery permit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Actually he made use of the delivery
permit when i</u><u><span style="">f he delivered </span></u><u><span style="">it </span></u><u><span style="">to the arrastre operator</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without the delivery permit,
the arrastre operator would not charge the consignee arrastre charges nor
deliver </span><span style="">to him </span><span style="">physical possession of the cargo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>In the present case, </u></span><u><span style="">it </span>is </u><u><span style="">not diluted that after the delivery </span></u><u><span style="">permit was sho</span></u><u><span style="">wn</span></u><u><span style=""> </span></u><u><span style="">by the broker </span></u><u><span style="">of the consignee to the defendant, Manila
Port Service, the latter as­sessed and collected the arrastre charges and
proceeded</span></u><u><span style=""> to </span></u><u><span style="">deliver the cargo</span></u><span style="">."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></u></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the language of said Appellate Court:</p>

<blockquote>"The procedure followed before any cargo discharged from a
carrying vessel may be delivered to the consignee is for the latter or his
broker to obtain from the agents of the carrying vessel <span style="">a </span>de­livery permit and to present it together with the ne­cessary
commercial and shipping documents to the Bureau of Customs for processing and
for the ap­proval of the delivery permit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Once the delivery permit is approved, <u>the original thereof is stamped
with the provisions of Section 15 of the management contract before it is
delivered back to </u><u><span style="">the consignee </span>for
presentation to the arrastre operator.</u><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Manila Port Service as arrastre operator, before delivering the
cargo, to the consignee, would demand payment by the latter of its fees for its
services.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the goods are
placed in the possession of the con­signee represented by his broker who is
then issued a gate pass by the arrastre operator."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It being conceded that the sum of P2.85 had been paid, by way of
arrastre charges, by the broker of the consignee, it follows that the latter
had made use of the delivery permit, on which is stamped said section 15 of the
management contract, thereby justi­fying the conclusion of the Court of Appeals
to the effect that the consignee had accepted the provisions thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, this in­ference is borne out by the
fact that the consignee had filed a pro­visional claim for damages, pursuant to
the terms of said section 15, and that plaintiffs herein had filed the present
case against the Manila Port Service to enforce its obligations and the rights
of the consignee under said management contract.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">, the appealed decision of the Court of
Appeals is hereby affirmed, without special pronouncement as to costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
