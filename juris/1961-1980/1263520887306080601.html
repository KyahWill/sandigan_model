<p class="BODY">Petitioner instituted this action on June 7, 1967 to enjoin
enforcement by the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City sheriff of the writ of
execution issued by respondent city court of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
City pursuant to its final judgment dated January 14, 1967, in Civil Case No.
901-A thereof for illegal <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> entitled "<span class="SpellE">Liberato</span> S. Domingo, plaintiff vs. Miguel <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>, defendant" ordering petitioner to vacate the
leased property consisting of a 1,000-square meter parcel of land located along
<span class="SpellE">España</span> Extension, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City, as well as to restore possession thereof to private respondent Domingo as
the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>-owner thereof and to pay said respondent
the unpaid stipulated rentals of P200.00 monthly from Septem­ber 16, 1965.</p>

<p class="BODY">On petitioner's verified allegations that "petitioner was
very much surprised upon receipt of the said writ of execution for the reason
that he was not served any summons or a copy of the complaint filed against him
nor a copy of the decision and therefore, the respondent Judge, has acted without
or in excess of his jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion;"<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
and "granting without admitting that respondent <span class="SpellE">Liberato</span>
S. Domingo filed a complaint against petitioner herein before the City Court of
<span class="SpellE">Davao</span> City for 'Forcible Entry Into and <span class="SpellE">Detain­er</span> of Land or Buildings,' venue was improperly laid
as the land in question is situated at <span class="SpellE">España</span>
Extension, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City and not in <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
City",<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
the Court required respondent to answer the petition and issued a restraining
order against en­forcement of the questioned writ of execution.</p>

<p class="BODY">The answer and annexed documents filed by respondent, however,
totally disproved petitioner's allegations.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner had been personally served on <st1:date year="1966" day="17" month="12">December 17, 1966</st1:date>, by the <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Que­zon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city> sheriff with
respondent court's summons and copy of the complaint.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Petitioner had duly filed his answer dated <st1:date year="1966" day="21" month="12">December 21, 1966</st1:date> to the complaint, signing the same on
his own behalf and interposing no defense but pleading that he "has not
intentionally or deliberately failed or refused to pay the rentals.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
The duly notarized lease agreement between the parties expressly stipulated
that "(V)<span class="SpellE">enue</span> in case of litigation shall be in <st1:place><st1:city><span class="SpellE">Davao</span> City</st1:city>, <st1:country-region>Philippines</st1:country-region></st1:place>."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Petitioner failed to appear before respondent court, in person or through
counsel, at the scheduled hearing on <st1:date year="1967" day="9" month="1">January
 9, 1967</st1:date>, and after recep­tion of respondent's evidence, rendered
its judgment of <st1:date year="1967" day="14" month="1">Jan­uary 14, 1967</st1:date>,
against petitioner.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Copy of respondent court's decision was duly served on petitioner by registered
airmail special delivery on <st1:date year="1967" day="20" month="1">January
 20, 1967</st1:date>, and personally acknowledged by him on the registry return
receipt.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">At the hearing of the petition before the Court on Aug­ust 30,
1967, at which petitioner's counsel failed to appear due to alleged illness and
was instead given a period of ten days to submit a memorandum (which he did not
avail of), it was further brought out by respondent, through counsel, that when
the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City sheriff served on petitioner on May
20, 1967, the writ of execution, petitioner requested deferment thereof until
June 10, 1967, promising to vacate the premises as well as to pay all rentals
due to respondent by said date, which promise he wrote down on the reverse side
of the writ of exe­cution.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The petition must be dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While Rule 4, section 1 provides that "forcible entry and <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> actions regarding real property shall be brought
in the municipality or city in which the subject matter thereof is
situated", it is a dogma of procedural law that venue, in inferior courts
as well as in the courts of first instance, may be waived expressly or implied­ly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where the defendant fails to challenge timely
the venue in a motion to dismiss as provided by section 4 of the same rule, and
allows the trial to be held and a decision to be rendered, he cannot on appeal
or in a special action be permitted to challenge belatedly the wrong venue,
which is deemed waived.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
The analogy of actions for recovery of real property located in one province
being validly instituted and tried in another province where plaintiff resides,
when defendant has waived the venue fixed by law, is clearly applicable to the
present case.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Even if it were to be assumed that the parties' covenant in the
lease agreement fixing the venue in <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> City in
case of litigation could be validly repudiated by the defendant on the theory
that the provisions of Rule 4, section 1 above-quoted should be considered as
mandatory - a contention which petitioner does not make - petitioner, in the
light of his actions hereinabove recited, of filing his answer to the
complaint, requesting deferment of execution and formally undertaking to vacate
the property by June 10, 1967, would be <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> now
from making such a <span class="SpellE"><u>volte</u></span> <u>face</u>, since he
"cannot adopt a posture of double-dealing without running afoul of the doctrine
of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">A final note of advertence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The facts of record make out the petition to be a sham petition whereby
petitioner fla­grantly misled the Court into acting on his petition and issuing
a restraining order on the basis of his false representation that he had not
been summoned and was completely unaware of the respondent court's judgment
against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner should reflect
on the grave consequences of his contumacious act and on the criminal liability
that he may incur for willful commission of falsehood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's counsel, too, has failed to live
up to his exacting responsibility as an officer of the court to exert the
utmost diligence that the petition prepared by him state the facts truthfully
and accurately, as well as to deal with the courts in all good <span class="SpellE">faithland</span> candor,<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
in that he failed, upon receipt of respondent's documented answer, to file the
necessary rectification of the false allegations in his petition and enable the
Court to dismiss forthwith the petition.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Court cannot but express severe condemnation, as it has in the past,<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
for such deceptive tactics which delay due execu­tion of a just and lawful
verdict and waste the time that the courts need for the study and resolution of
meritorious cases.</p>

<p class="BODY">ACCORDINGLY, the petition is dismissed, with treble costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court's restraining order of <st1:date year="1967" day="15" month="6">June 15, 1967</st1:date>, is dissolved and
enforcement of respondent court's writ of execution may pro­ceed upon
promulgation of this decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, petitioner and his counsel are ordered to show cause
within ten (10) days from receipt hereof why they should not be punished for
contempt of court for having filed a sham petition, and his counsel is required
within the same period to show cause why disci­plinary action should not be
taken against him.</p>
