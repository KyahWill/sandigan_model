Court of First Instance of Manila (in Civil Case No. 50988) denying the
petition to stay the order of the Commissioner of Immigration for petitioners'
exclusion from the country. <o:p></o:p><p></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petitioners Cheung Bo Choi alias
Tiu Shu Bee, Lim Wan Thon, Lim Chin Doo and Lim Chin Eng, mother and her 3
minor children, entered the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> on </span><st1:date year="1960" day="8" month="10"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">October 8,
 1960</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> as
temporary visitors for an initial authorized stay of 3 months. Upon their
request, petitioners' <span class="GramE">stay have</span> been extended by the
Commissioner of Immigration several times, the last of which was to expire </span><st1:date year="1962" day="21" month="7"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">July
 21, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In the meantime, or on </span><st1:date year="1961" day="23" month="1"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">January
 23, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">,
the Court of First Instance of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> granted the petition for
naturalization of petitioner's husband. Thereafter, the immigrants petitioned
the Secretary of Foreign Affairs arid the Secretary of Justice for a change of
their status from temporary visitors to special non-immigrants, in view of
the fact that by January, 1963, their husband and father would become a
Filipino citizen by taking the corresponding oath of allegiance. This was
granted. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Later, however, this extension was <span class="GramE">declare</span> a nullity by the new Secretary of Foreign Affairs. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date year="1962" day="25" month="6"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 25,
 1962</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">,
petitioners requested the respondent Commissioner of Immigration that they <span class="GramE">be</span> allowed to pay the extension fees up to </span><st1:date year="1963" day="23" month="1"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">January
 23, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">,
but the name was denied and they were ordered instead to leave the country in 7
days. Thereupon, a petition for prohibition was filed in the Court of First
Instance of Manila to stop such order by the Immigration Commissioner. After
due hearing, the trial court denied the petition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petitioners have taken this appeal
assigning the following as errors allegedly committed by the lower court, to
wit: <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><blockquote>1. The court
a qua erred in holding that the Cabinet had acted without legal authority in
passing resolution of <st1:date year="1956" day="29" month="2"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">February 29, 1956</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">; <o:p></o:p></span></blockquote></span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><blockquote>2. The court a quo likewise erred
in holding that the secretary of Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of Justice
acted without legal authority in granting the request of change of category
from temporary visitors to special non-immigrants and extension of stay of
petitioners-<span class="GramE">appellants</span>;<o:p></o:p></blockquote></span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><blockquote>3. The court a qua further erred in
resolving that petitioners-appellants have violated their contract with the
Philippine Government in refusing to leave after the respondent-appellee has
ordered them to do so; and<o:p></o:p></blockquote></span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><blockquote>4. The court a quo has finally
erred in refusing to consider that the approval of the petition for
naturalization of petitioners-appellants' husband and father is one of the
considerations for their continued stay up to and including <st1:date year="3963" day="28" month="1"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">January
 23, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The legal <span class="GramE">issue
raised in this appeal are</span> not new; in fact, they have been already
resolved in previous similar cases. We have already said that the
administration and enforcement of our immigration laws lie with the Bureau of
Immigration. The so-called Cabinet Resolution of </span><st1:date year="1956" day="29" month="2"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">February
 29, 1956</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> did
not specifically authorize the Secretaries of Foreign Affairs and of Justice to
extend the stay of temporary visitors. It could not legally do so because under
the express provisions of the Immigration Law, it is the Commissioner of
Immigration who is vested with the power and authority to grant such
extensions. And, the Cabinet has no power to amend or modify the law. We so
declared in Ang Liong vs. Commissioner of Immigration (51 <span class="GramE">Off</span>.
Gaz., 2893) when we said: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"The Secretary of Foreign
Affairs is not authorized to admit into the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> aliens for temporary stay, or
extend the period authorized by the Commissioner of Immigration for their stay
in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</blockquote>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Neither can the two Secretaries
authorize the change of status from temporary visitors to special
non-immigrants. The law and our decisions on the matter are clear on this
point: temporary visitors can not have their status changed to special
non-immigrants without first departing from the country (Sec. 9, Philippine
Immigration Act of 1940, as amended; Ong Se Lun <i>vs.</i> Board of
Commissioners G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-6017, </span></span><st1:date year="1954" day="16" month="9"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Sept. 16, 1954</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">; Sy Ong <i>vs.</i> Commissioner of
Immigration, G.R. No.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> <span class="GramE">L-10224, </span></span><st1:date year="1957" day="11" month="5"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">May 11, 1957</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">; Ng Hin to Commissioner of
Immigration, G.R. No.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> <span class="GramE">L-13026, March 30, 1960.)</span> Having come to
this conclusion, we find it unnecessary to discuss the other points raised. At
any rate, the extension to </span><st1:date year="1963" day="23" month="1"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">January 23, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> granted by the two Secretaries and
invoked and relied upon by the petitioners in this case had already expired,
and since no other legal extension has been obtained, this appeal has become
moot. The act of the respondent to carry out his order complained of would be
justified. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p>As a consequence, the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed, with costs against appellants. It is so ordered. </p>
