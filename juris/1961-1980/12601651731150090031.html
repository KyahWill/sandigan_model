				<BR><STRONG>PADILLA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">By resolution adopted on 6 March 1959 the Court of Appeals certified to this 
Court the appeal in these two cases, because only legal questions are raised, to 
wit: "the criminal liability of appellant upon the provisions of Circulars Nos. 
42 and 60 of the Central Bank of the Philippines."
<p>The facts are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>* * * defendant Maria Maydin was booked as an outgoing passenger on a 
Philippine Air Line plane on February 23, 1956 from Manila to Hongkong. Shortly, 
before the hour of departure of the plane, the defendant's person and baggage 
were examined by the personnel of the Bureau of Customs assigned at the Manila 
International Airport at Nichols Air Base. Pasay City. The inspection was made 
in a room where outgoing passengers stay before they board the departing plane. 
Customs examiner Benigno Layug, who was assigned to examine the defendant, asked 
her if she had money in her handbag and in her overnight kit (Exhibit "A") which 
were part of Maydin's luggage. The defendant replied that she had $100.00 
covered by a license and P100. Philippine notes. Layug opened the defendants 
black handbag and he found therein eight pieces of fifty-peso bills (Exhibits 
"C-1" to "C-8", inclusive) amounting in all to P400.00. Layug then asked Maydin 
why she said that she only had $100.00 and P100.00 but the defendant did not 
answer. Examiner Layug then asked Maydin if she had anything in her overnight 
kit, Exhibit "A", and she replied that all that she had therein were toilet 
articles and lingeries. Layug asked the defendant to open her overnight kit, 
Exhibit "A", and when it was opened, Layug found on its upper portion toilet 
articles and lingeries on the lower part but the customs examiner noticed that 
the bottom floor of the overnight kit was quite high so he knocked on it and it 
produced a hallow sound. His suspicion was aroused so he asked her if she had 
anything aside from what he had seen and Maria Maydin tapped Layug lightly 
causing the latter to observe that she did not want him to continue with the 
examination. He asked Maydin to go with him to the Chief Appraiser with the 
overnight kit. The Chief Appraiser was not in his office. The Deputy Collector 
of Customs Mr. Crisostomo arrived and he asked Layug to bring the overnight kit 
Exhibit "A" to his office. Mr. Crisostomo asked Maydin what the contents of the 
bottom compartment of her overnight kit, Exhibit "A", were and she replied she 
had about P10,000.00 there.</p>
<p>As Maydin was anxious to leave on the plane, Deputy Collector Crisostomo 
allowed her to leave for Hongkong so long as she left behind a representative to 
witness the opening of her overnight kit. Maydin's husband Francisco Aldana 
acted as her representative. The bottom of the compartment of the overnight kit, 
Exhibit "A", was opened in the presence of Deputy Collector of Customs 
Crisostomo, defendant's husband Francisco Aldana, the agent in charge Victorino, 
agent Socorro de Guzman and forty-four pieces of one hundred peso bills, one 
hundred twenty pieces of fifty peso bills and four pieces of ten dollars were 
found totalling in all P10,800 and forty dollars.</p></blockquote>
<p>For carrying, and having in her possession and control, $40 found in her 
overnight kit without the necessary Central Bank license or permit, as required 
by section 3 (a) of Central Bank circular No. 42 in relation to circular No. 20 
and sections 14 and 34 of Republic Act No. 265, Maria Maydin was charged with a 
violation thereof. For carrying and having in her possession and control the sum 
of P10,800, Philippine currency, found in her handbag and overnight kit without 
the necessary license or permit as required by section 2(a) of Central Bank 
circular No. 60 in relation to sections 14 and 34 of Republic Act No. 265, she 
was accused of a violation thereof. After joint trial, the Court of First 
Instance of Rizal rendered judgment finding her guilty of the violations charged 
and sentencing her in both cases as follows—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1) In Criminal Case No. 3825-P defendant Maria Maydin is hereby sentenced to 
suffer imprisonment for six (6) months, pay a fine of Three Hundred (P300.00) 
Pesos and to pay the costs. The four ten-dollar bills, Exhibits "F-1" to "F-4", 
inclusive, are hereby declared forfeited in favor of the government; and</p>
<p>2) In Criminal Case No. 3796-P defendant Maria Maydin is hereby sentenced to 
suffer imprisonment for six (6) months, pay a fine of Three Thousand (P3,000.00) 
Pesos and to pay the costs. The one hundred twenty-eight pieces of fifty-peso 
bills, exhibits "C-1" to "C-8", inclusive, "D-1" to "D-120", inclusive, and the 
forty-four pieces of one hundred-peso bills, exhibits "E-1" to "E-44", 
inclusive, are hereby declared forfeited in favor of the 
government.</p></blockquote>
<p>From both judgments Maria Maydin has appealed to the Court of Appeals which, 
as stated at the beginning of this opinion, certified to this Court the appeal 
in both cases.</p>
<p>The appellant contends that the lower Court erred in—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>* * * its conclusion that the Monetary Board of the Central Bank of the 
Philippines is empowered, hy implication, to declare the existence of an 
"exchange crisis" under the provisions of Republic Act No. 265.</p>
<p>* * * its conclusions to the effect that Circular No. 20 of the Central Bank 
was approved by the President.</p>
<p>* * * its conclusion to the effect that after the approval of Circular No. 20 
by the President of the Philippines, rules and regulations that are 
supplementary thereto subsequently promulgated by the Monetary Board of the 
Central Bank, like those embodied in Circular No. 42, do not require the 
approval of the President for their validity.</p>
<p>* * * its conclusion to the effect that the rules and regulations embodied in 
Circular No. 42 are only supplementary to Circular No. 20.</p>
<p>* * * Its conclusion to the effect that Circular No. 60 does not require the 
approval of the President for its validity, on the argument that the said 
Circular was issued hy the Monetary Board of the Central Bank under section 14 
of Republic Act No. 265, and not under section 74 of the said Act.</p>
<p>* * * adopting the conclusion that the appellant, Maria Maydin, violated 
circulars Nos. 42 and 60.</p>
<p>* * * convicting the appellant, Maria Maydin; and imposing on her the 
penalties specified in the decision.</p>
<p>* * * decreeing the forfeiture of the United States dollars and Philippine 
pesos involved in these cases.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Central Bank of the Philippines need not declare the existence of an 
exchange crisis before it can exercise the powers granted it by Republic Act No. 
265. It is enough that the power be exercised to carry out the purpose and aim 
declared in the law. The validity of the circulars in question promulgated by 
the Central Bank without any prior declaration of the existence of an exchange 
crisis has been upheld in a number of cases.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span></p>
<p>Under the second, third, fourth and fifth assignments of errors, the 
appellant assails the legality and validity of circular No. 20 and the other 
subsequent circulars issued by the Central Bank, because, as contended by her, 
they lack the presidential approval required by law for their efficacy, validity 
and legality. This also is already settled. Circular No. 20 has the approval of 
the Chief Executive. The other circulars promulgated subsequent to circular No. 
20 need not be approved by the President, because they merely implement circular 
No. 20.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[2]</sup></span></p>
<p>In the sixth and seventh assignments of errors, the appellant claims that she 
did not violate Circulars Nos. 42 and 60, for the reason that before the U.S. 
currency of $40 and the Philippine currency of Pl0,800 were found and taken from 
her possession by the customs authorities she had orally declared to them that 
she had both kinds of bills in her possession. As found by the trial Court, this 
pretention is not true because upon being asked by a customs examiner she only 
declared that she had $100 covered by a license and P100. This admission which 
was made only after her possession of the money had been detected cannot 
substitute for or take the place of the license or permit required by law to be 
issued by the Central Bank or its authorized agent.</p>
<p>The rule laid down in People <i>vs</i>. Lim Ho et al., <i>supra</i>. as 
regards forfeiture of the bills found in appellant's possession may not be 
invoked in these cases, because there the gold bars and United States securities 
were seized by the Bureau of Customs officers and forfeiture proceedings before 
the Collector of Customs were commenced and were not introduced in evidence at 
the trial of the case; here, the bills found in appellant's possession were 
presented in evidence and were under the control of the trial Court. Their 
forfeiture ordered by the Court was legal.</p>
<p>The judgments appealed from are affirmed, with costs against the 
appellant.</p><em>Bengzon, Acting C.J., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion,
