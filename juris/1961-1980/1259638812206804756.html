				<H3>NEMESIA U. ALAMA, PETITIONER, VS. THE HONORABLE MACAPANTON ABBAS, JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF DAVAO, AND THE PROVINCIAL FISCAL OF DAVAO, RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>ZALDIVAR. J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align=""><div align="justify"><br><p>This is a petition for mandamus with preliminary injunction, praying that 
respondent Judge Macapanton Abbas, of the Court of First Instance of Davao, be 
ordered to immediately give course to the appeal interposed by petitioner in 
five criminal cases decided by said Judge.</p>
<p>Petitioner is the accused in Criminal Cases Nos. 5364, 5365, 5366, 5443 and 
6112, for malversation of public funds thru falsification of official documents, 
before the Court of First Instance of Davao. Upon her plea of guilty in the five 
criminal cases, judgment was rendered by the respondent Judge which was 
promulgated on December 19, 1961.</p>
<p>On January 3, 1962, within the regfementary period to appeal, petitioner 
filed a notice of appeal in all the five cases. After the appeal bond, which was 
previously fixed at P20,000.00 for the five cases was filed and approved, 
respondent Judge, on January 11, 1962, ordered counsel for petitioner to file a 
manifestation stating therein the questions of law that the accused would raise 
in the appeal. Complying with said order, on January 26, 1962, counsel for 
petitioner filed a manifestation enumerating the questions of law he would raise 
in the Supreme Court, to wit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"1. That accused's plea of guilty in the five (5) cases were secured thru 
misrepresentation.</p>
<p>"2. That the penalties are not what had been promised the accused.</p>
<p>"3. That the penalty imposed in Criminal Case No. 6112 is excessive.</p>
<p>"4. That the decisions are rendered upon defective 
informations."</p></blockquote>
<p>On February 8, 1962, an order was issued by the respondent Judge disallowing 
the appeal, the pertinent portions of which reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The accused pleaded guilty to the information in all these cases. All 
defects in the information except want of jurisdiction and that the acts alleged 
in the information do not constitute an offense are deemed waived. The accused 
is intelligent and educated.</p>
<p>"The contention that the plea of guilty entered by the accused in all these 
cases were secured by misrepresentation is a question of fact. If true, there is 
no evidence of such misrepresentation in the record and it can not be reviewed 
on appeal. Moreover, the accused is intelligent and assisted by counsel. If 
there was any promise regarding the penalties, it is also a question of fact and 
since the record does not show such promise it can not be reviewed on appeal. It 
is not pointed out why the penalty Imposed in Criminal Case No. 6112 is 
excessive. The penalty imposed in this case is the minimum penalty. It is not 
stated why the informations are defective. As already stated all defects in the 
information except want of jurisdiction and that the acts alleged in the 
information do not constitute an offense are deemed waived by the plea of 
guilty."</p></blockquote>
<p>Claiming that respondent Judge acted improvidently and without any legal 
basis either (1) because at the time the questioned order was issued 
petitioner's appeal was already perfected and so respondent Judge had lost 
jurisdiction over the case, or (2) that respondent Judge has no power to pass 
upon the issues he would raise in the appeal, on April 3, 1962, petitioner filed 
the instant petition for mandamus with preliminary injunction to restrain the 
execution of the judgment in the five criminal cases in question. The Provincial 
Fiscal of Davao is included as party respondent. On April 6, 1962, this Court 
gave due course to the petition and issued the writ of preliminary injunction, 
prayed for, without bond.</p>
<p>The petition is meritorious. Settled is the rule that once an appeal in a 
case, "whether civil or criminal, has been perfected, the court <i>a quo</i> 
loses jurisdiction over the case both over the record and over the subject of 
the case" (The Director of Prisons, et al. v. Teodoro, etc., et al., 97 Phil., 
391, 395). And in criminal proceedings, an appeal is perfected by "filing a 
notice of appeal with the court in which the judgment or order was rendered, and 
by serving a copy thereof upon the adverse party or his attorney, within fifteen 
days from the rendition of the judgment or order appealed from" (Evaristo, et 
al. v. Hon. Olegario Lastrilla, et al., L-14682, November 29, 1960; Sections 3 
and 6, Rule 118, Old Rules of Court, now Sections 3 and 6, Rule 122.). Here it 
is not disputed that petitioner had filed her notice of appeal with respondent 
Judge on January 3, 1962, and having complied with the legal requirements for 
the perfection of her appeal before the statutory period for appeal expired,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> there Is no need for the respondent Judge 
to require petitioner to file a manifestation stating the questions she wants to 
raise In her appeal, and all that is left for him to do is to give the appeal 
due course. This is so because whether the issues to be raised by petitioner in 
the appeal are factual, or the appeal is frivolous or dilatory, is not for the 
court <i>a quo</i> to pass upon but by the appellate court.</p>
<p>Thus, in the case of Dasalla, et al. v. The Hon. Judge Hermogenes Caluag, et 
al., L-18765, July 13, 1963, this Court held:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is true that, according to defendants, judging from its merits, the 
appeal seemingly has been interposed by the plaintiffs merely for manifest 
delay, but even if this were true the right to pass upon this question Is not 
certainly the court <i>a quo</i> whose decision is in issue but the appellate 
court. The court <i>a quo</i> cannot prevent a party from appealing from its 
order or decision no matter how frivolous it may be in order that it may be 
reviewed by an appellate court, because such prerogative is given to the latter. 
As a matter of fact, this case is covered by our rules when they provide that 
where an appeal is found to be frivolous double or treble costs may be imposed 
on the appellant, which may be paid by his attorney, if so ordered by the court 
(Section 3, Rule 131). Indeed, this is a matter that cannot be looked into by 
the court <em>a quo</em> because it goes to the very merits of its decision. x x 
x"</p></blockquote>
<p>Recently, We had occasion to reiterate the foregoing ruling:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Respondent judge having erroneously dismissed GSIS' timely appeal, the 
present action for mandamus is the proper remedy (Sec. 15, Rule 41, Rules of 
Court). As regards the right to pass upon whether or not the appeal is 
manifestly for delay, the same resides not on the court <em>a quo</em> whose 
decision or order is in issue, but on the appellate court during consideration 
of said appeal (Dasalla vs. Caluag, L-18765, July 31, 1963)." (Government 
Service Insurance System v. Hon. Gaudenclo Cloribel, et al., L-22236, June 22, 
1965)</p></blockquote>
<p>It is contended by the Provincial Fiscal of Davao, in behalf of respondents, 
that the notice of appeal filed by the petitioner did not comply with the 
requirement of Section 3, Rule 42 of the Rules of Court (now Section 2, Rule 42 
of the New Rules of Court) which provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sec. 2. <i>Appeal on pure question of of law</i>.—Where the appeal is based 
purely on questions of law, the appellant shall so state in his notice of 
appeal, and then no other questions shall be allowed, and the evidence need not 
be elevated."</p></blockquote>
<p>This contention has no merit. The above-quoted provision refers to appeal in 
civil cases. The requirement that when the appeal (to the Supreme Court) is 
based on pure question of law "the appellant shall so state in his notice of 
appeal" does not mean that right in the notice of appeal the questions of law to 
be raised must be specified. That requirement is simply for the purpose of 
determining whether, or not, there is necessity for the transmission to the 
Supreme Court of the record of the evidence adduced during the trial. The law 
prescribes the cases that are appealable directly from the Court of First 
Instance to the Supreme Court, but if the appellant manifests that the appeal is 
based purely on questions of law he should so state in his notice of appeal so 
that the record of the evidence would not be transmitted to the Supreme Court. 
Thus if the subject matter of a civil case before the Court of First Instance is 
valued at more than P200,000.00, for instance, the decision of the Court of 
First Instance is appealable directly to the Supreme Court — and both questions 
of fact and law may be reviewed by the Supreme Court. Here is a case where it is 
necessary to state in the notice of appeal that the appeal is based on purely 
question of law — otherwise if there is no such statement in the notice of 
appeal the entire records of the case will have to be remitted to the Supreme 
Court. It is understood that in cases which are not appealable directly from the 
Court of First Instance to the Supreme Court a notice of appeal to the Supreme 
Court will only relate to questions of law.</p>
<p>The law prescribes the criminal cases that are appealable directly from the 
Court of First Instance to the Supreme Court, and in these cases both questions 
of fact and law may be reviewed by the Supreme Court. It is understood that an 
appeal from the decision of the Court of First Instance to the Supreme Court in 
those cases that are not directly appealable to the Supreme Court only questions 
of law may be raised. And so, in appeals in criminal cases that are not 
appealable directly to the Supreme Court, there is even no need to state in the 
notice of appeal that the appeal is based on purely questions of law. In fact, 
the provisions of Rule 118 of the Old Rules of Court (now Rule 122 of the New 
Rules of Court), relating to appeals in criminal cases from the Court of First 
Instance to the Supreme Court, makes no mention of any requirement that the 
appellant should state in his notice of appeal that the appeal is based on 
purely question of law.</p>
<p>The respondent Judge, therefore, erred in requiring the counsel for the 
petitioner to make specifications of the question of law that the petitioner 
would raise in his appeal to the Supreme Court from the decision in Criminal 
Cases Nos. 5364, 5365, 5366, 5443 and 6112 of the Court of First Instance of 
Davao.</p>
<p>It appearing that the respondent Judge had unlawfully excluded the petitioner 
from the enjoyment of a right to which she is entitled, and the petitioner has 
no other plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, the 
issuance of a writ of mandamus in the present case is in order.</p>
<p><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the writ of mandamus, prayed for, is granted. The order 
dated February 8, 1962 is set aside, and respondent Judge, or whoever now has 
taken the place of the respondent Judge and to whose sala Criminal Cases Nos. 
5364, 5365, 5366, 5443 and 6112 of the Court of First Instance of Davao are 
assigned, is hereby ordered to give due course to petitioner's appeal in said 
criminal cases. No costs.</p><i>Concepcion, C.J., Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, Dizon,

record to show that notice of the appeal was served upon the adverse party, this 
fact is to be presumed as the same is not raised and/or denied by respondents.
