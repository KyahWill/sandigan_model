				<BR><STRONG>ANGELES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, St. Paul Fire &amp;
Marine Insurance Company, was the insurer of a shipment consisting of 218
packages of medicinal and phar­maceutical products consigned to Winthrop
Stearns, Inc., Manila, loaded on the vessel SS Tai Ping, "which arrived in
Manila on August 7, 1960, and discharged unto the custody of the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operator, the Manila Port Service, on August 11,
1960.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">For loss and damage
sustained by the abovemen­tioned shipment, the consignee demanded and collected
from the insurer the reasonable value thereof, includ­ing other expenses,
amounting to $1,071.58.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The insurance company, as <span class="SpellE">subrogee</span> of
the con­signee, filed complaint with the Court of First In­stance of Manila,
alleging that the subject loss and damage were due to the fault and/or
negligence of the defendants Wilhelm <span class="SpellE">Wilhelmsen</span>
and/or its agents Bar­ber Steamship Lines, Inc. and/or <span class="SpellE">Macondray</span>
&amp; Co., Inc., prior to the delivery thereof to the Manila Port Ser­vice, or
in the alternative, that said loss and damage were due to the fault or
negligence of the Manila Port Service and the Manila Railroad Company, after
delivery thereof of the goods to the latter.</p>

<p class="BODY">Answering the complaint, the Manila Port Ser­vice and Manila
Railroad Company denied responsibility of the alleged loss and damage on the
ground that the goods have been delivered to the consignee in the same
condition as they were received by them from the carry­ing vessel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the same time, they pleaded, in defense,
the provisions of paragraph 15 of the Management Con­tract.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In their answer, the
other defendants, although denying responsibility and liability, for the loss,
alleged that for the purposes of avoiding litigation, they had offered to
settle the plaintiff's claim in full by paying the c.i.f. value of the lost and
damaged shipment, but the consignee and its <span class="SpellE">subrogee</span>
declined the offer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After trial and the
submission of the parties' memoranda, the court found that plaintiff's claim
had to do with one undelivered carton and damage on six cartons and one drum,
with a total value of P1,109.67; that said shipment of 218 cartons was
discharged from the vessel complete and in good order, with the excep­tion of
one drum and </span>3 <span style="">cartons, hence,
any loss or da­mage thereof are the responsibility of the owner and operator of
the vessel and its agents, while the unde­livered carton and any damage on the
remaining three cartons are the responsibility of the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
con­tractor and its principal company.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The court thus rendered judgment in accordance with these findings; and
to be more specific, it fixed the liability of the first set of defendants, for
the damage on the one drum and three cartons, at P300.00; while that of the </span>second
set of defendants, for the undelivered carton and the damage on the remaining
three cartons, for P809.67, both amounts with legal interest from the filing of
the complaint until fully paid.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Manila Port Service and the Manila Rail­road Company have
appealed.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is contended in the first place that the complaint should be
dismissed because the provisional claim, for the alleged lost and damaged
goods, was not filed within the fifteen-day period fixed by the Management
Contract for filing such claims.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
contention is meritorious, for the reason that while the carrying vessel
discharged its last package on <st1:date year="1960" day="11" month="8">August
 11, 1960</st1:date>, the claim adverted to was filed the day before or on <st1:date year="1960" day="10" month="8">August 10, 1960</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court has re­peatedly held that a
stereo-type provisional claim for "any shortage or damage that may after
examina­tion be found to exist" filed against the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
operator before the discharge of the last package from the carrying vessel is
not a compliance with the provision of the said Management Contract entered in­to
between the consignee of the goods and the <span class="SpellE">arras­tre</span>
operator, such claim being premature and speculative.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
To allow it would swamp the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> service with
advance claims of brokers for all goods consign­ed to their customers.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Of course, this ruling is
not without any ex­ception.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">In <u>Switzerland General Insurance Co., Ltd. vs. Java Pacific
&amp; <span class="SpellE">Hoegh</span> Lines, et al</u>., G. R. No.</span> L-­21760,
</span><st1:date year="1966" day="30" month="4"><span style="">April 30, 1966</span></st1:date><span style="">,
a claim filed in advance was </span>held to have constituted substantial
compliance with the provision of Section 15 of the Management Con­tract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But this, under the conditions that, upon the
examination of the shipment before the discharge of the last package from the
boat, certain shortages were found and that examination took place in the
presence of the representatives of both parties, <u>which conditions do not
appear to obtain here</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bare
allegation of the plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> that claim­ant
had knowledge of the loss and damage before the boat or vessel had finally
unloaded all its cargo, which allegation is not <span class="GramE">supported</span>
by the evidence, and without any showing under what circumstances the alleged
know­ledge had come about, would not cause Us to deviate from the general
ruling on the matter.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of these findings, <span class="GramE">We</span> need not
go into the other issue raised by appellant, which merely refers to the amount
for which the defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> would be held liable
should recovery appears to be proper.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from is hereby re­versed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs at this instance.</p>
