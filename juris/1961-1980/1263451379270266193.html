Acting Prosecutor of the CIR, filed a complaint against the aforementioned
union and its incumbent officers and members of the board of directors,
charging them with violation of Section 17, subsections (c), (f), (h), (j), and
(l) of Republic Act No. 875, by passing resolutions directing an assessment of
P5.00 monthly <span style="">from </span>everyone of

the </span><span style="">union.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After the hearing before
the court below was closed but before its decision was rendered, a
certification </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">submitted to it by respondents there
(petitioner here), to </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">effect that in a convention held on March 23,
24 and 25, 1961 the members of the union passed several resolutions, as
follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"1. The majority of the members of said convention has
ratified the collection of five pesos (P5.00) monthly as special assessment
from the members of the union to cover the deficit for the retirement benefits;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2. The majority ratified all union expenditures for the year
1959-1960 and all resolutions passed in the year 1959-1960 which resolutions
and expenditures are questioned in Case No. 2585-ULP in the Court of Industrial
Relations; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>3. That during said convention, the union president rendered an accounting
of his trip abroad and his report has been approved by the majority of the
members of the convention." (Annex <span style="">C)</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The above-mentioned
certification was made part of the record of the </span><span style="">case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date month="7" day="27" year="1961"><span style="">July 27,
 1961</span></st1:date><span style="">, the trial
court (Judge Jose S. Bautista) rendered the following judgment:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"IN VIEW WHEREOF, except for paragraph 9 of the complaint, all
other charges contained therein <span class="GramE">are</span> hereby
dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondents are hereby
declared guilty <span style="">of </span><span style="">unfair </span><span style="">labor practice pursuant to </span><span style="">sub-paragraph
(1), </span><span style="">Section 17 of Republic Act
975; are directed to cease and desist from further committing such unfair labor
practice complained of; and are also ordered to allow complainant Rafael
Hernandez to inspect the books of accounts, and other pertinent documents of
respondent union."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The complainants filed a
motion for reconsideration and on April 26, 1962 the lower court <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>
issued the following resolution, with Judges Jose S. Bautista and <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> M. Vil­lanueva dissenting and voting for the <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> of the original decision:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"IN VIEW OF THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, we are forced to vote for the
allowance of the motion for reconsideration of the aforesaid decision, and in
its stead we issue an order directing the respondents to cease and desist from
further commit<span style="">ting </span>the <span style="">unfair </span>labor practice acts described
in the complaint; and in order to make effective the policies of the Industrial
Peace Act, respondents are hereby ordered to stop the monthly collection of
five pesos (P5.00) from the members of the respondent union; that respondents
are hereby ordered to render an accounting of all expenses incurred by respondent
<span class="SpellE">Olazo</span> in his last trip abroad in July, 1960 and to
reimburse to the union all expenditures and increases in salaries which were
not properly authorized under the union's constitution and by-laws; and that
respondents are further ordered to post a copy of this resolution in two
conspicuous places in the premises of the business establishment of the Manila
Railroad Company and to report to this Court within thirty (30) days their compliance
of this resolution."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Respondents below filed
the instant petition for review and raise the following issues:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">Whether or not the 10% requirement
under Section 17 of Republic Act 875 is complied with where the union members
involved are not properly identified.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Judicial interference in internal affairs of a labor union is
sanctioned by Section 17 of Republic Act 875, other­wise known as the
Industrial Peace Act, which provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 17.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">RIGHTS AND CONDITIONS OF
MEMBERSHIP IN LABOR ORGANIZATIONS.</span> - It is hereby declared to be the
public policy of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
to encourage the following internal labor organization procedures.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A minimum of ten percent of the members of a
labor organization may report an alleged violation of these procedures in their
labor organization to the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the
Court finds, upon investigation, evidence to substantiate the alleged violation
and that efforts to correct the alleged violation through the procedures provided
by the labor organization's constitution or by-laws have been exhausted the
court shall dispose of the complaint as in 'unfair labor practice' cases."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">For the court to
intervene two requirements must </span>be <span style="">satisfied:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) at least 10% of the union membership must
concur to report the alleged violation; and (2) the procedures p</span><span style="">rovided </span><span style="">by the union's constitution or by-laws must first be exhausted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner here contends
that the 10% requirement of the law was not satisfied in this case and points
out that the signatures appearing on Annex A to the complaint in the court
below were not properly identified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
lower court, however, found that this requirement was complied with, and we
have no reason for disturbing this finding of </span>fact.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is true that under the
statute redress must first be sought within the organization itself in
accordance with its constitution and by-laws.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, it has been held that this requirement is not absolute, but
yields to exceptions under varying circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar, noteworthy is the fact
that the complaint was filed against the union and its incumbent officers, some
of whom were members of the board of directors.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The constitution and by-laws of the union provide that charges for any
violation thereof shall be filed before the said board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But as explained by the lower court, if the
complainants had done so the board of directors would in effect be acting as
respondent, investigator and judge at the same time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To follow the procedure indicated would be a
farce under the circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where
exhaustion of remedies within the union itself would practically amount to a
denial of justice, or would be illusory or vain, it will not be insisted upon,
particularly where property rights of the members are involved, as a condition
to the right to invoke the aid of a court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Going back to the first
issue, petitioner here argues that since the respondents admit </span>the <span style="">necessity of the assessment of P5.00 upon
each member the court has no power under Section 17 of Republic Act 875 to
declare said assessment excessive and unjustified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contention is </span>not correct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondents' complaint below, <span style="">as </span>explained by counsel in the course
of the hearing before the trial court, did not touch on the question of whether
such assessment was excessive or unjustified, but rather on the fact that it
was, together with other actuations of the union officers, and board of
directors, contrary to the constitution and by-laws of the said union.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They point out, correctly as <span style="">we </span>see it, that Section 1, Article VI
of the union's constitution and by-laws provides for a contribution of P2.00
from each member to cover the retirement benefits due to retiring members; that
the collection of P5.00 was based merely on the circular of the president of
the union, which appears to have been authorized by the board of directors;
that the board alone cannot amend the union's constitution and by-laws; and
that the increased assessment of P5.00 is in the nature of such an amendment,
and therefore required approval in a convention of the union members.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner here stresses
the fact that approval </span>by the members was obtained in their convention
held on March 23, 24 and 25, 1961, as shown by the certification to that effect
dated March 27, 1961.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court,
however, disregarded that certification on the ground that it was submitted
after the hearing had been terminated and without the <span class="GramE">respondents'
having</span> been given the opportunity to cross-examine the certifying
officers.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 5(b) of Republic Act 875 provides that the court in
rendering its decisions "shall not be bound solely by the evidence
presented during the hearing but may avail itself of all other means such as
(but not limited to) ocular inspections and questioning of well-informed
persons which results must be made a part of the record." This provision,
however, is not meant to do away with the requirements of due process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondents had the right to be heard before
the certification was admitted so that it could inquire into and test, by
cross-examination if necessary, the veracity of the facts alleged therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise self-serving evidence could easily
find its way into the record.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, we cannot close our eyes to the fact that the
resolutions referred to, apparently passed precisely to meet the objections of
herein respondents as alleged in their complaint below, <span class="GramE">may</span>
have a material bearing on the issues in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would therefore serve the ends of truth
and justice to have said resolutions properly presented as evidence so that
they may be considered by the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style=""> the decision appealed from is set aside </span>and
this case is remanded below for the reception of evidence concerning the
resolutions <span class="GramE">aforesaid,</span> and for the rendition of the
corresponding judgment thereafter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
pronouncement as to costs.</p>
