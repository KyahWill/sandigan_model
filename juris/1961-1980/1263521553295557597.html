				<BR><STRONG>FERNANDO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Respondent Court of Industrial Relations, in its decision sought
to be reviewed in this petition, sustained the claim of respondent Philippine
Association of Free Labor Unions, hereinafter designated as the respondent
Union, that the sale of the Quality Container Factory was designed to avoid
bargaining collectively with it as the duly chosen representative of such
employees and thus constituted an unfair labor practice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It therefore held vendors Catalina V. Tan and
Victor <span style="">Tan</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
and vendee Carlos Cruz<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
liable for the reinstatement of the members of respondent <st1:place>Union</st1:place>
to their employment with full back wages.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>With such a finding of bad faith reached by respondent Court, which is
not for us to disregard, there is a heavy burden of persuasion that must be
borne by the party assailing a decision of an administrative tribunal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A careful scrutiny of the arguments in the
respective briefs filed by petitioners in these two cases does not, for all
their plausibility, suffice to indicate that a different conclusion is called
for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We affirm.</p>

<p class="BODY">The background facts are set forth thus in the resolution of
respondent Court now before us: "It appears from the record that the
Quality Container Factory is a joint business venture of a husband and wife
team — [the Tan spouses] — employing hired-hands in the manufacture and sale of
tin cans. Sometime in January 1961 these workers formed a union, elected its
officers and had it registered with the Department of Labor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, on February 28, 1961 the
factory received from the complaining union a notice of its existence with an
attached set of collective bargaining proposal after a series of unreasonable
delay in dis­cussing or negotiating with complainant the possibility of
entering into a collective bargaining contract, a management-inspired petition
was later filed with this Court docketed <span style="">as
</span>Case No. 894-MC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
notwithstanding, and <span class="SpellE">inspite</span> of the protest lodged by
the petitioner Philippine Transport and General Workers Organization (PTGWO),
herein complainant Philippine Association of Free Labor Union (PAFLU) came out
by a clear majority and was declared as the winning collective bargaining representative
of the Quality Container Factory Workers."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Then came this portion: "On <st1:date year="1963" day="14" month="6">June
 14, 1963</st1:date>, after the issue of certification was decided by this
Court, complainant union proposed to continue the negotiations to possibly
finalize a collective bargaining contract with the management.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Less than a month thereafter, on <st1:date month="7" day="11" year="1963">July 11, 1963</st1:date>, the factory was how­ever
sold to respondent Carlos Cruz.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Trial Court while admitting the testimony of Mrs. [Tan] that she adequately
informed the buyer of the existence of the complainant union, * * *, in the
same way, sustained the testimony of Carlos Cruz that this matter was never
discussed in the preliminary talks prior to the sale of the factory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither one nor the other could be telling
the truth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not at all possible for
the Court to lend credence to the two narrations of facts one of which, on the
whole contradicts the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course,
the sale in all its phases is seemingly without flaw.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All its elements are anyway present to clothe
it with the taint of validity, except the motive, which undoubtedly was never
disclosed."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
It was noted in such a resolution: "This Court has in mind that there are
a number of causes why a business enterprise has to be sold.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are so many factors to be considered,
say, losses are being heavily incurred or that the owners have tired of its so
many industrial problems and would therefore want to retreat to a less busier
corner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A sale, under normal conditions,
may even be executed just for fun of it, and nobody would lift a finger against
its valid effects.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Oftentimes, however,
it is simulated to rid the management of mounting labor problems."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
After which came this observation on the part of respondent Court: "Under
the situation, there was no evidence presented which would somehow indicate
that business was lean, much less was it hinted that the former owners really
wanted to seek retirement from further engaging into the world of trade.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It could not be said that the sale was made
just for the sake of selling, or that the owners were branch­ing out into other
business fields.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were none of
these reasons."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It then ascertained what could be the possible motive for the
sale in this wise: "From the outset of the organization of complainant
union, the management considerably found a foe which it would not recognize for
reasons we do not know.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Evidence
strongly insinuated that the company supported a stand apparently adverse to
the sentiment of the workers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
mentioned certification Case (894-MC) which is interrelated herein, the same
company claimed to have an existing collective bargaining contract with another
union but which was never produced before the Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is why the dispute continued from there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Evidence further hinted that during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the protest in the said certification case, the
company financed the presentation of witnesses to testify against the union * *
*.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The labor dispute was indeed at its
height, still mounting, at the same time when the alleged sale was made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no other excuse that the Court
could exhaust under the <span class="SpellE">prevaling</span> conditions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sale was executed not for any other cause
but to rid the company of the current labor problems. (See <span class="SpellE">Angat</span>
Case) All phases of evidence pointed to it."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It was not surprising therefore that the conclusion reached by it
was that the transaction was tainted by bad faith and that there was an unfair
labor practice. Thus: "But a buyer should not be allowed to reap and enjoy
all the profits of a sale without the corresponding responsibilities that are
attached to the industrial enterprise, specially so when the sale was executed
under dubious circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it is so
the convenience of ridding the manage­ment of any labor problem is easily
facilitated by simulating a sale <span class="SpellE">everytime</span> the
laboring elements agitate the protection of their rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is why under the present condition,
responsibility should be shared by both the buyer and the seller otherwise the
efforts of the workers would have been futile and fruitless, since they would
naturally face a blank wall after the sale.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For how can they be reinstated to their former employment if the duty to
rehire them be limited to the seller?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This seems impossible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After all
respondent Carlos Cruz, was not at all free from the attending faults.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As was discussed earlier, Mrs. [Tan] made a
disclosure that he was made aware of the current labor problems.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be reasoned out that there was a
failure, much less can it be said that he is a buyer in good faith as far as
the workers are concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let all the
party respondents be liable, therefore."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is thus apparent that as noted at the outset the decision now
on review must be affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
conclusion reached by respondent Court finds support in the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be a frustration of the statutory
scheme in the Industrial Peace Act<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
instituting a regime of free collective bargaining to hold otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The choice as to the bargaining
representative of the employees belongs to them alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the language of the Act: "The labor
organization designated or selected for the purpose of collective bargaining by
the majority of the employees in an appropriate collective bargaining unit
shall be the exclusive representative of all the employees in such unit for the
purpose of collective bargaining in respect to rates of pay, wages, hours of
employ­ment, or other conditions of employment: * * *.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners, the Tan spouses, were thereafter called upon to
bargain collectively with respondent Union as such exclusive
representative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a failure to
do so by them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was an unfair labor
practice,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
compounded by another actuation amounting to discrimination in regard to tenure
or condition of employment against a labor union.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
Apparently in an effort to avoid the legal consequences of such conduct frowned
upon by the law, the connivance of petitioner Cruz was elicited. Necessarily
the sale was attended with bad faith. Respondent Court was not blind to such an
attempt at evasion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It refused to countenance
the resulting dismissal of the members of respondent Union.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It ordered the reinstatement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its decision far from being repugnant to law
is in conformity with it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This certainly
cannot be one of those cases where the judgment arrived at by respondent Court
is to be ignored, much less set aside.</p>

<p class="NUM">1. Its conclusion must be respected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no justification for the principal
contention advanced in the ably-written briefs of both petitioners Tan and Cruz
that the conclusion of respondent Court that the sale was tainted by bad faith
should not be sustained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law has not
been ignored.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Far from it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing offensive to the reason or
common sense in the verdict thus arrived at.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>More­over, as far back as 1940, it was already noted by Justice Laurel,
for a finding of respondent Court to lose its conclusive character, there must
be a showing of abuse of discretion.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
As worded in the Industrial Peace Act, factual determinations of the Court of
Industrial Relations "if supported by substantial evidence on the record
shall be conclusive."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
It is to be noted further that it is not only findings of fact that are
ordinarily left undisturbed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
principle as to the recognition to be accorded the conclusion reached by
respondent Court goes further.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it was
stressed in a relatively recent case, National Waterworks and Sewerage
Authority v. NWSA Consolidated Union:<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
"The controlling doctrine recognizes the wide discretion enjoyed by
respondent Court in ascertaining what actually did occur in labor disputes of
whatever sort.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its conclusion once
reached is invariably accorded the seal of our acceptance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its disposition of a case before it usually
elicits assent from us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It could happen
of course that we may fail to view matters similarly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have that power; it must be made use of
when warranted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not occur often
though.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is not merely so as to the
facts found.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The acceptance of its legal
conclusion reached is not a rare event either. This is merely to recognize that
on labor matters, its recognized expertise has well-nigh earned for its decrees
the title-deed to recognition, unless there be a rank failure to observe the
constitutional and statutory limitations which it must observe."<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
It follows there­fore that the principal assignment of error of petitioners as
to the absence of bad faith appears to be without sufficient legal basis.</p>

<p class="BODY">Support for the above conclusion comes from a leading case,
Philippine Land-Air-Sea Labor Union v. <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> <span class="SpellE">Indong</span> Co. Rice &amp; Corn Mills,<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
the opinion being penned by the then Justice, now Chief Justice, <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
speaks for itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus: "Upon a
review of the record we are inclined to sustain the conclusion of the trial
judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, as set forth in His
Honor's decision, and the Resolution appealed from does not deny it: 'The
management, in making their union busting air-tight, dissolved their
partnership without any reason at all although its existence is for 20 years
per Article of Partnership of <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> Han <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span> &amp; Company, doing business in the name of <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Sy</span></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE">Indong</span>
Company * * *. Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Que</span>, in his testimony, alleged
that the <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> <span class="SpellE">Indong</span> Company
was bankrupt, but nowhere in the records was there any declaration of
bankruptcy made by a competent court pursuant to the provisions of the Code of
Commerce.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, the manager,
Tan Chua <span class="SpellE">Seng</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span>
declared that as manager of the <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> <span class="SpellE">Indong</span> Company, he owned P20,000.00 worth of shares and
that his shares of stocks increased a little when he withdrew it. * * * The
alleged bankruptcy, therefore, of the company as pictured by Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Que</span> is absurd.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Other­wise,
the manager could not have withdrawn with an increased shares in stocks if the
company was really bankrupt. '" The ensuing paragraph follows:
"Moreover, <span class="SpellE">Sen</span> <span class="SpellE">Chiong</span>
was organized on the very same day on which the assignment thereto of the assets
of <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> <span class="SpellE">Indong</span> in <span class="SpellE">Tubod</span> took place, and <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> Han <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span> the managing partner of <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> <span class="SpellE">Indong</span> is the same managing partner of <span class="SpellE">Sen</span>
<span class="SpellE">Chiong</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again,
<span class="SpellE">Tiu</span> E. Tec is, likewise a partner of both
enterprises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These circumstances, when
considered in relation to the fact that the present unfair labor practice case
had been pending in the CIR for about 18 months prior to February 4, 1957, lead
to no other conclusion than that the organizers of <span class="SpellE">Sen</span>
<span class="SpellE">Chiong</span> were aware of said case when they established
the company and acquired the assets of <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> <span class="SpellE">Indong</span> in <span class="SpellE">Tubod</span>, and that they
either organized Sen. <span class="SpellE">Chiong</span> in an attempt to relieve
<span class="SpellE">Sy</span> <span class="SpellE">Indong</span> of the
consequences or effects of the present litigation, or acquired said assets
assuming the risk of having to bear the liabilities or part of the liabilities
that said litigation may eventually entail.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In either case, the trial Judge was justified in rendering judgment
against <span class="SpellE">Sen</span> <span class="SpellE">Chiong</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Necessarily then, the
alleged error assigned by petitioners, the Tan spouses, and petitioner Cruz that
respondent Court should not have ordered the reinstatement of the members of
complainant Union as well as the back wages to which they are entitled is
equally without foundation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The language
of the Industrial Peace Act is un­equivocal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For respondent Court, according to the Industrial Peace Act, is called
upon to "take such affirmative action as will effectuate [its policies]
including reinstatement of employees with or without back pay." Less than
two months ago, in East Asiatic Company, Ltd. v. Court of Industrial Relations.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court, through Justice <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>, had occasion to
announce the applicable doctrine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:
It is the obligation of the employer to pay an illegally dismissed employee or
worker the whole amount of the salaries or wages, plus all other benefits and
bonuses and general increases, to which he would have been normally entitled
had he not been dismissed and had not stopped working, but it is the right, on
the other hand, of the employer to deduct from the total of these, the amount
equivalent to the salaries or wages the employee or worker would have earned in
his old employment on the corresponding days that he was actually gainfully
employed elsewhere with an equal or higher salary or wage, such that if his
salary or wage in his other employment was less, the employer may deduct only
what has been actually earned."<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
There is thus a reconciliation of the principle that would hold an employer
liable for a defiance of the plain statutory command with the equitable concept
that he is not thereby precluded from reducing the financial liability
incumbent upon him by the deduction of whatever wages might have been earned by
the aggrieved employees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision
now under review as thus construed is thus free from such alleged infirmity.</p>

<p class="NUM">3.There is likewise an error assigned by petitioner Cruz that
labor contracts being in <span class="SpellE">personam</span> are not enforceable
against a transferee of an enterprise, there being no previous
employer-employee relationship existing between the new owner and the complaining
employees. Reliance is placed on our ruling in <span class="SpellE">Visayan</span>
Transportation Co. v. Java.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
There is no need to inquire as to the applicability of such a decision in the
disposition of the present case. If the facts were otherwise and no bad faith
could be imputed to petitioner Cruz, then perhaps it would be in order to
ascertain whether it governs the situation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Without discounting therefore the criticism to which the <span class="SpellE">Visayan</span> Transportation Company case had been subjected
insofar as it would ignore the binding force of a collective bargaining
contract just because of the sale of the enterprise, when the vendee could be
looked upon as the successor­-in-interest of the vendor to whatever rights or
obligations could be transferred, it suffices to state that petitioner Cruz is
in the position of a tort-<span class="SpellE">feasor</span>, having been a party
likewise responsible for the damage inflicted on the members of respondent
Union and therefore cannot justly escape liability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That would dispose of all the errors assigned
by petitioners in this appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of respondent Court of August 18,
1966 is affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case is hereby
remanded to the Court of Industrial Relations for further proceedings in
conformity with this opinion. With costs against petitioners, the Tan spouses
as well as petitioner Carlos Cruz.</p>
