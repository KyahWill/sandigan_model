				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On January <span style="">10, 1964 </span>the
spouses Mercedes Ruth Cobb-Perez and Damaso P. Perez interposed the present
petition for <u><span style="">certiorari</span></u><span style=""> </span>with urgent writ of preliminary
injunction from the order of <span style="">January </span><span style="">4, 1964 </span>of the respondent Judge
Gregorio T. Lantin of the Court of First Instance of Ma­nila, which order
denied a motion for reconsideration of a previous order rejecting <span style="">a motion </span>to quash the writ of
execution herein controverted.</p>

<p class="BODY">A chronology of the essential antecedent events <span style="">is </span>necessary for a clear understanding
of the case at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February <span style="">25, 1959 </span>the respondent Ricardo P. Her­moso commenced civil case <span style="">39407 </span>in the Court of First Instance
of Manila (Branch VII presided by the respondent Judge) against the petitioner
Damaso P. Perez and one Gre­gorio Subong, for the recovery of the principal sum
of <span style="">P17,309.44 </span>representing
unpaid purchases of leather ma­terials used in the shoe manufacturing business
of the said petitioner.  Because at the
hearing neither the de­fendants nor their counsel appeared despite due notice
to the latter, Hermoso was permitted to present his evi­dence <u><span style="">ex</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">parte</span></u><span style="">.  </span>On
April 11, <span style="">1960 </span>judgment was
rendered ordering Perez and Subong to pay Hermoso jointly and severally the sum
of <span style="">P17,309.44 </span>with interest,
attorney's fees and costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June <span style="">21, 1960 </span>Perez
and Subong appealed to the Court of Appeals, which dismissed their appeal
because it was filed beyond the reglementary period.  Then on Feb­ruary <span style="">4, 1961
</span>the defendants elevated the case to this Court on petition for <u><span style="">certiorari</span></u><span style="">, </span>which was denied for lack of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the case was remanded to the court of origin, Hermoso moved
for execution of judgment, which was granted on July 1, <span style="">1961, </span>and the corresponding writ of execution was issued on
August 15, 1961.  Meantime, on July <span style="">11, 1961, </span>Perez and Subong filed a
petition for relief from judgment, alleging excusable negligence.  This petition was denied by the respondent
Judge on August <span style="">3, 1961.  </span>From the order of denial, Perez and
Subong on August <span style="">21, 1961 </span>served
notice of appeal to the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On
August </span><span style="">23, 1961 </span>the
respondent Sheriff of Manila le­vied upon <span style="">3,573
</span>shares of <span style="">common stock registered in the name </span>of Damaso P. Perez with the
Republic Bank.  On August <span style="">30, 1961 </span>Perez interposed an urgent
motion to stay execu­tion, alleging that the levy on said shares was highly excessive
and unjust, considering that said shares have a to­tal value of more than <span style="">P357,300 </span>while the judgment debt was <span style="">only
P17,309.44.  On </span>September <span style="">2, 1961 </span>the Sheriff served and
published the <u>first</u> notice of sale scheduling the auc­tion sale of said <span style="">shares </span>for September <span style="">8, 1961.  </span>However, by order of September <span style="">7, </span><span style="">1961, </span>the
respondent Judge suspended the sale on execution pending resolution of the
abovemen­tioned urgent motion to stay execution.</p>

<p class="BODY">On September <span style="">29, 1961 </span>the respondent Judge promul­gated two orders:   the first denied the appeal of Perez and
Subong from the abovementioned order of August <span style="">3, 1961 re­jecting </span>their petition for relief from judgment, and
the second denied Perez' urgent motion to stay execution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, <span style="">an </span>October
<span style="">4, 1961 </span>the
respondent She­riff served a <u><span style="">second</span></u><span style=""> </span>notice of sale resetting the auction
for October 10, <span style="">1961.  </span>This was cancelled by the Court of
Appeals which issued on October <span style="">9, 1961
</span>a writ of prelimi­nary injunction, pending hearing of Perez' petition
for mandamus and <u><span style="">certiorari</span></u><span style=""> </span>with preliminary injunction (CA?<span style="">G.R. 29962-R) </span><span style="">filed on October </span><span style="">5, 1961 against </span><span style="">the res</span>pondents
Judge and Sheriff, in which petition Perez al­leged that (1) the levy upon <span style="">his </span><span style="">3,573 </span>shares of stock was manifestly
and patently unjust, and <span style="">(2) </span>the
respondent Judge committed grave abuse of discretion in denying his statutory
right to appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 15, <span style="">1962 </span>the
Court of Appeals rendered judgment sustaining Perez’ position with respect to
the extent of the levy at the same time that it upheld the denial of his motion
to appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case was remanded for the second time to the court of origin
on January 14, <span style="">1963.  </span>Subsequently, on January 18, <span style="">1963, </span>the Sheriff published the <u>third</u>
notice of sale, this time for only 210 shares of stocks, setting the public
sale for January 24, <span style="">1963.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Two days before the scheduled sale on execution, or <span style="">on January </span>22, <span style="">1963, </span>a new twist was added to the already pro­tracted
litigation when the petitioner Mercedes Ruth Cobb-Perez, the wife of Damaso P.
Perez, filed with the Court of First Instance of Rizal a complaint for
injunction with <u><span style="">ex</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>parte</u> writ of preliminary
injunction against Hermoso, the Republic Bank and <span style="">the Sheriff of Manila (civil case </span>7532), wherein she contended
that the levied shares are conjugal assets which are not answerable for the
judgment debt of Damaso Perez, an obligation contracted not for the <span style="">benefit </span>or interest of their conjugal
partnership.  On the following day, January
<span style="">23, 1963, </span>Judge Eulogio Mencias
of the Court of First Instance of Rizal granted the <u><span style="">ex</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>parte</u>
writ of preli­minary injunction, <u><span style="">enjoining</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">once</span></u><span style=""> <u>more</u> </span>the
respondent Sheriff from carrying out the execution sale.  However, on Oc­tober <span style="">4, 1963, </span>Judge Mencias lifted the writ, <span style="">in </span>obeisance to the doctrine enunciated in <u>Acosta vs. Alvendia</u>
<span style="">(L-14598, </span>October 31, <span style="">1960) </span>to the effect that courts of
first instance have no power to <span style="">restrain
</span>acts outside their territorial jurisdictions.   Incidentally, the abovementioned <span style="">civil </span>case <span style="">7532 </span>was
dismissed on November 9, <span style="">1963, </span>upon
motion of the complainant herself.</p>

<p class="BODY">A month before the aforementioned writ was lifted, or on
September 3, <span style="">1963, </span>Mrs. <span style="">Perez filed in the basic civil case </span><span style="">39407 </span>an urgent motion to recall or
lift the writ of execution issued on August 15, <span style="">1961, </span>alleging the same rea­<span style="">sons she advanced in civil case </span><span style="">7532 </span>then pending in the Court of First Instance of Rizal, which
are the self-same grounds upon which the herein petitioners anchor the peti­tion
at bar -- the conjugal nature of the levied shares of stock and the personal
nature of the obligation of Damaso Perez.  Neither Mrs. Perez nor her counsel attended the sche­duled
hearings.  On October <span style="">19, 1963 </span>the respondent Judge
promulgated an order <span style="">denying </span>the
motion on the ground that "Mercedes Ruth Cobb-Perez <span style="">is </span>not a part in this case and that
this [the motion to lift execution] is not the remedy prescribed by the Rules
of Court in its Section <span style="">15 </span>of
Rule 39 for the protection of her right".</p>

<p class="BODY">The writ of preliminary injunction having been lifted by the
Court of First Instance of Rizal, and the urgent mo­tion to lift the writ of
execution having been denied by the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>,<span style=""> </span>the respondent Sheriff on October <span style="">18, 1963 </span>caused the publication for
the <u><span style="">fourth</span></u><span style=""> </span>time of a notice of sale set­ting the
execution sale of 220 shares of stock for October <span style="">29, </span>1963.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On
</span>October <span style="">23, 1963 </span><span style="">Mrs. </span>Perez
filed with the respondent Sheriff a third-party claim over the aforesaid <span style="">220 </span>shares of stock, but the latter
was determined to proceed with the sche­duled auction sale as he was protected
by an indemnity bond filed by the respondent Hermoso.  <span style="">On
October </span><span style="">25, 1963 </span><span style="">Mrs. </span>Perez, assisted by her husband, commended civil case <span style="">55292, </span>denominated an action to
vindicate third-party claim with pe­tition for preliminary <span style="">injunction, </span>in Branch <span style="">XXII </span>of the
Court of First Instance of Manila, presided by Judge Federico Alik­pala.  As a consequence of the <span style="">new </span>action,
the projected <span style="">exe­</span>cution
sale was suspended for the fourth time.  On November <span style="">8, </span>1963 Judge
Alikpala denied the preliminary injunction prayed for <span style="">in </span>the aforesaid civil case <span style="">55292, </span>on the grounds that (1) he has
no power to interfere by injunction with the judgment or decree of <span style="">a </span>court of concurrent or coordinate
jurisdiction; and <span style="">(2) </span>the remedy
of plaintiff <span style="">(Mrs.
</span>Perez) is to lodge the third-party claim filed by her with the court
which issued the execution<span style="">, </span>"as
it has the inherent control of its minis­terial officers and to do all things
reasonably necessary for the administration of justice.”</p>

<p class="BODY">The aforesaid civil case <span style="">55292
</span>was dismissed on March <span style="">20, 1964,
</span>upon agreement of the parties after the institution of the petition at
bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the same day (November <span style="">8,
1963), </span>Damaso Perez filed in the basic civil case 39407 an "Urgent
Motion for <span style="">Reconsi­</span>deration"
of the order of October <span style="">19, 1963 </span>which
denied his wife's motion to recall the controverted writ of execution.  In this latest motion, Perez adopted his
wife's previous mo­tion, and at the same time offered in lieu of the levied
stocks his alleged cash dividends in the Republic Bank in the sum of <span style="">P19,985.  </span>In the same motion he asked for the suspension of the <u><span style="">fifth</span></u><span style=""> </span>scheduled auction sale set for No­vember 11, <span style="">1963, which </span>was granted <u><span style="">ex</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">parte</span></u><span style="">.<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On January <span style="">4, </span><span style="">1964, the motion </span>for
reconsideration <span style="">was </span>denied by the respondent Judge.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the respondent Sheriff had scheduled (for the <u>sixth</u>
time) the execution sale of the levied 240 shares of stock, the herein
petitioners on January 10, 1965 interposed the present petition, which was
given due course on January <span style="">15, 1964; </span>the
writ of preliminary injunction prayed for was issued upon petitioners posting a
bond of P10,000.</p>

<p class="BODY">The movants-petitioners<span style=""> </span><span style="">main con</span>tention
is that the res­pondent judge committed grave abuse of discretion in refusing to
recall the controverted writ of execution despite their avowal that the levied <span style="">240 </span>shares of stock belong to their
conjugal partnership and as such cannot be made to answer for a judgment debt
which is a personal obligation only of Damaso Perez.</p>

<p class="BODY">After a thorough review of the record, we hold that the
respondent Judge acted correctly in refusing to quash the writ in dispute.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is conceded that courts have jurisdiction to enter­tain
motions to quash their writs of execution because every court has the inherent
power, for the advancement of justice, to correct errors of its ministerial
officers and to control its own processes.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a> However,
the exercise of this power is well circumscribed.  Thus, the proper court may quash the writ only in certain
situations, as when it appears that (a) it has been improvidently issued, or
(b) it is defective in substance, or (c) it has been issued against the wrong
party, or (d) the judgment debt has been paid, or (e) the writ has been issued
without authority, or (f) there has been a change in the si­tuation of the
parties which makes such execution inequitable, <span style="">or (g) </span>the controversy has never been
submitted to the judg­ment of the court, and therefore no judgment at all has
ever been rendered thereon.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a> <span style="">In </span>the
instant controversy, not one of <span style="">these </span>accepted grounds exists.</p>

<p class="BODY">Significantly, the spouses have not questioned the in­trinsic
validity or regularity of the writ of execution.  They have alleged none of the circumstances earlier enumerated or
other similar grounds which may warrant the quashal of the writ in dispute.</p>

<p class="BODY">In reality, what they attacked is not the writ of execu­tion, the
validity and regularity of which are unchallenged, but the levy made by the
respondent Sheriff.  In this regard, the
remedy is not the recall of the writ, but an independent action to enjoin the
Sheriff from proceeding with the pro­jected sale, in which action the conjugal
nature of the le­vied stocks should be established as a basis for the subse­quent
issuance of a permanent injunction, in the event of a successful claim.  Incidentally, in the course of the pro­tracted
litigation, the petitioners had already <span style="">availed </span>of this remedy in civil cases 7532
and <span style="">55292, </span>only
to abandon it as they <span style="">incessantly </span>sought other, and often simultaneous, devices of
thwarting satisfaction of the judgment debt.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering the antecedent facts, particularly CA-G.R. 29962-R,
even the remedy indicated above must fail, as Da­maso Perez is now estopped
from asserting that the levied shares are conjugal assets.  All along he has nurtured the impression
that the said shares are his exclusive property, which representation <span style="">was </span>enhanced by the fact that the same
are registered in his name alone.</p>

<p class="BODY">It bears emphasis that in CA-G.R. <span style="">29962-R, </span>Damaso Perez practically asserted exclusive ownership
of the levied shares; although he challenged the legality and propriety of the
levy with respect to its excessive coverage, he never raised the question of
the conjugal nature of the levied shares.   Having represented himself before the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u><span style=""> </span>and in the
Court of Appeals as the exclusive owner of <span style="">the </span>shares in dispute, he is now precluded from asserting that the
levied shares are conjugal assets, an <span style="">assertion
</span>that he should have ad­vanced with expected alacrity when he first
questioned the legality of the levy.</p>

<p class="BODY">Coming now to the other petitioner, Mrs. Perez, although she was
not a party in CA-G.R. <span style="">29962-R, </span>the
judgment therein similarly binds her for she stands in privity with her
husband.  Moreover, she cannot feign utter
ignorance of the affairs of her husband as to justify her delay in questioning
the legal­ity of the levy on the ground aforestated in civil case <span style="">7532, </span>which case was commenced only on
January <span style="">22,1963, 17 </span>months after
the original levy was made on August <span style="">23,
1961.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Even granting that the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u><span style=""> </span>could
properly take cognizance of the said motion to quash the writ of execution, the
movants-petitioners failed to substantiate their claim that the levied shares
are conjugal assets and that the judg­ment debt is a personal obligation only
of Damaso Perez.</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent their claim that the shares in question are con­jugal
assets, the spouses Perez adduced not a modicum of evi­dence, although they
repeatedly invoked article <span style="">160 </span>of
the New Civil Code which provides that "All property of the mar­riage is
presumed to belong to the conjugal partnership, unless it be proved that it
pertains <span style="">exclusively </span>to the
husband or to the wife." As interpreted by this Court, the party who
invokes this presumption must first prove that the property in controversy was
acquired during the marriage.  In other
words, proof of acquisition during coverture is a condition <u>sine</u> <u>qua</u><span style=""> </span><u>non</u>
for the operation of the presumption in favor of conjug<span style="">a</span>l ownership.  Thus in <u><span style="">Camia de Reyes vs. Reyes de, Ilano</span></u><span style="">,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>it was held
that "according to law and jurisprudence, it is sufficient to prove that
the property was acquired during the marriage in order that the same may be
deemed conju­gal property." <span style="">In </span>the
recent case of <u><span style="">Maramba vs. Lozano,
et </span>al</u>.,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>this Court, thru Mr. Justice
Makalintal, reiterated that "the presumption under Article <span style="">160 </span>of the <span style="">Civil </span>Code re­fers to property
acquired during the marriage," and then concluded that since "there
is no showing as to when the property in question was acquired. . . the fact
that the title is in the wife's name alone is determinative." Similarly,
in the case at bar, since there is no evidence as to when the shares of stock
were acquired, the fact that they are registered in the name of the husband
alone is an indication that the shares be­long exclusively to said spouse.</p>

<p class="BODY">Conceding, however, that the shares in question are conju­gal
assets, they must still prove that their ganancial partner­ship is not liable
for the payment of the aforesaid judgment debt.  This, they were unable to do.  Their contention that the judgment debt is a personal obligation of only
one of them is devoid of evidentiary foundation.  It is, to say the least, a futile attempt to rebut the
presumption that the husband, as head of the family and administrator of the
conjugal partner­ship, contracts obligations for the benefit of his family or
the partnership.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
The aforesaid obligation was contracted in the purchase of leather used in the
shoe manufacturing bu­siness of the petitioner husband.  Said business is an ordinary commercial
enterprise for gain, in the pursuit of which Damaso Perez had the right to
embark the partnership.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a> It is
well-set­tled that the debts contracted by the husband for and in the exercise
of the industry or profession by which he contributes to the support of the
family, cannot be deemed to be his exclu­sive and private debts.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We feel compelled to observe that during the protracted li­tigation
below, the petitioners resorted to a series of actions and petitions, at some
stages alternatingly, abetted by their counsel, for the sole purpose of
thwarting the execution of a simple money judgment which has long become final
and executory.  Some of the actions were
filed, only to be abandoned or with­drawn.  The petitioners and their counsel, far from viewing courts as
sanctuaries for those who seek justice, have tried to use them to subvert the
very ends of justice.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the instant petition is dismissed, and the
writ of preliminary injunction heretofore issued is hereby dissolved.  Treble costs are assessed against the
petitioners, <span style="">which shall </span>be paid
by their counsel.</p>
