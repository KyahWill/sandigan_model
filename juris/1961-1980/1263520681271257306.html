				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">What is before this Court is the automatic review of a lower
court decision convicting the accused and sentencing him to death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its correctness is to be tested in the light
of the principal contention that the plea of guilt of the accused under the
circumstances disclosed did not suffice for the lower court's judgment of
conviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is, as will hereafter
be made evident, justification for such a stand as a reading of the transcript
would indicate that there were positive and categorical statements denying
culpability by the accused in the course of answering questions asked by the
lower court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the conviction
should be reversed and the case remanded.</p>

<p class="BODY">The information under which the accused was arraigned reads as
follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"That on or about the 7th
day of June, 1966, in the afternoon, in Bo. <span class="SpellE">Gobarogwan</span>,
Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Mondragon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>,
Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the
above-named accused, actuated by lust and with lewd designs and by means of
force and intimidation, and with the use of deadly weapon locally known as '<span class="SpellE">depang</span>', did then and there, <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>,
unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge with <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span>
<span class="SpellE">Buenaobra</span>, 26 years old, an unmarried woman of good
reputation, against the will and consent of the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That in the commission of the crime, the
following aggravating circumstances were present:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) in an uninhabited place; and (2)
recidivism, the accused having been convicted by final judgment before the
Honorable Court of First Instance, Branch IV, <span class="SpellE">Catarman</span>
<span class="SpellE">Samar</span>, in Criminal Case No. C-445 for Forcible
Abduction, on May 18, 1959, convicting the accused to suffer an indeterminate
penalty ranging from Six (6) years and One (1) day of <span class="SpellE">prision</span>
mayor as minimum to Twelve (12) years and one (1) day of reclusion temporal as
maximum and to indemnify the offended party in the amount of P500.00 and to pay
the costs." This information filed by an assistant provincial fiscal on <st1:date year="1966" day="26" month="8">August 26, 1966</st1:date> arose from a com­plaint
for rape against the accused by the offended party, <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span>
<span class="SpellE">Buenaobra</span>, dated <st1:date year="1966" day="21" month="6">June 21, 1966</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The arraignment was held on <st1:date year="1966" day="26" month="8">August 26, 1966</st1:date> in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>, Branch IV then presided by Judge Manuel R. <span class="SpellE">Pamaran</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused
was represented by an attorney <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>,
Gabriel de <span class="SpellE">Guia</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After the counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>
stated that the accused would want to enter a plea of guilty, the lower court
twice asked him whether such was the case, after informing him that the penalty
imposed could be death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Twice the
accused answered in the affirmative.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
He was then informed by the presiding judge that in order to give him enough
time to deliberate maturely on such a grave matter, he was given up to 2:00
o'clock that afternoon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
when the session was resumed, he was asked "what is his stand now?"
This was the reply of his lawyer:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Upon arrival, this repre­sentation inquired from the accused,
after having been duly informed by the Court of the effect of the plea of
guilty, and he still makes his decision to proceed with his plea of guilty as
stated this morning to this Court."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
When the accused was asked directly whether such manifestation of the lawyer
was true, the accused categorically affirmed:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Yes, sir."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Then, through the court interpreter, this question was put to him: "Are
you guilty or not?" The answer:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Guilty."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus far, it would seem that the accused did really intend to
enter such a plea, but what transpired in the subsequent questioning would, at
the very least, raise doubts on the matter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The court wanted to find out why he entered the plea of guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was his response:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"To be candid, sir, I would have not
entered the plea of guilty."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
When the question was repeated, he answered:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Because I already asked the woman to marry her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What was lacking was our marriage."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Again, when queried as to his plea of guilt, he spoke of the real reason, which
was not an admission of culpability:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Because I cannot do anything, sir, because I cannot fight this
case as I am very poor."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
He was given the opportunity to elaborate by the court stating that he would be
furnished counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What came from him in effect was a denial
that the crime of rape was committed:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"To tell the truth also, sir, in this case when it happened it is
not true that I raped her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were at
that time going to town to buy our necessities.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It so happened that my supposed brother-in-law, a younger brother of the
woman, desires that another person marry her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As a matter of fact, I was even wounded.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The first slash blow I received was this one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Witness showing a scar extending one finger
at the lower left scapula and about 1 centimeter wide)."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
When pressed further why he had to plead guilty, if what he said was true, he
had an explanation:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Because I had
already a previous case, and I believe that the government will still prosecute
me."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
The lower court, desirous of further clarification, informed the accused that
he could reconsider his plea and that he would be given a lawyer so that he
would have a fair trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All that was
said in reply was:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"I submit myself
to the discretion of the Court."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
When pressed to be specific on the matter, he categorically stated:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"I would desire not to plead guilty in
this case if I have the funds or money to pay for this."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
There would still, however, appear to be some slight confusion in the mind of
the accused, for when reminded that he did not have to pay a single centavo, he
surprisingly came out with the statement that "he would plead guilty to
the charge."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
At that stage, he was reminded again that the penalty imposed would be death.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Then and there, in open court, the decision now on review was
rendered, with the accused sentenced to death, the crime being one of rape with
the use of a deadly weapon, attended by the two aggravating circumstances of
uninhabited place and recidivism, which was offset by the mitigating
circumstance of a plea of guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
Court, as announced, is of a different mind.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The plea, considering the totality of the replies made by the accused to
the questions propounded by the lower court, could not in law be said to be one
of guilt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The conviction cannot stand.</p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The principal error
assigned, as set forth in the very able brief of counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>, Atty. Gonzalo W. Gonzalez, is that the lower
court did not fully inform the accused of the consequences of a plea of
guilt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a recent opinion promulgated a
year ago,<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court speaking through Justice <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, there is
this timely reminder to trial judges as to the course of conduct to be followed
whenever an accused in a capital offense enters such a plea.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"We have gone over the record and We find that the motion for new
trial mentioned heretofore is justified.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The present being one for murder for which the defendant was sentenced
to suffer the maximum penalty of death, We find it proper to invite the
attention of the court a quo and of all trial courts in general to what We said
in People v. <span class="SpellE">Apduhan</span>, G. R. L-19491, August 30, 1968
and People v. <span class="SpellE">Solacito</span>, G. R. L-29209, August 25,
1969 on the matter of what the trial court should do upon arraignment of a
defendant charged with a capital offense, before he is allowed to enter a plea
of guilty."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In People v. <span class="SpellE">Apduhan</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
Justice Castro, for the Court, did properly stress the need for such care and
circumspection in these words:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Even as we purge the decision under review of its errors, we must
hasten to commend the trial judge, the Hon. <span class="SpellE">Hipolito</span> <span class="SpellE">Alo</span>, for his earnest and patient efforts to forestall the
entry of an improvident plea of guilty by the accused <span class="SpellE">Apduhan</span>,
notwithstanding that the latter was already represented by a counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span> and hence presumed to have been advised
properly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judge <span class="SpellE">Alo</span>
made sure that the accused clearly and fully understood the seriousness of the
offense charged and the severity of the penalty attached to it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the accused proposed to confess his
guilt, Judge <span class="SpellE">Alo</span> repeatedly warned him that the death
penalty might be imposed despite his plea of guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As aforementioned, when it appeared that <span class="SpellE">Apduhan's</span> plea of guilty was ambiguous, Judge <span class="SpellE">Alo</span> reopened the case to determine with definitiveness the
nature of his plea.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The virtue of Judge <span class="SpellE">Alo's</span> efforts in ascertaining whether <span class="SpellE">Apduhan</span>
pleaded guilty with full knowledge of the signifi­cance and consequences of his
act, recommends itself to all trial judges who must refrain from accepting with
alacrity an <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> plea of guilty, for while
justice demands a speedy administration, judges are duty bound to be extra
solicitous in seeing to it that when an accused pleads guilty he understands
fully the meaning of his plea and the import of an inevitable conviction."<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
In People v. <span class="SpellE">Solacito</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
there is this realistic appraisal of the matter by the Chief Justice:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"No comparable assurance is imparted by
defendant's affirmative answer to the questions propounded by the lower court
'whether he understands the meaning of a plea of guilty and whether he is
admitting all the material averments in the information.' The questions were,
apparently, formulated in such a technical language that a layman is likely to
miss the far-reaching implications thereof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is every reason to believe that the accused, who claims to be an
'ice-plant delivery boy' is not capable of understanding the precise
connotation of the term 'material averments' of the information, used by His
honor the trial Judge, without any <u>explanation thereof, which, seemingly,
was not given</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There is, in addition, this equally relevant excerpt from People
v. <span class="SpellE">Arpa</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
where Justice <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span>, as <span class="SpellE"><u>ponente</u></span>,
after referring to the early cases of United States v. <span class="SpellE">Talbanos</span><a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
and United States v. Rota,<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
quoted with approval this excerpt from People v. <span class="SpellE">Bulalake</span>:<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
"It is of course true that the taking of such evidence is a matter left to
the discretion of the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nevertheless, inasmuch as judgments of conviction imposing the extreme
penalty of death are subject to review by the Supreme Court as law and justice
shall dictate, whether the defendant appeals or not, which automatic review
neither the Court nor the accused could waive or evade, it would seem that the
proper and prudent course to follow where the accused enters a plea of 'guilty'
to capital offenses specially where he is an ignorant person with little or no
education, is to take testimony not only to satisfy the trial judge himself but
to aid the Supreme Court in determining whether the accused really and truly
understood and comprehended the meaning, full significance and consequences of
his plea."<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
Tested by such authoritative pronouncements, it would appear that the lower
court, while not lacking in awareness of the proper procedure to be followed in
the event that the plea of the accused is one of guilt, ought, in the light of
the answers made, to have called to the stand witnesses to ascertain exactly
what did really transpire.</p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that sense, the
principal error assigned is not without basis.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, precisely because of the line of questioning pursued, the
answers elicited from the accused did cast enough doubt as to his intention to
accept culpability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were explicit
statements made that cannot be interpreted as other than a denial that he was
liable for the crime of rape imputed to him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It has been the constant, uninterrupted holding of this Court from <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> v. <span class="SpellE">Dineros</span><a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
that the essence of such a plea "is that the accused, on arraignment,
admits his guilt, freely, voluntarily, and with a full knowledge of the
consequences and the meaning of his act."<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
As further elaborated by Justice Carson, who likewise penned the opinion in the
subsequent case of United States v. <span class="SpellE">Jamad</span>:<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
"The effect of that ruling is to make it clear that the doctrine just
referred to is not applicable unless the plea of 'guilty' is in truth and in
fact made under the conditions indicated, that is to say on arraignment, freely
and voluntarily, as an express admission of the guilt of the accused of the
offense with which he is charged, and with full knowledge of the consequences
and the meaning of his act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A mere
formal plea of 'guilty' made under compulsion, or under any condition other
than those just indicated will not suffice."<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There is need, then, for such a categorical declaration by the
accused that he is guilty of the crime charged, one made with full knowledge of
the consequences that such an admission would entail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plea entered in this case was not
impressed with such an attribute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To so
construe the statements of the accused, characterized by inconsistencies and
express disclaimers of guilt, as amounting to an acknowledgment of criminal
liability, would be to disregard what has so long and so constantly been
adhered to.<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
There is force in the observation that the Constitution cannot be satisfied
with anything less.<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
It presumes the innocence of the accused; it is imperative then that the fact
of guilt be demonstrated by competent and credible evidence beyond reasonable
doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused could, of course,
dispense with the need of proof by the express admission at his arraignment
that he is guilty of the offense charged.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There must be a clear and categorical showing, though, that such indeed
was his intention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plea of guilt
must be unequivocal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must not give
rise to contrary interpretations.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Unfortunately, that is what happened in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court should not have been
satisfied that the accused did in fact plead guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, his judgment of conviction cannot
stand.</p>

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the conclusion thus
reached, there is no need to pass upon the other three errors assigned by the
accused to the effect that the lower court should not have appreciated the
aggravating circumstance of uninhabited place, should not have imposed the
death penalty, and should not have considered the plea of guilt as an admission
of the allegations in the amended information.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the lower court of August 26,
1966, convicting the accused of the crime of rape with the use of a deadly
weapon and sentencing him to death, is set aside, and the case remanded to it
