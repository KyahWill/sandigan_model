reconstituted <st1:place>Torrens</st1:place> titles whose originals <span class="GramE">are existing</span> and whose reconstitution was, therefore,
uncalled for.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lots Nos. 915 and 918 of the <span class="SpellE">Tala</span> Estate, with areas of more than twenty-five and
twenty-four hectares, respectively, located at <span class="SpellE">Novaliches</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span>, now <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City,
are registered in the name of the <u><span style="">Commonwealth
of the Philippines</span></u><span style="">, </span>as
shown in Transfer Certificates of Title Nos. 34594 and 34596 of the registry of
deeds of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> both <u><span style="">dated April 30, 1938</span></u><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The originals of those titles are on file in the registry of
deeds in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Pasig</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were
not destroyed during the war.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even the
originals of the preceding cancelled titles for those two lots, namely,
Transfer Certificates of Title Nos. 15832 and 15834 in the name of the
Philippine Trust Company, are intact in the registry of deeds.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The reconstitution proceeding started when <span class="SpellE">Fructuosa</span> <span class="SpellE">Laborada</span>, a widow
residing at 1665 Interior 12 Dart Street, <span class="SpellE">Paco</span>,
Manila, filed in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
at <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> City a petition dated November, 1967 for
the reconstitution of the title covering the above-mentioned Lot No. 915.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She alleged that she was the owner of the lot
and that the title covering it, the number of which she could not specify, was
"N. A." or <span class="GramE">not available (Civil Case No.</span> <span class="GramE">C-677).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition
was sworn to on <st1:date year="1967" day="16" month="11">November 16, 1967</st1:date>
before <st1:place>Manila</st1:place> notary Domingo P. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>
(48-52, Consolidated Record on Appeal).</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1968" day="2" month="4">April
 2, 1968</st1:date>, the lower court issued an order setting the petition for
hearing on <st1:date year="1968" day="14" month="6">June 14, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The notice of hearing was published in the
Official Gazette.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Copies thereof were
posted in three conspicuous places in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
and were furnished the supposed adjoining owners (53-54, Consolidated Record on
Appeal).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The registers of deeds of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
and <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> were not served with copies of the petition
and notice of hearing.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>State Prosecutor Enrique A. Cube, as supposed
counsel for the Government, did not oppose the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Laborada</span> presented
her evidence before the deputy clerk of court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Judge <span class="SpellE">Serafin</span> Salvador in his
"decision" dated <st1:date year="1968" day="6" month="7">July 6, 1968</st1:date>
granted the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">He found that Lot No. 915
was covered by a transfer certificate of title which was not available and
which was issued to Maria <span class="SpellE">Bueza</span> who sold the lot to <span class="SpellE">Laborada</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
transfer certificate of title covering the lot was allegedly destroyed during
the war.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plan and technical
description for the lot were approved by the Commissioner of Land Registration
who recommended favorable action on the petition (pp. 53-56, Consolidated
Record on Appeal).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">5.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The lower court directed the register of
deeds of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> to reconstitute the title for
Lot No. 915 in the name of <span class="SpellE">Laborada</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The order of reconstitution was not
appealed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It became final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">6.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Acting on the court's directive, the register
of deeds issued to <span class="SpellE">Laborada</span> on <st1:date year="1968" day="14" month="8">August 14, 1968</st1:date> Transfer Certificate of Title No.
(N. A.) <span class="GramE">3-(R).</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Lot No. 915 was later subdivided into seven lots, Lots Nos. 915-A to
915-G.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Acting Commissioner of Land
Registration approved the subdivision plan.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The register of deeds cancelled TCT No. (N. A.) 3-(R) and issued on
October 15, 1968 seven titles to <span class="SpellE">Laborada</span>, namely,
TCT Nos. 30257 to 30263 (pp. 56-59, 61-83, Consolidated Record on Appeal).</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">7.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">In</span> another and later
case, Civil Case No. C-763 of the lower court, one Francisca S. <span class="SpellE">Bombasi</span>, single, residing at 2021 San <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span>
Street, <span class="SpellE">Malate</span>, Manila filed in the lower court a
petition dated November 16, 1967 for the reconstitution of the title of another
lot, the aforementioned Lot No. 918.</p>

<p class="BODY">She could not specify the number of the title.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She alleged that the title was "N.
A." or not available.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She claimed
to be the owner of the lot and that the title covering it was destroyed during
the war.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Like the first petition, the
second petition was sworn to on the same date, <st1:date year="1967" day="16" month="11">November 16, 1967</st1:date>, before <st1:place>Manila</st1:place>
notary Domingo P. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why it was not filed simultaneously with <span class="SpellE">Laborada's</span> petition was not explained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(17-21, Consolidated Record on Appeal.)</p>

<p class="NUM" style="text-indent: -18.9pt;">8.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
lower court set the second petition for hearing on <st1:date year="1969" day="31" month="1">January 31, 1969</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As in <span class="SpellE">Laborada's</span> petition, the notice of
hearing for <span class="SpellE">Bombasi's</span> petition was published in the
Official Gazette.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was posted in three
conspicuous places in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> and copies thereof were sent
to the supposed adjoining owners (22, Consolidated Record on Appeal).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But no copies of the petition and notice of hearing
were served upon the registers of deeds of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
and <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, the officials who would be interested in
the reconstitution of the supposed lost title and who could certify whether the
original of the title was really missing.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="text-indent: -18.9pt;">9.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Bombasi's</span> petition was assigned also to Judge Salvador.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was not opposed by the government lawyers,
Enrique A. Cube and <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> de Leon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judge Salvador in his order of <st1:date year="1969" day="3" month="4">April 3, 1969</st1:date> granted the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The court found from the evidence that the allegedly missing or
"not available" title was issued to <span class="SpellE">Regino</span> <span class="SpellE">Gollez</span> who sold the land to petitioner <span class="SpellE">Bombasi</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The owner's duplicate of <span class="SpellE">Gollez's</span>
title was supposedly destroyed during the war.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Taxes were paid for that land by <span class="SpellE">Gollez</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bombasi</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
technical description of the land and the plan were approved by the Commissioner
of Land Registration who submitted a report recommending the reconstitution of
the title (pp. 22-25, Consolidated Record on Appeal).</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">10.<span style=""> </span>The lower court ordered the register of deeds
to reconstitute the missing title of Lot No. 918 in the name of <span class="SpellE">Bombasi</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Acting on
that directive, the register of deeds issued to <span class="SpellE">Bombasi</span>
Transfer Certificate of Title No. N. A. <u>4(R) dated </u><st1:date year="1969" day="27" month="8"><u>August 27, 1969</u></st1:date> (pp. 24-27, Consolidated
Record on Appeal).</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">11.<span style=""> </span>On March 25, 1969 or five months <u>before</u>
the issuance of the reconstituted title, Francisca <span class="SpellE">Bombasi</span>,
now identified as (R.C. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> 10/6/80) a resident of
<u>1665 Interior 12 Dart Street, <span class="SpellE">Paco</span>, Manila, which
was the same address used by <span class="SpellE">Fructuosa</span> <span class="SpellE">Laborada</span></u> (<span class="SpellE">Bombasi</span> used first
the address 2021 San <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> Street) sold Lot No.
918 to <span class="SpellE">Herculano</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Deo</span>
allegedly for P249<span class="GramE">,880</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Transfer Certificate of Title No. 34146-R was
issued to <span class="SpellE">Deo</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1969" day="28" month="10">October 28, 1969</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Deo</span> sold the lot to A &amp; A <span class="SpellE">Torrijos</span>
Engineering Corporation allegedly for P250<span class="GramE">,000</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Transfer Certificate of Title No. 34147-R was
issued to the corporation (pp. 10-11, 29-34, Consolidated Record on Appeal).</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">12.<span style=""> </span>On May 25 and 26, 1970, the State filed two
petitions for the cancellation and annulment of the reconstituted titles and
the titles issued subsequent thereto (Civil Cases Nos. 1784 and 1785).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judge Salvador, who had ordered the
reconstitution of the titles and to whom the two cases for cancellation were
assigned, issued on <st1:date year="1970" day="5" month="6">June 5, 1970</st1:date>
restraining orders enjoining the register of deeds, city engineer and
Commissioner of Land Registration from accepting or recording any transaction
regarding Lots Nos. 915 and 918.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">13.<span style=""> </span>The respondents in the two cases, through a
common lawyer, filed separate answers containing mere denials.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commissioner of Land Registration filed <u>pro</u>
<u>forma</u> answers wherein he interposed no objection to the issuance of the
preliminary injunction sought by the State.</p>

<p class="BODY">After a joint trial of the two cases, <span class="GramE">respondents
corporation</span> and <span class="SpellE">Laborada</span> filed amended answers
wherein they pleaded the defense that they were purchasers in good faith and
for value.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">14.<span style=""> </span>On June 22, 1972, Judge Salvador (who did not
bother to inhibit himself) rendered a decision in the two cases holding that
the State's evidence was insufficient to establish its ownership and possession
of Lots Nos. 915 and 918 and that <span class="SpellE">Laborada</span> and A
&amp; A <span class="SpellE">Torrijos</span> Engineering Corporation were
purchasers in good faith and for value and, consequently, their titles are not <span class="SpellE">cancellable</span> and annullable.</p>

<p class="BODY">Judge Salvador further held that the titles, whose reconstitution
he had ordered allegedly in conformity with law, could not be attacked
collaterally and, therefore, "the reconstituted titles and their
derivatives have the same validity, force and effect as the originals before
the reconstitution" (pp. 160-161, Consolidated Record on Appeal).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The State appealed.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">15.<span style=""> </span>The Court of Appeals, in affirming the lower court's
judgment, held that the orders of reconstitution dated July 6, 1968 and April
3, 1969 could no longer be set aside on May 26, 1970, when the petitions for
annulment and cancellation of the reconstituted titles were filed, and that if
there were irregularities in the reconstitution, then, as between two innocent
parties, the State, as the party that made possible the reconstitution, should
suffer the loss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals
cited section 101 of Act 496 to support its view that a registered owner may
lose his land "by the registration of any other person as owner of such
land".</p>

<p class="BODY">The State appealed to this Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We hold that the appeal is justified.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Appellate Court and the trial court grievously erred in sustaining
the validity of the reconstituted titles which, although issued with judicial
sanction, are no better than spurious and forged titles.</p>

<p class="BODY">In all candor, it should be stated that the reconstitution
proceedings, Civil Cases Nos. C-677 and C-<span class="GramE">763,</span> were
simply devices employed by petitioners <span class="SpellE">Laborada</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bombasi</span> for <span class="SpellE"><u>landgrabbing</u></span>
or for the usurpation and illegal appropriation of fifty hectares of
State-owned urban land with considerable value.</p>

<p class="BODY">The crucial and decisive fact, to which no importance was
attached by the lower court and the Fifth Division of the Court of Appeals
(Reyes, L. B., <span class="SpellE">Domondon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Ericta</span>,
<u>JJ</u>.), is that two valid and existing Torrens titles in the name of the
Commonwealth of the Philippines were needlessly reconstituted in the names of <span class="SpellE">Laborada</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bombasi</span> on the false
or <span class="SpellE">perjurious</span> assumption that the two titles were
destroyed during the war.</p>

<p class="BODY">That kind of reconstitution was a brazen and monstrous fraud
foisted on the courts of justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
a stultification of the judicial process.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One and the same judge (1) allowed the reconstitution and then (2)
decided the two subsequent cases for the cancellation and annulment of the
wrongfully reconstituted titles.</p>

<p class="BODY">The existence of the two titles of the Government for Lots Nos.
915 and 918 <u>ipso</u> <u>facto</u> nullified the reconstitution proceedings
and signified that the evidence in the said proceedings as to the alleged
ownership of <span class="SpellE">Laborada</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bombasi</span>
cannot be given any credence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two
proceedings were sham and deceitful and were filed in bad faith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such humbuggery or imposture cannot be
countenanced and cannot be the source of legitimate rights and benefits.</p>

<p class="BODY">Republic Act No. 26 provides for a special procedure for the
reconstitution of <st1:place>Torrens</st1:place> certificates of title that are
missing and not fictitious titles or titles which are existing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a patent absurdity to reconstitute
existing certificates of title that are on file and available in the registry
of deeds.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">The reconstitution proceedings in Civil Cases
Nos.</span> C-677 and C-763 are void because they are contrary to Republic Act No.
26 and beyond the purview of that law since the titles reconstituted are
actually subsisting in the registry of deeds and do not require reconstitution
at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a rule, acts executed against
the provisions of mandatory laws are void (Art. 5, Civil Code).</p>

<p class="BODY">To sustain the validity of the reconstituted titles in these
cases would be to allow Republic Act No. 26 to be utilized as an instrument for
<span class="SpellE">landgrabbing</span> (See Republic vs. Court of Appeals, <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> and Anglo, L-31303-04, May 31, 1978, 83 SCRA 453, <span style="">480, per <u>J</u>. G. S. Santos) or to
sanction fraudulent machinations for depriving a registered owner of his land,
to undermine the stability and security of Torrens titles and to impair the
Torrens system of registration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The theory of A &amp; A <span class="SpellE">Torrijos</span>
Engineering Corporation that it was a purchaser in good faith and for value is
indefensible because the title of the lot which it purchased unmistakably shows
that such title was reconstituted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
circumstance should have alerted its officers to make the necessary
investigation in the registry of deeds of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
and <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> where they could have found that <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
918 is owned by the State.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decisions of the Court of Appeals and the
trial court are reversed and set aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">The reconstitution proceedings in Civil Cases Nos.</span> C-677 and
C-763 are declared void and are set aside.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The reconstituted titles, Transfer Certificates of Title Nos. N. A.
3-(R) and N. A. 4-(R), and Transfer Certificates of Title Nos. 34146-R, 34147-R
and 30257 to 30263 and the survey plans and subdivision plan connected therewith
are likewise declared void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The register
of deeds is directed to cancel the said titles.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">BARREDO, <i>J.</i>:<span style="font-weight: normal;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.7pt;">I
concur fully in the well-reasoned main opinion of </span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.3pt;">Mr. Justice Aquino, if
only because it is to me inconceivable </span><span style="">how any court can order the reconstitution of a supposed lost torrens
title when the record shows beyond doubt that the land </span>in question, per
its technical description and location, is covered already by another title
actually subsisting in the office of the corresponding register of deeds.</p>

<p class="BODY">I am writing this separate opinion only to underscore my considered
view that considering the records that the various <span style="letter-spacing: 0.5pt;">offices of the government having to do with the matter should </span>keep
regularly, like the Land Registration Commission, the Bureau of Lands and the
corresponding Register of Deeds, only bad faith and bad faith alone can give
occasion to occurrences like what happened in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <st1:place>Torrens</st1:place> system of
land registration was conceived to give every duly registered owner complete
peace of mind as long as he has not voluntarily disposed of any right over the
same in the manner allowed by law that he would be safe in his ownership and
its consequent rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="letter-spacing: 0.1pt;">provision about recourse to the Assurance Fund was
not included </span>in the Act <span class="GramE">for the benefit of scoundrels
who might ingeniously <span style="letter-spacing: 0.2pt;">"steal" lands
nor</span></span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.2pt;"> to open opportunities for
chicanery of any shade </span>or mode.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nor is the judiciary without any responsibility in the
premises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judges must bear in mind that
the reconstitution of <span class="GramE">torrens</span> titles after a war or
other national catastrophe is a function that deserves the most careful and
scrupulous attention, certainly not a perfunctory, much less ministerial chore
to be performed on the basis simply of easily obtainable pro forma <span style="letter-spacing: 0.4pt;">certificates of other officials concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would go as far as to </span>require oral
testimony of the said official, unless this <span class="GramE">be</span> very
inconvenient, subject to closest scrutiny as to the veracity of his <span style="letter-spacing: 0.35pt;">records.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is absolutely no excuse for a judge to ignore the </span>actual
existence of a title in the office of the Register of Deeds covering the same
land claimed by another who alleges his title <span style="letter-spacing: 0.15pt;">thereto
has been lost, absent any showing of voluntary transfers </span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.45pt;">or other lawful transmission by the registered
owner in favor of </span>a person from whom the petitioner could have obtained
his right.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.15pt;">There are too many fake titles
being peddled around and </span>it behooves every official of the government
whose functions <span style="letter-spacing: 0.15pt;">concern the issuance of
legal titles to see to it that this plague </span>that has made a mockery of
the Torrens system is eradicated <span style="letter-spacing: 0.25pt;">right now
through their loyalty, devotion, honesty and integrity, </span>in the interest
of our country and people at large.</p>
