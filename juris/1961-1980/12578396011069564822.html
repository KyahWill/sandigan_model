				<H3>TOMAS B. TADEO, PETITIONER AND APPELLANT VS. THE PROVINCIAL FISCAL OF PANGASINAN, THE JUSTICE OF THE PEACE OF MANGALDAN, EMILIA ACOSTA AND LEONCIO MAICONG, RESPONDENTS AND APPELLEES.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>PADILLA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from an order of the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan, 
Third Branch, dated 30 July 1957, denying Tomas B. Tadeo Sr.'s petition for a 
writ of prohibition to enjoin the Provincial Fiscal and Special Counsel and the 
Justice of the Peace Court of Mangaldan, Pangasinan, from conducting the 
preliminary investigation in criminal) case No. 263 of the said Justice of the 
Peace Court for <i>estafa</i>, against the appellant, at the instance of the 
spouses Leoncio Maicong and Emilia Acosta.
<p>In the appellant's amended petition filed and admitted in Court on 26 June 
1957, in lieu of the original filed on 13 May 1957, the appellant alleged that 
in civil case No. 10759 of the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan, the 
appellees spouses sued him for damages allegedly for preparing a deed of sale of 
their parcel of land conveying it to Francisco Bongato and fraudulently inducing 
them to sign the deed of sale which they did sign under the belief that it was a 
partition of their conjugal partnership property they had asked the appellant, a 
lawyer and notary public, to prepare and ratify; that after instituting the 
foregoing action the appellees spouses filed against the appellant a complaint 
for <i>estafa</i> in the Justice of the Peace Court of Mangaldan, Pangasinan, 
arising from the same facts alleged in Civil Case No. 10759 (criminal ease No. 
129); that the Court of First Instance dismissed civil case No. 10759; that 
after the dismissal of the said civil case by the Court of First Instance, the 
Justice of the Peace Court dismissed criminal case No. 129 for <i>estafa</i> 
against the appellant on the ground that the dismissal of the civil case which 
was prejudicial precluded the continuation of the criminal case which arose from 
the same transaction alleged in the civil case; that after the dismissal of 
civil case No. 10759 by the Court of First Instance the appellant filed in the 
same Court a complaint against the appellees spouses for declaratory judgment 
basing his cause of action upon the same transaction alleged in civil case No. 
10759, which was still pending hearing and determination (civil case No. D-413); 
that after the appellant had instituted civil case No. D-413 in the Court of 
First Instance the appellees spouses again filed a complaint for <i>estafa</i> 
against the appellant in the same Justice of the Peace Court upon the same facts 
alleged in civil ease No. 10759 and criminal case No. 129, which already had 
been dismissed, and civil case No. D-413, still pending hearing and 
determination (criminal case No. 263); that civil case No. D-413 is prejudicial 
to criminal case No. 263; that the dismissal of civil case No. 10759 and 
criminal case No. 129 constitutes a bar to further criminal prosecution of the 
appellant for <i>estafa</i> arising from the same facts alleged therein; that 
all these notwithstanding the appellee Provincial Fiscal and Special Counsel and 
the appellee Justice of the Peace Court were conducting the preliminary 
investigation of criminal case No. 263 against the appellant; that the act of 
the aforesaid appellees in conducting the preliminary investigation in the said 
criminal case constitutes a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of 
jurisdiction; and that there is no appeal or any other plain, speedy and 
adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law available to the appellant. The 
appellant prayed that the appellees be enjoined from conducting the preliminary 
investigation in criminal case No. 263 for <i>estafa</i> against him (civil case No. D-539).</p>
<p>In their answer entitled "opposition" filed on 22 June 1957, the appellees 
alleged that civil case No. 10759 had been dismissed without trial on the merits 
and criminal case No. 129 had been dismissed without prejudice; and contended 
that civil case No. D-413 for declaratory relief does not raise any question 
prejudicial to the determination of criminal case No. 263 because the former 
refers to facts separate and distinct from those alleged in the latter case; 
that as the same acts that constitute the crime of <i>estafa</i> alleged in 
criminal case No. 263 are referred to in civil case No. D-413, the criminal case 
for <i>estafa</i> should first be decided before trial in the civil case could 
proceed; and that in civil case No. D-418 the appellant is not the real 
party-in-interest because he was not privy to any of the parties in the deed of 
quitclaim sought to be construed.</p>
<p>After trial and after the appellant had submitted his memorandum, on 30 July 
1957, as stated at the outset of this opinion, the Court entered an order 
denying the writ prayed for, on the ground that although the appellant's "claim 
of persecution" by the appellees seems to be "borne out by the previous cases 
between the parties which were dismissed," yet the former has a plain, speedy 
and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, for at the opportune time he 
could set up all defenses and appeal in case of an adverse judgment; and that 
the Provincial Fiscal and Special Counsel and the Justice of the Peace Court 
have the authority to conduct the preliminary investigation in criminal case No. 
263.</p>
<p>On 2 August 1957 the appellees Provincial Fiscal and Special Counsel filed a 
motion praying that the statement of the Court in its order, to wit: "There 
seems, however, to be a justification on the claim of persecution on the part of 
petitioner. This is borne out by the previous cases between the parties which 
were dismissed," be deleted.</p>
<p>On 10 August 1957 the appellant filed his notice of appeal "to the Court of 
Appeals on the ground that the said decision is contrary to law and the 
evidence."</p>
<p>On 14 August 1957 the Court entered an order setting the motion of the 
appellee Provincial Fiscal and Special Counsel for hearing on 21 August 1957 at 
8:30 o'clock in the morning and directing that a copy of the motion be furnished 
the appellant immediately.</p>
<p>On the same day, 14 August 1957, the appellant filed the appeal bond and 
prayed that the Court approve it.</p>
<p>On 21 August 1957 the court granted the appellant until 26 August 1957 to 
answer the motion of the appellee Provincial Fiscal and Special Counsel. On 24 
August 1957 the appellant filed his answer to the said motion.</p>
<p>On 11 September 1957 the Court approved the appeal bond filed by the 
appellant and denied the motion of the appellee Provincial Fiscal and Special 
Counsel for the reason that it had lost jurisdiction of the case by the 
perfection in due time of an appeal taken by the appellant. The Court also 
ordered the transmittal of the record of the case to the appellate court. On 14 
September 1957 the Court of Appeals received the record of the case. On 28 
November 1959 the Court of Appeals certified the appeal to this Court on the 
ground that only a question of law is involved.</p>
<p>The undisputed facts of the case are: On 29 January 1949 the appellees 
spouses brought an action in the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan against 
the appellant for recovery of P2,000 as damages suffered and P1,500 as 
attorney's fees spent by the former as a result of a fraudulent drafting by the 
latter of a deed of sale purporting to convey their parcel of land to Francisco 
Bongato and execution thereof by the appellees spouses under the belief that it 
was a deed of partition of their conjugal partnership property they had asked 
the appellant to draft (civil case No. 10579, Exhibit A). To this complaint the 
appellant and codefendant Francisco Bongato filed an answer with counterclaim 
for P5,000 and P500, respectively, as damages for maliciously bringing an 
unfounded suit calculated to embarrass them (Exhibit B). After filing the suit 
in the Court of First Instance (civil case No. 10579), the appellees spouses 
filed a criminal complaint for <i>estafa</i> arising from the same facts alleged 
in civil case No. 10579, against the appellant in the Justice of the Peace Court 
of Mangaldan (criminal case No. 129). At the preliminary investigation of 
criminal case No. 129 on 5 January 1956, the Justice of the Peace Court, at the 
behest of the appellant, suspended further proceedings until after civil case 
No. 10579 of the Court of First Instance, which has a direct beating on criminal 
case for <i>estafa</i>, shall have been finally decided (Exhibit G). On 21 March 
1956, upon motion of counsel for the appellees spouses that they were no longer 
interested in the prosecution of the case, but over the objection of the 
appellant who asked to be allowed to prove his counterclaim, the Court of First 
Instance dismissed the appellees spouses' complaint and the appellant's 
counterclaim in civil case No. 10579, because the latter could prosecute his 
claim in another action, his counterclaim being permissive only and not 
compulsory (Annex C). On 18 June 1956 the appellant filed a complaint for 
declaratory relief in the Court of First Instance against the appellees spouses 
and co-defendant Vicente Torralba praying that the deed of quitclaim executed 
by them on 27 March 1948 in favor of Francisco Bongato be declared "the genuine 
document representing the true intention" of the appellees spouses and that he 
(the appellant) be relieved from civil and criminal liability arising from the 
part he had taken as lawyer and notary public in the drafting and execution 
thereof; that the appellees spouses be enjoined from impeaching the genuineness 
and due execution of said deed of quitclaim; that the appellees spouses and 
their co-defendant Vicente Torralba, jointly and severally, be ordered to pay 
the appellant moral and actual damages in the total sum of P2,900; that during 
the pendency of the case a writ issue to attach the appellees spouses' and 
co-defendant's properties to secure the satisfaction of the judgment for damages 
that the appellant might recover from them; and that the appellant be granted 
other just and equitable relief (Exhibit D). On 22 June 1956 the appellant 
filed in the Justice of the Peace Court of Mangaldan a motion to dismiss 
criminal case No. 129 on the ground that civil case No. 10579, upon the facts of 
which criminal case No. 129 for <i>estafa</i> was based, already had been 
dismissed and that the determination of the question of whether or not the crime 
of <i>estafa</i> had been committed by the appellant depends upon the outcome of 
civil case No. B-413 for declaratory judgment filed by the appellant in the 
Court of First Instance (Exhibit F). On 9 July 1956 the Justice of the Peace 
Court dismissed without prejudice criminal case No. 129 (Exhibit H). On 30 April 
1957 the appellees spouses again instituted criminal proceedings for 
<i>estafa</i> against the appellant in the Justice of the Peace Court of 
Mangaldan, Pangasinan, based on the same facts alleged in civil case No. 10579 
(criminal case No. 263).</p>
<p>A Provincial Fiscal, a duly appointed Special Counsel or a Justice of the 
Peace has the power and authority to conduct preliminary investigations of 
crimes committed within their territorial jurisdiction. In the case at bar the 
crime of <i>estafa</i> imputed to the appellant in criminal case No. 263 was 
allegedly committed by him in Mangaldan, Pangasinan. Undoubtedly, the appellees 
conducting the preliminary investigation of criminal case No. 263 have the power 
and authority to do so. But in taking cognizance of the case and conducting the 
preliminary investigation, did they act with grave abuse of discretion which 
would entitle the appellant to the extraordinary legal remedy of prohibition and 
justify the intervention of a court exercising supervisory authority over them? 
Civil case No. 10579 for damages, brought by the appellees spouses against the 
appellant, was dismissed by the Court of First Instance for lack of interest on 
the part of the plaintiffs therein and not because the fraud constituting their 
cause of action and the crime of <i>estafa</i> allegedly committed by the 
appellant in fact had not been committed by him (Exhibit C). Criminal case No. 
129 for <i>estafa</i> against the appellant was likewise dismissed by the 
Justice of the Peace Court but without prejudice (Exhibit H). The pendency of 
civil case No. D-413 for declaratory judgment, commenced by the appellant 
against the appellees spouses in the Court of First Instance, was one of the 
reasons given by the Justice of the Peace Court to dismiss criminal case No. 
129. However, the appellant not being one of the constracting parties to the 
deed of sale executed by the appellees spouses but took part only as notary 
public before whom they acknowledged the execution thereof is not entitled to 
file an action for declaratory judgment. None of his rights or duties thereunder 
need be declared.<sup><font color="#ff0000">[1]</font></sup></p>
<p>Another valid and good reason relied upon by the Court in denying the writ 
prayed for is that the appellant has a plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the 
ordinary course of law. In the appropriate case and at the opportune time he may 
set up all defenses available to him and may appeal from an adverse 
pudgment.</p>
<p>As regards the motion to delete from the decision the statement of the Court 
to the effect that the appellee Provincial Fiscal and Special Counsel are 
persecuting the appellant, on 2 August 1957 when the motion was filed, the Court 
still had jurisdiction of the case for it was only on 10 and 14 August 1957 when 
the appellant filed his notice of appeal and appeal bond dnd the appellant had 
not yet perfected his appeal. Hence the Court should have acted upon it.</p>
<p>In fairness to the appellee Provincial Fiscal and Special Counsel, their act 
of conducting the preliminary investigation of criminal case No. 263 for 
<span style="font-style: italic;">estafa</span> against the apppellant does not constitute persecution; on the 
contrary they should be commended for their zeal and devotion to duty. It was 
incumbent upon them to Inquire whether an offense had been committed, and, if 
they should find it had been committed, to charge and prosecute the guilty 
part.</p>
<p>The order appealed from is affirmed, with costs against the appellant.</p> <i>Bengzon, C. J., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., 
Barrera, Paredes, Dizon,</i> and <i>De Leon, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br> <hr align="left" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<sup><font color="#ff0000">[1]</font></sup> In the order appealed from the Court 
states that after trial of civil case No. D-539, on 3 July 1957 it dismissed 
civil case No. D-413 "on the ground that said action is improper."</div>
