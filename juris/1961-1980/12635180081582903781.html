				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petition for review of the decision of the Public Service
Commission, in its Case No. 67-1712, granting the application of respondent
Dolly C. <span class="SpellE">Javellana</span> for a certi­ficate of public
convenience to operate a taxicab automo­bile service in the <st1:place><st1:placetype>island</st1:placetype>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Dolly C. <span class="SpellE">Javellana</span> filed
with the Public Service Commission an application to operate a taxicab automobile
service in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, and from the said City to any

traffic, and vice-versa, with the use of thirty (30) units.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In her application said respondent alleged,
among others, that she is of legal age, a Filipino citizen, financially capable
to operate the proposed service, and that public necessity and convenience
demands the approval of the appli­cation.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Generoso</span> Villanueva
Transportation Co., Inc. and Vicente <span class="SpellE">Tañedo</span>, through
counsel, opposed the application.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the
hearing, however, only <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span> <span class="SpellE">Generoso</span>
Villanueva Transportation Co., Inc. appeared through counsel, and so the
opposition of the other <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span> was dismissed for
lack of interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Herein petitioner (<span class="SpellE">oppositor</span> below) premised its opposition on the grounds,
namely, (1) that <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span> with other taxicab service
operators are rendering adequate, efficient, and satisfactory service in the
territory covered by the application; (2) that applicant is not financially
capable to operate and maintain the proposed service; and (3) that the grant of
the application would cause ruinous competition.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

after which she rested her case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Counsel
for herein petitioner, however, without pre­senting any evidence, orally moved
for the dismissal of the application upon the ground that the applicant failed
to prove her Filipino citizenship and her financial capacity, and asked for
time to submit a written memorandum in support of his motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that juncture, counsel for herein peti­tioner
was admonished by the Commissioner hearing the case that an adverse resolution
of his motion to dismiss would imperil his client's case for he would be barred
from intro­ducing evidence in support of the opposition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Notwithstand­ing the admonition, counsel
submitted his memorandum, praying "that this application be ordered
dismissed, and in the alternative this case be set for hearing for the,
presentation of the evidence of <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="26" month="8">August 26, 1968</st1:date>,
respondent Public Service Commission rendered its decision, denying herein
petitioner's motion to dismiss, and at the same time - in the same decision -
approved the application.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is this
decision that is now sought to be reviewed in the instant case.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its petition for certiorari with writ of preliminary mandatory
injunction, which this Court has considered as a petition for review,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
petitioner prayed that the decision be set aside and that respondents Public
Service Commission and Dolly C. <span class="SpellE">Javellana</span> be directed
to "desist and refrain from carrying out in any manner the decision in
question, particularly the registration thereof, upon posting by the petitioner
herein of such bond as this Honorable Court should require."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On September 26, 1968, petitioner filed a petition before this
Court praying for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction restraining
the respondent Public Service Commission from issuing an order extending the
period of the registration of the thirty taxicab units asked by respondent <span class="SpellE">Javellana</span>, and that the latter be also enjoined from
registering said units in the Land Transportation Commission Agency, <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> City, and from operating under taxi denomination
the 30 units authorized in the decision.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Acting on the petition this Court, on October 1, 1968, issued a
temporary restraining order prohibiting respondent Public Service Commission
"from issuing an order extending the period of time for the regis­tration
and operation of the thirty (30) taxicab units of herein respondent Dolly C. <span class="SpellE">Javellana</span>" - ... and respondent <span class="SpellE">Javellana</span>
"from operating under taxi denomination the thirty (30) taxi units
authorized in the decision... -"<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On November 6, 1968 respondent <span class="SpellE">Javellana</span>
filed a motion to lift the temporary restraining order, and also her answer to
the petition wherein she questions the propriety of the petition for
certiorari, on the ground that petitioner had a plain, speedy, and adequate
remedy which was a motion for re­consideration of the decision, but which was
not availed of; that petitioner cannot complain of having been deprived of its
day in court because it waived said right when it agreed to have the
application case submitted for decision without presenting evidence to support
its opposition; that petitioner never questioned the citizenship of applicant
in its opposi­tion; and that applicant is, as per finding of fact of the
Commission, financially capable to maintain and operate the proposed
service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a resolution, dated <st1:date year="1968" day="19" month="11">November 19, 1968</st1:date>, this Court denied
the motion to lift the temporary restrain­ing order.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1969" day="6" month="2">February 6, 1969</st1:date>
respondent <span class="SpellE">Javellana</span> filed a motion for the
dissolution of the temporary restraining order issued on <st1:date year="1968" day="1" month="10">October 1, 1968</st1:date>, on the ground that petitioner
had not filed a bond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By resolution,
dated <st1:date year="1969" day="12" month="2">February 12, 1969</st1:date>,
this Court resolved to issue a writ of preliminary, injunction upon
petitioner's posting a bond of P2,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1969" day="24" month="5">May 24, 1969</st1:date>
respondent <span class="SpellE">Javellana</span> filed a motion for the
dissolution of the preliminary injunction, alleging the insufficiency of
petitioner's bond and offering to put up a <span class="SpellE">counterbond</span>
double the amount of the bond filed by petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court denied the motion for dissolution
of the prelimin­ary injunction, but required petitioner to increase his bond to
P8,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1969" day="10" month="7">July 10, 1969</st1:date>,
petitioner filed a motion to declare respondent <span class="SpellE">Javellana</span>
in contempt of court upon the ground that in spite of the writ of preliminary
injunction, said respondent had persistently operated two taxicab units for the
year 1969.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In her comments on the
motion, respondent <span class="SpellE">Javellana</span> admitted having
registered two units on September 3 and <st1:date year="1968" day="25" month="9">September
 25, 1968</st1:date>, that is, prior to the temporary restraining order which
was issued by this Court on <st1:date year="1968" day="1" month="10">October 1,
 1968</st1:date>; and that the renewal of the registration in 1969 was not
covered by the injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In reply to
the explana­tion, petitioner argued that both the temporary restraining order
of October 1, 1968 and the writ of preliminary injunction of February 19, 1969
restrained respondent <span class="SpellE">Javellana</span> "from
registering" and also "from operating under taxi deno­mination"
the 30 taxi units.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion for
contempt has not been resolved.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="BODY">In its brief, petitioner assigns the following errors, allegedly
committed by respondent Public Service Commission:</p>

<blockquote>I.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Public Service
Commission erred in denying the motion to dismiss in the decision itself and
granting the certificate of public convenience in question without giving an
oppor­tunity to petitioner to present its evidence in opposition depriving it
of its day in court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>II.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Public Service
Commission erred in holding that respondent <span class="SpellE">Javellana</span>
has proven that she is a Filipino citizen.</blockquote>

<blockquote>III.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Public Service
Commission erred in issuing the certificate of public convenience in question
considering that on the evidence and re­cords of this case respondent is
unquestionably financially incapable of operating and maintaining the proposed
service.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The instant case may be disposed of by resolving the issue raised
in the first error assigned.</p>

<p class="BODY">In support of the first assignment of error, petitioner argues
that the motion to dismiss should have been denied in an order separate from
the decision, in order to give peti­tioner an opportunity to file a motion for
reconsideration of the order of denial; that in rendering its decision, deny­ing
therein the motion to dismiss and not allowing petitioner to present evidence
in support of its opposition, the Public Service Commission barred the
petitioner from presenting evi­dence in support of its opposition, and thus
violated Section 1 of Rule 35 of the Rules of Court, and denied petitioner the
due process of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent <span class="SpellE">Javellana</span>, on the other
hand, argues that petitioner cannot complain of having been denied its day in
court because it waived its right to present evidence in support of its
opposition, and preferred to file a memorandum to substantiate its motion to
dismiss instead of presenting evidence, and its counsel even expressed his
preference to take the risk of the result of his motion to dismiss, in spite of
the admonition of the Commission that he had better present his evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">We sustain the stand of petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The right of a de­fendant who files a motion
to dismiss for insufficiency of plaintiff's evidence, or a demurer to the
evidence, is specifically provided for in Rule 35, of the Rules of Court, the
lone section of which provides as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Section 1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Effect
of judgment on demurer to evidence</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After the plaintiff has completed the presentation of his evidence, the
defendant without waiving his right to offer evidence in the event the motion
is not granted, may move for a dismissal on the ground that upon the facts and
the law the plaintiff has shown no right to relief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, if the motion is granted and the
order of dismissal is reversed on appeal, the <span class="SpellE">movant</span>
loses his right to present evidence in his behalf."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This Court applied this rule in the case of Director of lands vs.
<span class="SpellE">Ceniza</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>,
wherein the Director of Lands, as <span class="SpellE">oppo­sitor</span> to the
application for registration, orally moved, thru counsel, after the applicant
had presented his evidence, for the dismissal of the application upon the
ground of insuffi­ciency of evidence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The trial court denied the motion to dismiss, and considered the case
submitted for decision with­out allowing the opposition to present
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Alleging before this Court
that the respondent judge neglected to per­form an act which the law
specifically enjoined as a duty re­sulting from his office, and that said judge
excluded him from the enjoyment of a right to which he was entitled -- the duty
to give every party to a litigation a reasonable oppor­tunity to be heard and
his right to present his side, this Court held that under Section 1, Rule 35 of
the Rules of Court it was "evident that the respondent court, in the case
at bar, after denying the motion to dismiss, for insufficiency of evidence
(demurer to evidence), should have permitted the petitioner-­defendant to
present his own evidence, notwithstanding its failure or omission to make a
reservation to that effect; more so, as in this particular case, when the
petitioner-defendant had asked to be given a day in court in order to defend
the government's title to a 78-hectare parcel of land".</p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE">Siayngco</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Costibolo</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
the issue on the legal effects and consequences of the defendant's motion to
dis­miss, or demurer to evidence, was raised.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The trial court therein ruled that the defendants, after moving to
dismiss the case after the presentation, of plaintiff's evidence, were
understood to have waived their right to present their evidence,
notwithstanding their reservation, and plaintiff could take judgment according
to the evidence already on record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Peti­tioners
in that case complained that they had been deprived of their day in court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court, speaking through Mr. Jus­tice <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span>, reaffirmed the doctrine laid down in Director of
Lands vs. <span class="SpellE">Ceniza</span> <u>supra</u>, and gave the rationale
behind Section 1, Rule 35 of the Rules of Court, saying:</p>

<blockquote>"The rationale behind the rule and doctrine is simple and
logical. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>The defendant is permitted,
without waiving his right to offer evidence in the event that his motion is not
granted, to move for a dismissal (<span class="SpellE">i.e</span>, demur to the
plaintiff's evidence) on the ground that upon the facts as thus established and
the applicable law, the plaintiff has shown no right to relief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the trial court <u>denies</u> the dis­missal
motion, i.e. finds that plaintiff's evidence is sufficient for an award of
judgment in the absence of contrary evidence, the case still remains before the
trial court which should then proceed to hear and receive the defendant's
evidence so that all the facts and evidence of the contending parties may be
properly placed before it for adjudication as well as before the appellate
courts, in case of appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing is lost.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The doctrine is but in line with the
established procedural precepts in the conduct of trials that the trial court
liberally receive all <span class="SpellE">proferred</span> evidence at the trial
to enable it to render its decision with all possibly relevant proofs in the
record, thus assuring that the appellate courts upon appeal have all the
material before them neces­sary to make a correct judgment, and avoiding the
need of remanding the case for retrial or reception of im­properly excluded
evidence, with the possibility there­after of still another appeal, with all
the concomi­tant delays.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rule,
however, imposes the condition by the same token that if his demurer is <u>granted</u>
by the trial court, and the order of dismissal is <u>reversed on appeal</u>,
the <span class="SpellE">movant</span> loses his right to present evi­dence in
his behalf and he shall have been deemed to have elected to stand on the
insufficiency of plain­tiff's case and evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In such event, the appellate court which
reverses the order of dismissal shall pro­ceed to render judgment on the merits
on the basis of plaintiff's evidence.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Public Service Commission's disregard of Rule 35 cannot be
justified on the ground that the Commission is not strictly bound by the
technical rules of procedure and evidence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A rule of procedure such as that provided in Rule 35, Section 1, con­cerning
the opportunity of a litigant to present his evidence in support of his side on
matters before the court, which may affect his rights, can hardly be classified
as a technical rule.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The process
requires that every person shall have his day in court and be given an
opportunity to be heard in order to establish any fact which will protect his
rights.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It cannot be said either, that herein petitioner waived his right
to present evidence in support of his opposition, as the Public Service
Commission said in its decision, and stressed by respondent, when</p>

<blockquote>"counsel for <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span> was
admonished that an adverse resolution on his motion to dismiss would imperil
his client’s case for he would be barred from introducing evidence in support
of the opposition x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
Counsel nevertheless decided to take said risk and agreed to have the case
submitted after sub­mission of his memorandum in support of his oral motion to
dismiss."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is untenable that a mere admonition by the Public Service
Commissioner would suffice to take away a right granted by law to a party to a
case -- that is, the right to present evidence in support of his
opposition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither can it be said that
petitioner by the mere filing of the demurer to evidence waived his right to
present evidence, because Rule 35, Section 1, expressly provides that the fil­ing
of such motion to dismiss is not a waiver of the right to offer evidence in the
event the motion is not granted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, counsel for petitioner herein expressly reserved said right,
when in his memorandum in support of the verbal motion to dismiss he
"respectfully prayed that this appli­cation be ordered dismissed and <u>in
the alternative this case be set for hearing for the presentation of the
evidence <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span></u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Waiver of a right must be express, made in a
clear and unequivocal manner.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is clear, therefore, that the Public Service Com­mission
arbitrarily disregarded the right of herein peti­tioner to present evidence in
support of its opposition, and so the decision in question should be set aside.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the Public Service Commission,
