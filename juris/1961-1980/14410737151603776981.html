				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Petitioner Eugenio P. Miculob seeks to nullify the orders dated April 25, 1963, January 22, 1964 and March 17, 1964, denying his motion to suspend the proceedings in Civil Case No. Q-4246 entitled "J.M. Tuason &amp; Co., Inc. vs. Eugenio P. Miculob" of the Court of First Instance of Quezon City for the recovery of possession of about 300 square meters of land which forms part of the Tatalon Estate in Quezon City on the ground that Republic Acts Nos. 2616, 3453, and 3516, authorize the expropriation of landed estates or haciendas in Manila, Quezon City and suburbs and their subdivision into smaller lots and the sale of such lots at cost or their lease on reasonable terms, and Republic Act No. 3516 provides that "from the approval of this Act (May 22,1963), and before the commencement of the expropriation herein provided, ejectment proceedings against any tenant or occupant of any landed estates or haciendas or lands herein authorized to be expropriated, shall be suspended for a period of two years, upon motion of the defendant xxx."</p><p>In the aforesaid Civil Case No. Q-4246, herein petitioner claims that on January 18, 1957, he bought in good faith the disputed lot of about 300 square meters of the Tatalon Estate, whereon he constructed his house, from Napoleon Pastrana, who in turn purchased on March 31, 1949 the said lot from Hilario Andaya, who previously acquired the same by purchase from Alberta Martinez..</p><p>His motion to suspend further proceedings in said case was denied in an order dated April 25, 1963; his second motion for reconsideration was likewise denied in an order dated January 22,1964; and his third motion for reconsideration was denied in an order dated March 17, 1964, on the ground that ejectment proceedings cannot be barred or suspended unless (1) an action for expropriation is already filed or the government takes possession of the land and (2) coetaneous payment or compensation is made, citing the cases of Teresa Realty, Inc. vs. Carmen vda. de Garriz<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> and Joaquin Cuatico, et. al. vs. Court of Appeals, et. al.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></p><p>Private respondent J.M. Tuason &amp; Co., Inc., in its answer dated and filed on April 10, 1964 in behalf of all the respondents, alleges, among others, that the disputed lot does not form part of any landed estate; that it is covered by TCT No. 1267 (37686-Rizal) of the Register of Deeds of Quezon City in its name; that neither the said lot nor the so-called Tatalon Estate is the subject of any expropriation case; that Republic Act No. 3516 is unconstitutional, citing the cases of Cuatico, et. al. vs. Court of Appeals, et. al., <em>supra</em>, J.M Tuason &amp; Co., Inc. vs. Court of Appeals, et. al.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> and Republic of the Philippines vs. J.M.

Tuason &amp; Co., Inc. prays that this case should now be dismissed as moot and academic; because by virtue of Letter of Instructions No. 34, (1) a complaint for the expropriation of the Tatalon Estate was filed on January 23, 1973 by the PHHC and docketed as Civil Case No. Q-17334 entitled "Republic of the Philippines vs. J.M. Tuason &amp; Co., Inc." in the Court of First Instance of Quezon City; and (2) the corresponding writ of possession has been issued by the court, the government having duly made the corresponding deposit required for its entry into the property, attaching thereto as Annex "A" the court's order dated March 17, 1973 granting the writ of possession (p. 67-68, rec).</p><p>In his manifestation dated July 11, 1973 and filed on July 16, 1973, herein petitioner concedes that the case has become moot and academic in view of Letter of Instructions No. 34 and he has no objection to the dismissal or withdrawal of this petition (p. 70, rec).</p><p>In his Compliance dated and filed on July 23,1973, the Solicitor General states that the issue as to the constitutionality of Republic Act No. 3516 has become moot and academic as a consequence of the issuance of Letter of Instructions No. 34, which now can settle all matters dealing with the acquisition of the Tatalon Estate; but added that the right of herein petitioner to file the instant petition as a tenant of the Tatalon Estate is another matter which may not become moot and academic simply because of the issuance of said Letter of Instructions No. 34 and therefore petitioner should be given the opportunity to ventilate his right to acquire a lot from the Estate in a proper administrative and/or judicial proceedings (pp. 74-76, rec.).</p><p>In his reply dated August 9, 1973 and filed on August 13, 1973 to the Compliance of the Solicitor General, petitioner agrees with the observations of the Solicitor General and affirms that he has already filed his application for the acquisition of the lot he is occupying with the proper offices concerned.</p><p>CONSIDERING THAT ALL PARTIES ARE AGREED THAT THE ISSUANCE OF LETTER OF INSTRUCTIONS NO. 34 ON OCTOBER 27, 1972, RENDERED THIS CASE MOOT AND ACADEMIC AND THAT HEREIN PETITIONER HAS ALREADY FILED HIS APPLICATION WITH THE PROPER AUTHORITIES FOR THE ACQUISITION OF THE DISPUTED LOT, THIS PETITION IS HEREBY DISMISSED AS MOOT AND ACADEMIC, WITHOUT COSTS.</p><p><em>Makalintal, Acting.
