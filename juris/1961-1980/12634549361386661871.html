				<H3>NATIONAL MARKETING CORPORATION (NAMARCO), JOVENAL ALMENDRAS PETITIONERS, VS. HON. GAUDENCIO CLORIBEL, IN HIS
CAPACITY AS DIS­TRICT JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF MA­NILA AND GERMAN
E. VILLANUEVA, DOING BUSINESS UNDER THE NAME AND STYLE VILTRA COMPANY, RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><STRONG>DIZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Before <span style="">Us now</span> is
a motion for reconsideration or clarification filed in due time by respondents
based on the following grounds:</p>

<blockquote>“1. The Court erred in resolving the question presented before it
in this <u>special civil action</u> by ruling on the correctness, as<span style=""> a matter </span>of law, of the summary
judgment rendered by the respondent Judge.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The sum<span style="">mary judgment of the
lower court is <u>not</u> in issue in this case, for the reason precisely </span>that
<span style="">it is </span>the subject of the <u>appeal</u>
filed by petitioners <span style="">with </span>this
Court in <u><span style="">G. R. N. </span>L-27441.<o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>“2. Assuming, arguendo, that the present controversy cannot be
resolved without deciding the merits of the summary judgment rendered <span style="">by the respondent court, justice and fair
play demand that the <u>factual</u></span><u><span style=""> and evidentiary </span>basis</u> supporting the summary judgment
should have been taken to account.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
basis may be found in the records of G. R. No. L-27441, and this <span style="">basis, </span>we
submit, supports in law the decision of the lower court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In <span style="">th</span>e
alternative that this Court finds it neither necessary nor appropriate to recon­sider
its decision in this case, respondents respectfully pray for clarificatory
judgment holding that its resolution of the question presented in this case is <u><span style="">without prejudice</span></u><span style=""> </span>to, and does necessarily foreclose,
the merits of the controversy involved in G. R. No. L­-27441."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In our decision
promulgated on April 29, 1968 We held, among other things, that the respondent
court had erred:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) in admitting the
amended complaint filed in Civil Case No. 64696 because it resulted in
transforming the original special </span><span style="">civil a</span><span style="">ction
for mandamus into an ordinary civil action for specific performance; (2) in
rendering, on motion <span style="">of VILTRA, </span></span><span style="">a </span><span style="">summary partial decision inspite of the fact
that in the answers filed by the de­fendants they had assailed the contract
which VILTRA sought to enforce as not having been duly perfected, and as one
against public policy, and on the further ground that </span><span style="">VILTRA </span><span style="">itself had committed a breach of its obli­gations
thereunder.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In connection with the
foregoing, We also made the following observations -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"It is obvious, therefore, that the amended pleading, which
changed the very nature of the action, was clearly intended to correct VILTRA's
<span style="">error in instituting a special civil
action for </span>mandamus <span style="">to enforce </span><span style="">contractual
obligations, </span><span style="">and that the
partial </span>decision summarily rendered by the respondent judge under the
irregular circumstances des­cribed above was intended to replace the un­warranted
preliminary writ of mandatory in­junction issued by him before the filing and
admission of the last amended complaint.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"With regards to the rendition of the summary partial
decision, it is clear that the same was irregular because in both answers filed
by NAMARCO - one to the first amended complaint for mandamus, and the other to
the last or second amended entitled "For Specific Performance and Damages’
? the illegality and unenforceability of alleged contract between VILTRA
and NAMARCO - on both legal and factual grounds - was duly raised.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, it was, to say the least, im­provident
to issue preliminary mandatory injunction for its performance, or rendered
partial judgment precisely requiring compliance with one of its essential
features or stipulations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having arrived
at this conclusion, It follows that the several writs issued by the respondent
judge for it execution are likewise irregular and void.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Upon the above premises
We issued the writs of certiorari and prohibition prayed for in the verified
peti­tion filed by petitioners herein.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The allegation made in
the motion before Us to the effect that We had erroneously ruled "on the
correctness, as a matter of law, of the summary judgment rendered by the respondent
judge" inspite of the fact that said judgment was not in issue, is based<span style=""> </span>upon an apparent misapprehension of
the meaning of our decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We say </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">this connection that We did not rule on <u>the</u>
<u>merits</u> of said decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other
words We did not hold that it was correct or otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What We said was this:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that the validity of </span>the <span style="">contract sought to be enforced by action
having been raised a</span><span style="">s an </span><span style="">issue on factual as
well </span><span style="">as
</span><span style="">legal grounds, the respondent
court was</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">not in a position to render a summary judgment.
Moreover, if the </span><span style="">summary </span><span style="">judgment which
said court rendered was the one provided for in Rule 36 of the Rules of Court,
the facts of record clearly show that the requirements thereof were not
complied with.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The second point raised
in the motion for reconsideration </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">virtually
resolved by what We have said heretofore.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As We </span><span style="">did </span><span style="">not decide "the
merits of the summary judgment" already referred to, there is no need to
consider - as respondents pray - the alleged "factual and</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">evidentiary </span><span style="">basis" </span><span style="">supporting the same.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As </span><span style="">to the alternative prayer "for
clarificatory judgment" to make it clear that neither our decision nor </span>our
resolution of the pending motion for reconsideration "is without prejudice
to x x x the merits of the contro­versy involving G. R. No. L-27441", We
believe that nothing further need be said except this:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that our decision and the present resolution
do not in any way decide the question of whether or not the contract which
VILTRA seeks to enforce against NAMARCO was perfected, and if it was, whether
or not it is valid and binding contract.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>PREMISES CONSIDERED</b>, the motion for reconsideration is
denied but our decision is <u>clarified</u> as above set forth.</p>

<p class="BODY"><i>Concepcion, C.J., Reyes, Makalintal, Zaldivar, Sanchez,
Castro, Angeles </i>and<i> Fernando, JJ., </i>concur.</p>
