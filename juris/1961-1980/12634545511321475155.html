				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal by the S<span style="">olicitor
General from the decision </span>of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Occidental <span style="">(Case
No. 109) granting <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> petition for
naturalization.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span style="">submitted </span>the
<span style="">case without filing </span>any brief in
reply to that of appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner is a native of China, born <span style="">on February </span>5, 1919 at <span class="SpellE">Lamua</span>, <span style="">Amoy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span>He arrived in the <span style="">Philippines
on </span>August 1, 1931 on board the vessel "<span class="SpellE">Ang</span>
<span style="">Kin", and since </span>then <span style="">did n</span>ot leave the country up to the
time he filed his petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He <span style="">is </span>married to <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Sy</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Sen</span> alias <span class="SpellE">Sima</span>, like</span>wise
a Chinese citizen, by whom he has three children, <span style="">namely, Lilia, Betty and Wayne, the first two being enrolled </span>at
the <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Chinese High School and the third at the
Immaculate <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> College.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the time of the hearing petitioner and his
family <span style="">were </span><span style="">residing at <span class="SpellE">Sinacaban</span>,
</span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Misamis</span></span><span style=""> </span>Occidental, where he was engaged in
the <span style="">business </span>of buying and
selling copra.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to his <span style="">petition </span>filed <st1:date year="1961" day="9" month="8">August 9, 1961</st1:date>, his average annual net income was <span style="">more than P4<span class="GramE">,000</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the hearing he testified in English
and spoke and wrote a few sentences in the <span class="SpellE">Visayan</span>
dialect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two witnesses, Jose Contreras
and <span class="SpellE">Telesforo</span> <span class="SpellE">Simbajon</span>,
vouched for the good moral character of the petitioner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Solicitor General submits
that the lower court erred:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) in not
finding that the notice and publication requirements of the law were not
complied with; (2) in not finding that petitioner has no lucrative income; and
(3) in not finding that petitioner has not conducted himself in </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">proper and
irreproachable manner, because of his use of aliases without judicial
authority.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On the first point, the
question is whether the newspaper "<span class="SpellE">Nueva</span>
Era" was of general circulation in the province of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span>
Occidental.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no evidence to this
effect other than the affidavit of the publisher that the "<span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> Era" was of general circulation in the
Philippines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such kind of evidence has
been held to be insufficient.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span class="GramE"><span style="">Thus
in </span><span style="">the case of Tan Ten <span class="SpellE">Koc</span> vs. Republic, G.R. No.</span></span><span style=""> L-18344, February </span><span style="">28, 1964, this </span><span style="">Court </span><span style="">said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The law requires that the newspaper in which the petition for
naturalization is to be published must be of general circulation in the
province where peti­tioner resides.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While, <span style="">in
</span>the instant case, there is an affidavit executed by the Editor of the <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> Era to the <span style="">effect
that the said newspaper is of general circulation in the Philippines, </span><span style="">this </span><span style="">statement </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">not sufficient proof that there has been
compliance with the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Positive
evidence must be presented to prove that the <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span>
Era is of general circulation in <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>, and it is
incumbent upon petitioner to present such evidence.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The purpose of the <span style="">law in </span>requiring publication of the notice <span style="">is </span>to inform those officers and the
public in general of the filing of such a petition in order that the public
officers and private citizens supposed to be acquainted with the petitioner may<span style=""> furni</span>sh the Solicitor General or <span style="">the provincial fiscal with such necessary </span>information
<span style="">and </span>evidence as there may be
against the petitioner (Anti-Chinese League of the Phil. vs. Alfonso Felix,
etc., et al. G. R. No. <span class="GramE"><span style="">L-998,
</span></span><st1:date year="1947" day="20" month="2"><span class="GramE"><span style="">February 20, 1947</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="">, 77 Phil. 1012).</span></span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Considering then that the <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> Era </span>is <span style="">published in Spanish and not in English <span style="">or in the dialect of <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>,
which are </span></span><span style="">more </span>commonly
used in petitioner's province of residence, and that there has been no positive
and direct proof that it <span style="">is </span>generally circulated in said pro­vince, the publication made
therein nay not be taken as having served the objective of the law."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the issue of petitioner's income, his tax return for 1961
shows a net amount of P3<span class="GramE">,037.44</span>, derived as his salary
from Ramon Tan <span class="SpellE">Kee</span> <span class="SpellE">Tu</span> &amp;
Co., and as profit from Lim's Sing Rice Mill in <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>
del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Suprisingly</span> enough, his income from the same sources in
1962 aggregate aver P10,000.00, aside from a bonus of P1,000.00 - something he
did not receive the previous year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
pointed out by the Solicitor General, the sudden increase by more than 100%
over the previous average gives rise to the suspicion that <span style="">it </span>was
intended to cure the deficiency for purposes of naturalization.</p>

<p class="BODY">The third point raised by the Solicitor General is even more
fatal to petitioner's position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
admits that he uses three aliases, namely:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"<span class="SpellE">Cayetano</span> Tan", "<span class="SpellE">Cayetano</span> <span class="SpellE">Pao</span> <span class="SpellE">Hu</span>"
and "Tan <span class="SpellE">Pao</span> <span class="SpellE">Hu</span>."
In his marriage certificate (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. E) <span class="GramE">petitioner</span> used the name "Tan <span class="SpellE">Pau</span>
<span class="SpellE">Hu</span>." The same name appears in the birth
certificates (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. F and F-1) of his children Lilia
and Wayne, while <span style="">in </span>that of Betty Tan (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. F-2), the
name <span style="">is “</span>Tan
<span class="SpellE">Sen</span>".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is no evidence that petitioner has been judicially authorized to
use the aliases above mentioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This <span style="">is </span>a clear
violation of the Anti-Alias Law<span style=""> </span>(Commonwealth
Act No. 142), which justifies denial of his application for naturalization (<span class="SpellE">Ong</span> Hock <span class="SpellE">Lian</span> vs. Republic,
supra; Wang I Fu vs. Republic, L-15819, September 29, 1962; Koa <span class="SpellE">Gui</span> vs. Republic, supra; Lim Bun vs. Republic, L-17317,
April 26, 1961; and Ng Liam Ken; vs. Republic, L-14146, April 29, 1961).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment appealed from is reversed and the
petition is denied, with costs.</p>
