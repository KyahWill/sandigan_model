for certiorari and prohibi­tion filed by the National <span style="">Waterworks &amp; Sewerage Authority, hereinafter referred to as the </span>NAWASA
<span style="">against the </span>Honorable Andres
Reyes, <span style="">presiding judge </span>of Branch
VI, Court of <span style="">First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> </span>and the C &amp; C Commercial Corporation,
seeking to set <span style="">aside a preliminary </span>injunction
issued by the said court dated <span style="">January
18, 1968, in Civil Case No. 10523, </span>which restrained herein <span style="">petitioner from proceeding </span>with the
calling of bids for the supply of steel pipes <span class="GramE">intended</span>
<span style="">for the </span>impro<span style="">vement of its waterworks </span><span style="">projects in the City of Manila and its
suburbs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">Herein </span>petitioner assails <span style="">the legality of the said restraini</span>ng
order on several grounds:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>lack of
jurisdiction of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u><span style=""> to </span>issue the injunctive writ of afore­said against herein
petitioner when, admittedly, the offices for place of business of petitioner
corporation and the bidding enjoined are outside <span style="">its </span>territorial jurisdiction; the complaint in the lower court
fails to <span style="">state a cause of action; and
the </span>plaintiff corporation is disqualified to <span style="">participate in public biddings call</span>ed for by the NAWASA under
the provisions of Administrative Order No. 66, dated June 27, 1967.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The background facts of
the </span><span style="">controversy are as </span><span style="">follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On December 12, 1967, the
NAWASA caused to be published an </span>advertisement <span style="">calling for bids for the </span><span style="">supply
of <u>steel</u> <u>pipes</u> of 30-inch </span><span style="">and 24-inch diameters, intended fo</span><span style="">r</span><span style=""> </span>the <span style="">Interim Program of </span>Development <span style="">of the Distribution System of the </span><span style="">Manila and Suburbs Water­</span><span style="">works.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Believing that the said call for bids was </span><span style="">pre</span><span style="">judicial to its
interest, in the </span><span style="">circumstance
that the </span><span style="">NAWASA had specifically
and exclusively called for the supply of steel pipes only excluding <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> </span>the asbestos cement pressure pipes it manufactures,
the C <span style="">&amp; </span><span style="">C </span>Commercial Corporation filed a
complaint against the NAWASA in <span style="">the </span><span style="">court below, alleging that it is </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">qualified bidder in any bidding of the
Government; that </span><span style="">its </span><span style="">locally manufactured asbestos cement pipes
are far les expensive and </span>cheaper than any other type, class or kind of <span style="">pipe </span>locally manufactured; are
available, pro­<span style="">ven and tested to be
durable and usable and serve as equally well as steel pipes in waterworks
distribution systems; that in the call for bids of the NAWASA in its advertisement
of December 12, 1967, asbestos cement pressure pipes had been excluded in
violation of Repub­lic Act 912; and that said deliberate discrimination against
its products would cause great prejudice to </span><span style="">public interest and would cause irreparable damage to both plaintiff
and the Government, if not </span><span style="">enjoined
by </span><span style="">the court from</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">the
act complained of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It concluded with a
prayer </span>that <span style="">a </span>writ of preliminary injunction <span style="">or </span><span style="">restraining order be
issued immediately ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span>, upon plaintiff's filling
a sufficient bond, enjoining the NAWASA from opening the bids submitted under
the adver­</span>tisement above-mentioned, and after trial, that <span style="">judg­ment be </span>rendered:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) ordering the NAWASA permanently i<span style="">n desist from </span>proceeding with <span style="">the</span> <span style="">conduct </span><span style="">of the bid­</span>ding
complained of; (2) ordering the NAWASA to call and advertise another bidding to
include plaintiff's products; and (3) ordering the NAWASA to pay unto the
plaintiff actual damages, attorney's fees, and the costs of the suit.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It appears that the
NAWASA, </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">well as the In­ternational Pipe Industries
Corporation which had been granted leave to intervene in the case, opposed the
application for preliminary injunction, contending, that the complaint states
no cause of action by reason of failure on the part of the plaintiff to allege
or how that it has complied with the requirements of Republic Act 912, <span class="SpellE">i</span>. e., by showing that it has secured a certification from
the Director of Pub­lic Works as to the "availability, practicability,
usability and durability" of its products; that plain­tiff is a
disqualified bidder in any Government pro­ject under the provisions of
administrative Order No. </span>66 <span style="">dated
June 26, 1967, by reason of the fact that plaintiff corporation and </span>its
President have tremen­<span style="">dous </span>tax
liabilities with the Government; that plain­<span style="">tiff’s plant <span style="">is </span>not
capable of producing asbestos cement pipes in the sizes called for in the bids,
the largest size of pipe; it is actually producing being up to 12 inches in
diameter </span><span style="">&nbsp;</span><span style="">only; that it has actually ceased to be a manufacturer of said
products, having leased its plant together with </span>all the machineries <span style="">and </span>the <span style="">land whereon the plant is located, in favor of D. </span>B. <span class="SpellE">Canicosa</span> <span style="">&amp; Sons
for a period of three (3) <span style="">years </span>starting
November 20, 1967; that the court has no jurisdiction to </span>issue the writ
prayed <span style="">for </span>because <span style="">the NAWASA and the holding of the bidding
sought to be enjoined, </span>are outside its territorial jurisdicti<span style="">on; that the issuance of the injunction would
cause prejudice to public interest for the delay <span style="">in </span>the completion of </span>the projects wherein the <span style="">pip</span>es called <span style="">for in the bid </span>are intended <span style="">would cause public inconvenience which </span>are natural results of
water shortage; <span style="">and that plaintiff's
damage </span>is reparable while teat <span style="">of
</span>the NAWASA is irreparable.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The application for </span>the
writ <span style="">of </span>preliminary <span style="">injunction was </span>set for hearing by<span style=""> </span>trial court on January 15, 1967.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same was reset <span style="">for hearing on the following day where the parties were </span>called
in chambers and there discussion ensued relative to the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, under date of January 18, 1967,
the respondent judge issued the order complained of which, as earlier stated,
ordered the NAWASA to desist from proceeding with the bidding in question.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Acting upon the </span>petition,
this <span style="">Court resolved </span>to require
the herein respondents to file their <span style="">answer
not later than February 12, 1968.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Hearing
on the <span style="">merits was </span>set <span style="">on February 14, on which date the case was
argued by </span>the respective <span style="">counsels
for the petitioner and the respondents.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner was given two (2) days within which to submit a copy of the
contract of lease over the asbestos cement </span>pressure pipe <span style="">plant or factory of the respondent C &amp; C
Commer­</span>cial <span style="">Corporation which
the former claims </span>the latter <span style="">had
executed in favor of D. B. <span class="SpellE">Canicosa</span> &amp; Sons, to
support herein petitioner's contention that the </span>said <span style="">respondent corporation had ceased to be a
manufacturer of asbestos cement pressure pipes; and the C &amp; C Com­mercial </span>Corporati<span style="">o</span>n was likewise given<span style=""> </span><span style="">two
(2) days within which to submit the necessary </span>certification from the
Bureau <span style="">of Public Works to sustain its
claim that it has a right to the preference granted to lo­cally manufactured
products under the Flag Laws.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It </span>appears
<span style="">that the NAWASA has complied with the
order of the Court by submitting copies of the alleged contract of </span>lease
<span style="">of C &amp; C Commercial Corporation's
factory for a term of three (3) years, but the </span>said <span style="">respondent up to now has not filed the
certification from the Bureau of Public Works required of it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">An examination of the
pleadings revealed that the </span>issues <span style="">raised
in the instant petition are substantially the very </span><span style="">same points </span><span style="">relied upon by </span>herein pe<span style="">titioner
in the </span>lower court <span style="">in support of
</span>its opposi­<span style="">tion </span>to <span style="">the issuance of the preliminary injunction in
question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Admittedly the </span><span style="">NAWASA has </span><span style="">its offices </span>in Manila, <span style="">and
the bidding sought </span>to be <span style="">enjoined
</span>is to be <span style="">conducted in that
city.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the issue then that needs
to be resolved </span><span style="">is:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>May </span><span style="">a court of first </span>instance issue <span style="">a writ of preliminary injunction which will be enforced outside the
territorial boundaries </span>of said <span style="">court?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was the very same question that was
brought before <span class="GramE">Us</span> in </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">very recent case,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> and We answered the question in the
negative, thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The power of a court to issue an injunction, which is a
matter of jurisdiction, is one of legislative enactment (Manila Railroad Co. v.
Atty. Gen., 20 Phil. 523) but the manner of its exercise is prescribed by the

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">Upon
the facts of this case, and in the light of autho­rity above-quoted, there can
be no doubt that the writ of preliminary injunction issued by the respondent
judge of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> which
purports to restrain acts of herein petitioner outside of the territorial
limits of its province or district is null and void, for </span>want of
jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">H</span>er<span style="">ein private respondent claims that the call
for bids of the NAWASA is in violation of Republic Act 912 which gra</span>n<span style="">ts preference right to locally manufact­ured
products.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An examination of the
complaint filed in the lower court, however, would show that it does not
contain any </span>allegation <span style="">that it
possesses </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">necessary certification </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">to </span>the "availability, practicability, <span style="">usability</span><span style=""> and, durability" of the asbestos cement </span>pressure pip<span style="">es manufactured by it from the director of
Public Works pursuant to the requirement of said Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now was the said certification produced
before <span class="GramE">Us</span> in this proceeding as required in the
resolution of this Court of February 14, 1968.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is safe to conclude </span>under the circumstances that it does not
have such cer­tification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This <span style="">is fatal to </span>herein private <span class="GramE">respondents</span> cause of action in the lower court, and sustains
the <span style="">claim </span><span style="">of </span>herein petitioner <span style="">that the C &amp; C Commercial Corporation is
not entitled to the benefits of Republic Act 912.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">We
</span><span style="">have clearly passed upon this
point in a former case,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> involving the same parties herein, and for
pronouncement there should apply with equal force here.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Statutes granting advantages to private persons have in many
instan­ces created special privileges or monopolies for the grantees and thus
have been viewed with suspicion and strictly construed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is altoge­ther appropriate in the
majority of situations for if public advantage is gained by the grant it
normally appears to be of secondary significance compared with the advantage
gained by the grantee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Sutherland
Statutory Construction, <span class="SpellE">Vol</span>, II, Section 3404, p.
240) And rights<span style=""> </span>which exist only
by virtue of such statutes come into being only after strict compliance with
all the conditions found in those statutes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Id., Vol. III, Sec. 5812, p. 94) These rules should apply to the case
at bar where the law invoked grants a preference to locally produced products
or materials.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since Republic Act 912
grants preference only upon the certification of availability, practicability
and usability of locally produced materials by the Director of Public Works,
that certification must be <span class="GramE">existing</span> and effective
before any right arising <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> <span style="">may </span>be claimed to have been
violated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Notwithstanding the clear
nationalistic policy of the law aforementioned, <span class="GramE">We</span> can­not,
by any mistaken sympathy towards herein <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>,
recog<span style="">nize the existence of its </span>right
<span style="">under the law alleged to have been
violated which the C &amp; C Commercial Corporation has mis­erably failed to
prove in this </span><span style="">case."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Furthermore, the private
respondent is disqualif</span><span style="">ied to </span>participate
in public biddings by virtue of Administrative Order No. 66 issued by <span style="">the </span>President of <span style="">the </span>Philippines <span style="">on June </span><span style="">26, 1967:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
