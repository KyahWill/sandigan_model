 1948</span></st1:date><span style=""> - barely </span><span style="">one </span><span style="">month after the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
of Republic Act No. 296 known as the Judiciary Act of 1948 the spouses <span class="SpellE">Serafin</span> <span class="SpellE">Tijam</span> and <span class="SpellE">Felicitas</span> <span class="SpellE">Tagalog</span> commenced Civil
Case No. R-660 in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
against the spouses <span class="SpellE">Magdaleno</span> <span class="SpellE">Sibonghanoy</span>
and Lucia <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> to recover from them the sum of P</span><span style="">1<span class="GramE">,908.00</span>, </span><span style="">with legal interest thereon from the date of
the filing of the complaint until the whole obligation </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">paid, plus costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As prayed for in the complaint, a writ of
attachment was issued by the court against defendants' properties, but the same
was soon dissolved upon the filing of a counter-bond by defendants and the
Manila Surety and Fidelity Co., Inc. hereinafter referred to as the Surety, on
the 31st of the <span class="GramE">same</span> month.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After being duly served
with summons the defendants filed their answer in which, after making some
admissions and denials of the material averments of the complaint, they
interposed a counterclaim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
counterclaim was answered by the plaintiffs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After trial upon the </span><span style="">issues thus </span><span style="">joined, the Court rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiffs and,
after </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">same had </span>be­come <span style="">final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>,
upon motion of the latter, the Court issued a writ of execution against the defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The </span><span style="">writ </span><span style="">having been
returned unsatisfied, the plaintiffs moved for the issuance of a </span><span style="">writ </span><span style="">of execution against the Surety's bond </span><span style="">(Rec. </span><span style="">on Appeal pp.
46-49), against which the Surety filed a written opposition (Id. pp. 49) upon
two grounds, namely, (1) Failure to prosecute and (2) Absence of a demand upon </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">Surety for the payment of the amount due under the judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon these grounds the Surety prayed the
Court not only to deny the motion for execution against its counter-bond but
also the following <u>affirmative</u> </span><u><span style="">relief</span></u><span style="">:<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">"to
relieve the herein bonding company of its </span><span style="">liability, if </span><span style="">any, under
the bond in question" (Id. p. 54) The Court denied this motion on the
ground solely that no previous demand had been made on the Surety for the satisfaction
of the judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter the
necessary demand was made, and upon failure of the Surety to satisfy the judg­ment,
the plaintiffs filed a second motion for execution against the
counter-bond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the date set for the
hearing thereon, the Court, upon motion of the Surety's counsel, granted the
latter <span style="">a </span>period of five days
within which to answer the motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon
its failure to file such answer, the Court granted the motion for execution and
the corresponding writ was issued.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Subsequently, the Surety
moved to quash the writ on the ground that the same was issued without the
required summary hearing provided for in Section 17 of Rule 59 of the Rules of
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the Court denied the motion,
the Surety appealed to the Court of Appeals from such order of denial and from
the one denying its motion for reconsideration (Id. pp. 97).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Its re­cord on appeal was
then printed as required by the Rules, and <span style="">in due </span>time</span> it filed its brief raising therein no other
question but the ones covered by the following assignment of errors:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">“I.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>That
the Honorable Court a quo erred in issuing its order dated <st1:date year="1957" day="2" month="11">November 2, 1957</st1:date>, by holding the incident as
submitted for resolution, without a summary hearing and compliance with the
other mandatory requirements provided for in Section 17, Rule 59 of the Rules
of Court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“II.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That the Honorable Court a quo erred in
ordering the issuance of execution against the herein bonding
company-appellant.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“III.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the Honorable Court a quo erred in denying
the motion to quash the writ of execution filed by the herein bonding
company-appellant as well as its subsequent motion for <span style="">reconsideration, and/or in not quashing or setting aside the writ of
execution."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Not one of the assignment of errors - it <span style="">is </span>obvious -raises the question of lack of jurisdiction, neither
directly nor indirectly.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Although the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> failed to file their brief, the Court of Appeals,
on </span><st1:date year="1962" day="11" month="12"><span style="">December 11, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">, decided the case affirming the orders appealed from.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1963" day="8" month="1"><span style="">January
 8, 1963</span></st1:date><span style=""> - five </span><span style="">days after </span><span style="">the Surety received notice of the <span class="GramE">decision,</span> it
filed a motion asking for extension of time within which to file a motion for
reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals
granted the motion in its resolution of January 10 of the same year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two days later the Surety filed a pleading
entitled MOTION TO DISMISS, alleging substantially that <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>'
action was filed in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
on July 19, 1948 for the recovery of the sum of P1,908.00 only; that a month
before that date Republic Act No. 296, other­wise known as the Judiciary Act of
1948, had already become effective, Section 88 of which placed within the
original ex­clusive jurisdiction of inferior courts all civil actions where the
value of the subject matter or the amount of the demand does not exceed
P2,000.00, exclusive of interest and costs; that the Court of First Instance
therefore had no jurisdiction to try and decide the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon these premises the Surety's motion
prayed the Court of Appeals to set aside its decision and to dismiss the
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By resolution of </span><st1:date year="1963" day="16" month="1"><span style="">January
 16, 1963</span></st1:date><span style=""> the Court
of Appeals required the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> </span>to <span style="">answer the motion to dis­miss, but they
failed to do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whereupon, on May 20 of
the </span>same year, the <span style="">Court
resolved to set aside its decision and to certify the case to <span class="GramE">Us</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pertinent
portions of its reso­lution read as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"It would indeed appear from the record that the action at
bar, which is a suit for collection of money in the sum of exactly P1,908.00
exclusive of interest, was ori­ginally instituted in the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> on July 19, 1948.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But about a month prior to the filing of the
complaint, more specifically on <st1:date year="1948" day="17" month="6">June
 17, 1948</st1:date>, the Judiciary Act of 1948 took effect, depriving the
Court of First Instance of original jurisdiction over cases in which the
demand, exclusive of interest, is not more than P2<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Secs</span>.
44[c] and 86[b] R.A. No. 296.)</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"We believe, therefore, that the point raised in appellant's
motion is an <span style="">important </span>one which
merits serious consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As stated,
the complaint was filed on <st1:date year="1948" day="19" month="7">July 19,
 1948</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This case therefore
has been pending now for almost 15 years, and throughout the entire proceeding
appellant never raised the question of jurisdiction until after receipt of this
Court's adverse decision.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"There are three cases decided by the Honorable Supreme Court
which may be worthy of consideration in connection with this case, namely:
Tyson Tan, et al. vs. Filipinas <span class="SpellE">Compañia</span> de <span class="SpellE">Seguros</span>, et al., G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-10096, </span><st1:date year="1956" day="23" month="3"><span class="GramE">March 23, 1956</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">; <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Pindangan</span></span><span style=""> </span>Agricultural Co., Inc. vs. Jose P. <span class="SpellE">Dans</span>, etc., et al., G. R. No.</span> <span class="GramE">L-14591,
</span><st1:date year="1962" day="26" month="9"><span class="GramE">September 26,
 1962</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">; and Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Mon­telibano</span>
et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span>-Murcia Milling Co., Inc., G. R.
No.</span> L-15092, September 29, 1962, wherein the Honorable Supreme Court
frowned upon the 'undesirable practice' of appellants submitting their case for
decision and then accepting the judgment, if favorable, but attacking it for
lack of jurisdiction <span style="">when </span>adverse.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Considering, however, that the Supreme Court has the
'exclusive' appellate juris­diction over 'all cases in which the juris­diction
of any inferior court is in issue' (Sec. 1, Par. 3[3], Judiciary Act of 1948,
as amended), we have no choice but to certify, as we hereby do certify, this
case to the Supreme Court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"ACCORDINGLY, pursuant to Section 31 of the Judiciary Act of
1948 as amended, let the record of this case be forwarded to the Supreme
Court."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is an undisputed fact
that the action commenced by <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> in the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> against the </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Sibunghanoy</span></span><span style=""> spouses was </span><span style="">for the recovery of the sum of P1<span class="GramE">,908.00</span> only
- an amount within the original exclusive jurisdiction of inferior courts in
accordance with the pro­visions of the Judiciary Act of 1948 which had taken
effect about a month prior to the date when the action was commenced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>True also is the rule that jurisdiction over
the subject matter is conferred upon the courts exclusively by law, and as the
lack of it affects the very authority of the court to take cognizance of the case,
the objection may be raised at any stage of the proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, considering the facts and
circumstances of the present case - which shall forth­with be set forth - We
are of the opinion that the Surety is now barred by <span class="SpellE"><u>laches</u></span>
from invoking this plea at this late hour for the </span><span style="">purpose of <span class="SpellE">annuling</span>
</span><span style="">everything done heretofore in
the case with its active participation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As already stated, the
action was commenced in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
on </span><st1:date year="1948" day="19" month="7"><span style="">July 19, 1948</span></st1:date><span style="">,
that is, almost <u>fifteen</u> <u>years</u> <u>before</u> the Surety filed its
motion to dismiss on </span><st1:date year="1963" day="12" month="1"><span style="">January 12, 1963</span></st1:date><span style=""> raising the question of lack of jurisdiction
<u>for</u> <u>the</u> <u>first</u> <u>time</u>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It must be remembered that although the action, ori­ginally, was
exclusively against the <span class="SpellE">Sibunghanoy</span> spouses, the
Surety became a quasi-party therein since July 31, 1948 when it filed a
counter-bond for the dissolution of the writ of attachment issued by the court
of origin (Record on Appeal, pp. 15-19).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Since then, it acquired certain rights and assumed specific obligations
in connection with the pending case, in accordance with Sections 12 and 17,
Rule 57, Rules of Court (Bautista vs. Joaquin 46 Phil. 885; <span class="SpellE">Kimpang</span>
&amp; Co. vs. Javier 65 Phil. 170).</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the filing of the first motion for execution against the
counter-bond the Surety not only filed a written opposition thereto praying for
its denial but also asked for an additional <u>affirmative</u> <u>relief</u> -
that it be relieved of its liability under the counter-bond upon the grounds
relied upon in support of its opposition - lack of jurisdiction of the court a
quo not being one of them.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then, at the hearing on the second motion for execution against
the counter-bond, the Surety appeared, through counsel, to ask for time within
which to file an answer or opposition thereto.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This motion was granted, but instead of such answer or opposition, the
Surety filed the motion to dismiss men­tioned heretofore.</p>

<p class="BODY">A party may be <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> or barred from
raising a question in different ways and for different reasons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus we speak of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>
in <span class="SpellE">pais</span>, of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> by
deed or by record, and of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> by <span class="SpellE"><u>laches</u></span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Laches</span>, in a general sense, is failure
or neglect, for an unreasonable and unexplained length of time, to do that
which, by exercising due diligence, could or should have been done earlier; it
is negligence or omission to assert a right <span style="">within a</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">reasonable time, warranting a presumption
that the party entitled to assert it either has </span><span style="">abandoned it </span><span style="">or declined
to assert it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The doctrine of <span class="SpellE">laches</span> or of
"stale demands" is based upon grounds of public policy which
requires, for the peace <span style="">of society, </span>the
discouragement of stale claims and, unlike the statute of limitations, <span style="">is </span>not <span style="">a mere </span>question of time but <span style="">is </span>principally a question of the inequity or unfairness of
permitting a right or claim to be enforced or asserted.</p>

<p class="BODY">It has been held that a party can not invoke the jurisdiction of
a court to secure affirmative relief against his opponent and, after obtaining
or failing to obtain such relief, repudiate or question that same jurisdiction
(Dean <span style="">vs. Dean, 136 Or. 694, 86 A.L.R.
79).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case just cited, by way of
explaining the rule, it was further said that the question whether the court
had jurisdiction either of the subject matter of the action or of the parties
was not im­portant in such cases because the party is barred from such conduct <u>not
because the judgment or order of the court is valid and conclusive as an </u></span><u><span style="">adjudication</span></u><span style="">, <u>but for, the </u></span><u><span style="">reason that such a practice can not be
tolerated</span></u><span style=""> - obviously for
reasons of public policy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, it has also been held that after voluntarily submitting
a cause and encountering an adverse decision on the merits, it <span style="">is </span>too late for the looser to
question the juris­diction or power of the court (Pease vs. <span class="SpellE">Rathbun</span>-Jones
etc. <span style="">243 U.S. 273, 61 <span class="SpellE">L.Ed</span>. 715, 37 </span><span class="SpellE">S.Ct</span>. 283;
St. Louis etc. vs. McBride, 141 U.S. 127, 35 L. Ed. 659).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And <span style="">in
</span>Littleton vs. Burgess, 16 Wyo. 58, the Court said that it is not right
for a party who has affirmed and invoked the jurisdiction of a court <span style="">in a </span>particular matter to secure an
affirmative relief, to afterwards deny that same jurisdiction to escape a
penalty.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon this same principle is what We said in the three cases
mentioned in the resolution of the Court of Appeals of May 20, 1963 (supra) -
to the <span style="">effect </span>that we frown
upon the "undesirable practice" of a party submitting his case for
decision and then accepting the judgment, only if favor­able, and attacking it
for lack of jurisdiction, when adverse -as well as in <span class="SpellE">Pindañgan</span>
etc. vs. <span class="SpellE">Dans</span> et al., G. R. L-14591, September 26,
1962; <span class="SpellE">Montelibano</span> et al., vs. <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span>-Murcia
Milling Co., Inc., G.R. L-15092; <span style="">Young
Men </span>Labor Union etc. vs. the Court of Industrial Relations et al., G.R.
L-20307, Feb. 26, 1965, and Mejia vs. Lucas 100 Phil. p. 277.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts of this case show that from the time the Surety became
a quasi-party on July 31, 1948, it could have <span style="">raised the question of the lack of jurisdiction of the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> to take cognizance of the present
action by reason of the sum of money involved which, accord­ing to the law then
in force, was within the original ex­clusive jurisdiction of inferior
courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It failed to do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, at several stages of the proceedings
in the court a quo </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">well as in the Court
of Appeals, it invoked </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">jurisdiction of said courts to obtain
affirmative relief and submitted its case for a final adjudication on the
merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only after an adverse
decision was rendered by the Court of Appeals that it finally woke up to raise
the question of jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Were We to
sanction such conduct on its part, </span><span style="">We </span><span style="">would
in effect be declaring as useless all </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">proceedings had in
the present case since it was com­menced on July 19, 1948 and compel the
judgment creditors to go up their Calvary once more.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The inequity and unfairness of this is not
only patent but revolting.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Coming now to the merits
of the appeal: after going over the entire record, We have become persuaded
that We can do nothing better than to quote <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span>,
with approval, the de­cision rendered by the Court of Appeals on December 11,
1962 </span><span style="">as
</span><span style="">follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"In Civil Case No.</span> R-660 of the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, which was a suit for
collection of a sum of money, <span style="">a writ </span>of attach­ment was issued against defendants’
properties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The attachment, however, was
subsequently dis­charged under Section 12 of Rule 59 upon the filing by
defendants of a bond subscribed by Manila Surety &amp; Fidelity Co., Inc.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"After trial, judgment
was rendered in favor of plaintiffs.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The writ of execution against defendants having been returned
totally unsatisfied, plaintiffs moved, under Section 17 of Rule 59, for
issuance of writ of execution against Manila Surety &amp; Fidelity Co., Inc. to
enforce the obligation of the bond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
the motion was, upon the surety's opposition, denied on the ground that there
was 'no showing that a de­mand had been made by <span style="">the </span>plaintiffs to the bonding company for payment of the amount
due under the judgment' (Record on Appeal, p. 60).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Hence, plaintiffs made the necessary demand upon the surety
for satisfaction of the judgment, and upon the latter's failure to pay the
amount due, plaintiffs again filed a motion dated <st1:date year="1957" day="31" month="10">October 31, 1957</st1:date>, for issuance of writ of execution
against the surety, with notice of hearing on <st1:date year="1957" day="2" month="11">November 2, 1957</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1957" day="31" month="10">October 31, 1957</st1:date>,
the surety received copy of said motion and notice of hearing.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It appears that when the motion was called on <st1:date year="1957" day="2" month="11">November 2, 1957</st1:date>, the surety's
counsel asked that he be given time within which to answer the motion, and so
an order was issued in open court, as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1958" day="25" month="2">February 25, 1958</st1:date>,
the surety filed a motion for reconsideration of the above-stated order of
denial; <span style="">which </span>motion was like­wise
denied by order of <st1:date year="1958" day="26" month="3">March 26, 1958</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"From the above-stated orders of <st1:date year="1958" day="10" month="2">February 10, 1958</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1958" day="26" month="3">March 26, 1958</st1:date>---denying the sure­ty's motion to quash the
writ of execution and motion for reconsideration, respectively---the surety has
interposed the appeal on hand.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The surety insists that the lower court should have granted
its motion to quash the writ of execution because the same was issued without
the summary hearing required by Section 17 of Rule 59, which reads:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q"><span class="GramE">'SEC. 17.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When execution returned unsatisfied, recovery had upon bond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>? If the execution be returned
unsatisfied in whole or in part, the surety or sure­ties on any bond given
pursuant to the provisions of this role to secure the payment of the judgment
shall become finally charged on such bond, and bound to pay to the plaintiff
upon demand the amount due under the judgment, which amount may be recovered
from such surety or sureties after notice and <u>summary hearing in the same
action</u>.' <span style="">(Underscoring ours)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Summary hearing is 'not intended to be carried on in the
formal manner in which ordi<span style="">nary actions
</span>are prosecuted' (83 C.J.S. 792).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is, rather, a procedure by which a question is resolved with
dispatch, with the least pos­sible delay, and in preference to ordinary legal
and regular judicial proceedings' (Ibid, p. 790).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is essential is that 'the defendant is
no­tified or summoned to appear and is given an opportunity to hear what is
urged upon him, and to interpose a defense, after which follows an adjudication
of the rights of the parties' (Ibid., pp. 793-794); and as to the extent and latitude
of the hearing, the <span style="">same </span>will naturally lie upon the discretion of the court,
depending upon the attending circumstances and the nature of the in­cident up
for consideration.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the case at bar, the surety had been no­tified of the
plaintiffs' motion for execution and of the date when the same would be
submitted for consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact,
the surety's counsel was present in court when the motion was called, and it
was upon his request that the court <u>a</u> <u>q</u><u><span style="">uo</span></u><span style=""> </span>gave him a
period of four days within which <span style="">to </span>file
an answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet he allowed that period to
lapse with­out filing an answer or objection.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The surety cannot now, therefore, complain that it was de­prived of its
day in court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is argued that the surety's counsel did not file an answer
to the motion 'for the simple reason that all its defenses can be set up during
the hearing of the motion even if the same are not reduced to writing'
(Appellant's brief, p. 4).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There <span style="">is </span>obviously
no merit in this pretense because, as stated above, the record will show that
when the motion was called, what the surety's coun­sel did was to ask that he
be allowed and given time to file an answer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, it was stated in the order given in open court upon request of
the surety's counsel that after the four-day pe­riod within which to file an
answer, 'the incident shall be deemed submitted for resolution'; and counsel
apparently agreed, as the order was issued upon his instance and he interposed
no objection thereto.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"It is also urged that
although according </span>to Section 17 of Rule 59, <u><span style="">supra</span></u><span style="">, </span>there
is no need for a separate action, there must, however, be a separate judgment
against the surety in order to hold it liable on the bond (Appellant's Brief,
p. 15).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not so, in our opinion, A bond
filed for discharge of attachment is, per Section 12 of Rule 59, "to
secure the payment to the plaintiff of any judgment he may recover in the
action,' and stands <span style="">'<u>in place of the
property so released</u>'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Hence,
after the judgment for the plaintiff has become <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
and the execution <span style="">is </span>'returned unsatisfied' (Sec. 17, Rule 59), as in this case,
the liability of the bond automatically attaches and, in failure of the surety
to satisfy the judgment against the defendant despite demand <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, writ of execution may issue against the surety to
enforce the obli­gation of the bond."</blockquote>
