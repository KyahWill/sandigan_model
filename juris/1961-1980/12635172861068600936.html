				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The crucial issue in this appeal from a decision of October 19,
1965, rendered by the then Judge Agustin P. <span class="SpellE">Montesa</span>
of the Court of First Instance of Manila, dismissing an action for certiorari
and mandamus is, to paraphrase the brief for respondents-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>,
whether or not a petition for review of an administrative decision is to be
filed in the Court of First Instance of the province or city where the officer
who rendered the decision holds office or where the real property subject of
the litigation is located?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was the
view of former Judge <span class="SpellE">Montesa</span> that as the action was
one "affecting title to, or for recovery of possession of real
property," it should be commenced and tried in the province where it
lies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, his order of dismissal now
on appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is our view that the
answer thus given does not reflect the settled law on the subject.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, we reverse.</p>

<p class="BODY">The land, which is the subject matter of this litigation, is
located in Quintana, <span class="SpellE">Tanza</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner-appellant <span class="SpellE">Salud</span>,
alleging that he was the successor in interest of the original applicant, who
paid the first installment of the purchase price of such parcel of land of the
Sta. Cruz de <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span> Friar Land Estate situated in <span class="SpellE">Tanza</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>, sought a recog­nition
of his right from the Director of Lands.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was successful, the decision in his favor being con­firmed by the
then Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon appeal to the Executive Secretary,
however, his fate was otherwise, it being the holding of such official, now
respondent-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, that the land was open for
public sale to the highest bidder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not
satisfied, he instituted a special civil action for certiorari and mandamus,
with the lower court, as noted, dismissing such a suit on the ground that as
the parcel of land was located in <span class="SpellE">Tanza</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>, the Court of First Instance of Manila was without
jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">To repeat what was stated at the outset, the lower court was far
from responsive to what has been so categorically announced by this Court time
and time again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The jurisdiction of the
Court of First Instance of Manila to decide the matter on the merits far from
being dubious is quite clear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So we have
held not once but repeatedly.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, in Dizon v. Bayona,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
the matter in dispute was an application for fishpond permit, covering two
parcels of land in <span class="SpellE">Calatagan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>,
with the action taken by the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources
being challenged in a suit filed with the Manila Court of First Instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We did rule that "respondent court has
jurisdiction * * *." In <span class="SpellE">Sarabia</span> v. The Secretary
of Agriculture and Natural Resources,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a> a
petition for certiorari to review and set aside or annul the order of
respondent was instituted in the Manila Court of First Instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What was in issue was a fishpond permit
issued by such official for a parcel of land in <span class="SpellE">Naujan</span>,
Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was no doubt entertained as to the jurisdiction of the lower
court, outside the province where the land was located.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Suarez v. Reyes,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
the right to a timber con­cession located in <span class="SpellE">Labason</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del Norte, was inquired into in a suit
before respondent Judge Reyes of the <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Court of
First Instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it was in <span class="SpellE">Uichanco</span> v. Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
dealing with a sales application of peti­tioner with the Bureau of Lands for
the purchase of a parcel of public land situated in Victoria, Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Due to a
protest, such an application was cancelled by the Director of Lands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While respondent Secretary of Agriculture and
Natural Resources rein­stated it, a portion thereof was excluded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner not satisfied brought certiorari
proceedings in the Court of First Instance of Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no question that such a tribunal
was possessed of jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">The recent case of Extensive Enterprises Corp. v. <span class="SpellE">Sarbro</span> &amp; Co., Inc.,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
reaffirms the doctrine thus consistently announced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here the controversy centered on which entity
would be given the opportunity of exploiting a tract of public forest with an
approxi­mate area of 29,000 hectares situated in <span class="SpellE">Compostela</span>,
Province of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was a public bidding and the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural
Resources issued an award in favor of respondent <span class="SpellE">Sarbro</span>
&amp; Co., Inc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On appeal to the Office
of the President, the then Acting Executive Secretary, by authority of the
President, rendered on December 29, 1959, a decision dividing the area in
question between Extensive and <span class="SpellE">Sarbro</span> based on his
opinion that both corporations appeared to be well qualified to operate the
logging area and as a result, he revoked the temporary permit granted to <span class="SpellE">Sarbro</span> for the logging of the entire area, causing it to
file a special civil action for certiorari and mandamus with preliminary
injunction before the Court of First Instance of Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would thus test the validity of the order
of the Acting Executive Secretary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
doubt whatsoever was enter­tained as to the power and competence of the Court
of First Instance of Manila to pass on the matter.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It would thus appear that such a doctrine con­cerning the jurisdiction
of the judicial tribunal where the executive official whose decision is sought
to be assailed holds office is applied with an undeviating rigidity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No misgivings ought to have been entertained
by the then Judge <span class="SpellE">Montesa</span> then as to his jurisdiction
to decide the action before him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Either
through inadvertence or insufficient awareness of the principle consistently
adhered to by this Court, he dismissed the suit precisely on a ground where he
was least vulnerable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His order of
dismissal as already stated cannot stand.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b style="">WHEREFORE</b>, the
decision of Judge <span class="SpellE">Montesa</span> of October 19, 1965
dismissing the case for certiorari and mandamus is set aside and the case
remanded to the lower court to be determined on its merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With­out pronouncement as to costs.</p>
