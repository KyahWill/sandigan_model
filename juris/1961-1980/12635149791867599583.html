the Court of First Instance of Manila, hereinafter referred to as the CFI.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1958" day="12" month="8"><span style="">August
 12, 1958</span></st1:date><span style="">, the
Reparations Commission approved a resolution awarding to the Liberation
Steamship Co. - herein?</span> after referred to as Liberation -
"two (2) additional units of cargo vessels of 11, 000 dead weight ton each
at an estimated price of $7,900,000".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Alleging that the Commission and its members - hereinafter referred to
collectively as petitioners - had neglected<span style=""> their "bounden duty to finally <span class="SpellE">consumate</span>"
the aforementioned reso­lution, on February 29, 1960, Liberation filed with the
CFI a peti­tion for mandamus - docketed as Civil Case No. 42668 of said court -
to compel herein petitioners "to implement" said resolu­tion by
"allocating in an award properly implemented the two (2) additional cargo
vessels in the third yearly or the next immediately available schedule of
reparations awards, " as well as to recover damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their motion to dismiss said petition having
been denied, petitioners herein filed their answer contesting Liberation's
alleged right to the relief prayed for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently,
both parties submit­ted an agreed statement of facts and compromise agreement,
dated </span><st1:date year="1960" day="13" month="10"><span style="">October 13, 1960</span></st1:date><span style="">, reading:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"COME NOW the parties in the above-entitled case, thru their
respective counsel and to this Ho­norable Court respectfully stipulated and
agree to submit this case for decision upon the following <span style="">facts agreed upon to be true and correct:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"1. That the petitioner is a corporation duly or­ganized by
native-born Filipino citizens under and by virtue of the laws of the
Philippines, for the pur­pose of engaging in shipping business and to help in <span style="">the promotion of the country's economic
rehabilitation;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"2. That the
respondent Reparations Commis­sion is a Commission created by law, Republic Act
No. 1789, and the other respondents are the duly ap­pointed, qualified and
incumbent Chairman and Com­missioners of the said Commission;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"3. That the exercise
by the respondent Repara­tions Commission of its powers and prerogatives to
administer the acquisitions utilization and distribu­tion of reparations goods
and/or services is subject to the Reparations Agreement, the Reparations Law,
and the Rules and Regulations promulgated pursuant thereto;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"4. That in the
smatter of the supply of services and products by the Japanese Government by
way of reparations, subject "services and products shall be those
requested by the Republic of the Philippines and agreed upon between the two
governments" pur­suant to Article 3 of the Reparations Agreement;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"5. That the
respondent Reparations Commission taking cognizance of representations made by
the pe</span><span style="">titioner, that the latter
be assured of at least three ocean-going vessels as per its original
application to be constructed within the next coming five years, in order to
permit it to plan for definite financing commitments and to make agency
contracts abroad, awarded two (2) additional units of cargo vessels of 11,000
deadweight ton each at an estimated-price of $7,900,000 by virtue of a
resolution adopted and ap</span>proved by it on August 12, 1958;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"6. That under the aforesaid resolution, it was also
"RESOLVED, FURTHER, that the Chief, Philip­pine Reparations Mission be, as
he is hereby request­ed to transmit to the GAIMUSHO the necessary amend­ment
covering these additional awards; and he is fur­ther authorized to make adjustments
in the 3rd year schedule as per attached amendments";</blockquote>

<blockquote>"7. That pursuant to said Resolution of August 12, 1958, the
Reparations Mission transmitted to the GAIMUSHO on August 18, 1958, an
amendatory sche­dule to the 3rd year schedule containing the award of two (2)
additional vessels to the petitioner, but when the 3rd year reparations
schedule was returned to the respondent Reparations Commission by the <span style="">GAIMUSHO, </span>only one vessel was awarded
to the petitioner, and the two additional units awarded to it were not approved
by the GAIMUSHO;</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"8, That thereafter,
the petitioner repeatedly requested the respondent Reparations Commission for
the inclusion of the two additional vessels awarded to it in the subsequent 5th
year reparations schedule, but the respondent could not grant said requests in
view of unavailability of funds for the purpose as well as the limitations
contained in the economic pattern established by the National Economic Council
which did not permit the same;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"9. That any
reparations schedule prepared by the respondent Reparations Commission, in
order to be valid and effective, must be approved by the National Economic
Council, then by the President and finally by the GAIMUSHO, representing the
Japanese Government;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"10. That the matter
of inclusion of a particular award or allocation in any given reparations
schedule is governed by Several factors, among which are, the economic
priorities established by the National </span><span style="">Economic Council, </span><span style="">the
conditions set forth by the law itself including the availability of funds for
the purpose;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"11. That the herein
petitioner is not the only applicant for overseas vessels; that the approved
allocation for one (1) vessel in favor of the petitioner, as well as those in
favor of other applicants, all come under one schedule, that is, the approved
3rd year schedule which was carried over to the 4th Repara­tions Year;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"12. That with reference to ocean-going vessels, there was no
new and additional allocation under the 4th Reparations Year for the reason
that the 4th year schedule merely carried over those approved under the 3rd
year schedule;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"13. That petitioner is willing that the two (2) additional
vessels awarded to it by respondent Repa­rations Commission be included in
whole or in part at the next available yearly schedule and the respond­ents
agree to consider this willingness of the petitioner in the drafting of the
next available reparations sche­dule subject to the conditions enumerated in
paragraph <span style="">10 hereof.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, it is most respectfully prayed that a decision be
rendered based on the foregoing agreed statement of facts and approving this
compro­mise without pronouncement as to costs. "</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1960" day="10" month="11"><span style="">November
 10, 1960</span></st1:date><span style="">, the CFI
rendered judgment "ap­proving" this agreement and "enjoining the
parties to comply strictly" with "the terms and conditions"
thereof, "without pronouncement as to costs. " Over a year later, or
on </span><st1:date year="1961" day="21" month="11"><span style="">November 21, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="">, the Company filed a motion praying "that an order of execution
of the above judgment be issued awarding" to the <span class="SpellE">movant</span>
"the two (2) vessels" referred to in the agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Des­pite petitioners' opposition to said
motion, on December 20, 1961, the CFI, then presided over by Honorable <span class="SpellE">Higinio</span> </span><span style="">B. </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Macadaeg</span></span><span style="">, Judge, ordered that "a writ of
execution issue to the </span><span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span><span style="">Reparations Commission" and the
Reparations "commissioners to include" said Company "as the <span class="SpellE">awardee</span> of the first </span><span style="">two (2) </span><span style="">ocean-going
vessels in this year's reparations schedule. "<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Accordingly, on December
22, 1961, a writ of execution, commanding the Sheriff of Manila "to cause
the </span><span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> </span><span style="">Reparations
Commission" and the Reparations "Commissioners to comply" with
paragraph 13 of the compromise agreement, "by including the </span><span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style=""> Liberation Steamship Co. as the <span class="SpellE">awardee</span> of the first two (2) ocean-going vessels in this
year's reparations schedule, within ten (10) </span><span style="">days from the date of receipt hereof, " was issued.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">A reconsideration of said order of December 20, 1961, and a
motion to quash said writ of execution having been denied, petitioners herein
perfected their appeal, by seasonably filing their notice of appeal, appeal
bond and record on appeal; but, the ap­peal was, on motion of Liberation,
dismissed by Judge <span class="SpellE">Macadaeg</span>, on March 30, 1962, upon
the ground that, being based upon a<span style=""> </span>compromise agreement, the judgment rendered
on November 10, 1960, became final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> upon
its rendition, and that an appeal would violate said agreement, the purpose of
which is to settle the issue between the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Notice of the order to this effect was
received by the petitioners on <st1:date year="1962" day="10" month="4">April
 10, 1962</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereupon, or on April 25, 1962, petitioners herein filed, in the
Court of Appeals, a petition for mandamus, which was docketed as CA-G.R. No.
30796-R, to compel the CFI to give due course to said appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a resolution of the Court of Appeals date<span style=""> October 26, 1962, this petition was,
however, "dismissed without prejudice to filing the same in the
appropriate court, " upon the ground of lack of jurisdiction, because the
issues involved in the appeal are "all questions of law" and the
value of the controversy exceeds P200,000.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Soon thereafter, petitioners commenced the present action, </span>for <span style="">the same purpose, in the Supreme Court, which
forthwith issued a writ of preliminary injunction restraining and enjoining the
Sheriff of Manila from proceeding with the enforcement of the aforementioned
writ of execution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents maintain that the "right of petitioners herein
to file the instant petition for mandamus <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>has
already prescribed, inasmuch as this action was begun on December 11, 1962,
whereas <span style="">the order of the CFI dismissing
petitioners' appeal was received by them over eight (8) months prior thereto.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Cortes v. Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Capiz</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
cited by res­pondents in support of their contention, is not in point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that case <u>no action</u> was taken by
the petitioners therein until over four (4) months after notice of the last
order denying their appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
present case, petitioners <u>did act within fifteen (15) days</u> after notice
of said order - by filing the <span style="">petition
for mandamus </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">CA-G. R. No. 30796-R
of the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The delay in
the commencement of the case at bar in the Supreme Court was due to the </span>fact
<span style="">that the Court of Appeals did not
dismiss the case before it until October 26, 1962, notice of which was received
by the petitioners on Octo­ber 29, 1962.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the Cortes case involved the application of section 499
of Act 190, pursuant to which a petition for mandamus for the approval of a
record on appeal should be filed "<u>at the next term of </u><u><span style="">the Supreme Court</span></u><span style="">." The </span><span style="">pertinent provision is now </span><span style="">section
15 of </span><span style="">Rule 41 of the Revised
Rules of Court,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> which fixes <u>no</u> period for the filing
of said petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the time <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> must be deemed "variable as the ends of
justice may demand," in the language of Mr. Justice Reyes (J. B. L.),
speaking for this Court in <span class="SpellE">Centenera</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Yatco</span>.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> In other words, the petition should be filed
within a reasonable time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Under the facts of the
present case, we find that the petition therein has been filed within such
time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, referring to a de­lay </span>of
<span style="">four (4) months, in the <span class="SpellE">Centenera</span> case, we held:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span><span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>the
constant policy of the courts is not to deny the writ if the result would be to
deprive a party of his substantial right and leave him without remedy (14
C.J.S. 190).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>A delay of four months
in the pursuit of his remedy of mandamus is not so </u><u><span style="">long or unreaso</span></u><u><span style="">nable </span></u><u><span style="">as to </span></u><u><span style="">nullify </span></u><u><span style="">petitioner's right to appeal and leave him
without any relief against the decision of the trial court which may after all
be erroneous and reversible</span></u><span style="">,
especially as the lower court is already poised to execute said judg­ment and
compel petitioner to remove his house of strong materials from the premises in
question, which execution could cause petitioner great damage and
prejudice."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> (Underscoring supplied)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Incidentally, this view
must be deemed to have superseded that expressed in the Cortes case, insofar as
the latter is inconsistent therewith.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Was the CFI justified in
refusing to give due course to petitioners' appeal?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The record on appeal
attached to the petition herein shows that on December 27, 1961, petitioners
moved for a reconsideration of the order of December 20, 1961 (granting the
motion for execution filed by the Company) and to quash the writ of execution
issued pur­suant thereto; that this motion was denied on January 10, 1962; and
that on January 19, 1962, petitioners filed their notice of appeal, appeal bond
and record on appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words,
petitioners' ap­peal was perfected within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">This notwithstanding, the
CFI dismissed the appeal upon the ground that, having been rendered upon a
compromise agree­ment between the parties, its decision dated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><st1:date year="1960" day="10" month="11"><span style="">November 10, 1960</span></st1:date><span style="">, "had already become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>." Petitioners sought to appeal, however, not
from said decision, but, from the order of </span><st1:date year="1961" day="20" month="12"><span style="">December 20, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="">, purporting to execute said decision in a
manner which, petitioners claim, is not in accordance therewith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true, Judge <span class="SpellE">Macadaeg</span>
opined otherwise, but, it is no </span><span style="">less </span><span style="">true
that petitioners are entitled, not only to disagree with his view, but, also,
to bring the issue, on appeal, to a higher court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The CFI might have had
some semblance of justification in dismissing the appeal if its order of </span><st1:date year="1961" day="20" month="12"><span style="">December
 20, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="">, and the
writ of execution issued pursuant thereto had, at least, purported to adhere to
the tenor of the decision of </span><st1:date year="1960" day="10" month="11"><span style="">November 10, 1960</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">Said </span><span style="">order, however, directs petitioners herein
"to include" the Com­pany "as the <span class="SpellE">awardee</span>
of the first two (2) ocean-going vessels" in the "reparations schedule"
for the year <u>1961</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Similarly, the
writ of execution commands the Sheriff of M</span><span style="">a</span><span style="">nila "to
cause" the petitioners herein to comply with the aforementioned decision
"by including the </span><span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
</span><span style="">Liberation x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
as the <span class="SpellE">awardee</span> of the first two ocean-going vessels"
in the reparations schedule for the year <u>1961</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This writ and said order manifestly depart
from the letter and the spirit of the decision they purport to enforce.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Paragraph 13 of the
compromise agreement, incorporated into said decision, merely states that
Liberation "is <u>willing</u> that the two (2) additional vessels awarded
to it" by petitioners be included, in whole or in part, "in the next </span><u><span style="">available</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">yearly schedule",
and, that petitioners herein have agreed "</span><span style="">to </span><u><span style="">consider</span></u><span style=""> this willingness" of Liberation "in
the drafting of the next available reparations schedule." The obligation
thus assumed by the petitioners is <u>not</u> "to <u>include</u>"
Liberation in the reparations schedule for <u>1961</u>, but merely "to <u>consider</u>"
its willingness to be included in the "next <u>available</u> yearly
schedule," in <u>connection with the drafting</u><b> </b>thereof.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Moreover, the commitment
of petitioners herein "to consider" Liberation's aforementioned
willingness, was explicitly made <u>subject to the conditions set forth </u></span><u><span style="">in par</span></u><u><span style="">a</span></u><u><span style="">gr<span style="">a</span></span></u><u><span style="">ph 10 </span></u><span style="">the compromise agreement, which provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>that the matter of inclusion of a particular
award or allocation in any given reparations schedule is covered by several
factors, among which are the economic priorities established by the <span style="">Na</span>tional Economic Council, the
conditions set forth by <span style="">law </span>itself
including the availability of funds for the purpose."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This paragraph should, in turn, be correlated with paragraph 9 of
said agreement, stipulating:</p>

<blockquote>" x<span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> that any<span style=""> </span>reparations schedule prepared by the

<p class="BODY">Neither should we overlook the other provisions of the compromise
agreement, particularly those stipulating that Liberation "is <u>not the

that, "with reference to ocean-going <span style="">vessels, </span>there was <u>no new and additional</u> allocation under

the representative of the Japanese Government, whose concurrence is essential
to the validity and <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of "any
reparations schedule."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">By virtue of these
stipulations, Liberation has, in effect, admitted that the non-inclusion, up to
the 5th year reparations sche</span>dule, of the two (2) additional ocean-going
vessels awarded thereto, <span style="">was due, </span><u>not</u> to petitioners' neglect or refusal to
implement the award, but to several factors <u>beyond their control</u>; that,
because <span style="">of these factors, the
petitioners are neither free to act in the matter of inclusion of awardees in
the reparations schedules, nor in a position to state, in advance, either the
specific circumstances under</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">which the inclusion could be effected, or the
particular time at which </span><span style="">or </span><span style="">the
schedule in which the inclusion could or would be made; and that, accordingly,
Liberation had agreed to depend upon the sense of duty and justice, as well as
to </span>rely upon the sound judgment and discretion of the petitioners
herein, in the determination of the conditions under which the implementation
of said award would be viable or feasible, tak­ing into account that there were
previous awards still to be met, apart from the "economic priorities,
established by the National Economic Council" and a number of other
"factors" govern­ing "the matter of inclusion of a particular
award or allocation in any given reparations schedule."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In short, petitioners
herein could not have bound them­selves, and Liberation could not have
understood them as as­suming the obligation to include said company in the 1961
repa­rations schedule.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, both
parties would have explicit­ly named said year, in their compromise
agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand, the
exercise of the aforementioned judgment and discretion by petitioners herein
cannot be controlled by writ of execution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, the order of </span><st1:date year="1961" day="20" month="12"><span style="">December 20, 1961</span></st1:date><span style=""> and the writ of execution issued on </span><st1:date year="1961" day="22" month="12"><span style="">December
 22, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="">, are not in
ac­cordance with the decision of </span><st1:date year="1960" day="10" month="11"><span style="">November 10, 1960</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">For this reason, it is
alleged in the petition herein that, in issuing said writ, the CFI had exceeded
its jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of this, and
of petitioners' allegations to the effect that said CFI had gravely <span class="SpellE">abuseedits</span> discretion and that they have "no other plain,
speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law," and considering
that, if the CFI were required</span> to give due course to petitioners'
appeal, we would unduly de­lay the determination of the merits of the issue
between the parties - which, at any rate, has been amply discussed by them in
the CFI, as well as in the Court of Appeals, and in this Court - said petition
may and should be, as it is hereby treated as one for certiorari.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>
