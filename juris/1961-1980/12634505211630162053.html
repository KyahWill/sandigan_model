				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES,
PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. DOMINGO
BATO, DEFENDANT-APPELLANT.

				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, C. J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Defendant Domingo <span class="SpellE">Bato</span> seeks the review
of a de­cision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>,
convicting him of the crime of murder, with which he is charged, and sentencing
him to life imprisonment, with the accessory penalties provided by law, to
indemnify the heirs of the deceased, Aurelio Laguna, in the sum of P6,000.00,
without subsidiary imprison­ment in case of insolvency, and to pay the costs,
one-half of his preventive imprisonment to be credited to him in the ser­vice
of said penalty.</p>

<p class="BODY">While Laguna was with his wife, <span class="SpellE">Emilia</span>
Rosales – hereinafter referred to as Mrs. Laguna – their daughter-in-law,
Asuncion <span class="SpellE">Cañete</span>, and their children, seated around a
table, taking their dinner, in the first floor of their house, in Barrio <span class="SpellE">Bagahupi</span>, municipality of <span class="SpellE">Babatñgon</span>,
province of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>, on April 3, 1959, between 6:30 and
7:00 p. m., with his back a few inches from a half-opened window, facing the
road, someone fired at him <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, thereby
inflicting upon him a gunshot wound<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
in consequence of which he died the next day.</p>

<p class="BODY">The only question for determination in this case is the identity
of the culprit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this connection, said
Asuncion <span class="SpellE">Cañete</span> testified that, upon hearing the
report of a gun, she stood up and looked through the aforementioned window,
which was only a little over one meter from the ground; that she then saw
defend­ant <span class="SpellE">Bato</span>, together with <span class="SpellE">Justiniano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ballais</span> and <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> <span class="SpellE">Saldivia</span>, all of whom are well known to her, in a seemingly
squatting position, as if prepared to run; that the place where these three (3)
persons were was illuminated by the light coming from Laguna's house and, also,
from that of their neighbor, <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> Rosales, aside
from a bonfire across the street, in the yard of one <span class="SpellE">Ceferino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lacaba</span>; that Bata was then holding a gun, whereas <span class="SpellE">Ballais</span> and <span class="SpellE">Saldivia</span> had each a
bolo; and that, Laguna had, likewise, looked at the window and told Mrs.
Laguna, that Domingo <span class="SpellE">Bato</span> was his assailant.</p>

<p class="BODY">Mrs. Laguna, in turn, revealed that, upon hearing the gunshot,
she went to the door leading to the kitchen and saw <span class="SpellE">Bato</span>
running away, pistol in hand, followed by <span class="SpellE">Ballais</span> and
<span class="SpellE">Saldivia</span>, each holding a long bolo; that when,
immediately thereafter, she approached her husband, he said that it was Domingo
<span class="SpellE">Bato</span> who had fired at him; that he reiterated this
statement to barrio lieutenant <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span> <span class="SpellE">Teñedo</span>, in the presence of rural policeman Pedro <span class="SpellE">Dosar</span>, when these two came soon after the occurrence, and,
still later, that <span style="">same </span>evening,
to municipal mayor, Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Ansale</span>, the chief of
police, and several policemen.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Gavino</span> <span class="SpellE">Teñedo</span>
and Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Ansale</span> confirmed this part of the
testimony of Mrs. Laguna.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further
corroboration was supplied by Vicente <span class="SpellE">Duallo</span>, who
said that, as he was walking towards the house of Laguna, in the evening of
April 3, 1959, to borrow a sack of <span class="SpellE">palay</span>, he heard
the report of a gun and then saw <span class="SpellE">Bato</span> and two (2)
other persons running away, coming from a place close to the house of said <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> Rosales, which is adjacent to that of Laguna.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Bato</span> would have us believe that, said
evening, he was with his family in a <span class="SpellE"><u>camarin</u></span>
of <span class="SpellE">Quinto</span> <span class="SpellE">Bato</span>, in which
they resided and which he did not leave that evening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He, likewise, introduced the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Felicisimo</span> <span class="SpellE">Bacquiano</span>, who claimed
to have spent the evening in said <span class="SpellE"><u>camarin</u></span>,
together with <span class="SpellE">Bato</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Testifying for the defense, <span class="SpellE">Ballais</span> and
<span class="SpellE">Saldivia</span> averred that they were in their respective
houses at the time of the occurrence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Pedro <span class="SpellE">Dosar</span> tried to corroborate <span class="SpellE">Saldi­via</span>, in whose house, <span class="SpellE">Dosar</span>
said, he was when a gun was fired at the scene of the occurrence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Dosar</span>, moreover,
stated that thereupon he went to the house of the <span class="SpellE">Lagunas</span>,
where Mrs. Laguna informed him that her husband had been shot by defendant <span class="SpellE">Bato</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is thus apparent, that this case hinges on the credibility of
the testimonial evidence therein introduced.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The lower court found the evidence of the prosecution more worthy of
credence than that of the defense and the records show that this appraisal is a
correct one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, apart from the
circumstance that the eyewitnesses for the prosecution corroborated each other,
their version was confirmed by the fact that, im­mediately after the
occurrence, Laguna told his wife that his assailant was Domingo <span class="SpellE">Bato</span>; that Mrs. Laguna immediately relayed this information
to Pedro <span class="SpellE">Dosar</span>; that Laguna, in turn, reiterated his
statement to the municipal mayor, the chief of police and members of the police
force; and that, in fact, <span class="SpellE">Bato</span> was seen near Laguna's
house when the shot was fired, as well as running away <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
immediately thereafter.</p>

<p class="BODY">Obviously, his version – which can hardly be characterized as an
alibi, for the house, in which he alleged he was at the time of the occurrence,
was barely 800 meters from that of Laguna, and is inherently weak – cannot
prevail over t h e foregoing circumstances.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then, again, it appears that, prior to the occurrence, Laguna had
reported to the Constabulary that <span class="SpellE">Bato</span> used to carry
around a firearm with which he used to threaten him (Laguna); that, as a
consequence, <span class="SpellE">Bato</span> was charged with illegal possession
of firearms, although this case was dismissed; that, a week or two before the
occurrence, the deceased had hand-carried to the provincial health officer a
report to the effect that dying <span class="SpellE">carabaos</span> had been
indiscriminately slaughtered by <span class="SpellE">Bato</span>; and that, in <span style="">a </span>number of land cases against <span class="SpellE">Quinto</span> <span class="SpellE">Bato</span>, an uncle of the
defendant, Laguna had acted either as plaintiff or as a witness.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are satisfied, therefore, that appellant is guilty of the
crime of murder, qualified by treachery.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Although the offense was committed at nighttime, the record does not
show that appellant had sought it purposely or taken advantage thereof to
facilitate the perpetration of the offense.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, the place from which he fired at Laguna seemed to be
sufficiently lighted for him to be clearly visible to, as well as recognized
by, all of those who happened to be nearby.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from should be, as it is
hereby, affirmed, with costs against appellant Domingo <span class="SpellE">Bato</span>.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>
