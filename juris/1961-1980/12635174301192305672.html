<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>FERNANDO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Providence Washington Insurance Co. filed, on October 21, 1966,
its brief as appellant against an order of the lower court dismissing its suit
for the non-delivery of thirty cases of steel files, which cargo was insured by
it against loss and damage, naming as defendants the Republic of the
Philippines and the Bureau of Customs as the operator of the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> service, thus rendering unavoidable the invocation
of the well-settled doctrine of non-suability of the government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Less than two months later, on <st1:date year="1966" day="17" month="12">December 17, 1966</st1:date>, our decision in
Mobil Philippines Exploration, Inc. v. Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span>
Service was promulgated.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
We there explicitly held:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The
Bureau of Customs, acting as part of the machinery of the national government
in the operation of the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> service, pursuant to
express legislative mandate and as a necessary incident of its prime
governmental function, is immune from suit, there being no statute to the
contrary."</p>

<p class="BODY">As of this date, thirty-six subsequent cases, certainly a figure
far from unimpressive, have been similarly decided, expressly reaffirming the
above ruling of governmental immunity from suit without its consent.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
The futility of this appeal is quite apparent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We affirm the lower court order of dismissal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The doctrine of non-suability thus holds undisputed sway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its primacy appears to be undeniable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For a suit of this character to prosper,
there must be a showing of consent either in express terms or by implication
through the use of statutory language too plain to be misinterpreted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its absence being obvious, the lower court
acted correctly.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nor did the Mobil decision blaze a new trail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it has been from the time the Constitution
took effect in 1935. Bull v. <span class="SpellE">Yatco</span>, a 1939 decision
during the Commonwealth, spoke to that effect.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a> Adherence
to such a view is reflected in the various cases decided after independence
before the <span class="GramE">Mobil Exploration case.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
The classic formulation of Holmes of this doctrine of non-suability thus bears
restatement:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"A sovereign is exempt
from suit, not because of any formal conception or obsolete theory, but on the
logical and practical ground that there can be no legal right as against the
authority that makes the law on which the right depends."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This is not to deny that while indeed logical and far from im足practical
the doctrine does give rise to problems considering how widely immersed in
matters hitherto deemed outside its sphere the government is at present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor is it likely considering its expanding
role, demanded by the times and warranted by the Constitution, that a halt
would be called to many of its activities, at times unavoidably adversely
affecting private rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, a
continued ad足herence to the doctrine of non-suability is not to be deplored for
as against the inconvenience that may be caused private parties, the loss of
governmental efficiency and the obstacle to the performance of its multifarious
functions are far greater if such a fundamental principle were abandoned and
the availability of judicial remedy were not thus restricted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the well known propensity on the part of
our people to go to court, at the least provocation, the loss of time and
energy required to defend against law suits, in the absence of such a basic
principle that constitutes such an effective obstacle, could very well be
imagined.</p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, in case of a money claim arising from contract,
express or implied, which could serve as a basis for civil action between
private parties, such a consent has been given by a statute enacted by the
Philippine legislature, even before the Constitution took effect and still
applicable at present.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
The procedure provided for in such a statute<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
was made more expeditious by a Commonwealth Act, enabling the party or entity,
who feels aggrieved by the final decision of the Auditor General required to
decide the claim within sixty days, having the right to go to this Court for
final adjudication.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
It is worthy of note likewise that in the pursuit of its activities affecting
business, the government has increasingly relied on private corporations
possessing the power to sue and be sued.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus the doctrine of non-suability of the government without its
consent, as it has operated in practice, hardly lends itself to the charge that
it could be the fruitful parent of injustice, con足sidering the vast and
ever-widening scope of state activities at present being undertaken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whatever difficulties for private claimants
may still <span class="GramE">exist,</span> is, from an objective appraisal of
all factors, minimal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the balancing
of interests, so unavoidable in the determination of what principles must
prevail if government is to satisfy the public weal, the verdict must be, as it
has been these so many years, for its continuing recognition as a funda足mental
postulate of constitutional law.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order of dismissal of the lower court of
May 23, 1966 is affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">With costs against plaintiff-appellant.</span></p>
