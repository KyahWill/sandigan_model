<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petitioner is a first grade civil 
service eligible who on </span><st1:date month="3" day="24" year="1953"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">March 24, 
1953</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> was 
appointed Chairman of the Board of Special Inquiry of the Bureau of Immigration 
pursuant to Section 27 (a) of Commonwealth Act 613. The appointment contains a 
proviso that it may be terminated anytime, "without any proceedings", at the 
pleasure of the President of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. This position was later 
classified by the WAPCO as Hearing Officer II, Range 39.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date month="1" day="23" year="1962"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">January 23, 
1962</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
petitioner was served by the Commissioner on Immigration with an <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> bearing the same date enclosing therewith a 
letter of Executive Secretary <span class="SpellE">Amelito</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span> and another from Secretary of Justice Jose W. <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span> advising him that his appointment as such has been 
terminated effective immediately by the President of the 
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. Upon receiving such advice, 
petitioner asked the President to have his decision terminating his appointment 
reconsidered inviting attention to the fact that his separation was effected 
summarily, without cause, without any charge previously filed against him, and 
without the benefit of any hearing, in violation of the safeguards that are 
extended to an employee of the government by our Constitution and our Civil 
Service Law. And when this step failed, he commenced the present petition for 
quo <span class="SpellE">warranto</span> directly before this Court seeking h 
reinstatement to his former position with payment of salaries from 
</span><st1:date month="1" day="23" year="1962"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">January 23, 
1962</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
date of his separation, to his actual reinstatement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This petition was given due 
course and, in due time, respondents filed their answer stating the reason 
justifying the separation of petitioner from the service.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petitioner was admitted to the 
Philippine bar on </span><st1:date month="12" day="21" year="1948"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 21, 
1948</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. He 
began serving the government way back in July, 1941, as a mere clerk in the 
immigration On </span><st1:date month="8" day="2" year="1944"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">August 2, 
1944</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, he 
was appointed acting immigration inspector, and on </span><st1:date month="3" day="22" year="1953"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">March 
22, 1953</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
he was promoted to the position of Chairman of the Board of Special Inquiry of 
the Bureau of Immigration. On </span><st1:date month="11" day="25" year="1957"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">November 25, 
1957</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
such position was classified by the WAPCO as Hearing Officer II Range 39. He 
discharged the duties of this office until </span><st1:date month="1" day="23" year="1962"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">January 23, 
1962</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
when he was notified by the Immigration Commissioner that his services in the 
government have been terminated, effective immediately, by the President of the 
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petitioner now contends that his 
appointment as Chairman of the Board of Special Inquiry of the Bureau of 
Immigration cannot be terminated without cause and without due process because 
(1) he is a civil service eligible; (2) his appointment, though terminable at 
the pleasure of the President, should be construed in the light of the Civil 
Service Act of 1959; (3) he is exercising quasi-judicial powers; and (4) the 
classification made by the WAPCO of his position has the effect of giving 
permanence to his tenure.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petitioner's status of being a 
civil service eligible cannot be made use of by him as an armor to protect him 
against any action that the appointing power may want to take in connection with 
his appointment it having been made in pursuance of Section 27(a) of 
Commonwealth Act No. 613 which makes the appointee "removable at (his) 
pleasure." In fact, his appointment contains the following proviso; that it may 
be terminated anytime, without any proceedings, at the pleasure of the President 
of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. It may, therefore, be said 
that, though not technically a temporary appointment, as this term is used in 
Section 24 (b) of the Civil Service Act of 1959, petitioner's appointment in 
essence is temporary because of its character that it is terminable at the 
pleasure of the appointing power. Being temporary in nature, the appointment can 
be terminated at a moment's notice without need to show cause as required in 
appointments that belong to the classified service. Thus, in <span class="SpellE">Cuadra</span> vs. Cordova, 103 Phil. 391, we 
held:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"* * * His appointment being 
temporary does not give him any definite tenure of office but makes it dependent 
upon the plea' sure of the appointing power. A temporary appointment is similar 
to one made in acting capacity, the essence of which lies in its temporary 
character and its <span class="SpellE">terminability</span> by the appointing 
power. And one who bears such, an appointment cannot complain if it is 
terminated at a moment's notice." <o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petitioner's appointment being 
temporary, it can be terminated at .pleasure even if he is a civil service 
eligible<span class="GramE">.<sup><span style="color: red;">[</span></sup></span><sup><span style="color: red;">1]</span></sup> And this holds true notwithstanding his badge 
of eligibility for, having accepted a temporary appointment, he cannot invoke 
the security of tenure guaranteed by our Constitution<sup><span style="color: red;">[2]</span></sup> In fine, to him cannot apply the safeguard 
embodied in Section 32 of the Civil Service Act. of 1959 which provides : "No 
officer or employee in the civil service shall be removed or suspended except 
for cause as provided by law and after due process."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petitioner's claim that as 
Chairman of the Board of Special Inquiry he exercises quasi-judicial powers 
which give him some stability in his tenure is of no moment, for what 
characterizes the security of tenure is not the nature of one's duties or 
functions but the nature of the appointment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The Reorganization Act of 1954 
which gives to the WAPCO the necessary authority to undertake the classification 
of those who are in the government service does not authorize the latter to 
change the nature of appointments from temporary to permanent. Neither Republic 
Act 997 nor any executive order issued to implement the Reorganization Plan give 
such authority. As a matter of fact, in Executive Order No. 279 issued on 
</span><st1:date month="11" day="7" year="1957"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">November 7, 
1957</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the 
WAPCO was merely charged with the responsibility of "enforcing all laws, rules 
and regulations governing appointments and promotions pursuant to the 
classification and compensation plans and other salary laws" (53 <span class="GramE">Off</span>. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Gaz</span></span><span class="GramE">., 8339).</span> And the law 
governing- the appointment of petitioner is Section 27 (a) of Commonwealth Act 
No. 613 which, as above stated, makes petitioner's appointment "removable at 
pleasure." <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">WHEREFORE</span></strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, petition is dismissed. No 
costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
