				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On March 30, 1978, the Office of the President referred to this Court
a letter addressed to the President, dated March 15, 1978, and signed by Ms. Fe
<span class="SpellE">Bron</span> of <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> City, charging
respondent with having mortgaged a typewriter of the government with the
management of the Fiesta Hotel, <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> City, which she
was able to do because she is the "<span class="SpellE">querida</span>"
of the present judge of the said court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The letter was in turn referred by this Court to the Hon. <span class="SpellE">Moises</span> <span class="SpellE">Kallos</span>, District Judge,

1978, with the request that he look into the matters alleged therein and to
submit a written report thereon as soon as possible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judge <span class="SpellE">Kallos</span> has
submitted the required report, the pertinent portions of which read:</p>

handwritten letter of a certain Fe <span class="SpellE">Bron</span>, an Office
MEMORANDUM was issued to Atty. German Mata, Clerk of Court of the Circuit Criminal

about the typewriter mentioned in the letter, of which the present Presiding
Judge <span class="SpellE">Moises</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Kallos</span> has
never had any knowledge of (Annex '1') and Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Adoracion</span>
Delis was at the same time furnished copy of the letter-complaint, requiring
her to file her answer <i><span style="">within 24
hours</span></i><span style=""> </span>and whether she
would prefer a formal investigation regarding the matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Annex '2') At the same time, in an <span style="">effort of </span>the undersigned Presiding
Judge of the CCC to clear his name from the <i><span style="">malicious </span>and libelous</i> imputations in the said letter and
vindicate his name and reputation, SUBPOENAS were issued by him personally to
the following persons after docketing with the records of the CCC as

Hotel Manager &amp; owner of the Fiesta Hotel, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Naga</span></span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
was served and appeared on <st1:date year="1978" day="24" month="4">April 24,

stand and the transcript <span style="">of </span>his
testimony is found on pages 1 to 8, of Annex '12'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He admitted that the hotel has in its
possession a typewriter which was retained together with other personal effects
of <span class="SpellE">Adoracion</span> Delis due to her failure to settle her
hotel bills amounting to <i>P1,778.00</i> in the year 1974, when she stayed
there while serving as <i>COURT STENOGRAPHER</i> of the CCC during the SPECIAL
TERM of former Presiding Judge of the CCC then, Judge Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Payumo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Up to the
date of the investigation, <st1:date year="1978" day="24" month="4">April 24,
 1978</st1:date>, the bills of <span class="SpellE">Adoracion</span> Delis have
not been paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mr. <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>
could not bring the typewriter with him then as he wanted to ask the Court
assistance so that there should be somebody present when the cartons of Mrs.
Delis would be opened, least she should claim the loss of anything inside.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Court entered an order directing the Deputy Sheriff of the CCC
to proceed to <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> City with Mr. Antonio <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> the same day and get the help of a policeman of <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> City to witness the taking of the typewriter so it
could be identified whether it is the one owned by the government, which order
is Annex '9'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Deputy Sheriff Rodolfo M. <span class="SpellE">Espartinez</span> returned to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
bringing along a TRIUMPH (MATURA 30) typewriter, Made <span style="">in </span><st1:place>Western Germany</st1:place>, SERIAL NOS.
8537821-A-811-43498-1 etc., color GRAY, which tallied with the missing
typewriter of the CCC and not in use since 1974 by the Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A proper receipt was issued to Mr. Antonio <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, Manager of Fiesta Hotel, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Naga</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
which is attached as Annex '11' and marked Exhibit 'A' in the investigation.</blockquote>

retired deputy clerk of court, appeared on <st1:date year="1978" day="24" month="4">April 24, 1978</st1:date> in obedience to a subpoena issued by the
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His testimony appears on pages 8
to 12 of Annex '12'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mr. <span class="SpellE">Altea</span> informed the Court that this TRIUMPH typewriter was
brought to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Naga</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> in the year 1974 by the CCC,
when then Judge Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Payumo</span> held special term
there for more than six months.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
used by Stenographer <span class="SpellE">Adoracion</span> J. Delis, who was one
of the two stenographers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mr. <span class="SpellE">Altea</span> was sent by the Court to the Fiesta Hotel in 1974 to
get the typewriter but <span style="">the </span>management
did not give the machine because the hotel wanted to hold the typewriter as
security for the hotel bills of <span class="SpellE">Adoracion</span> <span style="">J. </span>Delis, which she said would be
settled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No further action was taken by
the Court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The following question was propounded by the present Presiding
Judge <span style="">of </span>the CCC to Mr. <span class="SpellE">Altea</span> and his answer is as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>'Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
the incumbency of the present Presiding Judge from the time he assumed office
on March 18, 1976, would you explain to us what - why this matter was never
brought to the attention of the Presiding Judge officially about the missing
typewriter so that action could have been taken thereon earlier?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
have called the attention of my chief, <span style="">Atty.
</span>German Mata about the typewriter but he told that he will try his best
to let Mrs. Delis return that equipment to the office.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The case was called again for summary investigation
on <st1:date year="1978" day="25" month="4">April 25, 1978</st1:date> at <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9:00 A.M.</st1:time> Respondent Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Adoracion</span>
Delis was not in Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Deputy Sheriff
Rodolfo M. <span class="SpellE">Espartinez</span> and Atty. German Mata, Clerk of
Court were called to the witness stand.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Their testimonies as transcribed can be found on pages 1 to 6 of Annex
'13'.</blockquote>

<blockquote>After the typewriter was brought to Court and duly identified as the
property of the government, the Court entered the following order on <st1:date year="1978" day="25" month="4">April 25, 1978</st1:date>:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'The Court is satisfied from the evidence before it that the
typewriter which was taken <span style="">from </span>the
Fiesta Hotel yesterday pursuant to the order of this Court is the very typewriter
of the CCC which in the letter-complaint sent to the President has been
mortgaged by Respondent <span class="SpellE">Adoracion</span> J. Delis with the
Fiesta Hotel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It turned out from the
testimony of the owner of the Hotel that this typewriter was among the personal
effects of the Respondent <span class="SpellE">Adoracion</span> J. Delis which
was retained in the hotel in view of the failure of Mrs. Delis to settle her
hotel bills amounting to P1,778.10 during her stay with the hotel during the
period when respondent was acting as Stenographer of the CCC (1974).</p>

<p class="2Q">ACCORDINGLY, considering that this typewriter is a government property
which is among the property responsibility of the Clerk of Court to the Supreme
Court, the said typewriter is hereby ordered to be kept with the CCC in <span class="SpellE">Legazpi</span> City for its use, reserving to the owner of the
Hotel the right to institute the corresponding criminal charges against the
Respondent <span class="SpellE">Adoracion</span> J. Delis for her failure to pay
her hotel bills despite the fact that for her stay in the hotel at <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> City in 1974 she has not settled her accountability up
to the present.</p>

<p class="2Q">The case therefore is submitted for corresponding resolution and report
to the Supreme Court for such administrative action that the Supreme Court may
take against the Respondent Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Adoracion</span> J. Delis.'</p>

<blockquote>Mr. Antonio <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> of the Fiesta
Hotel arrived in Court about <st1:time minute="0" hour="11">11:00 A.M.</st1:time>
on <st1:date year="1978" day="25" month="4">April 25, 1978</st1:date> and he
was informed that the investigation was already terminated by the Court and
that the typewriter will have to be taken by the CCC as government property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He offered no objection but said that he
would just press his case to recover the amount long unpaid by <span class="SpellE">Adoracion</span> J. Delis.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Respondent <span class="SpellE">Adoracion</span> J. Delis also came
to Court at about the same time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She has
not filed any answer to the charge, Annex '2'.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It would seem that she simply does not care.</blockquote>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">CONCLUSION &amp; RECOMMENDATION<o:p></o:p></span></u></p>

<blockquote>The typewriter subject of the letter was with the FIESTA HOTEL
since the year 1974, during the incumbency of Judge Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Payumo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judge <span class="SpellE">Moises</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Kallos</span> only became the CCC Judge the latter part of March
1976, after his transfer from the CFI, Branch III of DAET, and did not come to
know about this machine except when he received the 1st <span class="SpellE">Indorsement</span>
of the SC of <st1:date year="1978" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1978</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Adoracion</span> J. Delis never reported to
the present Presiding Judge of the CCC the whereabouts of this typewriter since
March 1976 to date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her misfeasance has
prejudiced the government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her failure
to pay her hotel bills at the Fiesta Hotel despite the fact that official records
of the Supreme Court must indubitably show that she had long collected the per
diems and allowances for her stay as Court Stenographer of the <span style="">CCC </span>in the year 1974 is clearly a <i>criminal
act</i> punishable by Article 315, Par. 2(e) of the Revised Penal Code
(SWINDLING).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a crime against
property, it carries <i>moral turpitude.</i><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The act is aggravated by the fact that she committed it as an employee
of the Supreme Court, which granted her per diems and allowances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She has been able to get accommodation
because of her known employment to the management.</blockquote>

<blockquote>She is not only an undesirable employee within the meaning of LOI
13 and 13-A, but has violated our penal law.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Adoracion</span> J. Delis is therefore
recommended for <i><span style="">immediate dismissal</span>
</i>from the service." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 4-8)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As can be gathered from the foregoing report, respondent Delis,
in her capacity as stenographer of the Circuit Criminal Court, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Legazpi</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
was <span style="">issued by said court a typewriter,
Matura </span>30 (Triumph), German make, with Serial No. 8537821.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When <span style="">the
</span>Circuit Criminal Court held a special term in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Naga</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
in 1974, respondent brought with her the typewriter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Naga</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
she was billeted in the Fiesta Hotel.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For her stay in the hotel <span style="">during
</span>that special term, she accumulated unpaid <span style="">hotel bills <span class="SpellE">totalling</span> </span>P1,778.10.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As she could not pay <span style="">the bills at </span>the end of the term, <span style="">she left the type</span>writer with the hotel management and the latter
retained it together with her personal belongings as security for the payment
of her hotel bills.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since 1974 the
typewriter <span style="">remained </span>in the
possession of the hotel management until <st1:date year="1978" day="24" month="4">April 24, 1978</st1:date> when it was taken <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
by Deputy Sheriff Rodolfo M. <span class="SpellE">Espartinez</span> upon order of
the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent's hotel bills,
however, remained unpaid.</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing facts clearly demonstrate respondent's
irresponsibility and grave misconduct.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Every public officer is bound to use reasonable skill and diligence in
the performance of his official duties.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He is bound, <span class="SpellE"><i>virtuite</i></span> <span class="SpellE"><i><span style="">offici</span></i></span><i><span style="">. </span></i>to bring to the discharge of his
duties that prudence, caution and attention which careful men usually exercise
in the management of their affairs.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
There is no question that the failure of a respondent to comply with the laws
governing and regulating his powers and duties, may subject him to criminal and
administrative sanctions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here,
respondent knowingly or negligently failed to comply with her duty of returning
the typewriter to the court and to pay her bills.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> respondent is found guilty of grave misconduct,
dishonesty and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service and is
hereby ordered DISMISSED from the service effective upon her receipt of a copy
of this decision.</p>
