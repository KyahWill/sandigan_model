in Case No. 582 of the Court of First <span style="">In­stance
</span>of <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> del Norte, from a decision thereof
granting the writ of certiorari therei<span style="">n
prayed for.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Said case had been instituted against <span class="SpellE">Palarca</span>
<span style="">because, </span>as Judge of<span style=""> </span>the Municipal <span style="">Court </span>of <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span> City, he had <span style="">denied a motion </span>to quash, filed by the
petitioner in <span style="">the aforementioned</span>
certiorari proceeding, Mateo J. <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Pabulario</span></span><span style="">, </span><span style="">as </span>defendant in <span style="color: windowtext;">Criminal
Case No. 1509-AF of said municipal court, the information therein alleging:</span><i style=""><span style="color: windowtext;"><o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"That on or about </span><st1:date year="1961" day="26" month="7"><span class="GramE">July 26, 1961</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, in the City of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Iligan</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span class="GramE">, </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="GramE">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span class="GramE">, and within the juris­diction of this Honorable Court, the said
accused, being then the chauffeur and person in charge of a truck bearing Plate
No.</span> T-9000 and owned by one <span class="SpellE">Luois</span> Lee, did
then and there <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>, un­lawfully and feloniously
drive and operate the said truck while passing along the intersection of <span class="SpellE">Sabayle</span> and Luna Streets, this city in a negligent,
careless and imprudent manner, without due regard to traffic laws, regulations
and ordinances and without taking the necessary pre­caution to prevent
accident, to persons and dam­age to property, causing by such negligence,
carelessness and imprudence, said truck driven and operated by him to bump and
hit a passenger jeep bearing Plate No. AC-4528, driven and operated by one <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> <span class="SpellE">Ermac</span> and owned by one
Carlos <span class="SpellE">Suband</span>, thereby causing actual damages to the
said passenger jeep in the total amount of P397.00, Philippine Currency, and
causing physical injuries to the following per­sons who were passengers of the
said passenger jeep, to wit:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Physical injury to one <span class="SpellE">Maemona</span> <span class="SpellE">Dinal</span> de <span class="SpellE">Panandegan</span>, a passenger
of the jeep, to wit:</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Very slight bluish discoloration on left
arm near the anterior part of elbow, which injury will require medical
attendance for a period of from two (2) to three (3) days.</span></blockquote>

prejudice of the said Carlos <span class="SpellE">Subang</span> in the aforesaid
sum of P397.00, Phil­ippine Currency.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Contrary to <span style="">and in violation </span>of Article <span style="">365 in relation with Article 266 of the Revised Penal Code."</span></span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="GramE">as</span> well as <span class="SpellE">Pabulario’s</span> a motions to reconsider the order denying said
motion to quash.</p>

<p class="BODY">The latter was predicated upon the theory that said information
charged more than one offense, namely, that of dam­age to property through
reckless imprudence and that of multi­ple slight physical injuries, likewise,
through reckless im­prudence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Pabulario’s</span> petition for certiorari in case No. 582 was, in
turn, anchored upon the proposition that said municipal court of <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span> City is without jurisdiction to hear the aforemen­tioned
Criminal Case No. 1509-Af, and that the order of Judge <span class="SpellE">Palarca</span>
denying said motion to quash and <span class="SpellE">Pabulario’s</span> motions
for reconsideration are null and void.</p>

<p class="BODY">Inasmuch as the decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> del Norte sustained the foregoing contention of <span class="SpellE">Pabu­lario</span>, respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Palarca</span>
interposed the present appeal, which we find to be well taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The issue in the case at bar is substantially
identical to that decided in People vs. Cano,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
in which we held:</p>

<blockquote>"The order appealed from is predicated upon the theory that
the offense of slight physi­cal injuries thru reckless negligence cannot be <span class="SpellE">complexed</span> with that of damage to property with multiple
physical injuries thru reckless im­prudence, because ‘misdemeanor’ may not,
under Article 48 of the Revised Penal Code, be <span class="SpellE">complexed</span>
with grave or less grave fel<span style="color: windowtext;">onies</span><i style=""><span style="color: windowtext;">.<o:p></o:p></span></i></blockquote>

<blockquote>"However, the information herein does not purport to complex
the offense of slight phy­sical injuries with reckless imprudence with that of
damage to property and serious and less serious physical injuries thru reckless
impru­dence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is merely alleged in the
information that, thru reckless negligence of the defendant, the bus driven by
him hit another bus causing upon some of its passengers serious physical
injuries, upon others less serious physical in­juries and upon still others
slight physical injuries, in addition to damage to property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Ap­pellee</span> and the
lower court have seemingly pre­sumed that said information thereby charges two
offenses, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) slight physical in­juries
thru reckless imprudence and (2) dam­age to property, and serious and less
serious physical injuries, thru reckless negligence -- which are sought to be <span class="SpellE">complexed</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This as­sumption
is, in turn, apparently premised upon the predicate that the effect or
consequence of defendant's negligence, not the neg­ligence itself, is the
principal or vital factor in said offenses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such predicate is not alto­gether accurate.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"As early as <st1:date month="7" day="28" year="1955">July 28,
 1955</st1:date>, this Court, speaking thru Mr. Justice J. B. L. Reyes, had the
occasion to state, in <span class="SpellE">Quizon</span> vs. Justice of the Peace
of <span class="SpellE">Bacolor</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> (G. R.
No. L­-6641), that:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'The proposition (inferred from Art. 3 of the Revised Penal Code)
that ‘”reckless imprudence’” is not a crime in itself but simply a way of
committing <span style="font-size: 12pt; color: windowtext;">it
</span><span style="color: windowtext;">and merely determines ‘”lower de­cree of
criminal liability”’ is too broad to deserve unqualified assent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are crimes that by their structure can
not be committed through imprudence:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>murder, treason, robbery, malicious mischief, etc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In truth, criminal neg­ligence in our Revised
Penal Code is treated as a mere quasi-offense, and dealt separately from
willful offenses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not a mere
question of classifica­tion or terminology.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In international crimes, the act itself is punished; in negligence or
imprudence, what is prin­cipally penalized is the mental attitude or condition
behind the act, the danger­ous recklessness, lack of care or fore­sight; the
"<span class="SpellE">imprudencia</span> <span class="SpellE">punible</span>".
<span class="GramE">Much of the confusion has arisen from the com­mon use of such
descriptive phrases as "’homicide through reckless imprudence'" and
the like; when the strict technical of­fense is, more accurately
"’reckless imprudence resulting in homicide’;” or "'simple imprudence
causing damages to property'."</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">'Were criminal negligence but a mo­dality in the commission of
felonies, ope­rating only to reduce the penalty <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>,
then it would be absorbed in the mitigating circumstances of Art. <span class="GramE">13, specially the lack of intent to commit so grave a wrong as the
one actually committed.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, the theory would require that the corresponding penalty
should be fixed in proportion to the penalty prescribed for each crime when
committed <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For each penalty for <span style="">the </span><span class="SpellE">wilful</span> offense, there would then be a corresponding penalty
for the negligence variety.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But instead,
our Revised Penal Code (Art. 365) fixes the <span style="color: windowtext;">penalty for reckless
imprudence at <span class="SpellE">arresto</span> mayor maximum to <span class="SpellE">prision</span> <span class="SpellE">correccional</span> minimum if
the <span class="SpellE">wilful</span> act would constitute a grave felony,
notwithstanding that the penalty for the latter could range all the way from <span class="SpellE">prision</span> mayor to death, according to the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It can be seen that the actual penalty for
criminal negligence bears no relation to the individual <span class="SpellE">wilful</span>
crime, but is set in relation to a whole class, or </span><span style="color: windowtext;">series </span><span style="color: windowtext;">of crimes.’</span><i style=""><span style="color: windowtext;"><o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<blockquote>"Thirdly, <span style="">regardl</span>ess of whether the <span style="">i</span>ssue
adverted to above should be decided in <span style="">the
affir</span>ma<span style="">tive
or </span>in the negative, the proper procedure for the lower court was to
reserve the resolution there<span style="">of </span>until after the case has been heard on the merits, when
decision is rendered thereon, there being no question that the court has
jurisdiction and can pro­<span style="">perly </span>try the defendant for damage to property and <span style="">serious or less </span>serious
physical injuries thru reck­less negligence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It may not be amiss to add that the purpose of Article 48 of the Revised
Penal Code in <span class="SpellE">complexing</span> several felonies resulting
from a single act; or one which is a necessary means to <span style="">commit </span>another, is to favor the accused by prescribing the
imposition of the penalty for the most serious crime, instead of the penalties
for each of the aforesaid crimes, which, put together may be graver than the
penalty for the most serious offense.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Fourthly, from the viewpoint both of trial practice and justice,
it <span style="">is, </span>to
say the least, doubt<span style="">ful </span>whether
the prosecution should split the action against the defendant, by filing
against him several <span class="SpellE">informations</span>, namely, one for
damage to property and serious and less serious physical injuries thru reckless
negligence, before the court of first instance, and another for slight physical
injuries thru reckless negligence, before the justice of the peace or municipal
courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One <span style="">thing is, </span>however, certain.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such splitting of the action would work unne<span style="">cessary </span><span style="">inconv</span>enience to the administration of
justice in general and to the accused in particular, for it would require the
presentation of substantially the same evidence before two <span style="">different </span>courts, the municipal court
and the court of first instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Worse
still, in the event of conviction in the municipal court, and appeal to the <span style="">court </span>of first Instance, said evidence
would still have to be introduced once more in the latter court.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Herein petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> has not
advanced any reason, and we find none, to warrant a departure from the
foregoing ruling.</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be noted, also, that, assuming for the sake of argument
only, that <span style="">the </span>information under
consideration alleges two (2) different and separate offenses, it does not
follow that the municipal court of <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span> City had no
jurisdiction to hear the aforementioned Criminal Case No. 1509-AF, inasmuch as
the offense of damage to property amounting to P397.00, through reckless
negligence, and that of multiple slight physical injuries, through reckless
negligence, above referred to, <span style="">are </span>within
the jurisdiction of said court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again,
the order denying the motion to quash and the orders denying the motions for
reconsideration, even if hypothetically erro­neous, were not null and
void."</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from is here­by reversed <span style="">and </span>another
one shall be entered dismissing the petition in said Case No. 582 of the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> del Norte, and denying the
writ therein prayed, with costs against petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
