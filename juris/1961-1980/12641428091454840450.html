Pineda.</p>
<p>Complainant alleged that a few months before December 1941, Benjamin B. 
Pineda had been expelled as member the Bar; that notwithstanding such 
disbarment, Pineda continue to practice law; that in 1953, said Pineda was 
convicted, by final judgment, of the crime of robbery; that although President 
Magsaysay pardoned him conditionally, such pardon did not blot out the stain of 
moral misconduct. So, complainant prayed for action for contempt or for a new 
disbarment, if after 1941, said Pineda had been reinstated to membership of the 
Bar.</p>
<p>The matter was referred to the Solicitor-General, whose report filed later 
and in due course, recommended that respondent should only be "warned not to 
practice law again." Such recommendation rested on his finding that Pineda 
continued to practice law in Jolo during the latter part of 1941 (i.e., after he 
had been disbarred in July 1940)-but that no evidence proved legal practice by 
respondent after 1941.</p>
<p>Our records do not show that Pineda has never been readmitted to the Bar.</p>
<p>Now, considering that 1941 is too far away, we approve the recommendation; 
and the respondent is accordingly warned not to engage in the legal profession 
again, until he is regularly re-admitted thereto. Needless to say, practice of 
law by one who is disbarred constitutes contempt of court.
