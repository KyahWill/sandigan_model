				G.R. No. L-15764, May 19, 1961</h4>
				<H3>IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF ROBERTO ONG TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES.<BR>ROBERTO ONG, PETITIONER AND APPELLEE, VS. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, OPPOSITOR AND APPELLANT.
<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a decision of the Court of First Instance of La Union, 
Hon. Jose P. Flores, presiding, finding Roberto Ong, qualified for 
naturalization as citizen of the Philippines, as he possesses all the 
qualifications and none of the disqualifications to become a Filipino 
citizen.
<p>In his appeal the Solicitor General claims the applicant does not possess the 
qualifications for Philippine citizenship because he failed to prove that he 
owns properties worth P6,000, as alleged in his petition, and because he lacks a 
lucrative trade, profession, or lawful occupation.</p>
<p>An examination of the record discloses that in his petition filed on March 1, 
1958, he declared that he is a fourth year high school student eligible for 
graduation in March, 1958. Perhaps, finding that the facts would not qualify him 
for naturalization, he filed an amended petition on April 22, 1958, claiming 
that he was a salesman in a rice and furniture store which belongs to his 
family, from which he derives an income of P130.00 a month, and that he has 
property worth P6,000.00. His supposed employment is corroborated by his 
sister's unsworn statement to the effect that he is actually receiving a salary 
of P130.00 a month since April, 1958. The fact that the applicant was graduated 
only in March, 1958 and admitted being a student in Manila in the first semester 
of the school year 1958-59 contradict his supposed employment in his sister's 
store since April, 1958. Apart from the fact that the statement of the sister 
regarding his supposed salary is not under oath and is furthermore hearsay, the 
evidence of his supposed employment is so flimsy and unbelievable as to merit no 
credence in a court of justice. Besides, we have held in a line of decisions 
that an applicant earning less than P250.00 a month is not considered as 
possessing the necessary lucrative trade or profession, in view of the present 
high cost of living. (Swee Din Tan <i>vs</i>. Republic, 109 Phil., 287, Republic 
<i>vs</i>. Lim, L-3030, January 31, 1951; Pang Kok Hua <i>vs</i>. Republic, 91 
Phil., 254).</p>
<p>As to his statement that he has real property worth P6,000, no credible 
evidence was presented in support thereof. We have only his own testimony to 
that effect. He declared that the only property he has is a residential house, 
which evidently is the house where he and his parents live and which should 
belong to the latter. If he is the owner of real property, he would have been 
able to present the corresponding tax declaration thereof in his name, or the 
tax receipts thereof, and he would have been able to explain how he acquired the 
same.</p>
<p>For the foregoing considerations, we find that even If the petitioner 
possesses the other qualifications, he has failed to prove that he has a 
lucrative trade or profession or that he has property of a substantial amount, 
within the contemplation of Section 2, par. 4 of the Revised Naturalization Law 
(Commonwealth Act No. 473.)</p>
<p>Wherefore, the judgment appealed from is hereby reversed and the petition for 
naturalization dismissed, with costs against the 
petitioner-appellee.</p><i>Bengzon, C.J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, 
Reyes, J.B.L., Paredes, Dizon, De Leon,</i> and <i>Natividad, JJ.,</i>
