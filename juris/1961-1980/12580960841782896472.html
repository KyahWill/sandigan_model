				<H3>[WITH RESOLUTION OF FEBRUARY 26, 1962]<BR><BR>THE COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE (NOW COMMISSIONER), PETITIONER, VS. ALBERTO D. BENIPAYO, RESPONDENT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>DIZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal taken by the Collector of Internal Revenue from the 
decision of the Court of Tax Appeals dated January 23, 1948, reversing the one 
rendered by the former, thereby relieving respondent Alberto D. Benipayo from 
the payment of the deficiency amusement tax assessed against him in the total 
amount of P12,093.45.
<p>Respondent is the owner and operator of the Lucena Theater located in the 
municipality of Lucena, Quezon. On October 3, 1953 Internal Revenue Agent Romeo 
de Guia investigated respondent's amusement tax liability in connection with the 
operation of said theater during the period from August, 1952 to September, 
1953. On October 15, 1953 De Guia submitted his report to the Provincial Revenue 
Agent to the effect that respondent had disproportionately issued tax-free 
20-centavo children's tickets. His finding was that during the years 1949 to 
1951 the average ratio of adults and children patronizing the Lucena Theater was 
3 to 1, i.e., for every three adults entering the theater, one child was also 
admitted, while during the period in question, the proportion was reversedâ€”three 
children to one adult. From this he concluded that respondent must have 
fraudulently sold two tax-free 20-centavo children's tickets to adult patrons 
instead of the 40-centavo tickets, in order to avoid payment of the amusement 
tax prescribed in Section 260 of the National Internal Revenue Code. Based on 
the average ratio between adult and children attendance in the past years, 
Examiner de Guia recommended a deficiency amusement tax assessment against 
respondent in the sum of 111,193.45, inclusive of 25 per cent surcharge, plus a 
suggested compromise penalty of P900.00 for violation of section 260 of the 
National Internal Revenue Code, or a total sum of P12,093.45, covering the 
period from August, 1952 to September, 1953, inclusive.</p>
<p>On July 14, 1964, petitioner issued a deficiency amusement tax assessment 
against respondent, demanding from the latter the payment of the total sum of 
P12,152.93 within thirty days from receipt thereof. On August 16, 1954, 
respondent filed the corresponding protest with the Conference Staff of the 
Bureau of Internal Revenue. After due hearing, the Conference Staff submitted to 
petitioner Collector of Internal Revenue its finding to the effect that the 
"meager reports of these fieldmen (Examiner de Guia and the Provincial Revenue 
Agent of Quezon) are bare presumptions and conclusions, devoid of findings of 
fact, of the alleged fraudulent practices of the herein taxpayer" In view 
thereof, and as recommended by the Conference Staff, petitioner referred the 
case back to the Provincial Revenue Agent of Quezon for further investigation. 
The report submitted by Provincial Revenue Officer H. I. Bernardo after this 
last investigation partly reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The returns from July 1 to July 11, showed that 31.43 per cent of the entire 
audience of 12,754 consisted of adults, the remaining 68.57 per cent of 
children. During this said period due, perhaps, to the absence of agents in the 
premises, subject taxpayer was able to manipulate the issuance of tickets in the 
way and manner alleged in Asst. De Guia's indorsement report mentioned above. 
But during the period from July 14 to July 24, 1955, when agents of this Office 
supervised in the sales of admission tickets the sales for adults soared upwards 
to 76 per cent while that for children dropped correspondingly to 24 per 
cent.</p>
<p>"It is opined without fear of contradiction that the ratio of three (3) 
adults to every one (1) child in the audience or a proportion of 75:25 as 
reckoned in Asst. De Guia's indorsement report or this Office's new findings of 
a proportion of 76.24, represents or conveys the true picture of the situation 
under the law of averages, provided that the film being shown is not a 
children's show. There is no hard and fast rule in this regard, but this 
findings would seem to admit no contradiction.</p>
<p>"Please note that the new findings of this Office is not a <span style="font-style: italic;">direct</span> proof of 
what had transpired during the period investigated by Asst. De Guia and now 
pending before the Conference Staff", * * * (Exh. 3, BIR Record, pp. 
137-138).</p></blockquote>
<p>After considering said report, the Conference Staff of the Bureau of Internal 
Revenue recommended to the Collector of Internal Revenue the issuance of the 
deficiency amusement tax assessment in question.</p>
<p>The only issue in this appeal is whether or not there is sufficient evidence 
in the record showing that respondent, during the period under review, sold and 
issued to his adult customers two tax-free 20-centavo children's tickets , 
instead of one 40-centavo ticket for each adult customer, to cheat or 
defraud the Government.</p>
<p>On this question the Court of Tax Appeals said the following in the appealed 
decision:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"To our mind, the appealed decision has no factual basis and must be 
reversed. An assessment fixes and determines the tax liability of a taxpayer. As 
soon as it is served, an obligation arises on the part of the taxpayer concerned 
to pay the amount assessed and demanded. Hence, assessments should not be based 
on mere presumptions no matter how reasonable or logical said presumptions may 
be. Assuming <span style="font-style: italic;">arguendo</span> that the average ratio of adults and children patronising 
the Lucena Theater from 1949 to 1951 was 3 to 1, the same does not give rise to 
the inference that the same conditions existed during the years in question 
(1952 and 1953). The fact that almost the same ratio existed during the month of 
July, 1955 does not provide a sufficient inference on the conditions in 1952 and 
1953. * * *<br> </p>
<p>"In order to stand that test of judicial scrutiny, the assessment must be 
based on actual facts. The presumption of correctness of assessment being a mere 
presumption cannot be made to rest on another presumption that the circumstances 
in 1952 and 1953 are presumed to be the same as those existing in 1949 to 1951 
and July 1955. In the case under consideration there are no substantial facts to 
support the assessment in question. * * *." </p></blockquote>
<p>A review of the record has not disclosed anything sufficient to justify a 
reversal of the above finding made by the Court of Tax Appeals. It should be 
borne in mind that to sustain the deficiency tax assessed against respondent 
would amount, in effect, to a finding that he had, for a considerable period of 
time, cheated and defrauded the government by selling to each adult patron two 
children's tax-free tickets instead of one ticket subject to the amusement tax 
provided for in Section 260 of the National Internal Revenue Code. Fraud is a 
serious charge and, to be sustained, it must be supported by clear and 
convincing proof which, in the present case, is lacking.</p>
<p>The claim that respondent admitted having resorted to the anomalous practice 
already mentioned is not entirely correct. What respondent appears to have 
admitted was that during a certain limited period he had adopted a sort of 
rebate system applicable to cases where adults and children came in groups and 
were all charged 20 centavo admission tickets. This practice was, however, 
discontinued when he was informed by the Bureau of Internal Revenue that it was 
not in accordance with law.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the appealed judgment is hereby affirmed, with costs.</p> <i>Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., Barrera,
