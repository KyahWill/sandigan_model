(p. 5 of Respondents' Memorandum)<br><br>The petition was not served on the widow and ten children of Virgilio Valera.&nbsp; Celso Valera interposed an opposition to it on the ground that Francisco Valera had no interest in the Valera residence, that the property was never leased and that the remedy of Mrs. Bringas was "in a appropriate remedy and/or procedure" and not in the intestate proceeding.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>The lower court granted the petition in an order dated July 10, 1964 which reads:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><blockquote><center>"O R D E R</center><br>"The administratrix, through counsel, has petitioned for an order to pay rental on the property (Item 1-B, 23 of the Inventory submitted by the administratrix, pp. 415-416, rec.) owned in common by the estate of the deceased Francisco Valera y Versoza and late Virgilio Valera and Celso Valera, corresponding to one-third (1/3) interest pertaining to the estate of the deceased Francisco Valera to be paid by the family of Virgilio Valera and Celso Valera and family who have been occupying the property since April, 1945 in the amount of P100.00 a month, plus legal interest, the same to be paid to the Administratrix.<br><br>WHEREFORE, finding the said <i>motion</i> to be well-founded and meritorious, the same is hereby granted.&nbsp; It is further ordered that the Clerk of Court shall furnish Angelita Garduque Vda. de Valera with a copy of this order by registered mail."<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br>Done at Bangued, Abra, this 10th day of July, 1964.<br><br><table  ="" align="center" border="0" width="85%"> <tbody><tr> <td width="50%"><div align="center"></div></td> <td width="50%"><div align="center">(Sgd.)

Celso Valera was joined as a nominal party.&nbsp; The respondents were required to answer the petition.&nbsp; The Court directed that a writ of preliminary injunction should issue upon petitioners' posting a bond of P5,000.00.<br><br>The petitioners assail the brief, three-sentence order of July 10, 1964 on the following grounds:&nbsp; (a) that it decided the issue of ownership as to the one-third <span style="font-style: italic;">pro-indiviso</span> share of Francisco Valera in the Valera residence, an issue, which according to them, is beyond the court's probate jurisdiction; (b) that it was issued without the benefit of a trial on the merits and without hearing all the parties involved; (c) that it does not contain findings of fact and law; (d) that it is a judgment for a money claim which should have been filed in the proceedings for the settlement of the estate of the deceased debtor, Virgilio Valera, and (e) that the order has no basis in substantive law.<br><br>The petitioners attack Judge Ofilada's order of April 15, 1966 on the following grounds:&nbsp; (a) that, as a probate judge, he had no jurisdiction to require the heirs of Virgilio Valera to account for the fruits of the six parcels of land administered by him and that a separate action should be filed or the proper claim should be made against his estate; (b) that he had no jurisdiction to order the heirs of Virgilio Valera to deliver to Mrs. Bringas the sum of P4,784.98 as "insurance and war damage monies collected by Virgilio Valera"; (c) that Section 8, Rule 87 of the Rules of Court contemplates that "double the value of the fruits and monies" should be recovered in an "action" and not in an intestate proceeding, and (d) that the order was issued without any trial on the merits and it does not contain findings of fact and law.<br><br>The petitioners further contend that the orders of July 10, 1964 and April 15, 1966 are not enforceable by execution because they are incomplete and not precise as to the amounts supposedly due from the judgment debtors.<br><br>As to the execution sale, the petitioners contend:&nbsp; (a) that the orders sought to be executed are void; (b) that the probate court ordinarily has no jurisdiction to issue a writ of execution and that the instant case is not among the exceptional cases wherein the probate court can authorize an execution, and (c) that execution for a money claim cannot be had against a decedent's estate.<br><br>After a careful study of the arguments of the parties in their memoranda, reply, rejoinder and sur-rejoinder, We find that, for the resolution of the case, it is not necessary to pass upon all those issues.&nbsp; The crucial issue in the last analysis is whether the lower court, sitting as a probate court in the intestate proceeding for the estate of Francisco Valera, could hold the heirs of Virgilio Valera answerable for certain supposed monetary liabilities of the latter to the estate and enforce said liabilities against the properties of the deceased Virgilio Valera.<br><br>We hold that the trial court, as a probate court, erred in adjudging in the said intestate proceeding the monetary liabilities of the late Virgilio Valera to the estate of Francisco Valera and in issuing a writ of execution against his properties to enforce the supposed liabilities.<br><br>The controlling principle, which should govern this case, was announced by Justice Torres in 1907 in Pavia vs. De la Rosa, 8 Phil. 70, a case which is on all fours with the instant case.&nbsp; This Court ruled in that case:<br><blockquote>"<i>Administrators or executors; Code of Civil Procedure; Heirs.</i>&nbsp; – The heir legally succeeds the deceased from whom he derives his right and title but only after the liquidation of the estate, the payment of the debts of same, and the adjudication of the residue of the estate of the deceased, and in the meantime the only person in charge by law to attend to all claims against the estate of the deceased debtor is the executor or administrator appointed by a competent court." (Syllabus based on page 77).</blockquote>In the <i>Pavia</i> case, an action for damages was brought by Rafaela Pavia against Bibiana de la Rosa and Salud de la Rosa, as the only heirs of the deceased Jose de la Rosa.&nbsp; Rafaela Pavia claimed that she empowered Jose de la Rosa to administer the estate of Pablo Linart and that, as administrator, De la Rosa caused damages to the estate through his negligence.&nbsp; The De la Rosa sisters contended that they could not be held liable for the negligent acts of their brother, Jose de la Rosa.<br><br>This Court held that the action was not maintainable against the De la Rosa sisters and that it should be prosecuted against the executor or administrator of the estate of Jose de la Rosa.&nbsp; Hence, the action was dismissed, reserving to Rafaela Pavia "the right to institute proper action against the executor or administrator of the properties of the estate of the deceased Jose de la Rosa".<br><br>In the instant case, Mrs. Bringas sought to hold the heirs of the deceased Virgilio Valera liable for his obligations to pay rentals and to account for the fruits of the properties forming part of the estate of Francisco Valera and the war damage and insurance monies collected by Virgilio Valera.&nbsp; The heirs of Virgilio Valera were dragged into the intestate proceeding for the purpose of holding them liable for the amounts supposedly due from the deceased.&nbsp; As already noted, Bringas prayed for "an order directing the Sheriff to seize such properties of Virgilio Valera and his heirs ... as may be sufficient, to be sold according to law for the payment of double the value of the fruits and the amount of monies alienated and embezzled" (Annex "E" of Petition).&nbsp; Judge Ofilada specifically directed that the execution be issued "against the heirs of Virgilio Valera".&nbsp; The Deputy Sheriff literally followed that directive by levying upon "the goods and chattels of the heirs of Virgilio Valera".<br><br>The procedure followed by the Sheriff was erroneous.&nbsp; The decedent's heirs are not liable personally for the debts of his decedent.&nbsp; Thus, it was held:<br><blockquote>"It happens, however, that the plaintiffs are not under obligation to pay the debts of their late father, such as items (a), (f), and (h) of the counterclaim.&nbsp; It does not appear that they personally bound themselves to pay them, and the mere fact that they are the deceased's heirs does not make them answerable for such credits against their predecessor in interest, inasmuch as article 1003 of the Civil Code is no longer in force, having been abrogated by certain provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure" (<span style="font-style: italic;">Pavia vs. De la Rosa, </span>8 Phil. 70, cited in <span style="font-style: italic;">Calma vs. Calma,</span> 56 Phil. 102, 105).<br></blockquote>The error becomes more glaring in the light of Section 7, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court which allows execution in case of the death of a party only "where a party dies after the entry of the judgment or order".&nbsp; The implication is that if a person, <i>before his death, or the legal representative of his estate was never a party to a case,</i> no execution can be issued against his properties after his death.&nbsp; In this case, the Sheriff seems to have proceeded on the assumption that the properties levied upon belonged to the deceased Virgilio Valera and that the said properties were in the possession of his heirs.<br><br>Furthermore, there is merit in the petitioners' contention that the probate court generally cannot issue a writ of execution.&nbsp; It is not supposed to issue a writ of execution because its orders usually refer to the adjudication of claims against the estate which the executor or administrator may satisfy without the necessity of resorting to a writ of execution.&nbsp; The probate court, as such, does not render any judgment enforceable by execution.<br><br>The circumstance that the Rules of Court expressly specifies that the probate court may issue execution (a) to satisfy the contributive shares of devisees, legatees and heirs in possession of the decedent's assets (Sec. 6, Rule 88), (b) to enforce payment of the expenses of partition (Sec. 3, Rule 90), and (c) to satisfy the costs when a person is cited for examination in probate proceedings (Sec. 13, Rule 142) may mean, under the rule of <u><i>inclusio unius est exclusio alterius,</i></u> that those are the only instances when it can issue a writ of execution.<br><br>With particular reference to the sum of P4,784.96, which represents the insurance and war damage monies allegedly embezzled by Virgilio Valera, the lower court, sitting as a probate court, had no jurisdiction to enforce, by execution, the payment of double the value of that amount.&nbsp; The alleged embezzler was dead.&nbsp; Execution was not warranted under Sections 7 and 8, Rule 87 of the Rules of Court, which both refer, to a living person, meaning a person entrusted with a part of the decedent's estate "by an executor or administrator", and to a person who committed "embezzlement before letters (were) issued".&nbsp;
