				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an original action for mandamus instituted by <span class="SpellE">Dra</span>. <span class="SpellE">Suga</span> Sotto <span class="SpellE">Yuvienco</span> to compel the Honorable Mateo <span class="SpellE">Canonoy</span>,
presiding Judge of Branch III, Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>,
to approve, sign and certify to this Court the Record on Appeal she had filed in
Special Proceeding No. 2232-R entitled "In the Matter of the Guardianship
of the Person and Property of Don <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span> Sotto,
Incompetent, <span class="SpellE">Pascuala</span> Sotto <span class="SpellE">Pahang</span>,
Petitioner", and to order respondent Marcelo Sotto to pay the costs of
suit.</p>

<p class="BODY">On or about <st1:date year="1962" day="24" month="7">July 24,
 1962</st1:date>, in the Special Proceeding aforesaid the respondent Judge
appointed (a) <span class="SpellE">Dra</span>. <span class="SpellE">Suga</span>
Sotto <span class="SpellE">Yuvienco</span> as guardian of the person (with a bond
of P2,500.00) of the incompetent, Don <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span> Sotto -
hereinafter referred to as the ward - of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City,
93 years of age, sick and confined at the Perpetual <span class="SpellE">Succour</span>
Hospital of the same city since March 9, 1962; and (b) Rev. Father Sergio <span class="SpellE">Alfafara</span> and Cesar Sotto as co-guardians of the properties
of the same ward, with a bond of P5,000.00 each, subject to the condition,
among others, that the appointments were to be subject to the discretion of the
court until December 31, 1963, by which time the actions for compul­sory
acknowledgment as natural children of the ward filed by <span class="SpellE">Pascuala</span>
Sotto <span class="SpellE">Pahang</span>, <span class="SpellE">Matilde</span> Sotto
<span class="SpellE">Palicte</span>, Amelia Sotto and Marcelo Sotto were expected
to have been terminated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court said
further:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
the petitions of <span class="SpellE">Pascuala</span> Sotto <span class="SpellE">Pahang</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Matilde</span> Sotto <span class="SpellE">Palicte</span> and
others for judicial acknow­ledgment as natural children of Don <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span> Sotto are still pending hearing and decisions by
the Court and whatever arrangement the Court may make at present will
necessarily be affected by the deci­sions in said cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If they thus estab­lish their status as
acknowledged natural children, then they would be the nearest <span class="SpellE">kins</span> and their combined word will bear much weight." <span class="GramE">(p. 120, Record on Appeal or p. 6, decision, Spec. Proceedings No.
2232-R - Annex "1").</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Having been subsequently declared by competent court as the
illegitimate children of the ward in separate civil cases, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) Nos. R-7413, entitled "Marcelo Sotto
vs. <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span> Sotto, et <span class="SpellE">als</span>.,";
(2) R-6926, entitled "<span class="SpellE">Pascuala</span> Sotto <span class="SpellE">Pahang</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span> Sotto, et <span class="SpellE">als</span>.,"; and (3) R-6890, entitled "<span class="SpellE">Matilde</span> Sotto <span class="SpellE">Palicte</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span> Sotto, et <span class="SpellE">als</span>.,",
Marcelo, <span class="SpellE">Pascuala</span> and <span class="SpellE">Matilde</span>
filed on December 16, 1962 a joint motion praying the court to appoint them as
follows: Marcelo Sotto, as guardian of the pro­perty of the ward; and <span class="SpellE">Pascuala</span> Sotto <span class="SpellE">Pahang</span>, <span class="SpellE">Matilde</span> Sotto <span class="SpellE">Palicte</span> and Marcelo
Sotto, as co-guardians of his person, effective January 1, 1964.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An opposition thereto was filed by <span class="SpellE">Dra</span>. <span class="SpellE">Suga</span> Sotto <span class="SpellE">Yuvienco</span>, until then the guardian of the person of the
ward, claiming that the appointment of the <span class="SpellE">movants</span>
would defeat the appeals involving their status as illegitimate chil­dren
pending before the Supreme Court, and claiming further that it would be best
for the estate of the ward to maintain the <u>status quo</u> until <span class="SpellE">movants</span>' status shall have been finally decided on appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="28" month="12">December 28, 1963</st1:date>,
the respondent Judge extended the terms of <span class="SpellE">Dra</span>. Sotto
and Atty. Cesar Sotto as guardians of the person and property of the ward,
respectively, until June 30, 1964 to enable them to clear their accounts, but
on January 3, 1964, His Honor terminated their services effective July 1, 1964
retaining, however, the services of Marcelo Sotto and <span class="SpellE">Pascuala</span>
Sotto <span class="SpellE">Pahang</span> as guardians of the estate and person of
the ward, with bonds of five thousand and two thousand pesos, respectively,
until further orders of the Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
motion to reconsider and set aside the order just mentioned was filed in due
time by <span class="SpellE">Dra</span>. <span class="SpellE">Suga</span> Sotto <span class="SpellE">Yuvienco</span>, and an opposition thereto <span style="">was </span>filed by <span class="SpellE">Pascuala</span> and Marcelo.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> Amelia Sotto, who
also claimed to be an illegitimate child of the ward and whose case for
acknowledgment (Case No. 7417, entitled "Amelia Sotto vs. <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span> Sotto, et <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">als</span></span><span class="GramE">.,</span>") was still pending, moved on <st1:date year="1964" day="5" month="5">May 5, 1964</st1:date> for the retention of the services of
Cesar Sotto as one of the co-guardians of the estate of the ward.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the conflicting attitudes of the parties who claimed
to be the heirs of the ward, the Court, on <st1:date year="1964" day="30" month="5">May 30, 1964</st1:date>, issued an order in effect holding in abey­ance
the termination of the services of Cesar M. Sotto and <span class="SpellE">Dra</span>.
<span class="SpellE">Suga</span> Sotto <span class="SpellE">Yuvienco</span> as
guardians of the proper­ties and person of Don <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span>
Sotto, and directed the parties to hold a conference on <st1:date year="1964" day="13" month="6">June 13, 1964</st1:date> and submit a formal compromise
agreement thereafter.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="23" month="6">June 23, 1964</st1:date>,
acting finally on the motion for the reconsideration of its order of <st1:date year="1964" day="3" month="1">January 3, 1964</st1:date>, the respondent Judge
extended the terms of office of <span class="SpellE">Dra</span>. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Suga</span></span><span class="GramE"> Sotto <span class="SpellE">Yuvienco</span> and Cesar M. Sotto as guardians of the person and
estate of the ward <u><span style="">until </span></u></span><st1:date year="1964" day="30" month="9"><span class="GramE"><u><span style="">September 30, </span>1964</u></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"> to
enable them to clear their accounts.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Not satisfied with the orders of (a) <st1:date year="1963" day="28" month="12">December 28, 1963</st1:date>, (b) January 3 and (c) <st1:date year="1964" day="23" month="6">June 23, 1964</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Dra</span>.
<span class="SpellE">Suga</span> Sotto <span class="SpellE">Yuvienco</span>
attempted to appeal to this Court on questions of law, but co-guardian Marcelo
Sotto moved for the dismissal of the appeal on three grounds, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) that appellant had no right to appeal
since she had no vested right to the position she was holding; (2) that the
orders appealed from were not <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> not being
final determinations granting or denying substantial rights, and that (3) the
appeal was merely dilatory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Replying to <span class="GramE">said</span> motion appellant argued that none of the grounds relied
upon by <span class="SpellE">movant</span> was a legal ground for the dismissal
of an appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="31" month="7">July 31, 1964</st1:date>,
the Court issued an order dis­missing petitioner's appeal on the ground that
under Sec. 3, Rule 97 of the New Rules of Court, "the guardian of any
person may be discharged by the Court when it appears, upon the application of
the ward or otherwise, that the guardianship is no longer necessary."
Hence, the petition for mandamus now before <span class="GramE">Us</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents' answer admits some of the material averments of the
petition and denies the others, and alleged the following affirmative defenses:</p>

<p class="BODY">The only issue to be resolved is whether or not <span style="">the </span>respondent Judge gravely abused
his discretion <span style="">in </span>dismissing
petitioner's appeal on the grounds <span style="">stated
</span>in his order of <st1:date year="1964" day="31" month="7">July 31, 1964</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's petition for mandamus is based on <span style="">the </span>provisions of Section 14, Rule 41
of the New Rules <span style="">of Court to this </span>effect:</p>

<blockquote>"When erroneously a motion to dismiss an appeal is granted or
a record on appeal is disallowed by the trial court, a proper petition for
mandamus may be filed in the <span style="">appellate
court."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">It is petitioner's contention that having
served a notice of appeal upon herein respondents, and filed the notice of
appeal with the Court below together with an appeal bond and a record on
appeal, within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period, her appeal
was deemed perfected and it became the duty of the respondent Judge to give due
course to it.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, respondents argue that peti­tioner's
contention is without merit because the subsequent order of the respondent Judge
extending the terms of <span class="SpellE">Dra</span>. <span class="SpellE">Suga</span>
Sotto <span class="SpellE">Yuvienco</span> and Cesar M. Sotto up to June 30,
1964, and the second order extending their terms to September 30, 1964 to
enable them to wind up and settle their accounts, are not new adjudi­cations or
decisions but were issued merely to supple­ment the order of June 24, 1962 from
which petitioner did not appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 22, 1964 We issued a resolution, upon petitioner's
posting of a bond of P5,000.00, for the issuance of a writ of preliminary
injunction enjoining the respondent Judge from enforcing the order terminat­ing
the term of office of petitioner as guardian of the person of the ward.</p>

<p class="BODY">Two pertinent principles are well settled in this
jurisdiction:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) one is that mandamus
would lie only to compel a tribunal, board or officer to comply with a purely
ministerial duty, or to allow a party to exer­cise a right or to occupy and
enjoy the privileges of an office to which he is lawfully entitled; (b) the
other is that for the writ of mandamus to issue, peti­tioner must establish a
clear legal right to the relief sought, and a mandatory duty on the part of the
respondent in relation thereto.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the light of the above principles, the petition before <span class="GramE">Us</span> must fail.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is obvious from the facts set forth above that the respondent
Judge appointed petitioner on <st1:date year="1962" day="24" month="6">June 24,
 1962</st1:date> as guardian of the person of the ward with a term expiring on <st1:date year="1963" day="31" month="12">December 31, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As petitioner did not appeal said order
became final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, petitioner actually accepted the
terms of the order because she took her oath as guardian and actually dis­charged
her functions as such in accordance therewith.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the light of these circumstances, We believe not only that the
subsequent orders extending petitioner's term as guardian were issued in
accordance with the sound discretion of the respondent Judge but also that
petitioner is now <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> from contesting the
authority of the lower court to issue said order and the subsequent ones of the
same nature.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, the law empowers <span class="GramE">a </span><st1:street><st1:address><span class="GramE">Guardianship</span> Court</st1:address></st1:street> to appoint
guardians for the person of an incom­petent under such terms and conditions as
it may deem necessary; to terminate their term upon a showing that the
guardianship is no longer necessary, or to modify the original conditions of
the appointment whenever proper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this
case there is nothing in the record showing that the order appointing and the
order terminating petitioner's term were issued capriciously.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To the contrary, it appears that they were
issued subject to conditions which the appointees accepted voluntarily.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>In view of all the foregoing</b>, the writ prayed for is
denied, and the writ of preliminary injunction issued heretofore is set <span style="">aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span class="GramE">With <span style="">costs.</span></span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>
