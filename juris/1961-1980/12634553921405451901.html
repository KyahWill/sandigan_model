				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The Agricultural Land Reform Code<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
goes rather far, much too far in the opinion of some of its irreconcilable
critics, whose opposition has been most vocal and bitter, in curtailing the
property rights of landholders in pursuance of the consti­tutional objectives
of social justice and protection to labor.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
It is understandable then why not a few of its provisions have been assailed as
unconstitutional. One would think that a section of such act, giving due course
to any application for mechanization properly certified in accordance with the
previous statute by the Agricultural Tenancy Commission and the National
Resettlement and Rehabilitation Administration with proper notices served on
the tenants at least two months prior to its approval on August 8, 1963 and
allowing the decision to be based on the Agricultural Tenancy Act formerly in
force, would not raise a constitutional question.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Nonetheless, insofar as it could stand in the way of a land­holder
ejecting a tenant based on such previous statute,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
there would be a clear need for declaring Sec. 168 void; otherwise such a move
would be doomed to failure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
accounts for the three cases originating in the Court of Agrarian Relations
where the principal legislative question posed is the validity of the above
provision, the retroactive application of which is alleged to be <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of due process.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY">For a better understanding of the controlling facts, it must be
remembered that under Section 50 of the previous law, the Agricultural Tenancy
Act, the dispossession of a tenant by the landholder based on the ground of the
latter's <span style="">intention of </span>mechanizing
his farm was allowed subject to certain conditions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are that the landholder (1) shall at
least one year but not more than two years prior to the date of his petition to
dis­possess the tenant file a notice with the Court of Agrarian Relations; and
(2) shall inform him in writing in a language or dialect known to him of such
intention to cultivate the land himself, through the employment of mechanical
implements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is required likewise that
there be a certification of the Agri­cultural Tenancy Commission that the land
is suited for Mechanization and another certification from the manager of the
National Resettlement and Rehabilitation Administration that it can resettle
the tenant immediately in the event that the petition for dispossession is
authorized.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the basis of the above statutory provision,
plaintiff-appellant <span class="SpellE">Tinio</span>, with intention to
mechanize his land occupied by his tenants, now defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
Mina, Antonio and <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span>, obtained the required
certification both from the Agricultural Tenancy Commission on <st1:date year="1963" day="22" month="3">March 22, 1963</st1:date> and from the National
Resettlement and Rehabilitation Administration on <st1:date year="1963" day="30" month="5">May 30, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While
there was an allegation that the notice of such intention to mechanize was
served on the tenants, the brief of plaintiff-appellant did not show whether it
was made in writing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No mention was made
of the date either.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Agricultural Land Reform Code took effect on August 8, 1963, <span style="">as </span>previously
noted, while the previous ground for dispossession based on mechanization was
omitted, Section 168 thereof would preserve such right of the landholder under
the previous statute, if he could show that the corre­sponding certification
for suitability for mechanization and availability for resettlement were thus
obtained from the proper <span style="">agencies </span>and
proper notices were served on the tenants at least two months prior to its
approval.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be more precise, the
tenants should have been notified, if reliance be placed on the above
provision, at the latest on <st1:date year="1963" day="8" month="6">June 8,
 1963</st1:date>, the law having taken effect on August 8 of that year.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiff-appellant <span class="SpellE">Tinio</span> in these
three cases, however, waited almost two years from such date, having filed his
action in the Court of Agrarian Relations in <span class="SpellE">Guimba</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span> against defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Mina under date of July 8, 1965, defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Antonio, July 11, 1965 and defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span>, August 5,
1965, the complaints were for the mecha­nization of the land under tenancy,
owned by plaintiff-appellant Angel M.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Tinio</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1965" day="10" month="8">August 10, 1965</st1:date>, defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> through counsel, the then incumbent mayor of such
municipality filed a motion to dismiss based on the ground that under the above
referred to Section 168 of Agricultural<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Land Reform Code, the Court of Agrarian Relations was without
jurisdiction over the subject matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was contended in the opposition to such motion to dismiss that to apply the
aforesaid section would be to taint it with invalidity as it would deprive
plaintiff-appellant of a vested right.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1966" day="26" month="2">February 26, 1966</st1:date>,
the opposition not­withstanding, the Court of Agrarian Relations dismissed all
of the three above cases for lack of jurisdiction in accordance with the
aforesaid section.</p>

<p class="BODY">A more accurate ground on which dismissal could be predicated
could have been the absence of a cause of action in all three cases, no showing
having been made that there <span style="">was </span>full
compliance by plaintiff-appellant <span class="SpellE">Tinio</span> with the
terms of Section 168, which did preserve, under the conditions therein
provided, the jurisdiction of the Court of Agrarian Relations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, appeals were taken from such
order of dismissal to the Court of Appeals, which certified the matter to us,
the decisive issue being one of constitutionality, the briefs of
plaintiff-appellant <span class="SpellE">Tinio</span> in all three cases rather
insistent in their condemnation of the alleged nullity of Section 168 of the
Agricultural Land Reform Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">We could sustain the Court of Agrarian Relations in its dismissal
of the three above cases in view of the rather conspicuous failure of
plaintiff-appellant to show a cause of action.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That would leave the <span style="">constitutional
question still open, the doubt thus engendered likely to </span>plague the
various Court of Agrarian Relations in subsequent cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a situation may be fraught with
undesirable consequences.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Agricultural Land Reform Code is undeniably <span style="">a </span>major piece of social
legislation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not for us to give
expression to our views as to whether it is unnecessary, unwise, or
inexpedient.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are called upon however
to decide whether the claim of landholders of any infringement of
constitutional rights, be passed upon, and as promptly as possible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereby, what­ever be the decision, others
similarly situated, and much more so, the agricultural workers for whose
benefit the legislation was enacted, could be certain as to what precisely may
be constitutionally done.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We feel under
the circumstances that the validity of Sec. 168 of the Agricultural Land Reform
Code should be inquired into.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Agrarian Relations must be upheld; the attack on the
validity of the above section of the Agricultural Land Reform Code is flimsy
and insubstantial.</p>

<p class="BODY">1. Sec. 168 of the Agricultural Land Reform Code being
essentially procedural, the question of retroactivity hardly poses a serious
problem.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Less than a month ago, in
Gregorio v. Court of Appeals,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>we explicitly affirmed:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"* * *, under the doctrine uninterruptedly
adhered to by this Court, the retroactive application of a procedural law is
not <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of any right of a party who may feel
that he is adversely affected." More to the point, in <st1:city><st1:place>Laurel</st1:place></st1:city>
v. <span class="SpellE">Misa</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
we made clear that "there is no constitutional objection to retroactive
statutes where they relate to remedies or procedure." To the same <span style="">effect:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"The </span>amendment being procedural in character, no vested
rights could attach."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>2. On what basis then
could the contention of unconsti­tutionality based on retroactivity be made to
rest, with some degree of plausibility?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Plaintiff-appellant would assert that the right to <span style="">file </span>such
an action not in accordance with the present Sec. 168 of the Agricultural Land
Reform Code, but with Sec. 50 of the Agricultural Tenancy Act, is a vested
right of a substantive, not merely of a procedural, character.<span style="font-size: 11pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As set forth in the brief for plaintiff-appellant in his case
against defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Mina:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The appellant before the enactment of
the new law has already acquired a vested right and has complied with the
provision of Sec. 50 of R. A. No. <span style="">1199 </span><span style="">as </span>amended, prior to the filing of the
instant com­plaint for mechanization."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Also, "the new law is not procedural in nature which may have retroactive
effect, for it affects a right already acquired by the appellant."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Assume that the right <span style="">vested
in the plaintiff-</span>appellant was in reality substantive rather than
procedural, would his contention prevail?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The answer must still be in the negative.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is to be admitted that a vested right, substantive in
character, comes within the protection of the Constitution under the due
process clause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In certain cases, it
could find shelter under the non-impairment guaranty, but not according to the
facts as found in these three suits before us.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is no assertion of any obligation arising from contract being
disregarded, nor could any such averment be made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To follow plaintiff-appellant's approach, it
likewise admits of no doubt that there may be instances where retroactivity as
such would amount to a denial of due process.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It does not follow, however, that each and every instance where a law
operates to affect past events is to be condemned as obnoxious to such a basic
right.</p>

<p class="BODY">For what does due process signify?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to a recent decision:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It is responsiveness to the supremacy
of reason, obedience to the dictates of justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Negatively put, arbitrariness is ruled out
and unfairness avoided.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To satisfy the
due process requirement, official action, to paraphrase <span class="SpellE">Cardozo</span>,
<span style="">must </span>not outrun the bounds of
reason and result in sheer oppression.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Due process is thus hostile to any official action marred by lack of
reasonableness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Correctly has it been
identified as freedom from arbitra­riness.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is the embodiment of the sporting idea of fair play.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It exacts fealty 'to those strivings for
justice' and judges the act <span style="">of
officialdom </span>of whatever branch 'in the light of reason drawn from
considerations of fairness that reflect [democratic] traditions of legal and
political thought.’"<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is thus easily understandable why the allegation based on the
insistence on the alleged denial of due process by plaintiff-appellant cannot
be deemed persuasive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rather than being
arbitrary or possessing an element of unfairness, the challenged Sec. 168 of
the Agricultural Land Reform Code reveals on its face the concern shown by the
legislative body for pending actions for mechanization based on the previous
Agricultural Tenancy Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How could it
be said that such section is tainted by unreasonableness or oppressiveness?</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiff-appellant, along with almost every other Filipino, must
have been aware all the while that beginning the legislative sessions from
1962, a land reform measure, more comprehensive in scope and much more generous
in its conferment of benefits to agricultural workers, had been vigorously and
extensively discussed and debated, until its final approval on August 8,
1963.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It could have been reasonably
assumed then by landholders that whatever privileges had been enjoyed by them
under the Agricultural Tenancy Act could s<span style="">till
</span>be curtailed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The element of
surprise was clearly lacking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were
not left in the dark at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whatever
they could validly do under the previous statute, they should have done, before
it might prove too late.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is what
happened here.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the above circumstances, the allegation <span style="">that the </span>retroactive aspect of the
challenged section, even if the right formerly recognized as possessed by
landholders to file such suits for mechanization under the previous law be
considered substantive rather than procedural, sufficed to call for a judgment
of nullity should fall on deaf ears.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is manifestly no violation of the due process guaranty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 168 is not unconstitutional.</p>

<p class="BODY">3. Plaintiff-appellant's case for invalidity, weak enough as it
is, dwindles to the vanishing point, considering that the case for
mechanization against defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Mina was
filed on July 8, 1965, that against defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
Antonio on July 11, 1965 and that against defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
<span class="SpellE">Natividad</span> on August 5, 1965.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In these three above cases then,
plaintiff-appellant allowed almost two years to lapse after the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the Agricultural Land Reform Code before
going to court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For him then to voice a
plea of anguish, complaining of the alleged retroactivity of the challenged
section, is to elicit not sympathy but rejection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whatever be the plight he might find himself <span style="">in now, he </span>has only himself to blame.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Even the equities of the
case frown on his pretension.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Plaintiff-appellant,
after allowing such a long period of time to elapse, to enforce whatever rights
he felt he was entitled to, could not thereafter impugn the challenged section
which rightfully poses an insuperable barrier to his unwarranted claim.</p>

<p class="BODY">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is all then that
these three cases present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What was done
by the Court of Agrarian Relations was strictly in accordance with law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reversal of the orders of dismissal certainly
is uncalled for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respect <span style="">for a </span>valid
statute demands no less.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What <span style="">is </span>regrettable
is that plaintiff-appellant, adamant and unbending in his refusal to follow the
dictates of the Agricultural Land Reform Code, would seize upon a flimsy and
insubstantial argument in the vain hope of imparting deceptive plausibility to
the assertion of a non-existing right even to the extent of alleging nullity of
the challenged section.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How could he
hope to show its alleged invalidity, when, both according to reason and
precedent, no ground for such a conclusion, does exist?<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>
