City did not have any cause of action, because, in his opinion, the right of

after the original conveyance, as provided by Article 1508 of the Civil Code.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The cardinal point of

of deletion constitutes <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There are at least two
reasons why this claim can not be sustained:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">(a) The record before us clearly establishes that the order of
deletion of the entries in question was the result of the concordant positions
of the city officers and the appellant entity, BPOE (petitioner in 1963),
concerning the supposed lapse of the stipulation providing for the optional
reacquisition by <span style="">the City of Manila of
the land conveyed to the appellants, and its improvements, after fifty </span><span style="">year </span><span style="">from the original conveyance (in 1911) at the price stated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both the </span>City <span style="">and the appellant in 1963 entertained the view that this stipulation
was void in so far as it exceeded the ten-year period fixed for repurchase in
sales <u>a</u> <u>retro</u> by Article 1508 of the Spanish Civil Code of 1889,
then in force </span>(Now <span style="">&nbsp;</span><span style="">Article 1606 of the new Civil Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This conformity of views, expressly pleaded
in the petition to cancel (Record on Appeal, pages 14-18), led the City not to
file any opposition to the appellant's petition for an order to delete the
entry of the City's option, </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">annotated in their certificates of
title.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court's 1963 order granting
such deletion was, in fact and in law, a Judgment by consent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is apparent from the last portion of the
order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Rec. on Appeal, p. 21).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">". . . . . . . . </span>and
further considering that <span style="">it is the
official opinion of the City Fiscal that the City has no cause of action
against petitioner for the repurchase of said property as embodied in Opinion
No. 14, Series of 1962 (Annex "B"), so that the </span>City <span style="">of Manila deemed it unnecessary to file </span>any
opposition in spite <span style="">of having been
furnished with a copy of the above-entitled petition, said pe­tition is hereby
granted."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But the rule is clear, and it is supported by abundant
authority, that a consent decree, in which the officials of a municipality
assume obligations not authorized by law, is null and void (Kelley vs. Milan,
32 L. Ed. 77; Slayton vs. Crittenden Country, 284 Fed. 293; State ex <span class="SpellE">rel</span>. St. Paul vs. Great Northern <span class="SpellE">Ry</span>

</span><span style="">726).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Thus, the fact that, by consent
of the municipal officers, an agreement or stipulation made by them <u>has been
put in the form of a judgment</u>, in an effort to give it the force and effect
of a judgment, <u>does not cure a lack of power in the </u></span><u><span style="">officers to make it</span></u><span style="">, </span><span style="">and if such power </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">lacking, <u>the judgment</u> as well as the
stipulation <u>is void</u> (St. Paul v. Chicago, St. P. M, &amp; O. R. Co.
(1918) </span>139 <span style="">Minn. </span>322, 166
N. <span style="">W. </span>335).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And it has been held that as a contract by
which a city agrees with a railroad company that the city is to maintain and
keep in repair a bridge over the tracks of the railroad is <u>void as an
attempt to take from the city a part of its police power</u> to compel a
railway company to construct and maintain a bridge for the purpose of carrying
a street over its tracks when necessary for the public safety, of which the
city cannot divest itself by contract or otherwise, <u>such an invalid contract
is not validated by a judgment consented to by the municipality</u>, expressly
stipulating that such a contract is valid and binding (State ex <span class="SpellE">rel</span>. St. Paul v. Great Northern R. <st1:place>Co.</st1:place>

<blockquote>"(8) Authority
is not wanting to the effect that judgments entered against municipalities on
consent of the municipal authorities are not <span class="SpellE">res</span> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span> as to the authority or power to consent, and that
such want of power or authority to consent may always be shown to avoid the
judgment whenever, as here, the record shows that it was entered on consent.</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'Consent judgments, are in effect, merely contracts of parties,
acknowledged in open court, and ordered to be recorded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As such, they bind the parties themselves
thereto as fully as other judgments; but, when parties act in a representative
capacity, such judgments do not bind the <span class="SpellE">cestuis</span> qua <span class="SpellE">trustent</span>, unless the trustees had authority to act; and
when (as in the present case) the parties to the action, the town authorities,
had, as appears above, no authority to issue the bonds, their honest belief,
however great, that they had such power, would not authorize them to acquire
such power, and bind the town by consenting to a judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not a question of a fraudulent
judgment, but a void judgment for want of authority to consent to a decree to
bind principals (the tax-payers) for whom they had no authority to create an
indebtedness by consenting to a judgment any more than they would have had by
issuing bonds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If authorized to create
the indebtedness, either the bonds or the consent judgment would be equally an <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>, but, as they had no such authority, neither bonds

of the land plus the value of the improvements?</p>

<p class="BODY">This question requires a closer look at the nature of the right
thus reserved to the City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Contrary to
the views expressed by the appellant, the continued existence of the City's
authority to reacquire the property <span style="">"<u>for
public </u></span><u>purpose only</u>" (sic) any time after 13 July 1961
is not debatable:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>for such authority is
nothing more than the City's right to exercise the power of <u><span style="">eminent domain</span></u><span style="">, </span>which the City of Manila can not be
deprived of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not arise from
contract, nor can it be barred by prescription.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, it would exist without any reservation or stipulation at all.</p>

<p class="BODY">The more important part in the deleted stipulation is the right
of the City of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> <u><span style="">not to pay for </span>the land more than the
price at which it was originally sold</u> to the BPOE in 1911, disregarding
market values at the time of condemna­tion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The elimination of this part of the contractual reservation in favor of
the City commits the latter to pay the <u>actual market value of the land</u>
at the time of expropriation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Considering the uninterrupted rise in real estate values, it <span style="">can </span>be readily seen that by consenting
to the deletion of the annotation the City of Manila was made, in effect, to <u><span style="">donate</span></u><span style=""> </span>to the BPOE, or its successor-in-interest, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>
Development Corporation, the difference between the original price at which the
land was sold to the BPOE in 1911 and the market price of the land at the time
the City decided to reacquire it for public purposes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It requires no argument to show that the City
executive officers had no power to bind the City to a stipulation so
unfavorable to its interests, and so prejudicial to its taxpayers.</p>

<blockquote>"The court found, and so do we, that the city of­ficials, in
consenting to the judgment were actuated by no bad motive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the court also found, and so do we, that
they so far exceeded their powers, as to taint the settlement and judgments
with constructive fraud, and this, though less reprehensible, can be no less
fatal to the validity of the judgment than actual fraud." (State ex <span class="SpellE">rel</span>. <span class="SpellE">Bradway</span> vs. De <span class="SpellE">Mattos</span>, 88 <st1:state><st1:place>Wash.</st1:place></st1:state>
35, 152 <st1:place>Pac.</st1:place> 721)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">That neither in the petition nor in the order to delete <span style="">the </span>annotation in question is any
mention or reference made to the disastrous consequences for the City of the
action asked for, as above adverted to, no, <span style="">to </span>the fact that the City's right to reacquire the lot sold to
the BPOE <u>for public purposes</u> was no other than the sovereign power of
eminent domain, a power in­alienable and <span class="SpellE">imprescriptible</span>,
is eloquent proof that the Court, in granting the petition to delete relied
primarily, if not exclusively, on the assent thereto of the City authorities,
and that the decree granting the petition to delete was nothing but a judgment
by consent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the circumstances
above discussed we have no other alternative but to declare the order of
deletion null and void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, it can
not be considered conclusive on any subsequent proceedings.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(b) A further
reason for this Court to deny the effect of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span> to the 1963 order to delete from the
certificates of title of the BPOE re annotation of the City's right to
repurchase the property under the condition specified<span style=""> in </span>the original deed of conveyance lies in the fact that
proceeding under Section 112 of the Land Registration Act presuppose unanimity
among the parties;<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
hence, the said 1963 order of the Land Registration Court lacks the quality of
being an adjudication <u>on the merits of a controversy</u>, that is in
essential re­quisite of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span> (Rule 39, section 49), since there wa<span style="">s </span>no controversy resolved by the
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this was never truer than in
the case at bar, where the decree of cancellation of the entry was, in fact,
the result of an agreement between the parties, being a judgment by consent, as
previously shown.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 41.4pt; text-indent: -19.8pt;">(c) In <span class="SpellE">Saminiada</span> vs. Mata, 92 Phil. 425, 431-462, this Court,
following American authorities, ruled that an agreement or settlement between
the parties, <u>even if sanctioned by the decree of a court</u>, does not give
to such decree the character of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
this is particularly true in the present case, where the agreement concerned a
question of law, to wit, the validity or invalidity in 1963 of the right
reserved to the City of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, it is argued on behalf of the appellant BPOE,
and is<span style=""> </span>transferee <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span> Development Corporation, that the 1964 order to <span class="SpellE">reannotate</span> the former entries in their certificates of
title could not be decreed in proceed­ings under Section 112 of Act 496 (the
Land 'Registration Law) for lack of juris­diction, because the proposed <span class="SpellE">reannotation</span> had been <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>
by them and the jurisprudence of this Court is to the effect that lack of
unanimity between the parties bars any action by the Court of Land Registration
under the section aforesaid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
contention might have carried weight if the parties had not discussed and
extensively argued on the merits of the petition to <span class="SpellE">reannotate</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead of confining themselves to the
jurisdictional question, appellants went on to discuss the nature of<span style=""> </span>the title of the City of Manila to the
land composing the <span class="SpellE">Luneta</span> Extension; whether or not
said lots were property of public use (or of public service), or whether it was
patrimonial property of the City; and whether the 1911 contract with the City
vested upon appellant BPOE a title in fee simple or merely a temporary right of
usufruct over the land in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE">Aglipay</span> vs. Reyes, L-12776, 23 March 1960, and Franco, et
al. vs. Monte de <span class="SpellE">Piedad</span>, L-17610, 22 April 1963, this
Supreme Court ruled that where the parties have acquiesced in submitting the
issues for determination on the merit on registration proceedings under Section
112 aforesaid, and they are given full opportunity to present their respective
sides of the contro­versy, then the <span style="">Land
</span>Registration Court, being itself a court of first instance, may validly
hear and determine issues otherwise litigable only in ordinary civil actions.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">At any rate, since the
1963 order to cancel the entry originally annotated on the back of the
certificates of title of appellant BPOE reserving the right of the City of
Manila to reacquire the property after 50 years from the original conveyance to
'said appellant was, and is, null and void, </span>as <span style="">previously shown, such nullity should necessarily result in the
re-annotation of the deleted entries on said certificates of title of the BPOE,
as well as on the other transfer certificates derived <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>,
including that of the <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span> Development Corporation,
as transferee of the BPOE, subject to the right of said Development Corporation
to sue for cancellation of the annotation on </span>its <span style="">own certificates (T. C. </span><span style="">T.
</span><span style="">No. 73444 of Manila) as herein­after
reserved.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0in; text-indent: 0in;">II - On Entry No.
18115/T-9332 (T. C. T. Nos. 9332 and 51988):</p>

<p class="BODY">What <span style="">has been stated
concerning the invalidity of the 1963 order of the Land Registration Court
decreeing the cancellation of the annotation of the rights of the City of
Manila on Certificates of Title Nos. 2195 and 67488 of the BPOE </span>applies <span style="">with equal force, and for the same reasons,
to the order of the same court <span class="SpellE">cancelling</span> the
annotations on Certificates of Title Nos. 9332 and 51988 of the Army and Navy
Club of Manila, appellant in G. R. No. L-24481.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The same issues were raised, and the resulting legal situation is
identical.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Hence the <span style="">subsequent order of <span class="SpellE">reannotation</span>
must also be sustained in this case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0in; text-indent: 0in;">III - Rights of the <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span> Development Corporation:</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Whether the <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span> Development Corporation is entitled to hold the pro­perty
(covered by T. C. T. No. 73444) free from the reserved </span>rights <span style="">of reacqui­sition of the City of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">, on account of its claim of being a
purchaser in good faith, involves essentially a question of fact. </span><span style="">&nbsp;</span>T<span style="">he <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, City of Manila, has assailed the good faith of
this transferee, pointing out that the <span class="SpellE">Luneta</span>
Extension is </span>a <span style="">park, and,
therefore, not patrimonial property of the City and that the description of the
property in the certificates of <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span> and its
predecessor, BPOE, clearly describe it as a </span><u>part of the <span class="SpellE">Luneta</span> Extension</u>, <span style="">thereby
placing its acquirers upon inquiry.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Whether such is the fact and whether the particular lot was turned over
to the City of Manila as </span>property for public use; under what <span style="">authority the City entered into the contract
of 13 July 1911 if the lands were not patrimonial property of said </span>City <span style="">and other </span>related <span style="">questions are not fully elucidated in the
proceedings now before us, and would </span>be best <span style="">litigated in another controversial proceeding, where <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span> may, likewise, raise the question of its rights
against its </span>vendor, the BPOE, should <span style="">it ultimately </span>be declared that <span style="">the City of Manila is still </span>entitled <span style="">to compel <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span> to resell </span>the
property <span style="">to it under the terms </span>and
conditions reserved in the original 1911 deed of sale by the City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this purpose, the right <span style="">is </span>reserved to <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Tarlac</span></span><span style=""> Development Corporation to initiate a distinct action where its rig</span>h<span style="">ts may be fully clarified </span>and
determined; but the <span class="SpellE">reannotation</span> order should be made
ef­fective on <span class="SpellE">Tarlac's</span><span style=""> Certificate of </span>Title No. 73444, as a preventive measure to
protect the eventual <span style="">rights of the City
of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> against </span>the claims <span style="">of future </span>transferee.</p>
