				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal by <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> Felix <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de Rodriguez from the decision of the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> in Civil Case No. 2565, which she
commenced on <st1:date year="1962" day="28" month="5">May 28, 1962</st1:date>,
to secure declar­ation of nullity of two contracts executed on <st1:date year="1934" day="24" month="1">January 24, 1934</st1:date> and for recovery of
certain properties.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts of this case may be briefly stated as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> Felix, widow of the late Don
Felipe Calderon and with whom she had one living child, <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>
Calderon, contract­ed a second marriage on June 20, 1929, with Domingo
Rodriguez, a widower with four children by a previous marriage, named Geronimo,
<span class="SpellE">Esmeragdo</span>, Jose and Mauricio, all surnamed
Rodriguez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no issue in this
second marriage.</p>

<p class="BODY">Prior to her marriage to Rodriguez, <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>
Felix was the registered owner of 2 fishponds located in the barrio of <span class="SpellE">Babañgad</span>, municipality of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> province, with a total area of 557,711 square
meters covered by OCT Nos. 605 and 807.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under date of <st1:date year="1934" day="24" month="1">January 24, 1934</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> Felix appeared to have executed a deed of
sale conveying ownership of the aforesaid properties to her daughter, <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> Calderon, for the sum of P2,500.00, which the
latter in turn appeared to have transferred to her mother and stepfather by
means of a document dated <st1:date year="1934" day="27" month="1">January 27,
 1934</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both deeds, notarized
by Notary Public Jose D. Mendoza, were registered in the office of the Register
of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> on <st1:date year="1934" day="29" month="1">January 29, 1934</st1:date>, as a consequence of which, the original
titles were cancelled and TCT Nos. 13815 and 13816 were issued in the names of
the spouses Do­mingo Rodriguez and <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> Felix.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 6, 1953, Domingo Rodriguez died intestate, survived by
the widow, <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> Felix, his children Geronimo, <span class="SpellE">Esmeragdo</span> and Mauricio and grandchildren Oscar, Juan and
Ana, surnamed Ro­driguez, children of a son, Jose, who had predeceased him.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1953" day="16" month="3">March 16, 1953</st1:date>,
the above-named widow, children and grandchildren of the deceased entered into
an extrajudicial settlement of his (Domingo's) estate, consisting of one-half
of the properties al­legedly belonging to the conjugal partnership.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Among the properties listed as conjugal were
the two parcels of land in <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, which, together with another piece of property,
were divided among the heirs in this manner:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREAS, the parties have furthermore agreed that the
fishpond covered by TCT Nos. 13815, 13816 and 24109 of the Office of the
Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, containing an area of
557,971 sq. m., which is likewise the conjugal property of the deceased and his
surviving spouse; 1/2 of the same or 278,985.5 sq. m. belongs to said <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> Felix <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de Ro­driguez,
as her share in the conjugal property; and 3/4 of the remaining half or
209,239.125 sq. m. are transferred in full ownership to Geronimo Rodriguez, <span class="SpellE">Esmeragdo</span> Rodriguez and Mauricio Rodriguez, share alike,
while the other 1/4 or 69,746.375 sq. m. of the said remaining half goes in
equal shares to Oscar Rodriguez, Juan Rodriguez and Ana Rodriguez."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">As a result of this partition, TCT Nos.
13815 and 13816 were can­celled and TCT Nos. T-11431 and T-14432 were issued in
the names of the said heirs of the deceased.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1953" day="23" month="3">March 23, 1953</st1:date>,
in a power of attorney executed by the children and grandchildren of Domingo
Rodriguez, <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> Felix <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.
de Rodriguez was named their attorney-in-fact, authorized to manage their
shares in the fishponds (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 4).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1954" day="2" month="7">July 2, 1954</st1:date>,
the heirs ended their co-ownership by execut­ing a deed of partition, dividing
and segregating their respective shares in the properties, pursuant to a
consolidation and subdivision plan (PCS-3702), in accordance with which, <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> Felix <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de
Rodriguez obtained TCT No. T-12910, for the portion pertain­ing to her (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. L), while TCT No. T-12911 was issued to the other
heirs, for their shares.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This latter
title was subsequently replaced by TCT No. 16660 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
M).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1954" day="12" month="10">October 12, 1954</st1:date>,
the Rodriguez children executed another document granting unto the widow
lifetime usufruct over one-third of the fishpond which they received as
hereditary share in the es­tate of Domingo Rodriguez, which grant was accepted
by <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> Felix <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de
Rodriguez.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then, in a contract dated December 15, 1961, the widow ap­peared
to have leased from the Rodriguez children and grandchil­dren the fishpond
(covered by TCT No. 16660) for a period of 5 years commencing August 16, 1962,
for an annual rental of P7, 161.37 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 5).</p>

<p class="BODY">At about this time, it seemed that the relationship between the
widow and her stepchildren had turned for the worse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, when she failed to deliver to them the
balance of the earnings of the fishponds, in the amount of P3;000.00, her
stepchildren endorsed the matter to their lawyer who, on <st1:date year="1962" day="16" month="5">May 16, 1962</st1:date>, sent a letter of demand to the
widow for payment thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="28" month="5">May 28, 1962</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>
Felix <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de Rodriguez filed the present action in
the Court of First Instance of Manila naming as defendants, Geronimo Rodriguez,
<span class="SpellE">Esmeragdo</span> Rodriguez, Oscar Rodriguez, <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> Bautista <span class="SpellE">vda</span>. de
Rodriguez, as guardian of the minors Juan and Ana Rodriguez, and Antonio Diaz
de Rivera and <span class="SpellE">Renato</span> Diaz de Rivera, as guardians of
the minors Marfa Ana, Mercedes, Mar­garita, Mauricio, Jr. and Domingo (Children
of Mauricio Rodriguez who had also died).</p>

<p class="BODY">The action to declare null and void the deeds of transfer of
plain­tiff's properties to the conjugal partnership was based on the alleged
employment or exercise by plaintiff's deceased husband of force and pressure on
her; that the conveyances of the properties - from plain­tiff to her daughter
and then to the conjugal partnership of plaintiff and her husband - are both
without consideration; that plaintiff par­ticipated in the extrajudicial
settlement of estate (of the deceased Domingo Rodriguez) and in other
subsequent deeds or instruments involving the properties in dispute, on the
false assumption that the said properties had become conjugal by reason of the
execution of the deeds of transfer in 1934; that laboring under the same false
assumption, plaintiff delivered to defendants, as income of the prop­erties
from 1953 to 1961, the total amount of P56,976.58.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As alternative cause of action, she contended
that she would claim for her share, as surviving widow, of 1/5 of the
properties in controversy, should such properties be adjudicated as belonging
to the conjugal partnership.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus,
plaintiff prayed that the deeds of transfer men­tioned in the complaint be
declared fictitious and simulated; that the "Extrajudicial Settlement of
Estate" be also declared null and void; that TCT No. 16660 of the Registry
of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> be cancelled and another one be
issued in the name of plaintiff, <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> Felix <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de Felix; that defendants be ordered to pay to plain­tiff
the sum of P56,976.58, with legal interest thereon from the date of the filing
of the complaint, and for appropriate relief in connection with her alternative
cause of action.</p>

<p class="BODY">In their separate answers, defendants not only denied the ma­terial
allegations of the complaint, but also set up as affirmative de­fenses lack of
cause of action, prescription, <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> and <span class="SpellE">laches</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
counterclaim, they asked for payment by the plaintiff of the un­paid balance of
the earnings of the land up to <st1:date year="1962" day="15" month="8">August
 15, 1962</st1:date> in the sum of P 3,000.00<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>for attorney's fees and expenses of litigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="5" month="10">October 5, 1963</st1:date>,
judgment was rendered for the defendants.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In upholding the validity of the contracts, the court found that al­though
the two documents, Exhibits A and B, were executed for the purpose of
converting plaintiff's separate properties into conjugal assets of the marriage
with Domingo Rodriguez, the consent of the parties thereto was voluntary,
contrary to the allegations of plain­tiff and her witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court also ruled that having taken part
in the questioned transactions, plaintiff was not the proper party to plead
lack of consideration to avoid the transfers; that contracts without consideration
are not inexistent, but are only <span class="SpellE">voidable</span>, following
the ruling in the case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Concepcion</u></span><u> vs.
Sta. Ana</u> (87 Phil. 787); that there was ratification or confirmation by the
plaintiff of the transfer of her property, by her execution (with the other
heirs) of the extrajudicial settlement of estate; that being a volun­tary party
to the contracts, Exhibits A and B, plaintiff cannot re­cover the properties
she gave <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Plaintiff's alternative cause of action was also rejected on the ground
that action for res­cission of the deed of extrajudicial settlement should have
been filed within 4 years from its execution (on <st1:date year="1953" day="16" month="3">March 16, 1953</st1:date>).</p>

<p class="BODY">From the decision of the Court of First Instance, plaintiff duly
appealed to this Court, insisting that the conveyances in issue were obtained
through duress, and were inexistent, being simulated and without consideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the trial Court that the evidence is not convincing
that the contracts of transfer from <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> Felix
to her daughter, and from the latter to her mother and stepfather were executed
through violence or intimidation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
charge is predicat­ed solely upon the improbable and biased testimony of
appellant's daughter, <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Martelino</span>, whom the trial court refused to believe,
considering that her version of violence and harass­ment was contradicted by <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> <span class="SpellE">Gualberto</span>, who had
lived with the Rodriguez spouses from 1917 to 1953, and by the improbability of
Rodriguez threatening his stepdaughter in front of the Notary Public who
ratified her signature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, as
pointed out by the appealed decision, the charge of duress should be treated
with caution considering that Rodriguez had already died when the suit was
brought, for duress, like fraud, is not to be lightly laid at the door of men
already dead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(cf. <span class="SpellE">Prevost</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Gratz</span>, 6 Wheat. [U.S] 481, 498; <span class="SpellE">Sinco</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Longa</span>, 51 Phil. 507).</p>

<p class="BODY">What is more decisive is that duress being merely a vice or
defect of consent, an action based upon it must be brought within four years
after it has ceased;<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
and the present action was insti­tuted only in 1962, twenty-eight (28) years
after the intimidation is claimed to have occurred, and no less than nine (9)
years after the supposed culprit died (1953).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On top of it, appellant entered into a series of subsequent transactions
with <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> that con­firmed the contracts that she
now tries to set aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, this
cause of action is clearly barred.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's main stand in attacking the conveyances in ques­tion
is that they are simulated or fictitious, and inexistent for lack of
consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We shall examine each
purported defect separately.</p>

<p class="BODY">The charge of simulation is untenable, for the characteristic of
simulation is the fact that the apparent contract is not really de­sired or
intended to produce legal effects or in any way alter the juridical situation
of the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, where a person, in
order to place his property beyond the reach of his creditors, simulates a
transfer of it to another, he does not really intend to divest him­self of his
title and control of the property; hence, the deed of transfer is but a
sham.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But appellant contends that the
sale by her to her daughter, and the subsequent sale by the latter to appel­lant
and her husband, the late Domingo Rodriguez, were done for the purpose of converting
the property from <span class="SpellE">paraphernal</span> to conjugal, thereby
vesting a half interest in Rodriguez, and evading the pro­hibition against
donations from one spouse to another during <span class="SpellE">coverture</span>
(Civil Code of 1889, Art. 1334).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If this
is true, then the appel­lant and her daughter must have intended the two
conveyances to be real and effective; for appellant could not intend to keep
the ownership of the fishponds and at the same time vest half of them in her
husband.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two contracts of sale then
could not have been simulated, but were real and intended to be fully
operative, being the means to achieve the result desired.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nor does the intention of the parties to circumvent by these
contracts the law against donations between spouses make them simulated ones.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant invokes our decision in <u>Vazquez vs. <span class="SpellE">Porta</span></u>, 98 Phil. 490, but to no purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mortgage and foreclosure sale involved in
that case were typical simulations, merely apparent but not really intended to
produce legal effects, as proved by the Court's finding that the alleged
creditor and buyer at the foreclosure sale "<span class="SpellE">Porta</span>
himself ostensibly acknowledged by his inertia in allowing the doc­tor (alleged
mortgagor debtor) to exercise dominical power thereon without any protest on
his part." (<span class="SpellE"><u>cas</u></span> <u>cit</u>. p. 495).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not only this, but the mortgagor's wife, when
her husband died, "found among his papers Portals cancellation of the
mortgage in his favor and the draft of the complaint for
foreclosure."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plainly, the
precedent cited is here inapplicable.</p>

<p class="BODY">Were the two conveyances from appellant to her daughter and from
the latter to the spouses Rodriguez void <span class="SpellE"><u>ab</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>initio</u></span> or inexistent for lack of consideration?<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not find them to be so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first transaction, the price of P2

P3,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now, Article 1274 of the
Civil Code of 1889 (in force when the deeds were executed) provided that --</p>

<p class="BODY">Since in each conveyance the buyer became obligated to pay a
definite price in money, such undertakings constituted in themselves actual <span class="SpellE"><u>causa</u></span> or consideration for the conveyance of the

(assuming <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>arquendo</u></span> that <span class="SpellE">Concep­cion</span> <span class="SpellE">Martelino's</span> testimony

ruled in <u>Enriquez de la <span class="SpellE">Cavada</span> vs. Diaz</u>, 37
Phil. 982, "the consideration (<span class="SpellE"><u>causa</u></span>) need
