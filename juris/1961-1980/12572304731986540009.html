				<H3>MANUEL H. BARREDO, ET AL., PETITIONERS VS. THE COURT OF APPEALS ET AL., RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The present appeal by the heirs of the late Fausto Barredo involves a tardy 
claim to collect the face value of a promissory note for P20,000.00 plus 12% 
interest per annum from 21 December 1949, the date of its maturity, plus 
attorney's fees and costs in the sum of P2,000.00, from the intestate estate of 
the late Charles A. McDonough, represented herein by the administrator, W. I. 
Douglas.
<p>The promissory note Was secured by a mortgage executed on 31 December 1940 in 
favor of Fausto Barredo over the leasehold rights of McDonough on the greater 
portion of a parcel of registered land located at Dungalo, Parañaque, Rizal, 
owned by Constantino Factor, and over four (4) houses which McDonough had 
constructed on the leased land. The lease contract between Factor and McDonough 
provided for a term of 10 years from 1 September 1936; but on December 1940, the 
parties extended the term up to 31 August 1961. The original lease, the 
extension of its term, and the mortgage were all inscribed at the back of the 
certificate of title of the land.</p>
<p>Upon Fausto Barredo's death on 8 October 1942, his heirs, in a deed of 
extrajudicial partition, adjudicated unto themselves the secured credit of the 
deceased, and had the same recorded on the aforesaid certificate of title.</p>
<p>This annotation was, however, cancelled when one day in August, 1944 Manuel 
H. Barredo was ordered to appear before an officer of the Japanese Imperial Army 
at the Army and Navy Club and was commanded to bring witft him all the documents 
pertaining to the mortgage executed by the late McDonough, whose private 
properties, because of his enemy citizenship, were, in the words of the Court of 
Appeals, "appropriated by the triumphant invader". Manuel H. Barredo was paid 
P20,000.00 In Japanese war notes by the occupation authorities and made to sign, 
as he did sign, a certification stating "that in consideration of P2,000.00 
which I have received today, I am requesting the Register of Deeds to cancel the 
mortgage of these properties"; and, as requested, the cancellation was inscribed 
at the back of the title.</p>
<p>Charles McDonough died on 15 March 1945; thereupon, Special Proceedings No. 
70173 of the Court of First Instance of Manila, captioned "In re: Intestate 
Estate of Charles A. McDonough", was instituted; and pursuant to a court order 
of 17 August 1945, the administrator caused to be published in the "Philippine 
Progress" for three consecutive weeks, on 23 and 30 August 1945 and 6 
September1945, a notice to creditors requiring them to file their claims with 
the clerk of court within 6 months reckoned from the date of its first 
publication and expiring on 23 February 1946.</p>
<p>On 22 October 1947, the heirs of Fausto Barredo filed their belated claim 
against the estate of McDonough. This claim Was opposed by the acfministrator. 
After hearing, the lower court allowed the claim, but the Court of Appeals 
reversed the order of allowance; hence, the Barredo heirs appealed to this 
Court, assigning the following alleged errors:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol><li>That the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the 'one month' period 
referred to in Section 2 of Rule 87 of the Rules of Court is to be counted from 
and after the expiration of the six-month period fixed in the published notice 
to the claims, and in further holding that the trial court had therefore 
committed a reversible error in admitting and allowing the claim of herein 
petitioners; and<br><br>
</li><li>That the respondent Court of Appeals erred in holding that the only logical 
conclusion is that the P20,000.00 in Japanese money paid by the Japanese 
military authorities to petitioner Manuel H. Barredo were paid for the 
redemption of the promissory note secured by mortgage of the four buildings. 
</li></ol></blockquote>
<p>It is pertinent to state before discussing the arguments of counsel that in 
view of the burning and destruction of the buildings which were the subject of 
the mortgage, the petitioners manifested their wish to abandon their security 
and prosecute the claim against the estate as for a simple money debt, and that 
when the Barredo heirs filed their claim, no order of distribution had been 
entered in the proceedings.</p>
<p>Section 2, Rule 87, of the Rules of Court reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SEC. 2. <i>Time within which clams shall be filed.</i>—In the notice 
provided in section 1, the court shall state the time for the filing of claims 
against the estate, which shall not be more than twelve nor less than six months 
after the date of the first publication of the notice. However, at any time 
before an order of distribution is entered, on application of a creditor who has 
failed to file his claim within the time previously limited, the court may, for 
cause shown and on such terms as are equitable, allow such claim to be filed 
within a time not exceeding one month."</p></blockquote>
<p>The probate court previously fixed the period for filing claims at six (6) 
months reckoned from the date of first publication, and the said notice to 
creditors was first published on 23 August 1945. The present claim was filed on 
22 October 1947; There is no doubt, therefore, that the claim was filed outside 
of the period previously fixed. But a tardy claim may fee allowed, at the 
discretion of the court, upon showing of cause for failure to present said claim 
on time.</p>
<p>The respondent administrator, relying on the case of the Estate of Howard J. 
Edmands, 87 Phil. 405, argues that the one-month period for filing late claims 
mentioned in Section 2, Rule 87, of the Rules of Court should be eounted from 
the expiration of the regular six-month period, but this pronouncement was but 
an <i>obiter dictum</i> that did not resolve the issue involved in said case. 
The ruling appears in the case of Paulin vs. Aquino, L-11267, March 20, 1958, 
wherein the controverted one-month period was clarified as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The one-month period specified in this section is the time granted 
claimants, and the same is to begin from the order authorizing the filing of the 
claims. <i>It does not mean that the extension of one month Harts from the 
expiration of the original period fixed by the court for the presentation of 
claims</i>." (Italics supplied)</p></blockquote>
<p>However, the probate court's discretion in allowing a claim <i>after</i> the 
regular period for filing claims but <i>before</i> entry of an order of 
distribution presupposes not only a claim of apparent, merit but also that cause 
existed to justify the tardiness in filing the claim. Here, petitioners alleged 
as excuse for their tardiness the recent recovery of the papers of the late 
Fausto Barredo from the possession of his lawyer who is now deceased. This 
ground is insufficient, due to the availability, and knowledge by the 
petitioners, of the annotation at the back of the certificate of title of the 
mortgage embodying the instant claim, as well as the payment of P20,000.00 made 
by the Japanese military authorities.</p>
<p>The order of the trial court allowing the late claim is without 
justification, because under Section 2, Rule 87, of the Rules of Court, said 
court has no authority to admit a belated claim for no cause or for an 
insufficient cause.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></p>
<p>In view of the conclusions thus arrived at, it becomes unnecessary to discuss 
whether the payment by the Japanese was intended as a discharge of the 
promissory note. Suffice it to say that there is no other cogent explanation for 
the payment made to the mortgagees, who were not the owners of the encumbered 
property.</p>
<p>For the foregoing reasons, the appealed decision, is affirmed, with costs 
against the petitioners.</p> <i>Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Barrera, Paredes, Dizon, Regala,</i> 
and <i>Makalintal, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><br>
<hr align="left" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<font color="#ff0000">[1]</font> In Paulin vs. Aquino, <i>supra</i>, the Supreme 
Court held that the late filing was justified by the fraudulent omission of 
certain assets in the inventory; in Gallinero vs. Torres, 86 Phil., 607; 47 Off. 
Gaz [12] 224, on the ground of inducement of fraud upon claimant; and in Estate 
of De Dios, 24 Phil. 573, is was held that negotiations with an heir is not a 
sufficient cause in allowing a tardy claim. Upon the other hand, in Nebraska 
Wesleyan University vs. Bowen, 103 N. W. 275, it was ruled that a court ought 
not to permit a claim delayed more than 8 months in the absence of diligence and 
of unavoidable mistake or accident or of a fraud of a nature analogous to that 
which warrants interposition of a court of equity to grant new trial.</div>
