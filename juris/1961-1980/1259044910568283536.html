<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The facts of this case, which are 
not disputed, are stated in the decision appealed from, as follows: 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> 
the petitioners, except Hon. Ramon <span class="SpellE">Duterte</span>, who is the 
incumbent Mayor of the City of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, and petitioners 
Jorge <span class="SpellE">Duterte</span>, Isidro <span class="SpellE">Godinez</span>, Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Zabala</span> and <span class="SpellE">Artemio</span> <span class="SpellE">Luceno</span>, are officers and 
employees of the <span class="SpellE">Osmena</span> Waterworks System, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City, who have been theretofore duly appointed as such 
by the Secretary of Public Works and Communications, receiving their 
corresponding salaries as authorized under said appointment (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span><span class="GramE">. '</span>l') The twelve last named 
petitioners, Jorge <span class="SpellE">Duterte</span>, <span class="SpellE">Epifanio</span> <span class="SpellE">Aban</span>, <span class="SpellE">Diosdado</span> <span class="SpellE">Abangan</span>, Julian <span class="SpellE">Antiporta</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabellon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span> <span class="SpellE">Cardiente</span>, Vicente <span class="SpellE">Durano</span>, Isidro 
<span class="SpellE">Godinez</span>, <span class="SpellE">Artemio</span> <span class="SpellE">Luceno</span>, <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> <span class="SpellE">Robeles</span>, Aurelio Samson and Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Zabala</span>, became employees of the <span class="SpellE">Osmena</span> Waterworks System only by virtue of the appointments 
extended to them by Hon. Sergio <span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span>, Jr., then City 
Mayor of the City of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, sometime in July, 1956, 
when their co-petitioners, except Mayor Ramon <span class="SpellE">Duterte</span>, 
were also given new appointments with increase in their salaries, by then Mayor 
Sergio <span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span>, Jr. Said appointments were allegedly 
predicated on the provisions of Section 21 of the Charter of the City of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, to supersede the first named 57 petitioners’ previous 
appointments extended to them by the Secretary of Public Works and 
Communications, duly approved by the Commissioner of Civil 
Service.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">“The appointments of the 
petitioners made by then Mayor Sergio <span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span>, Jr., 
were thereafter submitted to the Bureau of Civil Service and the Executive 
Secretary for approval as required by law, but the same were disapproved (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. ‘<span class="GramE">C’ and <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> ‘15’). The City Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, in a letter dated October 22, 1957, asked for the 
reconsideration of the ruling of the Commissioner of Civil Service (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 'D'), and the latter again denied to reconsider his 
opinion but reiterated his ruling disapproving the appointments extended to the 
petitioners by the Mayor of the City of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Cebu</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. 
<span class="GramE">'E’, 'E-1’, ‘E-2’ and ‘15’).</span> The City Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> then appealed the ruling of the Commissioner of Civil 
Service to the President of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> who, through the Executive 
Secretary, disapproved also the said appointments (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. ‘F’, '15' and ‘17'), Petitioners admitted having been 
paid of their salaries up to June 15, 1958, in spite of the order of the Auditor 
General disallowing said payment. In view of the denial of the Commissioner of 
Civil Service and the Executive Secretary to reconsider their rulings 
disapproving the appointments of the petitioners (except Hon. Ramon <span class="SpellE">Duterte</span>), and of the fact that the Auditor General, since 
November, 1957, ordered the suspension and disallowing to pass in audit the 
salaries of the petitioners under the appointments extended by then Mayor Sergio 
<span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span>, Jr., the present action was 
filed.<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The petition prayed for judgment 
(1) directing the Bureau of Civil Service and the Executive Secretary to approve 
the appointments extended by the City Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> in 
their favor; (2) enjoining the Secretary of Public Works and Communications and 
the Manager of the National Waterworks and Sewerage Authority from exercising 
the power of appointment over the personnel of the <span class="SpellE">Osmena</span> Waterworks System; (3) ordering the Auditor General 
and the City Auditor of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> to approve the payment of 
their salaries and promotions as authorized by the City Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>; (4) condemning the respondents, jointly and severally, 
to pay to the petitioners P200,000.00 as compensatory, moral and exemplary 
damages, P25,000.00 as attorney's fees and also the costs of the suit; and (5) 
such other <span class="SpellE">reliefs</span> as the Court may deem just, proper 
and equitable, including the issuance of a writ of preliminary mandatory 
injunction directing the Auditor General and the City Auditor of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> to pay the officers and employees of the <span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span> Waterworks System, pending termination of the case, 
their salaries and promotions for services actually rendered, meaning to approve 
the payments thereof. Petitioners, however, withdrew in open court their 
petition for the issuance of a writ of preliminary mandatory injunction. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In their separate answers, the 
respondents asserted in common that the petition states no valid and sufficient 
cause of action; that it is in violation of the doctrine of separation of powers 
in that it asks the court to intervene with the exercise of executive functions 
by the office of the President; and that the trial court is without jurisdiction 
to entertain the action it being in effect an appeal from the decision of the 
respondent Auditor General promulgated more than one month from the date the 
action was filed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The lower court, after trial, 
dismissed the petition, declaring that the power to appoint the officers and 
employees of the <span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span> Waterworks System is lodged in 
the Secretary of Public Works and Communications by virtue of section 8 of Act 
2009 creating the said system, and as expressly provided in paragraph 2, section 
9 of Republic Act 1383 creating the National Waterworks and Sewerage 
Administration. The court further stated: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"It is urged by the petitioners 
that, upon humanitarian considerations, the petitioners who have religiously 
performed their respective tasks and rendered satisfactory service to the 
inhabitants of the City of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Cebu</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> deserve lenient consideration 
and regard for which reason they should be paid for their services. As a matter 
of justice and equity, the Court is of the view that the first 55 named 
petitioners who have been appointed officers and employees of the <span class="SpellE">Osmena</span> Waterworks System by virtue of the appointments made 
by the Secretary of Public Works and Communications, duly approved, be paid of 
their salaries according to the rates therein authorized. With respect to the 12 
last named petitioners, namely: (1) Jorge <span class="SpellE">Duterte</span>, (2) 
<span class="SpellE">Epifanio</span> <span class="SpellE">Aban</span>, (3) <span class="SpellE">Diosdado</span> <span class="SpellE">Abangan</span>, (4) Julian <span class="SpellE">Antiporta</span>, (5) <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabellon</span>, (6) <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span> <span class="SpellE">Cardiente</span>, (7) Vicente <span class="SpellE">Durano</span>, (8) 
Isidro <span class="SpellE">Godinez</span>, (9) <span class="SpellE">Artemio</span> 
<span class="SpellE">LucenOj</span> (10) <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> Robles, 
(11) Aurelio Samson, and (12) Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Zabala</span>, who were 
appointed by the Mayor of the City of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, they 
should also be paid by the City of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> their services 
actually rendered on the basis of the Minimum Wage Law up to the time they have 
been duly advised of the rulings of the Commissioner of Civil Service and the 
Executive Secretary disapproving their appointments. However, the City of 
</span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Cebu</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, not being made a party hereto, 
cannot be reached by the effect of this pronouncement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"On the other hand, it is also 
urged by the respondents upon this Court, in their counter petition, to grant 
injunctive <span class="SpellE">reliefs</span>: ordering the City Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> and other city officers concerned to turn over without 
further delay the administration, control and supervision and jurisdiction of 
the <span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span> Waterworks System to the National 
Waterworks and Sewerage Authority; to desist from further interfering with the 
affairs of the said system constituting acts of administration, jurisdiction, 
supervision and control thereof; prohibiting the Mayor of the City of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> from further exercising the power of appointment over 
the officers and employees of the <span class="SpellE">Osmena</span> Waterworks 
System, and from further disturbing the civil service status of the officers and 
employees thereof; and ordering the restoration to the Office of those officers 
and employees of the <span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span> Waterworks System who were 
unlawfully ousted, including Mr. <span class="SpellE">Timoteo</span> Y. <span class="SpellE">Omay</span>, Superintendent of the said System. The Court believes, 
however, that what <span class="GramE">is</span> substantially asked by the 
respondents are matters which are incidental to and necessarily involved in that 
case now on appeal before the Supreme Court, and for that reason, it cannot 
entertain the same." <o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Failing in their motion for the 
reconsideration of the decision, the petitioners have appealed. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The Manager of the NAWASA, one of 
the respondents, also appealed, but only that portion of the decision where the 
court refused to entertain respondents' counter-petition for an order to have 
the administration, control and supervision and jurisdiction of the <span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span> Waterworks System transferred to the NAWASA, while 
the case <u>City of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> v. The National Waterworks 
and Sewerage Authority</u>, G. R. No. L-<span class="GramE">12892,</span> was 
pending before this Court, It is needless to pass upon the appeal interposed by 
the said respondent as the case aforementioned was already decided by us on 
<span class="SpellE">Decwmber</span> 29, 1960. Declaring the <span class="SpellE">Osmena</span> Waterworks System to be a patrimonial property of the 
City of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Cebu</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, in that decision, we reaffirmed 
our previous declaration in <u>City of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> v. 
NAWASA</u>, G. R. No. <span class="GramE">L-12032, </span></span><st1:date month="8" day="31" year="1959"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">August 31, 
1959</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, of the unconstitutionality of 
Republic Act 1383, creating the NAWASA, insofar as it expropriates the 
waterworks systems in the various cities without providing for an effective 
payment of just compensation.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> Our ruling in these cases was 
clarified in the case of <u>Municipality of Carlota v. NAWASA</u>, G. R. No. 
L-20232, </span><st1:date month="12" day="29" year="1964"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 29, 
1964</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
where it was held that jurisdiction, supervision and control of waterworks owned 
by the city may not be vested in the NAWASA without destroying the integrity of 
the city's right of dominion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petitioners' appeal hinges on 
this lone question: Who is the official vested by law with the power of 
appointment over the officers and employees of the <span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span> Waterworks System? Petitioner's contention that the 
Mayor of the City of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Cebu</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> possesses the power in question 
is based on section 1916 of the Revised Administrative Code, which reads, in 
part: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"In their respective districts, 
district engineers shall operate and maintain all municipal and provincial 
waterworks in accordance with the general regulations jointly issued by the 
Secretary of Interior and the Director of Public Works, and superintendents of 
waterworks, inspectors, plumbers, pump engineers, and all other employees as may 
be necessary for the proper operation and maintenance of these systems shall be 
under his direct supervision. Employees of the systems owned or administered by 
the province shall be appointed by him with the advice and consent of the 
provincial board and those of the mayor in accordance with section twenty one 
hundred and ninety nine as amended of the Administrative Code upon 
recommendation of the district engineer." <o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">and</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> section 21 of the Charter of the 
City of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Cebu</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, Commonwealth Act 58, which 
states that "the Mayor shall appoint all other officers and employees of the 
city whose appointment is not otherwise provided for by law." 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The above contention deserves 
scant consideration. The cited provision of the administrative code clearly 
refers to waterworks owned or administered by provinces and municipalities and 
does not include chartered cities, And the power of the city mayor under section 
21 of the <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City charter applies only if the 
appointment is not otherwise provided by law. <span class="GramE">Section 30, 
Article IV of the City Charter of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> states that the 
City Engineer shall have the care and custody of the public system of waterworks 
and sewers, and all sources of water supply.</span> In relation to the duties 
and functions of City Engineers in all chartered cities, Commonwealth Act 424 
states: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"The City engineers of chartered 
cities shall be under the supervision and control of the Director of Public 
Works.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"The assistant engineers, 
superintendents and other employees as are from time to time provided for in 
appropriation ordinances of the city <u>shall be appointed in accordance with 
existing laws governing the appointment of civil engineers, assistant civil 
engineers, and other personnel</u> in the various engineering districts of the 
Bureau of Public Works in the provinces." (<span class="GramE">underlining</span> 
supplied)<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In Enrique 
Morales v. City Engineer of the City of </span></span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Cavite</span></span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, G. R. 
No.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> L-11665, 
December 29, 1960, where the power to appoint the employees of the <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> Waterworks System was put at issue, this Court, thru 
Justice <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, has expressed the opinion that Section 
79(d) of the Revised Administrative Code is the provision referred to in the 
above quotation (underlined portions) governing the appointment of personnel in 
the engineering districts of the Bureau of Public Works. Said section says: 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"The Department Head, upon the 
recommendation of the Chief of the bureau or office concerned, shall appoint all 
subordinate officers and <span class="GramE">employees</span> whose appointment is 
not expressly vested by law in the President of the 
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, and may remove or punish them, 
except as especially provided otherwise, in accordance with the Civil Service 
Law. x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"The Department Head also may, 
from time to time, in the interest of the service, change the distribution among 
the several bureaus and offices of his Department of the employees or 
subordinates authorized by law."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The conclusion was thus reached 
in that case that the power to appoint officers and employees of the <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> Waterworks System is lodged in the Secretary of 
Public Works and <span class="SpellE">Comniunications</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Since, by virtue of section 8, 
Act 2009, the law creating the <span class="SpellE">Osmena</span> Waterworks 
System, "the Director of Public Works of the Philippines shall have exclusive 
charge and control of all work to be done and improvements to be made" under the 
said Act, and in view of the similarity in the provision of the charters of the 
cities of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> and <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> 
regarding their Engineering Departments, We see no reason to deviate from the 
ruling laid down in the <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> Waterworks case, 
<u>supra.</u> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is noteworthy that previous to 
the questioned appointments made by the Mayor of the City of 
</span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Cebu</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> to employees of the <span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span> Waterworks System in 1956, the City had recognized 
and acquiesced to the appointments extended by the Secretary of Public Works and 
Communications to such employees who were then receiving their salaries as 
authorized in said appointments.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In conclusion, <span class="GramE">We</span> declare that it is the Secretary of Public Works and 
Communication who is empowered to appoint the officers and employees of the 
<span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span> Waterworks System. In this respect, and the 
declaration Chat the petitioners employees of the <span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span> Waterworks are entitled to salaries for services 
rendered (a) for those appointed by the Secretary of Public Works and 
Communications, at the rates therein authorized; and (b) for those appointed by 
the City Mayor, on the basis of the Minimum Wage Law, up to the time they have 
been duly advised of the disapproval of their appointments, We are affirming the 
decision of the lower court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In conformity with the ruling 
laid down in a line of decisions where payment of back salaries to city 
employees was ordered although the city had not been made a party therein, We 
consider the City of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> a party in this action and, 
at this instance, liable for the payment of salaries of the <span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span> Waterworks for services actually rendered.
