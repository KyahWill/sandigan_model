(Criminal Case No. 182).</p>

<p class="BODY">The judgment of conviction was based on the following evidence
for the prosecution:</p>

<p class="BODY">Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span>, a thirty-one year

through another <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Makati</span></st1:place></st1:city>
policeman the things that they had taken from him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Later, <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span> filed with the City <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span> office of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
a complaint for grave coercion, kidnapping and robbery against <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> Carlos and seven members of the <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Makati</span></st1:place></st1:city> police force, namely,
Captain Gabriel <span class="SpellE">Bayle</span>, Sergeant Pedro <span class="SpellE">Espejo</span>, Corporals <span class="SpellE">Hipolito</span> <span class="SpellE">Jagar</span> and Romeo <span class="SpellE">Pe単a</span> and

<p class="BODY">That complaint was scheduled for preliminary investiga足tion in
the afternoon of <st1:date year="1969" day="28" month="1">January 28, 1969</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nick <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span>,
with his wife Marcela, his brother Alfredo, his friend <span class="SpellE">Amado</span>
<span class="SpellE">Busta足mante</span> and his two security guards, went to the
third floor of the City Hall on that date to attend the investigation.</p>

<p class="BODY"><st1:city><st1:place>Ventura</st1:place></st1:city> also went to
the City Hall at around two-thirty in that afternoon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span>
informed him that the investigation was postponed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the third floor, <st1:city><st1:place>Ventura</st1:place></st1:city>
and Alfredo went down to the quadrangle or interior driveway <span style="">of the City Hall and emerged at </span><st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Arroceros</span></span><span style=""> Street</span></st1:address></st1:street><span style="">, opposite the YMCA compound, where the jeep
of <span class="SpellE">Bustamante</span> was parked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nick <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span>,
with his lawyers and security guards, went out of the front or southern exit of

  Street</span></st1:address></st1:street><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Inside the jeep were Mercy <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span>,

and her companions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:city><st1:place>Ventura</st1:place></st1:city>
conversed with her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She pointed to him <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> Carlos, who was then reading a newspaper while
standing on the pavement on the eastern end of the driveway near <span class="SpellE">Arroceros</span> Street about twelve meters away from the jeep.</p>

<p class="BODY"><st1:city><st1:place>Ventura</st1:place></st1:city> harbored the
notion that Carlos (also a <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">compadre</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>of
Nick <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span>) had falsely implicated <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span> in the robbery at <span class="SpellE">Marsman</span>
&amp; Company and, therefore, in colloquial parlance, Carlos had some <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">atraso</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>or debt to pay to <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Allegedly animated by sympathy for his <span class="SpellE"><u>compadre</u></span>, Nick <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span>, </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="GramE">Ventura</span></st1:place></st1:city><span class="GramE"> imposed
upon himself the task of liquidating Carlos.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:city><st1:place>Ventura</st1:place></st1:city>
approached Carlos and at a distance of about two to three meters and without
any preliminaries shot him point blank five times with a .38 caliber
revolver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One shot hit Carlos in the
chest and another shot hit him in the abdomen when he was already prostrate on
the pavement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both shots were fatal.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the shooting, <st1:city><st1:place>Ventura</st1:place></st1:city>
walked hurriedly on <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Arroceros</span>
  Street</st1:address></st1:street>, crossed <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street> near the
city court building, entered the city court compound and headed for <st1:street><st1:address>Hospital
  Street</st1:address></st1:street> where he took a bus bound for <span class="SpellE">Quiapo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was able
to escape.</p>

<p class="BODY">He changed clothes at his residence in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He phoned <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span>
at his office in the <st1:place><st1:placename>Don</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Santiago</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Building</st1:placetype></st1:place> on <st1:street><st1:address>Taft
  Avenue</st1:address></st1:street> and informed him of the killing of
Carlos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, <st1:city><st1:place>Ventura</st1:place></st1:city>
went to the residence of <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nick gave him forty pesos and advised him to
go in hiding.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, at the scene of the crime, Patrolman Jose <span class="SpellE">Yumul</span> placed Carlos in a taxicab.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He died before reaching the hospital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The necropsy report of the chief medico-legal
officer of the Manila Police Department indicates that the thirty-three year
old victim (a native of <span class="SpellE">Paombong</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>
and a resident of <span class="SpellE">Pateros</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>)
sustained a mortal gunshot wound in the chest <span style="">and a similar wound in the abdomen.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Profuse hemorrhage </span><span style="">caused </span><span style="">his
death.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">For about a year, the police made no headway in the investigation
of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span>
wrote a letter dated <st1:date year="1970" day="13" month="1">January 13, 1970</st1:date>
to the <st1:place>Manila</st1:place> chief of police, revealing that <st1:city><st1:place>Ventura</st1:place></st1:city>
had confessed to him that he (<st1:city><st1:place>Ventura</st1:place></st1:city>)
had shot Carlos.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span> made the revelation because
he was apprehensive that he might be liquidated by <st1:city><st1:place>Ventura</st1:place></st1:city>
who had been blackmailing him and threatening to link him to the killing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:city><st1:place>Ventura</st1:place></st1:city>
had been asking <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span> to give "protection
money".<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span>
gave money to <st1:city><st1:place>Ventura</st1:place></st1:city> because the
latter was a "dan足gerous character".</p>

<p class="BODY">The <st1:place>Manila</st1:place> policemen were able to get a
photograph of <st1:city><st1:place>Ventura</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They asked <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span>
to identify the photograph.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span> confirmed that it was <st1:city><st1:place>Ventura</st1:place></st1:city>'s

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1970" day="15" month="1">January 15, 1970</st1:date>
the police received reliable information that at about <st1:time minute="45" hour="9">quarter to ten</st1:time> in the morning of that day <st1:city><st1:place>Ventura</st1:place></st1:city>
would get a bottle of whiskey from <span class="SpellE">Alcantara's</span>

 <st1:placetype>Building</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As expected, at that hour a man alighted from
a taxicab, went to the drugstore, got a bottle of liquor wrapped in yellow
paper, and returned to the waiting taxi足cab.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was not <st1:city><st1:place>Ventura</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The police trailed the taxicab which
proceeded to a barbershop at <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Mabini</span>
  Street</st1:address></st1:street>, <span class="SpellE">Ermita</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="GramE">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The police operatives found <st1:city><st1:place>Ventura</st1:place></st1:city>
in that barbershop.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He tried to draw a
.38 caliber revolver when the policemen sought to arrest him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They overpowered him and confiscated <span style="">his </span>revolver, ammunition pouch, and a
cartridge belt.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the course of the investigation at the police headquarters, <st1:city><st1:place>Ventura</st1:place></st1:city>
confessed to Detective Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Yanquiling</span> that he
was the killer of Carlos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:city><st1:place>Ventura</st1:place></st1:city>'s
confession was reduced to writing in question-and-answer form.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It consists of four pages, typed<span style=""> single-space.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He signed it and <span class="SpellE">initialled</span>
the corrections contained therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
signed the confession before Assistant Fiscal Rodolfo A. <span class="SpellE">Nocon</span>
of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> when he swore to it on that same day, </span><st1:date year="1970" day="5" month="1"><span style="">January 5,
 1970</span></st1:date><span style="">, the day he was
arrested.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the afternoon of that day, <st1:city><st1:place>Ventura</st1:place></st1:city>
voluntarily re足enacted the commission of the crime or the shooting of
Carlos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pictures of <st1:city><st1:place>Ventura</st1:place></st1:city>
were taken during the reenactment of the crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">Detective <span class="SpellE">Yanquiling</span> inquired from the
CIS whether <st1:city><st1:place>Ventura</st1:place></st1:city>, as he claimed,
"belongs to the Police Intelligence Branch of the CIS".<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Yanquiling</span> was
informed that <st1:city><st1:place>Ventura</st1:place></st1:city> was not a CIS
agent and that the CIS had not issued any firearm to him.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Amado</span> <span class="SpellE">Bustamante</span>,
an eyewitness to the shooting of Carlos, saw <st1:city><st1:place>Ventura</st1:place></st1:city>,
with his drawn revolver, approaching Carlos, who was then standing on the
cemented pavement, facing the YMCA building.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He testified that <st1:city><st1:place>Ventura</st1:place></st1:city>
fired suc足cessive shots at Carlos at close range.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Bustamante</span> saw
Carlos sprawled on the pavement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He saw <st1:city><st1:place>Ventura</st1:place></st1:city>
"leaving hurriedly going towards <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Arroceros</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>".</p>

<p class="BODY">After the shooting, <span class="SpellE">Bustamante</span> went to
the Bungalow Restaurant together with his four lady companions and narrated to
Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span> the shooting incident which he just
witnessed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although <span class="SpellE">Bustamante</span>
feared for his life, he said that he had no choice but to tell to the court
what he had seen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He kept silent for
almost one year but when lately <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span> informed
him that <st1:city><st1:place>Ventura</st1:place></st1:city> was linking him (<span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span>) to the shooting, <span class="SpellE">Bustamante</span>
insisted that that falsehood must be exposed.</p>

<p class="BODY"><st1:city><st1:place>Ventura</st1:place></st1:city> disclosed in
his confession that he had killed <span class="SpellE">Totoy</span>, his <span class="SpellE"><u>bilas</u></span> or the husband of his wife's sister, and one <span class="SpellE">Severino</span> de Villa on <st1:date year="1968" day="1" month="4"><span style="">April 1, 1968</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>He

<p class="BODY">On January 17, 1970, or two days after he was arrested, <st1:city><st1:place>Ventura</st1:place></st1:city>
was charged with the murder of Carlos.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As already stated, he was convicted after trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was represented by a counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
had pleaded not guilty notwithstanding his con<span style="">fession.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><st1:city><st1:place>Ventura</st1:place></st1:city> took the
witness stand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He tried to repudiate his
confession and create the impression that Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span>
(the brother of Nicolas) was the killer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He identified himself as an undercover agent of the <span class="SpellE">Metrocom</span>
Police Intelligence Service.</p>

<p class="BODY">He testified that his confession and the reenactment were not
voluntary because he was afraid that he might be killed if he did not cooperate
with the police.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He claimed that he was
con足nected with the Metropolitan Command (<span class="SpellE">Metrocom</span>)
and that he was allowed to possess a .38 caliber revolver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He supposedly<span style=""> conducted missions as an infiltrator of the underworld.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">He </span>explained that
on <st1:date year="1970" day="15" month="1">January 15, 1970</st1:date> he was
in an <span class="SpellE">Ermita</span> barbershop because he was going to
confer with a <span class="SpellE">Metrocom</span> lieutenant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was surprised by <st1:place>Manila</st1:place>
policemen in the barbershop.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He told
them that he was framed up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the way
to the police headquarters, Patrolman P. <span class="SpellE">Doplito</span>
allegedly warned him to cooperate or else he would be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said that he was interro足gated by the
police at the Springfield Hotel in front of the Hilton Hotel.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, he was brought to the tourist police headquarters at
the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Luneta</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Park</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
where he was investigated by Corporal <span class="SpellE">Yanquiling</span> and
six husky detectives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said that he admitted
the killing of Carlos because he feared for his life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He swore to his confession before Fiscal <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Nocon</span></span><span style=""> because he was accompanied by armed
policemen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reenactment of the crime
was </span>made at the behest of <span style="">Lieutenant
<span class="SpellE">Ildefonso</span> <span class="SpellE">Labao</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Ventura testified that he had known <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span>
for only five years and not ten years as claimed by the latter and that <span class="SpellE">Alcantara's</span> business consists of "robberies, hijacking
and explosions and selling fake drugs to the residents of <span class="SpellE">Tondo</span>
and suburban towns" (8 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span> April 29, 1970).</p>

<p class="BODY">He declared that on <st1:date year="1969" day="27" month="1">January
 27, 1969</st1:date> or on the eve of the preliminary investigation, he was at <span style="">the </span>residence of Nick <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Alcantara</span></span><span style=""> and he heard Nick giving instructions </span>to
<span style="">his brother Fred and his friend <span class="SpellE">Bustamante</span> to liquidate Carlos </span>by hook or by
crook.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was requested by Nick to be
present at the preliminary investigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">He admitted that he was at the City Hall in the afternoon of <st1:date year="1969" day="28" month="1">January 28, 1969</st1:date> and that he talked
with Mercy <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He said that he saw Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span> going
towards the place where Carlos was standing and <span class="GramE">that</span>
ten minutes later he heard gunshots.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then, Alfredo boarded a taxicab.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">The jeep wherein <span style="">Mercy <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bustamante</span> were

<p class="BODY"><st1:city><st1:place>Ventura</st1:place></st1:city> pointed to
Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span> as the mastermind behind the
killing and as the person who framed him up.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A ballistics expert from the Manila Police Department, testifying for
the defense, declared that the three bullets (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
1-E to 1-G) allegedly fired from <st1:city><st1:place>Ventura</st1:place></st1:city>'s
revolver had not been fired from it as shown by a comparison between those
exhibits and the test bullets.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However,
the expert admitted that the barrel of the revolver could have been changed
after the shooting to mislead the ballistician.</p>

<p class="BODY"><st1:city><st1:place>Ventura</st1:place></st1:city> in this
appeal contends that the trial court erred in convicting him of murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He argues that the confession and reenactment
were vitiated by duress; that he had no motive for killing Carlos; that he was
not positively identified as the <span class="SpellE">gunwielder</span>, and that
certain circumstances engender doubt as to his guilt.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's contentions are devoid of merit and do not deserve
serious consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His detailed
confession bears the earmarks of <span class="SpellE">voluntariness</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is a photograph of <st1:city><st1:place>Ven足tura</st1:place></st1:city>
signing his confession before Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Nocon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are <span style="">twenty-one pictures of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Ventura</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> replaying his role as the assassin of
Carlos.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">His averment that the police threatened to kill him if he did not
cooperate is a very transparent concoction.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His testimony intimating that Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span>
shot Carlos, as directed by his brother Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span>,
is an eleventh hour fabrication.</p>

<p class="BODY">His confession and the eyewitness-testimony of <span class="SpellE">Busta足mante</span> leave no room for doubt that he was the <span class="SpellE">gunwielder</span> who callously shot Carlos in broad daylight in a
public place in the presence of many persons.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record reveals that he is a hardened killer, who having
previously killed two persons and not having been prose足cuted for those acts,
had become trigger-happy and had no compunction in using his gun to kill the
enemy of his <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">compadre</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>just to earn a few pesos and perhaps
display his hubris or <u><span style="">machismo</span></u><span style="">.<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The killing should be characterized as murder because it was
