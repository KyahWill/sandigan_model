(Civil Case No. 55056) dismissing, <span style="">on the ground of prescription, the </span>amended
complaint of plaintiff-appellant, The American Insurance Company, as against
alternative defendant <span class="SpellE">Macondray</span> &amp; Co., Inc.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 11, 1962, a certain cargo insured with <span class="GramE">plaintiff corporation</span> was shipped in New York, U.S. A. aboard
"M/S <span style="">TOREADOR", </span>of
which the general agent <span style="">in </span>the Philippines is <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Macondray</span> &amp; Co., Inc. (hereinafter referred to as <span class="SpellE">Macondray</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The cargo,
with an invoice value of $3,539.61 CIF <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, was
consigned to the order of the importer Atlas Consolidated Mining and
Development Corporation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Inasmuch as the final port of call of the "M/S <span style="">TOREADOR" was </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">, the carrier, in </span><span style="">accepting </span><span style="">the cargo </span><span style="">at the point of shipment, agreed to transship the </span>same, <span style="">after its discharge <span style="">in </span></span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">, aboard an inter-island vessel to its destination in </span><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Cebu</span></span></st1:place><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="18" month="9">September 18, 1962</st1:date>
the "M/S TOREADOR" arrived <span style="">at
the </span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span style="">port</span></st1:placetype><span style=""> of </span><st1:placename><span style="">Manila</span></st1:placename></st1:place><span style=""> and </span>on the same date discharged the
cargo in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to the
arrangement the cargo was subsequently loaded aboard the "SS <span style="">SIQUIJOR, an </span>inter-island <span style="">vessel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The shipment was finally discharged <span style="">in </span><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place>
on <st1:date year="1962" day="24" month="9">September 24, 1962</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">When the consignee took delivery of the shipment it was found to <span style="">be </span>short of two (2) pieces of tractor
parts worth $2,834.88, or P11<span class="GramE">,063.12</span> at the exchange
rate of P3.9025.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff paid the
insured value of the lost merchandise to the consignee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To recover the said sum of P11<span class="GramE">,063.12</span> plaintiff, as <span class="SpellE">subrogee</span> of
the consignee's rights, filed on <st1:date year="1963" day="24" month="9">September
 24, 1963</st1:date> a complaint against the <span class="SpellE">Compañia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Maritima</span> and the <span class="SpellE">Visayan</span> <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Terminal Co., <span style="">Inc.
as alternative defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The
former was sued as operator and owner of "SS SIQUIJOR" and the latter
as operator of the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> service at the <st1:place><st1:placetype>port</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename></st1:place>
charged with the care and custody of all cargo discharge there.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of <span class="SpellE">Maritima's</span> allegation in its
answer that the lost merchandise had not actually been delivered to it,
plaintiff filed on <st1:date year="1964" day="6" month="11">November 6, 1964</st1:date>
<span style="">a </span>motion to admit its amended
complaint <span class="SpellE">impleading</span> <span class="SpellE">Macondray</span>
and Luzon Brokerage Corporation as additional defendants and elimina­ting the <span class="SpellE">Visayan</span> <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Terminal Co.,
Inc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to <span style="">plaintiff, "the amended complaint </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">necessary in view of </span>defendant <span class="SpellE">Maritima's</span> assertion and records tending to show that the
lost merchandise was not delivered to it, contrary to <span class="SpellE">Macondray’s</span>
representation, even after the filing of the original <span class="GramE">complaint,
that</span> the cargo was delivered to <span class="SpellE">Maritima</span>."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The amended complaint was admitted on <st1:date year="1964" day="14" month="11"><span style="">November
 14, 1964</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On December 23, 1964 <span class="SpellE">Macondray</span> moved to
dismiss the amended complaint against it on the ground that plain­tiff's action
had already prescribe under the provisions <span style="">of the carriage of Goods </span><span style="">by </span><span style="">Sea Act</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*</span></span></a><span style=""> which provides in </span><span style="">section </span><span style="">3 (6):<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"In any <span style="">event, </span>the carrier and the ship shall be discharged from all
liability in respect of loss or damage <u>unless suit is </u><u><span style="">brought within one year </span></u><u><span style="">after delivery </span></u><u><span style="">of the goods or the date when the goods is
all have been</span></u><u><span style=""> de</span></u><u><span style="">l</span></u><u><span style="">iv</span></u><u><span style="">e</span></u><u><span style="">r</span></u><u><span style="">ed:</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>”<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Macondray</span> contended that since the
amended complaint in which it was <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> for the
first time was filed only on November 6, 1964 and admitted on November 14,
1964, the period of one year had expired whether reckoned from one or the other
of the two dates, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>September 18,
1962, when the "M/S TOREADOR" arrived at the port of Manila and
discharged the cargo for transshipment to <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> on
board the "SS SIQUIJOR”, and September 24, 1962 when the ship­ment finally
arrived <span style="">in </span><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> and was discharged the same day.</p>

<p class="BODY">The motion to dismiss was granted and plaintiff interposed the
present appeal from the order of dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Plaintiff avers that the one year prescriptive period provided for in
the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act does not apply <span style="">in </span>this case, which should be governed
by the statute of limitations in the Civil Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In support of this con­tention it is pointed
out that the cargo in question was transshipment cargo; that the discharge
thereof in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> terminated the
obligation of <span class="SpellE">Macondray</span> as carrier; and that its
obligation to transship the cargo to <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place>
was merely that of a "forwarding agent" of the shipper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reliance is placed on Clause 11 of the bill
of lading which states:</p>

<blockquote>"This carrier, in making arrangements for any transshipping or
forwarding vessel or means of transportation not operated by this carrier shall
be considered solely the <u>forwarding agent of the shipper</u> and without any
other responsibility.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We do not see that the use of the term "forwarding agent of
the shipper" is decisive of the issue.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>According to paragraph 4 of the amended complaint the cargo was loaded
on board the "M/S TOREADOR" in <st1:state><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:state>,
"freight prepaid to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> . . . pursuant to the bill of
lading No. 13." In other words, the action is based on the contract of
carriage up to the final port of <span style="">destination, which was </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
for which the corresponding freight had been prepaid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The following provisions of the bill of
lading are the ones directly in point:</p>

<p class="NUM">"1. This bill of lading shall have effect subject to the provisions
of the Carriage of Goods by <span style="">Sea Act of </span>the United States of America, approved <span style="">April 16, 1936, </span>which
shall be deemed to be incorporated herein and nothing <span style="">herein con</span><span style="">t</span><span style="">ained shall be </span>deemed a surrender by the
Carrier of any of its rights or immunities or an increase of any of its
responsibilities or liabilities under said Act.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The provisions stated in said Act (except <span style="">as </span><span style="">may </span><span style="">be otherwise
specifically provided herein) shall govern before </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">goods are loaded on and after they are</span> <span style="">dis</span><span style="">charged from the ship and throughout the entire time the goods </span>are
in the <span style="">custody of the Carrier.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span></span></span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">"19. In any event the Carrier and the ship shall be
discharged from <span style="">all </span>liability in respect of loss <span style="">or </span>damage unless suit <span style="">is </span>brought within <span style="">one year </span><span style="">after delivery of
the goods </span><span style="">or </span><span style="">the date </span>when the goods should have <span style="">been </span>de<span style="">livered.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The
</span>transshipment of the <span style="">cargo </span>from
<st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> to <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place> was not a <span style="">separate transaction from that originally entered </span>into by <span class="SpellE">Macondray</span>, as general agent for the "M/S TOREADOR."
It <span style="">was part
of <span class="SpellE">Macondray's</span> </span>obligation under the contract
of carriage and the fact that the transshipment was <span style="">made via an </span>inter-island <span style="">vessel
did not operate to remove the </span>transaction from the operation of the
