<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petitioners seek review of a 
decision of the Court of Agrarian Relations. On October 13, 1961 Asuncion V. 
Sanchez filed a suit for "liquidation [of harvest], injunction: and <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>", against <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Tuvera</span> and Roman Marquez, in the Court of Agrarian 
Relations, First Regional District, <span class="SpellE">Tayug</span>, Pangasinan. 
She alleged, <i>inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span></i>, that <span class="SpellE">Tuvera</span> and Marquez are share-tenants in her agricultural 
land of 3.5 hectares, planted to <span class="SpellE">palay</span> and mango, at 
barrio <span class="SpellE">Unzad</span>, <span class="SpellE">Villasis</span>, 
<span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>; that as such they harvested the produce of 
said land for agricultural year 1960-61 but, over the objection of her overseer, 
appropriated all the harvest to themselves instead of delivering her lawful 
share therein; and that said tenants likewise made known their intention not to 
deliver her share in the late variety crop still standing on the land. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On November 2, 1961, <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Tuvera</span> filed an answer 
alleging ownership over the land and setting forth a counterclaim for attorney's 
fees, improvements and moral damages. Roman Marquez was declared in default on 
January 4, 1962 but the default order was lifted on January 23, 1962. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">At the trial, Asuncion V. Sanchez 
and her overseer, Jesus <span class="SpellE">Arcega</span>, testified in support 
of the complaint. After Asuncion V. Sanchez presented her evidence, <span class="SpellE">Tuvera</span> testified on behalf of himself and Marquez. On March 
20, 1962, however, the court postponed the hearing and ordered <span class="SpellE">Tuvera</span> and Marquez to submit, within 30 days from said date, 
a certified copy of the certificate of title allegedly in the name of their 
predecessor-in-interest. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Subsequently, the hearing was 
reset to June 6, 1962. It was again reset to June 20, 1962, on a telegraphic 
motion for postponement by counsel for <span class="SpellE">Tuvera</span> and 
Marquez, with a warning that no further postponement shall be given. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On June 20, 1962 <span class="SpellE">Tuvera</span> and Marquez did not appear. A motion to dismiss, 
however, was filed for them, dated April 26, 1962, stating that on March 15, 
1962 they filed a suit in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, against Asuncion V. Sanchez, asserting their 
ownership of the land in question. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Pursuant to the order of March 
20, 1962 the motion included, as Annex "A", "a certified copy of Original 
Certificate of Title No. 10514 in the name of <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Tuvera's</span> predecessor-in-interest". 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">For non-appearance of <span class="SpellE">Tuvera</span> and Marquez on June 20, 1962, the Agrarian Court 
proceeded to consider the case as submitted for decision on the evidence already 
on record. On July 9, 1962, therefore, it rendered judgment, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which stated: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Wherefore, judgment is hereby 
rendered in favor of petitioner Asuncion Sanchez, giving her authority to eject 
respondents <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Tuvera</span> 
and Roman Marquez from the 3.5 hectares, or less, located at Bo. <span class="SpellE">Unsad</span>, <span class="SpellE">Villasis</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>. Petitioner Sanchez is, likewise given the 
authority to appoint a new tenant or tenants of her own choice to cultivate the 
landholding in question.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"With respect to the undelivered 
shares of the petitioner, Court is without basis to adjudicate the same for lack 
of evidence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"So 
ordered."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">After their motion for 
reconsideration was denied on November 6, 1962 <span class="SpellE">Tuvera</span> 
and Marquez filed the instant petition on November 14, 1962. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petitioners herein would contend 
that the filing of their complaint in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, to litigate the ownership of the land involved, 
removed the case from the jurisdiction of the Court of Agrarian Relations. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">All cases involving the 
dispossession of a tenant by the landholder or the settlement and disposition of 
disputes arising from the relationship of landholder and tenant, fall under the 
original and exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Agrarian Relations (Sec. 21, 
R.A. 1199; Sec. 7, R.A. 1267). <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In <span class="SpellE">Abo</span> 
vs. <span class="SpellE">Philase</span> (KG) Employees &amp; Workers Union, 
L-19912, January 30, 1965, We said that jurisdiction is determined from the 
allegations in the complaint. Asuncion V. Sanchez's complaint alleged, as 
stated, that she is the landholder of the land in question, that <span class="SpellE">Tuvera</span> and Marquez are her tenants, that they deprived her 
of the landholder's share in the harvest, and that, therefore, they should be 
ejected. Accordingly, the complaint forth a cause of action for dispossession of 
a tenant the landholder of an agricultural land. Such an action within the 
exclusive original jurisdiction of the Court of Agrarian Relations (<span class="SpellE">Bakit</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Asperin</span>, 111 Phil., 
708). <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petitioners’ denial of the 
allegation that they were tenants and their claim of ownership over the <span class="GramE">land,</span> did not terminate the jurisdiction of the 
</span><st1:street><st1:address><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Agrarian 
Court</span></st1:address></st1:street><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. As this Court ruled in <span class="SpellE">Mandih</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Tablantin</span>, 107 Phil., 
530, said jurisdiction subsists even if the landlord-tenant relationship is 
denied and the alleged tenant asserts ownership over the land, "since the law 
does not exclude from the Jurisdiction of the Court of Agrarian Relations, cases 
in which a tenant claims ownership over the land given to him for cultivation by 
the landlord". <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Similarly, the suit to litigate 
the question of ownership, filed in the Court of First Instance <i>after</i> the 
Court of Agrarian Relations had acquired jurisdiction over the case in question, 
did not divest the latter of its jurisdiction. 'It is axiomatic that once a 
court had acquired jurisdiction over a case, it continues to have that 
jurisdiction, until the case is terminated (States Marine Corporation, et al. 
vs. <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Seamen's Association, Inc., L-12444, February 
28, 1963). <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Substantial evidence supports the 
Agrarian Court's finding that petitioners herein are tenants of Asuncion V. 
Sanchez in her landholding and that they deliberately failed to deliver said 
landholder's share in the harvest of agricultural year 1960-61. Asuncion V. 
Sanchez, as well as her overseer, Jesus <span class="SpellE">Arcega</span>, 
testified to the foregoing. She has also shown that the present Transfer 
Certificate of Title over the <span class="SpellE">land—T.C.T</span>. No. 5995 
issued on April 30, 1947—is in her name. Petitioners herein rely on the Original 
Certificate of Title No. 10514, in the name of Bernardino <span class="SpellE">Tuvera</span> and Maria <span class="SpellE">Duaso</span>. The same, 
however, had long been cancelled (on June 14, 1928) by Transfer Certificate of 
Title No. 3949, in the name of <span class="SpellE">Flaviano</span> N. <span class="SpellE">Oliva</span>. Since then a series of five Transfer Certificates of 
Title had admittedly been issued, before Asuncion V. Sanchez obtained the 
present title. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We therefore find no reason to 
alter the finding of the Agrarian Court that petitioners herein are tenants of 
Asuncion V. Sanchez who may be dispossessed of the land holding, pursuant to 
Section 50 (c) of Republic Act 1199, for deliberate failure to deliver the 
landholder's share. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the judgment appealed from is 
hereby affirmed with costs against herein petitioners. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">SO ORDERED</span></b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
