 accused, on the occasion of the commission of the crime 
above-mentioned, held and brought Catalina Sabado and Susana Sabado, 
daughters of the said Donata Rebolledo, to a sugarcane field which is a 
secluded and uninhabited place, at Barrio Bangar, Victoria, Tarlac, and 
once there and after tying together the respective forearms of the said 
Catalina Sabado and Susana Sabado, in pursuance of their concerted 
conspiracy, by means of force and grave abuse of superior strength, the 
said accused did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously, 
stab the said Catalina Sabado and Susana Sabado on different parts of 
their body and cut their necks with a sharp pointed instrument (scythe),
 as a result of which the latter died instantly.
  </p>
  <p>"That in the commission of the crime abovementioned, there 
concurred the aggravating circumstances of (1) abuse of superior 
strength, (2) nighttime, (3) uninhabited place, (4) by a band, (5) 
treachery, and (6) disregard of sex." (pp. 116-117, <em>rollo</em>) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Criminal Case No. 2293 Lorenzo Alviar was also charged of illegal possession of firearm and ammunition, <em>viz</em>:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>"That on or about November 24, 1959, in the Municipality of 
Victoria, Province of Tarlac, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction 
of this Honorable Court, the above named accused, without authority of 
law, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have in 
his possession and under his control a firearm, to wit:  a <em>paltik</em>
 revolver caliber 22 with eight (8) rounds of ammunition, without first 
obtaining the corres-ponding license or permit to keep and possess the 
same.” (pp. 117-118, <em>ibid</em>.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The two cases were jointly heard by the trial court, In a joint 
decision rendered on December 10, 1968, by then Presiding Judge, Hon. 
Arturo B. Santos, all the accused were found guilty as charged.  In 
Criminal Case No. 2253 (robbery with double homicide) the accused Fausto
 Damaso, Lorenzo Alviar, Bonifacio Espejo and Victoriano Eugenio were 
each sentenced to suffer the "penalty of death, to indemnify the legal 
heirs of the victims, Catalina Sabado and Susana Sabado, jointly and 
severally in the amount of P12,000.00 for each of the victims, plus the 
sum of P15.00 which was the money taken by the accused, and to pay the 
costs, share and share alike." One of the accused, Estanislao Gregorio, 
was no longer included in the sentence because he died on April 6, 1967 
while the cases were still undergoing trial.
</p><p>In Criminal Case No. 2293, accused Lorenzo Alviar was sentenced "to three years imprisonment and to pay the costs."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
</p><p>The evidence of the prosecution as found by the trial court establish the following incidents:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>
</p><p>Donata Rebolledo and her son-in-law, Victoriano de la Cruz were 
residents of Barrio Bangar, municipality of Victoria, province of 
Tarlac.  At about 9 o'clock in the evening of November 21, 1959, Donata 
and Victoriano heard the barkings of dogs outside their house.  Shortly,
 two men armed with guns, entered, pointed their weapons at them, tied 
up the hands of Victoriano, covered him with a blanket and asked Donata 
for the whereabouts of her daughter Catalina Sabado.  Stricken by fear, 
Donata kept silent and blocked the door leading to her daughter's room 
but was promptly pushed aside.  Donata was then ordered to open an "<em>aparador</em>"
 from which the two men took valuables like jewelry, clothing, 
documents, and cutting instruments.  All the while, Donata and 
Victoriano could hear the movements and voices of some three to four 
other persons beneath the house.  The two men brought Catalina Sabado 
down from the house and then asked where they could find Susana Sabado, 
Donata's other daughter who was then in her store located about five 
meters away in the same house.  Thereafter, Donata heard the men opening
 the door to Susana's store.  After several minutes, feeling that the 
intruders had left, Donata untied the hands of Victoriano and asked him 
to go to the store to see if her daughters were there.  When the two 
women could not be found, Donata sent Victoriano to the barrio 
lieutenant to report the incident.  Accordingly, Victoriano went to the 
barrio lieutenant and the two later went to town to inform the police of
 the occurrence.
</p><p>On the same night, Chief of Police Pedro Valdez, with the aid of 
several policemen and a handful of civilians went out in search for the 
Sabado sisters.  It was only the following morning when the two women 
were found already dead with wounds in several parts of their bodies.  
They were found in a sugar plantation belonging to one Ignacio Fabros, 
located about one hundred meters from Donata Rebollado’s house.
</p><p>Dr. Carlos Briones, Municipal Health Officer of Victoria 
performed the autopsy on the two bodies and reported that the deaths 
were caused by profuse hemorrhage due to a fatal, big, wide, gaping and 
deep lacerated wound just above the Adam's apple.  He also testified in 
court that the death weapon must have been a sharp instrument with a 
pointed tip, like a scythe.
</p><p>A few days after the incident, Donata Rebolledo singled out the 
accused Fausto Damaso from a police line-up as one of the men who went 
up to her house on that evening.  She and Victoriano had recognized 
Damaso because of the light coming from a kerosene lamp placed on a 
small table near the "<em>aparador</em>." Damaso, however, initially 
denied ever having been to Donata's house that night.  Later, the PC 
rounded up four other suspects in the persons of co-accused Gregorio, 
Eugenio, Alviar and Espejo.
</p><p>As further evidence, the prosecution presented separate 
extra-judicial statements, sworn to before Municipal Judge Conrado de 
Gracia of Paniqui, Tarlac, wherein all the five accused admitted having 
participated in the crime.
</p><p>In his sworn statement marked as Exhibit "J", Fausto Damaso 
stated that he was with his co-accused Gregorio, Eugenio, Alviar and 
Espejo on the night the Sabado sisters were killed; that he never went 
into the house of Donata Rebolledo as Eugenio and Gregorio were the ones
 who did; that it was Gregorio and Eugenio who actually did the killing 
while he, Alviar and Espejo merely stood by; that the victims were 
stabbed and their throats cut with a reaping knife (<em>pangapas</em> or <em>lait</em>);
 that the killing was motivated by the failure of the older woman 
(Catalina) to pay for a carabao bought from Gregorio; and that on that 
evening, Gregorio, Eugenio, Alviar and Espejo were carrying caliber .45 
pistols while he was unarmed.
</p><p>In a subsequent statement marked as Exhibit "P", Damaso 
reiterated his claim that it was Gregorio who actually stabbed and cut 
the throats of the victims in the presence of all the accused; that 
Catalina was killed ahead of Susana; that Gregorio killed Susana as she 
was being held by Eugenio; and that while still in the house, they were 
able to get P15 from Susana's store.  Contrary to what he confessed in 
his previous sworn statement, he admitted that it was he and Eugenio who
 went up to Donata Rebolledo's house and not Eugenio and Gregorio.  He 
also changed his theory as to the motive for the killings, declaring 
this time that the two women were killed because the latter had already 
recognized them.  He further stated that on that night, he was armed 
with a caliber .22 (<em>paltik</em>) revolver, Eugenio with a 12-gauge <em>paltik</em>, Gregorio with two reaping knives (<em>lait</em>), Lorenzo with a long firearm and Espejo with two stones.
</p><p>In his sworn statement, Exhibit "O", Victoriano Eugenio likewise 
admitted that he was a party to the commission of the offense; that it 
was Gregorio who conceived of the plot to commit the crime; that it was 
also Gregorio who killed the two women with a reaping knife; that after 
Catalina was killed, he held Susana by the arms as Gregorio stabbed her 
and cut her throat; that Alviar, Damaso and Lorenzo were also with them 
that night; that he did not know what motivated Gregorio to kill the 
victims; that he had no previous agreement with his co-accused to kill 
the two women; that he and Damaso were the ones who entered Donata's 
house, took P15 from the "<em>aparador</em>," brought down Catalina and also got Susana from another portion of the house; that he was then armed with a 12-gauge <em>paltik</em>, Damaso with a caliber .22 <em>paltik</em>
 revolver, Alviar with a Springfield caliber .30 rifle, Gregorio with a 
reaping knife and Espejo with two stones; and that he was with the group
 that night because at about 7 o'clock in the evening, Gregorio dropped 
by his house and invited him to Barrio Bangar where the crime was 
committed.
</p><p>In his separate statement (Exhibit "Q"), Estanislao Gregorio 
narrated that in the afternoon of November 21, 1959, his four co-accused
 came and informed him of a plan to rob the Sabado sisters, to which 
plan he agreed; that Damaso and Eugenio went up Donata Rebolledo's 
house, got P15 in cash and brought out Catalina and Susana by force; 
that he stabbed and cut the throats of the victims with all his 
co-accused present; that Eugenio held Catalina while Damaso held Susana 
as he killed them both with a reaping knife; that the two women were 
killed because they had recognized Eugenio and Damaso and might testify 
against them in court; that during the commission of the crime, his only
 weapon was a reaping knife while Alviar was carrying a caliber .22 <em>paltik</em> revolver, Damaso, a Springfield caliber .30 rifle, Eugenio, a 12-gauge single shot <em>paltik</em> and Espejo was unarmed.
</p><p>Exhibit "N" is Bonifacio Espejo's sworn statement.  Here he 
declared that he happened to be with the group because Damaso and 
Eugenio invited him to Barrio Bangar and they dropped by the houses of 
Alviar and Gregorio before actually proceeding to the barrio; that they 
had a previous agreement to commit the crime; that they planned the same
 in a lot owned by a certain Don Juan Garcia in Barrio Bangar; that it 
was Damaso and Eugenio who entered Donata Rebolledo's house while he, 
Alviar and Gregorio were left downstairs to keep watch; that they were 
able to get P15 from the house; that it was Gregorio who actually killed
 the two women; and that Damaso and Eugenio were armed with a 12-gauge <em>paltik</em> and another long arm the caliber of which he did not know; that Alviar had a caliber .22 <em>paltik</em> revolver, Gregorio a knife and he had two big stones.
</p><p>Substantially similar were the admissions of Lorenzo Alviar in 
his sworn statement (Exhibit "R").  He likewise declared that he and his
 co-accused took P15 from the house of the victims; that it was Gregorio
 who stabbed and cut the throats of the victims with a reaping knife; 
that the killing was done in a sugarcane plantation between 10:00 and 
11:00 o'clock in the evening of November 21, 1959; that Catalina was 
killed before Susana; that he was armed with a caliber .22 <em>paltik</em> revolver, Eugenio with a single shot, 12-gauge <em>paltik</em>,
 Damaso with a Springfield caliber .30 rifle and Espejo with two stones.
  He claimed, however, that he was only forced and intimidated by his 
co-accused to join the group.
</p><p>At the trial, the five accused set up the defense of alibi and 
repudiated their respective sworn statements alleging that these were 
obtained from them through duress, force and intimidation.  Instances of
 the use of third degree methods like boxing, pouring of "7-up" into the
 nostrils, stripping of clothes, pricking of the penis, kicking and 
slapping of the ears were narrated by the accused on the witness stand, 
all of which were not believed by the trial court.
</p><p>The accused-appellants are here represented by a counsel <em>de oficio</em>, Atty. Clemente A. Madarang, Jr., who filed an exhaustive brief for the accused.
</p><p>Taken as a whole, the assigned errors boil down to the question 
of credibility and sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the conviction
 of appellants for the special complex crime of robbery with double 
homicide.  It is argued that (a) there is no evidence of the alleged 
robbery; (b) that the homicide was not committed by reason or on 
occasion of the robbery; and (c) that the crime was not attended by the 
aggravating circumstances of armed band, treachery and uninhabited 
place.
</p><p>There is no merit to appellants' submittal.
</p><p>1.      That robbery was committed is evident from the 
declaration of prosecution witness Donata Rebolledo who testified that 
the two men who barged into her house, one of whom she recognized as 
Fausto Damaso, ordered her to open her "<em>aparador</em>" and then they
 took therefrom the following items with their respective values:  a 
jacket- P25; a necklace- P50; earrings - P25; a ring- P15; a hat- P5; 
scythes - P3.60; and documents worth P2.30.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>
 Moreover the appellants admitted in their separate statements that they
 were able to get P15 from Donata's house.  On this point, We agree with
 the Solicitor General that it matters not from what part of the house 
the accused got the P15.  What is important is that the culprits carried
 away personal property belonging to another by the use of force, 
intimidation or violence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>
</p><p>2.      Counsel points out that because there was a motive, at 
least on the part of Gregorio, for the killing of the Sabado sisters, 
the double homicide could not have been "committed by reason or on 
occasion of the robbery" as the law contemplates.  He calls Our 
attention to the sworn statement wherein Fausto Damaso declared that 
Gregorio killed Catalina and Susana because Catalina bought a carabao 
from him and did not pay for it.  Harping further on this motive theory,
 counsel mentions such circumstances as why the accused specifically 
asked for Catalina and Susana upon entering Donata Rebolledo's house and
 why Donata and Victoriano were not killed together with the sisters if 
the purpose was to remove all opposition to the robbery or to eliminate 
witnesses thereto.
</p><p>As to Damaso's declaration, it should be noted that Damaso 
himself, in his subsequent sworn statement, changed his motive theory 
and stated that the victims were killed in order to eliminate witnesses 
to the crime.  This was corroborated by Gregorio in the latter's own 
written confession.  Even assuming, however, that such a motive for 
vengeance existed on the part of Gregorio, it does not necessarily 
exclude the fact that he and co-accused also intended, when they went to
 Donata's house that night, to rob the family.  In a complex crime of 
robbery with homicide, while an intent to commit robbery must precede 
the taking of human life, the fact that the intent of the culprit was 
tempered with a desire also to avenge grievances against the person 
killed does not prevent the punishment of the accused for the complex 
crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>
</p><p>3. Counsel for appellants also argues that the trial court erred 
in its appreciation of the aggravating circumstances of armed band, 
treachery and uninhabited place.
</p><p>The aggravating circumstance of band exists whenever more than 
three armed malefactors act together in the commission of an offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>
 Counsel concedes that at least three of the accused-appellants, namely 
Eugenio, Alviar, and Gregorio, were armed during the commission of the 
crime.  He doubts, however, whether accused Damaso carried any weapon 
and whether the "two stones" carried by accused Espejo fall under the 
category of "arms." But even granting that Espejo's stones do not 
constitute arms, the prosecution presented the following evidence to 
show that Damaso was also armed and, as such, there were more than three
 of the accused who were armed:  (1) the extrajudicial confession of 
Damaso himself (Exhibit "P") that he was carrying a caliber .22 <em>paltik</em> revolver; (2) the sworn statement of accused Eugenio (Exhibit "O") that Damaso had a caliber .22 <em>paltik</em>
 revolver; (3) the separate written confessions of Alviar, Gregorio and 
Espejo (Exhibits "R", "Q", and "N") that Damaso had a caliber .30 
Springfield rifle; and (4) the testimonies of Donata Rebolledo and 
Victoriano de la Cruz that both men who entered their house (one of whom
 they later identified as Damaso) were carrying firearms.
</p><p>It is clear them the above, that Damaso was armed during the 
night of the commission of the crime, and it is immaterial what kind of 
firearm he carried, the only important thing being that he was armed.  
In this case, the presence of an armed band is to be considered as a 
generic aggravating circumstance under Article 14(6) of the Revised 
Penal Code inasmuch as the crime committed was that provided for and 
penalized in Article 294, paragraph 1 and not under Article 295, Revised
 Penal Code.  (see <em>People v. Apduhan, Jr.</em>, per Justice, now Chief Justice Fred Ruiz Castro, 24 SCRA 798.)
</p><p>Treachery is present if the victim is killed while bound in such a
 manner as to be deprived of the opportunity to repel the attack or 
escape with any possibility of success.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>
 The fact that the bodies of Catalina and Susana were found dead with 
their arms tied behind their backs as well as the admission of Gregorio 
in his confession (Exhibit "Q") that he killed the sisters while their 
arms were held by Eugenio and Damaso lead Us to conclude that the 
killing of the two women was done under treacherous circumstances.
</p><p>Anent the circumstance of uninhabited place, counsel disclaims 
its existence by pointing to the proximity of the sugarcane field where 
the victims were killed to the national highway as well as to certain 
houses in the barrio.  The uninhabitedness of a place is determined not 
by the distance of the nearest house to the scene of the crime, but 
whether or not in the place of commission, there was reasonable 
possibility of the victim receiving some help.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>
 Considering that the killing was done during nighttime and the 
sugarcane in the field was tall enough to obstruct the view of neighbors
 and passersby, there was no reasonable possibility for the victims to 
receive any assistance.  That the accused deliberately sought the 
solitude of the place is clearly shown by the fact that they brought the
 victims to the sugarcane field although they could have disposed of 
them right in the house of Donata Rebolledo where they were found. Thus,
 in <em>People v. Saquing</em>, the Court considered the crime as having
 been committed in an uninhabited place because the killing was done in a
 secluded place at the foot of a hill, forested, and uninhabited.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>
</p><p>The trial court considered separately the three circumstances of 
armed hand, treachery and uninhabited place where under other situations
 one may be considered absorbed or inherent in the other.  There is 
ample justification for this.  The elements of each circumstance subsist
 independently and can be distinctly perceived thereby revealing a 
greater degree of perversity on the part of the accused.
</p><p>4. In the third assignment of error, defense counsel assails the 
sufficiency of the evidence for the prosecution.  He urges that the 
extrajudicial confessions, having been repudiated during the trial, are 
insufficient to sustain the trial court's judgment of conviction, 
specially so since no direct evidence was introduced of any conspiracy 
of the involvement of appellants in the crime in question.
</p><p>Regarding this matter, the following are strongly persuasive.  
First, the appellants' separate extrajudicial confessions were 
subscribed and sworn to before Municipal Judge Conrado de Gracia of 
Paniqui, Tarlac.  On the witness stand, Judge de Gracia testified as to 
the authenticity and due execution of the statements.  He declared that 
before the statements were sworn to before him, he had the appellants' 
PC escorts excluded from the room.  He then took pains in translating 
and explaining to the appellants the contents of their written 
statements and got their assurance that such statements were freely and 
voluntarily made.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> If it 
were true that appellants were forced or intimidated into making the 
confessions, they could have easily manifested before the judge that 
they did not voluntarily give the same.  Certainly, they could have then
 been afforded the necessary protection from any untoward incident that 
could happen.  Their failure there and then to air any injustice or 
misdeed committed upon them belies their stories of maltreatment.  Too, 
there is no credible proof of the alleged maltreatment that they 
suffered in the hands of the police or other authorities as a result of 
which they executed the confessions.  Considering that repudiation of 
confessions comes very easily, the same must be taken with a grain of 
salt.  It occurs all too often that guilty persons, after confessing to 
crime, experience a change of heart and repudiate their confessions in 
the hope of escaping liability.
</p><p>Secondly, there was the reenactment of the robbery and the 
killings.  The movements reconstructed by the appellants conform 
substantially with the details set forth in their individual sworn 
statements.  The reenactment was done in the presence of people, 
including a photographer who had no connection with the police or the 
prosecution.
</p><p>Fiscal Magin Tañedo who was present during the reenactment 
testified that the entire proceeding was spontaneous and free from 
coercion.  On several occasions, appellants even corrected themselves in
 certain details.  Nobody directed the whole show except the appellants 
themselves.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>
</p><p>Fiscal Tañedo's testimony was corroborated by photographer Manuel
 Gamalinda who also declared that there was no dictation, violence, 
force or intimidation employed upon the appellants during the 
reenactment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Gamalinda 
also testified as to the authenticity of the pictures he took during the
 re-enactment, which the prosecution also submitted as evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>
</p><p>Again, concerning the confessions, other circumstances are 
equally significant.  Some of the statements made, specifically the one 
of accused Alviar, were exculpatory in nature and would not have been 
included had the confessant been coerced into making his confession.  
Others cite plausible facts and details which only actual participants 
in the crime could have known.
</p><p>Also, partial corroboration of appellants' statements are found 
in the testimonies of Donata Rebolledo and Victoriano de la Cruz, more 
particularly, as to the robbery.  As such, the confessions, coupled by 
evidence of the <em>corpus delicti</em>, the human remains of Catalina and Susana Sabado, are sufficient bases for the trial court's declaration of guilt.
</p><p>5. With regards to the defense of alibi, We find no justifiable 
reason for discarding the findings of the trial court on this matter.  
In <em>People v. Berdida, et al.</em>, this Court held that the defense 
of alibi is an issue of fact that hinges on credibility, which depends 
much on the credibility of the witnesses who seek to establish it.  In 
this respect the relative weight which the trial judge assigns to the 
testimony of the witnesses must, unless patently and clearly 
inconsistent with the evidence on record, be accepted.  The defense of 
alibi is worthless in the face of positive identification by prosecution
 witnesses, pointing to the accused as participants in the crime.  (17 
SCRA 520, citing <em>People v. Tansiangco</em>, L-19448, February 28, 1964; <em>People v. Riveral</em>, L-14077, March 31, 1964)
</p><p>6. As to conspiracy, the trial court's inference as to the 
existence of the same is well-founded and is amply discussed in its 
decision.  Said His Honor:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>"From the simultaneous and cooperative acts of the accused, the 
Court finds and so holds that there was conspiracy among them.  For 
conspiracy to exist, direct proof is not essential.  The same may be 
inferred from the acts of the conspirators in the commission of the 
offense.  It is not essential that each conspirator takes part in every 
act or that he should know the exact part to be performed by the others 
in the execution of the conspiracy.  Conspiracy merely implies concert 
of design and does not require participation in every detail of 
execution.  Neither is it necessary to show any previous plan or that 
the parties should actually come together and agree in express terms in 
pursuing a common design.  It is sufficient if it is proved that the 
acts of the conspirators were in fact connected and cooperative in 
accomplishing the unlawful object, thereby indicating a closeness of 
personal association and concurrence of sentiments. </p>
  <p>"In the case of the accused herein, they got together and planned 
the criminal act shortly before its execution; they proceeded together 
to the house of the victims and, while Damaso and Eugenio went upstairs,
 the other accused stayed under the house as lookouts once inside the 
house, the two asked and demanded for the victims, forcibly dragged them
 downstairs, handed them to those waiting under the house and, together 
as a group, they brought the victims to the sugarcane field and 
mercilessly stabbed them to death.  Clearly, there was a concert of acts
 among the accused aimed at one common design, and each act was 
connected to and cooperative with the others.”
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The basic rule is that when conspiracy is established, like in the 
present case, the act of one conspirator is imputable to the others and 
the criminal liability of each participant is the same as those of the 
others.
</p><p>7. On the matter of accused Lorenzo Alviar's conviction for 
illegal possession of firearms in Criminal Case No. 2293, two errors are
 assigned.  First, that the trial court had no jurisdiction over the 
case because the same having been previously filed before the Justice of
 the Peace Court of Victoria, Tarlac, which also acquired jurisdiction 
over the person of the accused, the latter court acquired jurisdiction 
to the exclusion of all other courts.
</p><p>This is untenable.  That the Justice of the Peace Court has 
concurrent jurisdiction with the Court of First Instance in this case is
 not questioned.  It, however, appears from the order of the Justice of 
the Peace Court forwarding the records of the case to the Court of First
 Instance<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> that the case 
was brought before the former court merely for purposes of a preliminary
 investigation.  Where a Justice of the Peace acquires jurisdiction for 
the purpose of preliminary investigation and not for trial on the 
merits, such court does not necessarily acquire exclusive jurisdiction 
to try the case on the merits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>
</p><p>In the second assigned error, counsel attacks the flimsiness of 
the evidence for the prosecution.  He questions the sufficiency of a 
document (Exhibit "B"), purportedly a receipt issued to Alviar upon the 
confiscation from him of the alleged firearm.  It is argued that from 
the manner the receipt is worded as well as from the fact that it is 
thumbmarked by Alviar and not signed by the person confiscating, it 
appears to be a confession rather than a receipt.
</p><p>The controversial receipt, however, is not the only evidence 
presented by the prosecution.  Sgt. Melencio Fiesta of the Philippine 
Constabulary also declared on the witness stand that Alviar verbally 
confessed to him his (Alviar's) possession of a caliber .22 <em>paltik</em> revolver.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>
 He further stated that he properly translated from English to Ilocano 
the contents of the receipt before Alviar affixed his thumbmark on the 
same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Whether Exhibit "B" is taken as a receipt or as a confession, it has its own weight as an evidence against appellant Alviar.
</p><p>Still on the illegal possession of firearm, the prosecution also 
presented as evidence Exhibit "C" properly sworn to before Judge Conrado
 de Gracia, wherein Alviar confessed that he did own and possess a 
caliber .22 <em>paltik</em> which he carried on the night the robbery 
and killings were committed.  The voluntariness of this confession has 
not been disproved.
</p><p>8. <em>In conclusion</em>, the crime committed by appellants in 
Criminal Case No. 2253 is robbery with homicide defined in Article 294, 
paragraph 1, Revised Penal Code, to wit:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>"<em>Robbery with violence against or intimidation of persons  - Penalties</em> – Any person guilty of robbery with the use of violence against or intimidation of any person shall suffer: </p>
  <p>"1. The penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua</em> to death, when by reason or on occasion of the robbery, the crime of homicide shall have been committed.
  </p>
  <p align="center">“xxx               xxx                   xxx”
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The penalty is to be imposed in its maximum period by reason of the 
presence of three aggravating circumstances found by the trial court, to
 wit:  that the robbery was committed by a band,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> with treachery,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> and in an uninhabited place.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>
</p><p>There is likewise the additional aggravating circumstance that 
the robbery was committed in the dwelling of the victim, Donata 
Rebolledo which although not alleged in the Information is however 
established by the evidence.
</p><p><strong>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS</strong>, We hereby affirm in toto the decision of the trial court in the two cases.
</p><p>Without pronouncement as to costs at this instance.
</p><p><strong>SO ORDERED</strong>.
</p><p><em>Castro, C.J., Teehankee, Barredo, Makasiar, Antonio, Muñoz Palma, Concepcion, Jr., Santos, Fernandez</em>, and <em>Guerrero, JJ.</em>, concur.
</p><p><em>Fernando</em> and <em>Aquino, JJ.</em>, no part.
