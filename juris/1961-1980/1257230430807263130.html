				<BR><STRONG>PAREDES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>On October 31, 1961, the Court of Appeals certified the case to this Court, 
stating that the issue involved herein is "solely on the interpretation of the 
order of the court a quo dated October 5, 1959, particularly the dispositive 
portion thereof, which is a legal question."</p>
<p>The Order issued in Civil Case No. 4666, CFI, Negros Occidental, between the 
same parties, subject of this proceeding, reads as follows—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When this case was called for trial today, the defendant and his counsel 
appeared hut the plaintiffs filed a motion for postponement in lieu of 
appearance. The record shows, however, that since the original complaint was 
filed, the counsel for the plaintiffs had asked for no less than five (5) 
postponements of the trial without the defendant having asked for any single 
postponement, and after the motion to amend the complaint was denied by this 
Court, the plaintiffs again asked for at least three other postponements. </p>
<p>"Wherefore, the plaintiffs' motion for postponement is denied and this case 
is hereby dismissed for lack of interest. The defendant's counterclaim is 
likewise dismissed, without prejudice."</p></blockquote>
<p>On November 29, 1959, plaintiffs-appellants presented another complaint with 
the CFI of Negros Occidental, against appellee herein for the recovery of a 
parcel of land, Civil Case No. 5557, which was the object of the previous 
complaint, dismissed on October 5, 1959.</p>
<p>Under date of February 1, 1960, defendant-appellee interposed a Motion to 
Dismiss, contending that the cause of action of plaintiffs is already barred by 
a prior judgment. The decision quoted above was reproduced in the motion to 
dismiss and submitted in support of the said motion. The motion to dismiss was 
opposed by plaintiffs, arguing in the main, that the dismissal of the previous 
complaint, was without prejudice and, therefore, the second complaint, is not 
barred.</p>
<p>On February 16, 1960, the court <em>a quo</em> handed down an Order, the 
pertinent portions of which state—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A perusal of the dispositive part of the order of this Court, above-quoted, 
shows the contention of the defendant that the dismissal of the complaint in 
Civil Case No. 4666 is with prejudice to be well-taken. The first sentence of 
the dispositive part of the order in question refers to the dismissal of the 
complaint, which is without any condition at all, and under Section 3, Rule 30, 
of the Rules of Court, it is understood to be with prejudice, and shall have the 
effect of an adjudication upon the merits. It is the second sentence of the 
dispositive part of the order in question, referring to the counterclaim of the 
defendant's which was dismissed 'without prejudice,' meaning, that the 
defendant's right to prosecute his counterclaim in a separate action is thereby 
reserved.</p>
<p>'The ruling laid down by the Supreme Court to the effect that a dismissal 
upon plaintiff's failure to appear at the trial does not constitute <i>res 
ajudicata,</i> is no longer good under the new Rules except where dismissal is 
made expressly without prejudice.' (Comments on the Rules of Court, by Moran, 
Vol. I, p. 636).</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, the Court finds the motion to dismiss flled by the 
defendant to be well-founded, and the plaintiffs' complaint dated November 25, 
1959, is hereby dismissed."</p></blockquote>
<p>Plaintiffs-appellants filed with the lower court a motion for 
Reconsideration, on three (3) grounds, to wit —</p>
<ol><li>That the order of October 5, 1959, dismissing Civil Case No. 4666 is vague 
and as such should be interpreted in favor of the preservation of the right of 
the plaintiffs;<br><br></li><li>That plaintiffs have a meritorious case, and if given due course, will 
eventually prosper; and<br><br></li><li>That the dismissal of the present case will work an injustice and inequity 
to the plaintiffs.</li></ol>


<p>Full discussion of the above grounds was made by counsel for the appellants. 
Liberal interpretation of the rules was invoked, in view of the supposed 
vagueness of the order. As for the merits of the case, appellants pointed out 
that the alleged sale of the property to the appellee's predecessors-in-interest 
was made before the expiration of the 5 years, period provided for by the Public 
Land Act. The motion for reconsideration was deiiiefi.</p>
<p>The only issue We are called upon to determine in this proceedings, is the 
import of the Order of October 5, 1959. It will be noted that the lower court 
made a clear interpretation of the Order, when it said: "* * *. The first 
sentence of the dispositive part of the order in question refers to the 
dismissal of the complaint, which <span style="font-style: italic;">is without any condition at all</span>, arid under 
Section 3, Rule 30 Of the Rules of Court, it is understood to be with prejudice, 
and shall have the effect of an adjudication on the merits". We share the view of the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span>. No other reasonable interpretation could, have been meant. 
And considering the fact that the judge who issued the controversial order, was 
also the one who interpreted or clarified the same, it becomes apparent that 
what the court really ordered, when, it dismissed the complaint was a dismissal 
<span style="font-style: italic;">with prejudice.</span> If he had meant what the appellants want Us to understand, his 
Honor, could have likewise suffixed the dismissal of the complaint with the 
phrase "without prejudice", in the same way he did with the dismissal of the 
defendant's counterclaim. The argument of appellants that the word "likewise" 
refers or modifies both the complaint and counterclaim, is, to Our mind, 
untenable. Even under ordinary rules of grammar, the phrase "without prejudice" 
appearing on the second sentence of the dispositive portion of the decision, 
should modify or refer only to the counterclaim. Had the two sentences been 
separated by a comma, there would have been no doubt, that the phrase <span style="font-style: italic;">without 
prejudice</span> had modified and/or referred to the dismissal of both the complaint 
and the counterclaim. But there were no different and distinct sentences, 
containing different subjects, predicates and modifiers.</p>
<p>Conformably with all the foregoing, the Order appealed from should be, as it 
is hereby AFFIRMED. Costs taxed against plaintiffs-appellants.</p>
<p><em>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, 
J.B.L., Barrera, Dizon, Regala </em>and <em>Makalintal, JJ.</em> concur.</p></div>
