				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Plaintiff Consuelo <span class="SpellE">Velayo</span> filed on <st1:date year="1950" day="11" month="7">July 11, 1950</st1:date> in the Court of First Instance
of Manila, a suit against her husband Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Velayo</span>,
for separation of conjugal properties and support for herself and their three
minor children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On February <span style="">17, 1953, </span>finding that defendant had
abandoned his wife for at least a year, the court al­lowed the petition for
separation of properties and or­dered the parties to submit an agreement to
that effect.</p>

<p class="BODY">The parties then submitted a compromise agreement covering
separation of properties, support and custody of the children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And on <st1:date year="1953" day="30" month="5">May 30, <span style="">1953</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>the Court of First Instance rendered
judgment, approving it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Substantial­ly,
its terms were as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) Defendant
shall pay his wife as her share of the conjugal properties a total of
P20,000.00, i.e., P5,000.00 payable upon approval of the agreement and <span style="">P15,000.00 </span>payable within two years
from said date or up to May 30, <span style="">1955; </span>(2)
until said ba­lance of <span style="">P15,000.00 </span>is
fully paid, defendant shall give to plaintiff P200.00 monthly for her support
and P300.00 monthly for the support of the children; (3) after said balance is
paid in full, defendant shall give to his wife P150.00 monthly as his share for
the support of the children, plaintiff agreeing to provide the other half of <span style="">P150.00 </span>for a total of P300.00; and <span style="">(4) </span>plaintiff shall remain in custody of
the children but defendant may visit and/or take them out at reasonable hours
of any day of the week.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Subsequently, pursuant to
Republic Act 1401, the case was transferred to the Juvenile and Domestic Rela­tions
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Acting upon plaintiff's motion, said
Court, on </span><st1:date year="1958" day="8" month="1"><span style="">January 8, 1958</span></st1:date><span style="">, ordered defendant to pay all the sums due
the plaintiff by virtue of the decision of </span><st1:date year="1953" day="30" month="5"><span style="">May 30, 1953</span></st1:date><span style="">, estimated at about P28,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant however on </span><st1:date year="1958" day="7" month="2"><span style="">February
 7, 1958</span></st1:date><span style=""> appealed
from said order to the Court of Appeals, staying execution in the meanwhile by
filing a <span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span> bond in the amount of
P25,000.00.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">During the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of said appeal, on </span><st1:date year="1958" day="2" month="7"><span style="">July 2, 1958</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span><span style="">plaintiff and defendant signed another agreement, provid­ing, thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>CONSUELO VELAYO has condoned and par­doned, as
she hereby condones and pardons all acts of <span class="SpellE">concubinage</span>
committed and being com­mitted by RODOLFO VELAYO;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>CONSUELO VELAYO hereby waives any and all
claims for support she has or may have against RODOLFO VELAYO covered by the
case between the two of them which originated in the Court of Domestic
Relations and now pend­<span style="">ing appeal in </span>the
Court of Appeals;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>CONSUELO VELAYO states <span style="">that </span>she is not going to claim any further support now and in
the future from RODOLFO VELAYO;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>RODOLFO VELAYO has and will conti­nue to have
the custody of their children ROBERTO, RODOLFO and ERLINDA, all surnamed VE­LAYO.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the protection of these children, the
business enterprises of RODOLFO VELAYO will be incorporated and these three
children will be given one-third (1/3) share in said business enterprise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>RODOLFO VELAYO will also see to it that
one-third (1/3) of all his properties will be given to the children afore­said;
and</blockquote>

<blockquote>“5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The parties hereto hereby promise to execute
such other document and documents as are necessary to fully effectuate the con­ditions
of this agreement."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">And
on the strength of this new agreement, the Court of Appeals issued a resolution
on </span><st1:date year="1958" day="29" month="8"><span style="">August 29, 1958</span></st1:date><span style="">,
<u>dismiss­ing the case</u>, without costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Plaintiff appealed from
said resolution of dismissal to this Court, in L-14541, <u>Consuelo <span class="SpellE">Velayo</span> v. Court of Appeals</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And deciding said case on </span><st1:date year="1960" day="30" month="3"><span style="">March
 30, 1960</span></st1:date><span style="">, this Court
held that the agreement of the parties, dated </span><st1:date year="1958" day="2" month="7"><span style="">July 2, 1958</span></st1:date><span style="">, was valid and effective, except as to the
por­tions regarding the pardon and <span class="SpellE">condonation</span> of all
acts of </span><span class="SpellE">concubinage</span> of defendant and the
waiver of future sup­port, which portions were held null and void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Constru­ing the new agreement in relation to
the judgment of the trial court dated <st1:date year="1953" day="30" month="5">May
 30, 1953</st1:date>, We ruled that said agree­ment did not cover plaintiff's
share in the conjugal pro­perties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
under the judgment P1<span style="">5,000.00 </span>remained
pay­able as such by defendant to plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, finding that plaintiff can still ask for execution in so
far as her right to share in the conjugal properties is concerned, this Court
modified the resolution of dismiss­al of the Court of Appeals, in the sense
that <u><span style="">defendant's appeal</span></u><span style=""> </span>to that Court, <u><span style="">not the case itself</span></u><span style="">, </span>is considered dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records of the case were then remanded to the Juvenile and
Domestic Relations Court, which received them on <st1:date year="1960" day="9" month="9">September 9, 1960</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1960" day="28" month="11">November 28, 1960</st1:date>,
defendant moved to cancel the <span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span> bond posted
to stay execution pending appeal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Plaintiff opposed it on <st1:date year="1961" day="7" month="1">January <span style="">7, </span>1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Said </span>motion
was denied by the court <u>a</u><span style=""> <u>quo</u>
</span>on <st1:date year="1962" day="2" month="3">March 2, 1962</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, on <st1:date year="1962" day="20" month="11">November
 20, 1962</st1:date>, defendant again filed a motion for cancellation of the <span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span> bond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
<st1:date year="1962" day="8" month="12">December <span style="">8, </span>1962</st1:date>, plaintiff again opposed the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Acting thereon only on June 22, 1964, because
there were pending disputes between the spouses before the Manila City <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span> office, the court <u>a</u> <u><span style="">quo</span></u><span style=""> </span>ordered defendant's <span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span> bond
cancelled, on <span style="">the </span>ground that by
then the judgment in the case could no longer be executed by motion, stating
that the five-year period for execution had lapsed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said the lower court:</p>

<blockquote>"The Court counts the 5-year period with­in which the judgment
can be enforced by motion as beginning <st1:date year="1955" day="30" month="5">May
 <span style="">30, </span><span style="">1955</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>by
which date defendant was obligated to make full payment of the P20,000.00 to
plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The running of the period was
suspended on <st1:date year="1958" day="8" month="1">January <span style="">8, </span>1958</st1:date>, or about 2 years
and <span style="">7 </span>months thereafter, be­cause
of defendant's appeal from the 'order of execution' of that date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The period began to run again from <st1:date year="1960" day="9" month="9">September 9, <span style="">1960</span></st1:date><span style=""> </span>when
this Court received official advice as to the final out­come of defendant's
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since then, plain­tiff has not
taken any steps for the enforce­ment of the judgment in her favor despite the
lapse of some <span style="">3 </span>years and <span style="">9 </span>months.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It will thus be seen that on computations
most favor­able to plaintiff (2 Moran, Rules of Court, <span style="">1963 </span>Ed., p. 250-251), the 5-year period for the enforcement of a
judgment can no longer be enforced in this case, it should stand to reason that
the <span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span> bond can no longer <span style="">be moved against in this case."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From this order, plaintiff has appealed directly to us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The purely legal question raised is whether
or not the <span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span> bond still remains answerable
for any­thing under the judgment in the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">As stated, by the terms of the CFI judgment dated <st1:date year="1953" day="30" month="5"><span style="">May 30,
 1953</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>defendant
was obliged to pay <span style="">to </span>plaintiff
the amount of P200.00 monthly for her support and P300.00 monthly for the
support of their children, until such time as defendant shall have fully paid
the P15,000.00 balance corresponding to plaintiff's share in the conjugal
properties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not disputed that, <span style="">until now, the P</span>15,000.00 has not been
paid.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Now </span>by virtue of
the agreement of the parties dated <st1:date year="1958" day="2" month="7"><span style="">July 2, 1958</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>submitted to the Court of <span style="">Appeals, </span><u>all items of support due
and recoverable under the said judgment, were waived.</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>As of that date</u>, therefore, i.e., <st1:date year="1958" day="2" month="7">July 2, <span style="">1958</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>plaintiff was not entitled to
execution upon the judgment as far as support that was already due for pay­ment
was concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said new compromise
agreement, how­ever, could not possibly affect <u>future support</u> or <u>the
right thereto under the same judgment</u>, since future support or the right
thereto cannot be waived nor compro­mised (Arts. 301, <span style="">2035, </span>Civil Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
was this Court's ruling in <u>Consuelo <span class="SpellE">Velayo</span> v.
Court of Appeals</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span>(L-14541),
supra.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And <span class="SpellE">altho</span>
We there pointed out that the portion of the judgment regarding which plaintiff
could <u>at that time ask</u> for execution was that providing for her
P15,000.00 share in the conjugal properties, We were speaking as of the time
that the parties entered into the new agreement, dated July <span style="">2, 1958.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span>All items for support prior to that date were validly waived; all
items for support after that date - i.e., future support <span class="SpellE">altho</span>
not waived, were not yet due, so that execution could not then be had thereon.</p>

<p class="BODY">As far as the period subsequent to the new agree­ment, or <u>after</u>
<st1:date year="1958" day="2" month="7">July <span style="">2, 1958</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span><span style="">is </span>concerned, therefore, the judgment
for support remained, with respect to the <span style="">P200.00
</span>payable monthly for the support of the wife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As regards the support of the children,
pursuant to the new agreement, defendant ceded one-third of his business and of
all his properties to them, for their protection.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Symbol;"><span style="">*</span></span></span></a>
It is moreover provided therein that "Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Velayo</span>
has and will continue to have the custody of their children Roberto, Rodolfo
and <span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span>" thereby undertaking their support.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Symbol;"><span style="">*</span></span></span></a><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Symbol;"><span style="">*</span></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Clearly therefore defendant still remained liable, under the
judgment, for support of his wife at P200.00 monthly, as far as months <u>subsequent</u>
to the new agree<span style="">ment of July 2, </span><span style="">1958 </span><span style="">are concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For being then <u>future</u>
support, the same could not be waived <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Now a judgment for support does not become dormant; the five-year
period for execution (Sec. <span style="">6, </span>Rule
<span style="">39, </span>Rules of Court) does not apply
thereto; rather, the sup­port under the judgment becomes due from time to time,
as provided, and is enforceable by simple motion at any time, except as to
installments not recovered within the statute of limitations (<span class="SpellE">Florendo</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Organo</span>, 90 Phil. <span style="">483).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span> bond expressly
undertook:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"to secure the
fulfillment and payment of the judgment so appealed together with the costs, in
case the same should be so affirmed, in whole or in part, or in case the
judgment should become effective on account of appellant's having abandoned or
withdrawn the appeal, or in case it should be dismissed or declared to be
improperly allowed." (As quoted by court <u>a</u> <u><span style="">quo</span></u><span style="">, </span>Record on Appeal, pp. <span style="">53-54)
</span>It therefore should not be cancelled since it still is ans­werable for
amounts due under the judgment, as to which, execution can still be had.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed order <span class="SpellE">cancelling</span>
defendant's <span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span> bond is hereby reversed and
set aside, with­out costs.</p>
