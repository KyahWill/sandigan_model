				<H3>COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, PETITIONER, VS. HAWAIIAN AND PHILIPPINE COMPANY, RESPONDENT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>DIZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>This is a petition filed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue for the 
review of the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals in C.T.A. Case No. 598 
ordering him to refund to respondent Hawaiian-Philippine Company the amount of 
P8,411.99 representing fixed and percentage taxes assessed against it and which 
the latter had deposited with the City Treasurer of Silay, Occidental Negros. 
</p>
<p>The undisputed facts of this case, as found by the Court of Tax Appeals, are 
as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The petitioner, a corporation duly organized in accordance with law, is 
operating a sugar central in the City of Silay, Occidental Negros. It produces 
centrifugal sugar from sugarcane supplied by planters. The processed sugar is 
divided between the planters and the petitioner in the proportion stipulated in 
the milling contracts, and thereafter is deposited in the warehouses of the 
latter.(Pp. 4-5, t.s.n.) For the sugar deposited by the planters, the petitioner 
issues the corresponding warehouse receipts or 'quedans'. It does not collect 
storage charges on the sugar deposited in its warehouse during the first 90 days 
period counted from the time it is extracted from the sugarcane. Upon the lapse 
of the first ninety days and up to the beginning of the next milling season, it 
collects a fee of P0.30 per picul a month. Thenceforth, if the sugar is not yet 
withdrawn, a penalty of P0.25 per picul or fraction thereof a month is imposed. 
(Exhibits 'B-l,' ‘C-l’, ‘D-1’, ‘B-2", ‘C-2", p. 10, t.s.n.)</p>
<p>"The storage of sugar is carried in the books of the company under Account 
No. 5000, denominated 'Manufacturing Cost Ledger Control’; the storage fees 
under Account No. 5216-20; the expense accounts of the factory under Account 
No.5200; and the so-called 'Sugar Bodega Operations' under Account No. 5216, 
under which is a Sub-Account No. 20, captioned, 'Credits'. (Pp. 16-17, t.s.n,, 
Exhibit 'F’.) The collections from storage after the lapse of the first 90 days 
period are entered in the company's books as debit to CASH, and credit to 
Expense Account No. 5216-20 (p. 18, t.s.n.)</p>
<p>"The credit for storage charges decreased the deductible expense resulting in 
the corresponding increase of the taxable income of the petitioner. This is 
reflected by the entries enclosed in parenthesis in Exhibit ‘G', under the 
heading "StorageCharges1. (P. 18, t.s.n.) The alleged reason for this accounting 
operation is that, inasmuch as the 'Sugar Bodega Operations' is considered as an 
expense account, entries under it are 'debits'. Similarly, since 'Storage 
Charges' constitute ‘credit', the corresponding figures (see Exhibit ‘C’) are 
enclosed in parenthesis as they decrease the expenses of maintaining the sugar 
warehouses.</p>
<p>"Upon investigation conducted by the Bureau, it was found that during the 
years 1949 to 1957, the petitioner realized from collected storage fees a total 
gross receipts of P212,853.00, on the basis of which the respondent determined 
the petitioner's liability for fixed and percentage taxes, 25% surcharge, and 
administrative penalty in the aggregate amount of P6,411.99 (Exhibit '5', p. 11, 
BIR rec.)</p>
<p>"On October 20, 1958, the petitioner deposited, the amount of P8,411.99 with 
the Office of the City Treasurer of Silay. (Exhibits 'I' and '1-1', pp. 59-60, 
CTA rec.) Later, it filed its petition for review before this Court (Exhibit 
'K’, p. 25, CTA rec.)" </p></blockquote>
<p>After due hearing the Court of Tax Appeals rendered the appealed decision. 
</p>
<p>The only issue to be resolved in the case at bar is whether or not, upon the 
facts stated above, petitioner is a warehouseman liable for the payment of the 
fixed and percentage taxes prescribed in Sections 182 and 191 of the National 
Internal Revenue Code which read as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sec. 182. FIXED TAXES - (A) ON BUSINESS(1) PERSONS SUBJECT TO PERCENTAGE 
TAX. – Unless otherwise provided every person engaging in a business on which 
the percentage tax is imposed shall pay a fixed annual tax of twenty pesos. x x 
x." </p>
<p>"Sec. 191. PERCENTAGE TAX ON ROAD, BUILDING,IRRIGATION, ARTESIAN TOLL, 
WATERWORKS, AND OTHER CONSTRUCTION WORK CONTRACTORS, PROPRIETORS OR OPERATORS OF 
DOCKYARD, AND OTHERS, x x x warehousemen; plumbers, smiths; house or sign 
painters; lithographers, publishers, except those engaged in the publication or 
printing and publication of any newspaper, magazine, review or bulletin which 
appear at regular intervals, with fixed prices for subscription and sale, and 
which is not devoted principally to the publication of advertisements; printers 
and bookbinders, business agents and other independent contractors, shall pay a 
tax equivalent to THREE PERCENTUM of their gross receipts, x x 
x."</p></blockquote>
<p>Respondent disclaims liability under the legal provisions quoted above, 
alleging that it is not engaged in the business of storing its planters' sugar 
for profit; that the maintenance of its warehouses is merely incidental to its 
business of manufacturing sugar and in compliance with its obligation to its 
planters. We find this to be without merit. </p>
<p>It is clear from the facts of the case that, after manufacturing the sugar of 
its planters, respondent stores it in its warehouses and issues the 
corresponding "quedans" to the planters who own the sugar; that while the sugar 
is stored free during the first ninety days from the date the "quedans" are 
issued, the undisputed fact is that, upon the expiration of said period, 
respondent charges and collects storage fees that for the period beginning 1949 
to1957, respondent's total gross receipts from this particular enterprise 
amounted to P212,853.00. </p>
<p>A warehouseman has been defined as one who receives and stores goods of 
another for compensation (44 Words and Phrases, p. 635) For one to be considered 
engaged in the warehousing business, therefore, it is sufficient that he 
receives goods owned by another for storage, and collects fees in connection 
with the same. In fact, Section 2 of the General Bonded Warehouse Act, as 
amended, defines aware houseman as "a person engaged in the business of 
receiving commodity for storage." </p>
<p>That respondent stores its planters' sugar free of charge for the first 
ninety days does not exempt it from liability under the legal provisions under 
consideration. Were such fact sufficient for that purpose, the law imposing the 
tax would be rendered ineffectual. </p>
<p>Neither is the fact that respondent's warehousing business is carried in 
addition to, or in relation with, the operation of its sugar central sufficient 
to exempt it from payment of the tax prescribed in the legal provisions; quoted 
heretofore. Under Section 178 of the National Internal Revenue Code, the tax on 
business is payable for every separate or distinct establishment or place where 
business subject to the tax is conducted; and one line of business or occupation 
does not become exempt by being conducted with some other business or occupation 
for which such tax has been paid. </p>
<p>Lastly, respondent's contention that the imposition of the tax under 
consideration would amount to double taxation is likewise without merit. As is 
clear from the facts, respondent's warehousing business, although carried on in 
relation to the operation of its sugar central, is a distinct and separate 
business taxable under a different provision of the Tax Code. There can be no 
double taxation where the State merely imposes a tax on every separate and 
distinct business in which a party is engaged. Moreover, in Manufacturers Life 
Insurance Co. vs. Meer, 89 Phil., 351, City of Manila vs. Interisland Gas 
Service, 99 Phil., 847, We have ruled that there is no prohibition against 
double or multiple taxation in this jurisdiction. </p>
<p>WHEREFORE, the decision appealed from is reversed and set aside, with costs.
