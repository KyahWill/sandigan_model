Appeals dated December 28, 1963 affirming the assessment issued against it by
the respondent Commissioner of Internal Revenue in the total sum of <span style="">P2<span class="GramE">,507,693.17</span>, repre</span><span style="">senting advance sales tax due on the importation of ten million pounds of

<p class="BODY">There is no dispute as to the following facts:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On August <span style="">13, </span><span style="">1957 </span>petitioner,
a domestic corporation, through its President, Harry S. <span class="SpellE">Stonehill</span>,
applied for a barter permit under the provisions of Republic Act No. 1194, <span style="">with the Agricultural and Cooperative </span><span style="">Finance Corporation
</span>(ACCFA), to export approximately 14 million pounds of locally grown and
sun-dried Virginia leaf tobacco, and, by way of barter, to <u>import</u> around
10 million pounds of U.S. Virginia leaf tobacco.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the im­portation of the latter <span style="">was at </span>the time banned by regulations of the Central Bank of the
Philippines, the then acting ACCFA Administrator, upon petitioner's request,
indorsed the appli­cation to the President of the Philippines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Acting upon the application - which was
favorably recommended by the acting ACCFA Administrator - the President of the
Philippines approved the same under the terms set forth in a letter dated
January 13, 1958 signed by the then Executive Secretary, Juan C. <span class="SpellE">Pajo</span>, some of which are as follows: </p>

<blockquote><span style="">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
</span>the exportation of 14 million pounds of locally grown and produced <span class="SpellE">sundried</span> Virginia leaf tobacco by the Philippine Tobacco

exchanged or bartered with 10 million pounds of foreign Virginia type leaf
tobacco which has to be imported for allocation among local cigarette factories

9,997,772 lbs. of U.S. Virginia and/or Burley leaf tobacco were received and

petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, before </span>the <span style="">commodity was released from Customs,
petitioner endorsed the bills of lading, in blank, to various local cigarette
manu­facturers who eventually obtained the release thereof from Customs'
custody without payment of the advance sales tax, on the strength of said
documents and the contracts of sale of the aforesaid imported Virginia leaf
tobacco entered into between petitioner, on one hand, and <span style="">said local cigarette </span>manufacturers, on
the other.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On May 20, 1960, the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue assessed and demanded from petitioner the
payment of the sum of P2,507,693.17, as advance sales tax due on the
importation of the nearly 10 million lbs. of Virginia leaf tobacco already
referred to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's request for a
reconsideration </span>of <span style="">the
assessment having been denied, it filed on September </span>3, <span style="">1960 a petition for a review thereof with the
Court of Tax Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter, as
stated at the outset, affirmed the assessment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence the present appeal, petitioner claiming that the Court of Tax
Appeals committed the following errors:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

CUSTODY, WERE DONE ILLEGALLY AND NOT IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS INSPITE

LEAF TOBACCO IMPORTED INTO THE <st1:country-region><st1:place>PHILIPPINES</st1:place></st1:country-region>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The issues raised in the
second and fourth alleged errors appear to be factual, possible of resolution
only after a review of facts, because, </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">regards the Court of Tax Appeals' finding to
the effect that the <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> of the bills of
lading made by petitioner to several local cigarette manufacturers was not done
in good faith, peti­tioner's contention is that said finding is "contrary
to the evidence in the case"; and, as regards the same court's finding
that the Barter Permit was issued on condition that advance sales taxes on the
shipment should be paid by peti­tioner, the latter claims that it </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">"without support
in the evidence".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both findings
therefore are not <span class="SpellE">reviewable</span> in this appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Be that as it may, all
the errors allegedly committed by the Court of Tax Appeals </span><span style="">are </span><span style="">resolved, directly
or indi­rectly, in the following considerations:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner can not deny
that it </span><u><span style="">applied to import</span></u><span style="">, </span><span style="">and
Permit No. BT-1830 (Special) issued to it on </span><st1:date year="1958" day="21" month="1"><span style="">January 21, 1958</span></st1:date><span style="">, allowed it to "import x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> into the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">" the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">U.S.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> grown </span><st1:state><st1:place><span style="">Virginia</span></st1:place></st1:state><span style=""> and/or Burley leaf tobacco mentioned
therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Questions that arise in this
connection are, firstly, whether by allocating the imported tobacco to several
local cigarette manufacturers to whom it delivered the corresponding shipping documents,
and by the release by Customs of the imported to­bacco to said local cigarette
manufacturers upon presentation of said shipping documents and without payment
of the advance sales tax due, petitioner ceased to </span><span style="">be </span><span style="">the <u>importer</u>
and, instead, the aforesaid local cigarette manufactur</span><span style="">ers became </span><span style="">the <u>importers</u>
thereof; and secondly, whether or not peti­tioner could assign or transfer the
permit granted to it without violating the terms thereof.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The resolution of the
questions thus posed will offer no particular difficulty provided <span class="GramE">We</span> lay aside the technical considerations and legal niceties
upon which petitioner relies to evade payment of the assessment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As heretofore stated, it
is not open <span class="GramE">to question</span> nor doubt that petitioner
applied for a permit <u>to import</u> U.S. Virginia and/or Burley leaf tobacco.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To secure it <span class="SpellE">inspite</span>
of the ban imposed upon the importation of such commodity by regulations of the
Central Bank, it, in turn, offered to purchase and thereafter to export from
the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> local </span><st1:state><st1:place><span style="">Virginia</span></st1:place></st1:state><span style=""> leaf tobacco worth $4,900,000 - the equivalent
of the importation cost of the foreign leaf tobacco to be imported.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The permit granted to
petitioner expressly and in clear terms provided, among other conditions:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"this permit cannot be transferred,
assigned or negotiated." The manifest and logical purpose of this
condition was to have petitioner retain its character as - and thus remain in
the eyes of the law and the Government, the <u>importer</u> of whatever U.S.
Virginia leaf tobacco was brought into the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> under and </span><span style="">by </span><span style="">virtue of said permit. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>This conclusion becomes more evident in the
light of the fact that, were the local cigarette manu­facturers to whom the
foreign leaf tobacco was ultimately allocated or <u>sold</u> to be considered
the importers thereof, they would bee exempt from paying the advance sales
tax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Petitioner's brief p. 28) In other
words, by the simple expedient of <u>selling</u> the foreign leaf tobacco to
them, peti­tioner would have been able to evade or avoid payment of the advance
sales tax due on the commodity, amounting to the considerable amount of P2<span class="GramE">,507,693.17</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner's attempt to accomplish this cannot be sanctioned.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner's deal with
the Government, in plain words, was in effect not more than that, Central Bank
regulations to the contrary notwithstanding, he will be allowed to <u>import</u>
ten million pounds of U.S. Virginia leaf tobacco but subject to two conditions
expressly stated in the Permit, namely:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(a) that in return for that privilege, it would <u>export</u> locally
produced Virginia leaf tobacco equivalent in value to that of the Virginia leaf
tobacco to be imported, and (b) that after the commodity had been imported,
petitioner would allocate the same among several local cigarette manufacturers
who were in dire need thereof for blending purposes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, petitioner must first <u>import</u>
the foreign tobacco, then allocate or sell it - naturally at a profit - to
local ciga­rette manufacturers to fill the latter's need for it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, in the contracts entered
into by and between petitioner, on the one hand, and local cigarette
manufacturers, on the other, petitioner was invariably referred to as <u>importer</u>
of the U.S. Virginia leaf tobacco contracted for, while the local cigarette
manufacturers were referred to as <u>buyers</u> thereof - all this in the light
of the Barter Permit BT-1830 issued to petitioner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Finally, as at the time
petitioner filed its applica­tion to import the importation of U.S. Virginia or
Burley leaf tobacco was banned by Central Bank regulations and there was no law
exempting petitioner from payment of advance sales tax on commodities imported
by it, it would be taxing too much one's credulity to accept what in effect is
the kernel of petitioner's contention:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>that the Government, by granting him the Permit to import foreign
Virginia leaf tobacco, not only bes­towed upon him the signal privilege of
going over the prohibi­tory regulations of the Central Bank but, in addition,
(a) exempted him from payment of the corresponding advance sales tax, and/or
(b) placed in his hands the means of avoiding payment of said taxes by merely
assigning the shipping documents thereof or selling the commodity to third
parties.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As regards the release of
the commodity by Customs authorities without payment of the advance sales tax,
all that We need say is that respondent Commissioner authorized said release
subject to a reservation that further verifica­tion and investigation would be
made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The assessment imposed and the <span class="GramE">demand for the payment of the corresponding amount were</span> the
result of such examination and verification.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b style="">WHEREFORE</b><span style="">, the appealed decision being in accordance
with law and the facts of the case, the same is hereby affirmed, with costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
