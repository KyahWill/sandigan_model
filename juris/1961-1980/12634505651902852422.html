				<BR><STRONG>RUIZ CASTRO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for <u>certiorari</u>, prohibition and
mandamus to annul the order dated December 1, 1967 of the respond­ent Judge
Manuel L. <span class="SpellE">Enage</span> of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>, which order directs a judicial recount of the votes
cast certain municipalities in <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span> at the last
elections held on November 14, 1967 and restrains the provincial board of
canvassers from canvassing the election returns for the offices of Governor,
Vice Governor and board members of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span> province.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent judge issued the order on petition of the
respondents Rafael C. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, candidate for Governor <span class="SpellE">Basilisa</span> K. <span class="SpellE">Atega</span>, candidate for
Vice Governor, and <span class="SpellE">Sulpicio</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Lagnada</span>,
Eduardo D. Mercado and <span class="SpellE">Noli</span> G. <span class="SpellE">Cortel</span>,
can­didates for board members, all belonging to the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span>
Party, in the last elections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In their
petition, the res­pondent candidates claimed that "the copies of the
election returns . . . pertaining to all the precincts involved in this
petition which are marked 'COPY FOR THE NACIONALISTA PARTY' give to the herein
petitioners [the respondents here] a different and larger number of votes than
the number of votes given to them in the corresponding copies of the same
statements of election returns transmitted to the Provincial Treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span> . . . and the difference arising out of the
abovementioned discrepancies materially and substantially affects the results
of the election . . . to such an extent that instead of being declared losers
petitioners [the respondents here] deserve to be proclaimed the duly elected
pro­vincial officials of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>."</p>

<p class="BODY">The present petitioners were the other candidates for the same
offices: Consuelo V. <span class="SpellE">Calo</span> for Governor, Jose T. Gon­zalez
for Vice Governor, and Pastor D. Ago, <span class="SpellE">Genaro</span> B. <st1:place>Asia</st1:place>
and Vicente C. Rosales for board members.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All were NP unof­ficial candidates.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They contend that the respondent judge acted in excess of his
jurisdiction and with grave abuse of discretion in ordering a recount of the
votes even before the provincial board of canvassers had started canvassing the
re­turns, and that in any event the supposed discrepancy between the NP copy
and the provincial treasurer's copy of the same returns from each of the
precincts in question as to the num­ber of votes cast for the respondents is
not a ground for a judicial recount under section 163 of the Revised Election
Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the extreme urgency of the petition, we issued on <st1:date year="1967" day="4" month="12">December 4, 1967</st1:date> a temporary
restraining order, en­joining enforcement of the lower court's writ of
preliminary injunction and the recounting of ballots, even as we allowed the
canvassing to proceed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are now
informed that the can­vassing was finished on <st1:date year="1967" day="13" month="12">December 13, 1967</st1:date> although no proc­lamation has been held
pending decision of this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The central issue here posed is whether a judicial re­count may
be ordered in case there is a variance between a copy of the election returns
in the hands of the provincial treasurer and another copy of the same returns
given to one of the major political parties.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Section 163 of the Revised Election Code states:</p>

<blockquote>"<u>When statements of a precinct are contradictory</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>-In case it appears to the provincial board
of canvas­sers that another copy or other authentic copies of the statement
from an election precinct submitted to the board gives to a candidate a
different number of votes and the difference affects the result of the
election, the Court of First Instance of the province, upon motion of the board
or of any candidate affected, may proceed to recount the votes cast in the precinct
for the sole purpose of determining which is the true statement or which is the
true result of the count of the votes cast in said precinct for the office in
question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Notice of such proceeding
shall be given to all candidates affected."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The issue here is not new.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In <span class="SpellE"><u>Acuña</u></span> <u>v</u>. <span class="SpellE"><u>Golez</u></span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court, resolving a similar question, unequivocally held:</p>

<blockquote>"Section 150 of the Revised Election
Code provides that 'immediately after the count, the Board of Inspectors shall
make, complete and sign a writ­ten statement thereof in <u>quadruplicate</u>'
(under­scoring ours.) The four (4) copies of this state­ment, otherwise
referred to in Section 151 as 'election returns,' must, pursuant to Section 152
of said Code, be distributed as follows: one copy shall be placed in the box
for valid ballots, another copy shall be delivered to the municipal treasurer,
the third copy shall be sent by regis­tered mail to the provincial treasurer,
and the fourth shall be forwarded, likewise, by regis­tered mail, to the
Commission on Elections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pur­suant,
however, to a resolution of the Commission on Elections in Case No. 488
thereof, the two (2) major political parties are provided with one (1) copy
each of the election return for each precinct .<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>.
. .</blockquote>

<blockquote>"[I]n using the aforementioned phrase,
the framers of the Revised Election Code evidently had in mind the <u>four</u>
(4) copies mentioned in Section 150 there­of . . . . In other words, the
lawmakers could not have referred to any other copies, for no such co­pies were
prescribed in the Code."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, it is now settled doctrine that the discrepancy which
justifies a judicial recount is such only as appears in the different copies of
the election returns required to be accomplished by section 150.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Section 163 should be con­strued restrictively because of the special nature of
the authority conferred therein, and because otherwise that au­thority could be
utilized to delay the proclamation of the winning candidate to beyond the date
set for the beginning of the term of office of the position involved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The neces­sity of avoiding this contingency
becomes apparent when we consider that the effect of the delay is, in the case
of national offices for which there is no hold over, to leave the office
without any incumbent, and, in the case of local of­fices, whose incumbents may
hold over, to permit the losing candidate to extend his tenure, at the expense
and to the prejudice of the elected candidate.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Any other discrepancy is not, therefore, a sufficient warrant for a judicial
recount.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It may be added here that were the copy furnished to a political
party considered a basis for an action under section 163, untold opportunities
would be afforded a candidate to tam­per with the contents of his party's copy
and, on the basis of the artificial discrepancy created between his copy and
that of the provincial treasurer, demand a recount of the votes and thus delay
or even prevent the proclamation of his opponent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not to inveigh against either the
validity of the extra copies of the election returns or the wisdom of the
resolution of the COMELEC requiring their preparation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As this Court said in <span class="SpellE"><u>Acuña</u></span>
the said resolution does not contravene any statute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, additional copies in the
hands of the major political parties may have the general salutary effect of
dis­couraging attempts to tamper with the copies required by the Code owing to
the greater probability of detection of irregu­larities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The point is simply that the extra copies
cannot serve as a legal basis for comparison with any of those pres­cribed by
the Code for the purpose of a judicial recount.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent judge's order flies in the face of settled
interpretation of section 163 and should be stricken down.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the order of <st1:date year="1967" day="1" month="12">December 1, 1967</st1:date> of the respond­ent judge is set aside,
and the respondent provincial board of canvassers is directed to proceed with
the proclamation of the winning candidates, at respondents' cost.</p>
