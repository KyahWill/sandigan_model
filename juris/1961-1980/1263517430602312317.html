<p class="BODY">In the language of the petition:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"This is an original action for the issuance of the writs of
certiorari and prohibition under Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of Court whereby
herein petitioners seek to annul and set aside:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(1) The Order, dated July 13, 1967 * * * denying the Motion to Dismiss

<p class="BODY">It was likewise therein alleged that Civil Reservation Case No. 1
"settled the ownership, private and public, of the <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:place></st1:city> <span class="SpellE">townsite</span>,
terminating with the Decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City dated <st1:date year="1922" day="13" month="11">November

Prior to said case, however, a military reservation known as the U. S. Fleet
Naval Rehabilitation Center consisting of Lots 140 and 141 of the <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> Cadastre with an aggregate area of 29 hectares, more
or less, was set aside pursuant to Executive Order No. 1254 of October 10,
1910, issued by the then President William Howard Taft of the United States, as
attested by Proclamation No. 114 of the then Governor-General W. Cameron
Forbes, and Executive Order No. 5139 of June 19, 1929, issued by the then President
Herbert Hoover, as attested by Proclamation No. 260 of the then
Governor-General Dwight F. Davis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
independence, the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
relinquished to the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
all claims to title over the military bases including the afore­said lots,
their relinquishment being formalized by an agree­ment of <st1:date year="1956" day="6" month="12">December 6, 1956</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Then came this categorical assertion in the petition that the land involved in
this proceeding "is limited to what is admittedly, and by unquestionable
proof, within the so-called U.S. Fleet Naval Rehabilitation Center, Lots 140
and 141, <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> Cadastre."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">From a summary of the facts appearing in the Petition, the need
for including the other respondents was made clear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was therein set forth that on May 21, 1965
the <span class="SpellE">Pirasos</span>, respondents herein, relying on the
controlling statute set forth at the opening of this opinion, sought the
reopening of Civil Reservation Case No. 1, LRC Rec. No. 211 of the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City; praying for the
issuance in their favor of title to a parcel of land designated as LRC-SWO-6132
(Lots 140 and 141, <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> Cadastre) consisting of
290,283 square meters, more or less, situated in <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>
City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1965" day="11" month="9">September 11, 1965</st1:date>, respondent Daisy <span class="SpellE">Pacnos</span>
filed an opposition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She sought in a
pleading dated <st1:date year="1966" day="14" month="3">March 14, 1966</st1:date>
to be allowed to introduce evidence to prove her alleged right to registration
of a portion of the land, consisting of an area of 28,215.52 square meters,
subject of the proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion
was granted in an order of the respondent Judge dated <st1:date year="1966" day="16" month="5">May 16, 1966</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 26, 1967, the First Assistant City Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City, in behalf of all the government agencies-<span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>, filed a motion to dismiss the main petition and
other related petitions, alleging thereto the following grounds:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) that the court has no jurisdiction over
the subject matter of the petition; (2) that the causes of action alleged in
the petition are barred by prior judgment or by the statute of limitations; (3)
that the petition states no cause of action.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="13" month="7">July 13, 1967</st1:date>,
the respondent Judge denied the said motion to dismiss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then came on <st1:date year="1967" day="7" month="10">October 7, 1967</st1:date>, a decision by re­spondent Judge,
decreeing the registration of a portion of the land (28,215.58 square meters of
<st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 140, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:place></st1:city>
Cadastre), subject matter of the <span class="SpellE">Pirasos</span>' petition in
favor of respondent Daisy <span class="SpellE">Pacnos</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Solicitor General received his copy of
this decision on <st1:date year="1967" day="4" month="12">December 4, 1967</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">There, was a motion for reconsideration filed by the City
Attorney of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> of <st1:date year="1967" day="9" month="12">December 9, 1967</st1:date>, denied by respondent Judge on December
15, as "having been filed out of time".</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="3" month="1">January 3, 1968</st1:date>,
the City Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City joined by petitioner
Superintendent of the <st1:place><st1:placename>Military</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Academy</st1:placetype></st1:place>
and the Director of Lands jointly filed a notice of appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was on <st1:date year="1968" day="7" month="2">February 7, 1968</st1:date>, an <u>ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span></u>
motion for extension of time to submit a record on appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An opposition thereto was filed by counsel
for respondent Daisy <span class="SpellE">Pacnos</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1968" day="15" month="2">February
 15, 1968</st1:date>, the Solicitor General filed a motion to annul the
decision dated <st1:date year="1967" day="7" month="10">October 7, 1967</st1:date>,
based on lack of jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="2" month="8">August 2, 1968</st1:date>,
respondent Albino Reyes filed an <u>ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span></u>
motion for the issuance of a decree in his favor, having previously manifested
to respondent Judge that respondent Daisy <span class="SpellE">Pacnos</span> had
transferred her right to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
same day, respondent Judge issued an order considering that the motions for
reconsideration and the motion to annul decision filed by the Solicitor General
and other government lawyers "have been rendered academic and of no moment
on account of the filing of the notice of appeal on January 3, 1968," but
in his opinion of no avail the time to do so having lapsed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, no record on appeal was submitted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He like­wise directed in said order the
issuance of a decree to respondent "Albino Reyes, married to Isabel Sta.
Maria, Filipino, with residence at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>."
Another order specifically to that effect came from respondent Judge on the day
in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The last order of
pertinence to this petition ca e from respondent Judge on <st1:date year="1968" day="24" month="8">August 24, 1968</st1:date>, setting for hearing o <st1:date year="1968" day="11" month="9">September 11, 1968</st1:date> the claim of the
respondents, surnamed <span class="SpellE">Piraso</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then on <st1:date year="1968" day="18" month="10">October 18,
 1968</st1:date> came this petition for certiorari and prohibition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next day, this Court adopted a resolution
requiring respondents to file within ten days from notice an answer, not a
motion to dismiss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A preliminary
injunction was likewise issued without bond.</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, on November 8, 1968, the petitioners, through the
Solicitor General, filed a motion for leave to amend the petition, alleging
that the property, "subject matter of the case which re­spondent Daisy <span class="SpellE">Pacnos</span> succeeded in obtaining a favorable judgment of
registration * * * and which respondents Albino Reyes and Isabel <span class="SpellE">Santamaria</span> subsequently succeeded in securing a decree of
regis­tration" was thereafter transferred on August 16, 1968 to one Arturo
<span class="SpellE">Tongson</span>, who, thereby, would be affected by the
outcome of the<span style="">&nbsp; </span>petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The proposed amendment, according to this
motion, would consist of his inclusion as one of the respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accompanying his pleading is the amended
petition for certiorari and prohibition.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On November 21, 1968, we adopted a resolution in the following tenor:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The motion of the Solicitor General for
leave to amend petition for certiorari and prohibition with preliminary
injunction in L-29675 (Republic of the Philippines, et al. vs. Hon. <span class="SpellE">Pio</span> R. Marcos, etc., et al.), is [Granted]; the amended
petition for certiorari and prohibition with a prayer for preliminary
injunction is hereby accepted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent Arturo Tong son is required to file, within 10 days from
notice hereof, an answer (not a motion to dismiss) to said amended
petition."</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meanwhile, even before the motion for leave to file
amended petition was filed, respondents, the <span class="SpellE">Pirasos</span>,
submitted their answer on <st1:date year="1968" day="4" month="11">November 4,
 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To the assertion in
the petition, fundamental in character, that the reopening sought by private
respondents refers to lands "admittedly and by unquestion­able proof,
within the so-called U. S. Fleet Naval Reservation Center, " the <span class="SpellE">Pirasos</span> answered in this wise:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The land in question is not a military
reservation under the Republic of the Philippines although it was formerly
reserved and placed under the control of the Navy Department for the use as
Naval Hospital and for other purposes of the Navy during the American regime
(U. S. Government) pursuant to Executive Order No. 5139 (Annex 'B' of the
petition), and was subsequently released or turned over to the Republic of the
Philippines in accordance with the provisions of the U. S. -Philippine Military
Bases Agreement on Dec. 6, 1956 but the same has not been reserved for military
purposes by the Republic of the Philippines."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
They would hedge further by the disclaimer of any acceptance on their part that
the land subject of the petition forms part of the naval reservation, with the
further qualification that in any event, even if it be admitted that there is
such a reservation by the government, such lot is subject to private rights.</p>

<p class="BODY">That respondents <span class="SpellE">Pirasos</span> could not very
well explicitly deny the allegation that the lot in question forms part of the
naval reservation is quite apparent from its memorandum submitted in lieu of
oral argument filed on April 7, 1969, wherein in disputing the point raised by
petitioners that the lower court acted without jurisdiction, they stated the
following:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Contrary to the
allegation of the City Attorney, we humbly state categorically that the land
involved in this case is no longer a reservation in its strict sense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It ceased to be a Naval Reservation of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States of America</st1:place></st1:country-region> upon the termination of
its sovereignty over the islands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
formerly reserved and placed under the control of the U. S. Naval Department
for the use of Naval Hospital and for other purposes of the Navy during the
American Regime (U. S. Government) pursuant to Executive Order No. 5139 (Annex
'B' of the petition), and was subsequently released or turned over to the
Republic of the Philippines in accordance with the pro­visions of the U. S.
-Philippine Military Bases Agreement on December 6, 1956.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said parcel of land (<st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
140 of the <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City Cadastre) until this time was
not reserved for military purposes by the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The answer of respondents, Albino Reyes and Isabel <span class="SpellE">Santa­maria</span>, to the amended petition filed on <st1:date year="1968" day="21" month="11">November 21, 1968</st1:date>, expressly admits
what petitioners so emphatically insist on that this petition before us
"is limited to what is admittedly, and by unquestionable proof, within the
so-called U. S. Fleet Naval Rehabilitation Center, Lots 140 and 141, <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> Cadastre."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
For the first paragraph of their answer is explicitly worded thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"1.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That they admit the allegations of the Petition with respect to the
Nature of the Case * * * and with respect to the Parties and Jurisdictional
Averments * * *."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
The above assertion of petitioner was thus given conformity by respondents
Reyes and <span class="SpellE">Santamaria</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nonetheless, they would seek to blunt the force of their admission by
alleging:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"That they deny the
allegations in par.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>V-A-1 of the
Petition, the truth being that the land in question, particularly the area
decreed in the name of the answering respondents, is not part of a military
reservation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The proclamation declaring
certain areas to be naval reservations of the Government of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> (Annex B of the Petition) expressly
states that such reservations are 'subject to private rights if any there be.'
Upon the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
becoming independent in 1946 the said areas, by virtue of Executive Agreements,
reverted to disposable lands administered by the Bureau of Lands of the
Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There is a similar express admission in the answer filed on
December 13, 1968 by respondent Arturo <span class="SpellE">Tongson</span>, its
wording being almost identical with the answer of Albino Reyes and Isabel <span class="SpellE">Santamaria</span>:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"That in so far as they are borne out by and made part of the
records of the case, he admits the allegations of the Petition with respect to
the nature of the case * * * and with respect to the Parties and Jurisdictional
Averments * * *."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Again, this particular respondent did attempt to weaken the force of the above
admission by the assertion that the land decreed in favor of respondent Albino
Reyes is not part of the military reservation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He would justify this seeming contradiction thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"At any rate, when said areas were
turned over to the Philippine Government by virtue of the U. S. Philippine
Military Bases Agreement; the land in question reverted to the disposable lands
administered by the Bureau of Lands of the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the light of the allegation in the petition and the admissions
made in the answers of respondents, the <span class="SpellE">Pirasos</span>,
Albino Reyes and Isabel <span class="SpellE">Santamaria</span> as well as Arturo <span class="SpellE">Tongson</span>, even as sought to be qualified, it would seem to
be fairly obvious that the lots in question sought to be reopened in the
proceeding before respondent Judge Marcos form part and parcel of a naval
reservation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot escape attention
that the above private respondents did try by highly sophistical reasoning,
invoking distinctions far from persuasive, to avoid the legal effect of the
admissions as to the location of the disputed lots within a reservation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They must have realized that unless
successful in this attempt, doomed by failure from the outset, the facts being
simply against them, the juris­diction of respondent Court can, as petitioners
have done, be successfully impugned.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That is what petitioners did; they must be sustained.</p>

<p class="NUM">1. Republic Act No. 931 speaks in a manner far from
ambiguous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is quite explicit and
categorical.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only persons "claiming
title to parcels of land that have been the object of cadastral
proceedings" are granted the right to petition for a reopening thereof if
the other conditions named therein are successfully met.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot admit of doubt, therefore, that if
the parcels of land were not the object of cadastral proceedings, then this
statute finds no application.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consider­ing
that as far back as October 10, 1910, the then President of the United States,
William H. Taft, issued an executive order reserving for naval purposes the
lots now disputed, they could not have been the object of the cadastral
proceeding involving the <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> <span class="SpellE">townsite</span>
reservation, decided only on November 13, 1922.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">The Cadastral Act<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
was enacted on <st1:date year="1913" day="11" month="2">February 11, 1913</st1:date>,
taking effect on its passage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As is made
clear in the first section thereof, when public interest requires that titles
to any land be settled and adjudicated, in the opinion of the then executive,
the Governor General, he could order the Director of Lands or a private
surveyor named by the landowners, with the approval of the Director of Lands,
to make a survey and plan of such lands.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
Clearly, it does not include the survey of lands declared as reservations.</p>

<p class="BODY">An earlier act, enacted as far back as 1903,<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
specifically governs the subject matter of reservations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As provided therein:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"All lands or buildings, or any interest
therein, within the Philippine Islands lying within the boundaries of the areas
now or hereafter set apart and declared to be military reservations shall be
forthwith brought under the operations of the Land Registration Act, and such
of said lands, buildings, and interests therein as shall not be determined to
be public lands shall become registered land in accordance with the provisions
of said the Land Registration Act, under the circumstances hereinafter
stated." The validity of this statute was sustained as against the
allegation that there was a violation of the due process clause, in a 1910
decision, Jose v. Commander of the Philippine Squadron.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In a 1918 decision, this Court had occasion to indicate clearly
that the proceeding under this statute, while analogous too, is not covered by
the Cadastral Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It will thus be seen that Act No. 627
contemplates a sort of cadastral proceeding wherein private owners may be
forced to come in and register their titles, under penalty of forfeiture of all
right in the land included in the reservation in case they fail to act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The validity of a law of this character can
not be questioned; and this court has uniformly up­held the Act now under
consideration."<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">What is even more conclusive as to the absence of any right on
the part of the private respondents to seek a reopening under Republic Act No.
931 is our ruling in Government v. Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, a 1926 decision.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
We there explicitly held:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The
defendant's contention that the respondent court, in a cadastral case, has
jurisdiction to order the registration of portions of a legally established
military reservation cannot be sustained.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The establishment of military reservations is governed by Act No. 627 of
the Philippine Commission and Section 1 of that Act provides that 'All lands or
buildings, or any interest therein, within the Philippine Islands lying within
the boundaries of the areas now or hereafter set apart and declared to be
military reservations shall be forthwith brought under the operations of the
Land Registration Act, * * *.' "</p>

<p class="BODY">The conclusion is therefore inescapable that, as contended by
petitioners, respondent Judge is devoid of jurisdiction to pass upon the claim
of private respondents invoking the benefits of Republic Act No. 931.</p>

<p class="NUM">2. This lack of jurisdiction on the part of respondent Judge is made
more patent by another specific restriction of the right of a person to seek
reopening under this statute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the
power of the Court to order such reopening is limited "to such of said
parcels of land as have not been alienated, reserved, leased, granted, or
otherwise provisionally or permanently disposed of by the Government K*
*."<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
Included in the petition is an executive order of the then President Herbert
Hoover of June 19, 1929, declaring to be a naval reservation of the Government
of the United States "that tract of land known as lot no. 141, residence
Section D, <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> naval reservation, heretofore
reserved for naval purposes * * *." If there were still any lingering
doubt, that ought to be removed by this reaffirmation of a presidential determination,
then binding and conclusive as we were under American sovereignty, that the lot
in question should be a naval reservation.</p>

<p class="NUM">3. The private respondents are thus bereft of any right which they
could assert under Republic Act No. 931.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such an enactment is the basis of whatever standing that would justify
their reliance on the specific power granted courts of first instance to reopen
cadas­tral proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
jurisdiction is thus limited and specific.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Unless a party can make it manifest by express language or a clear
implication from the wording of the statute too strong to be resisted, he may
not set in motion the judicial machinery under such specific grant of
authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This, private respondents
have failed to do as the statute in terms that are crystal clear and free from
ambiguity denies them such a right.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioners have made out their case for certiorari and prohibition.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the writ of certiorari is granted annulling and
setting aside the order of respondent Judge a July 13, 1967, denying the motion
to dismiss dated January 26, 1967 filed by the City Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City in <u>behalf</u> of <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>-government
agencies; his decision, dated October 7, 1967, decreeing the registration of a
parcel of land with an area of 28,215.58 square meters within Lot 140, <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> Cadastre, or within the so-called "U. S. Fleet
Naval Reservation Center" in favor of respondent Daisy <span class="SpellE">Pacnos</span>;
his order of August 2, 1968 which in effect denied the motion to annul decision
dated February 9, 1968 filed by the Solicitor General, and instead ordered the
issuance of a decree over the same parcel of land in favor of respondent Albino
Reyes; and his order, dated August 24, 1968 allowing respondents <span class="SpellE">Kosen</span> <span class="SpellE">Piraso</span>, et al., to adduce
their evidence of alleged ownership.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
writ of prohibition is likewise granted perpetually restraining respondent
Judge from further taking cognizance of and further assuming jurisdiction over
the reopening of Civil Reservation Case No. 1 LRC Rec. No. 211 as sought by the
private respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The preliminary
injunction issued is hereby made permanent.<span style="">&nbsp;

Republic Act No. 931 specifically provides:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Section 1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All persons
claiming title to parcels of land that have been the object of cadastral
proceedings, who at the time of the survey were in actual possession of the
same, but for some justifiable reason had been unable to file their claim in
the proper court during the time limit established by law, in case such parcels
of land, on account of their failure to file such claims, have been, or are
about to be declared land of the public domain, by virtue of judicial
proceedings instituted within the forty years next preceding the approval of
this Act, are hereby granted the right within five years after the date on
which this Act shall take effect, to petition for a reopening of the judicial
proceedings under the provisions of Act Numbered Twenty-two hundred and
fifty-nine, as amended, only with respect to such of said parcels of land as
have not been alienated, reserved, leased, granted, or otherwise provisionally
or permanently disposed of by the Government, and the competent Court of First
Instance, upon receiving such petition, shall notify the Government, through
the Solicitor General, and if after hearing the parties, said court shall find
that all conditions herein established have been complied with, and that all
taxes, interests and penalties thereof have been paid from the time when land
tax should have been collected until the day when the motion is presented, it
shall order said Judicial proceedings reopened as if no action has been taken
on such parcels." Under Republic Act No. 2061, an Act approved on June $0,
1958, the period for the reopening of judicial proceedings under the above
statute was extended to <st1:date year="1968" day="31" month="12">December 31,
 1968</st1:date>.</p>
