Director of Lands in March, 1969; whereas the <span class="SpellE">Tarucs</span>

against the said application.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Due

motions, one for <span class="GramE">reconsideration</span>, and another for
reinvestiga­tion, were both denied by the same department head on October 4,

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, Daniel <span class="SpellE">Taruc</span> died.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
On June 14, 1968, appeal was taken (in the deceased's name) to the President of
the Philippines from the Secretary's decision of April 28, 1966 and order of
October 4, 1967.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before the
administrative case could be fully terminated, however, or on November 10, 1967
to be precise, the <span class="SpellE">Tarucs</span>, all heirs of the late
Daniel <span class="SpellE">Taruc</span>, commenced civil case 1218 against the <span class="SpellE">Firmalos</span> in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> del Norte, presided by the respondent judge who was
on mere detail thereat due to the absence of the regular judge, Her­nando
Pineda.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complaint, styled "for
the quieting of title and to prevent a cloud from being cast on said
title," alleged that the <span class="SpellE">Tarucs</span> succeeded to all
the rights and property of the late Daniel <span class="SpellE">Taruc</span>;
that the latter, during his lifetime, was "the owner and in possession,
free, open and uninterrupted" of the land in dispute since 1929, the same
being covered by a free patent application in his name; that the defendants <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Dionisia</span> <span class="SpellE">Dajunos</span> have asserted a claim over the same property by
virtue of an invalid deed of sale executed in their favor by the defendant
Manuel <span class="SpellE">Fir­malo</span>; and that this claim tended to cast a
cloud on the <span class="SpellE">Tarucs</span>' title and disturbed the latter's
ownership.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Tarucs</span>
asked the court to adjudicate to them the land in question, to the exclusion of
the <span class="SpellE">Firmalos</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 10, 1968, the <span class="SpellE">Firmalos</span> filed an
answer to the above complaint, setting up the two decisions of the Director of
Lands and the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources rendered in their
favor and, by way of counterclaim, demanding from the <span class="SpellE">Tarucs</span>
payment of damages for the loss occasioned by the latter's refusal to yield
possession of the disputed property.</p>

<p class="BODY">Civil case 1218 was twice calendared for pre-trial but neither
the <span class="SpellE">Firmalos</span> nor their counsel appeared, and hearing
was conse­quently held <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> for
reception of the evidence of the <span class="SpellE">Tarucs</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, on <st1:date year="1968" day="8" month="10">October 8, 1968</st1:date>, the respondent judge rendered a deci­sion
declaring the <span class="SpellE">Tarucs</span> the "true equitable
owners" of the land subject of that case and the rightful possessors
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No appeal was taken from this
decision, causing the same to become "final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>."</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, however, the President of the Philippines acted on
the late Daniel <span class="SpellE">Taruc's</span> appeal in the administrative
pro­ceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a decision handed down
on December 6, 1968, the President sustained the Secretary of Agriculture and
Natural Resources.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This opened the way
for the <span class="SpellE">Firmalos</span> to apply for a title to the
land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, on March 28, 1969,
Original Certificate of Title P-2881 was issued to the <span class="SpellE">Firmalos</span>,
covering 13 hectares of land, a large portion of which is admittedly the same
property adjudicated by the respondent judge in favor of the <span class="SpellE">Tarucs</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 5, 1969, a new action, civil case 1528, was commenced
by the <span class="SpellE">Firmalos</span> against the <span class="SpellE">Tarucs</span>
in the same court, now presided by Judge Hernando Pineda, for "ownership,
posses­sion and damages with preliminary mandatory injunction." The <span class="SpellE">Firmalos</span> invoked the title of ownership administratively
awarded to them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On November 24, 1969,
finding merit in the verified complaint filed by the <span class="SpellE">Firmalos</span>,
Judge Pineda issued an order granting the petition for preliminary mandatory
injunction and directing the <span class="SpellE">Tarucs</span> to vacate the
land covered by the <span class="SpellE">Firmalos</span>' title.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Tarucs</span> filed a
motion for reconsideration of this order, claiming that the "final"
judgment in civil case 1218 barred the filing of the new action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They likewise offered to file a counter-bond
for the lifting of the injunction against them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This motion was, however, denied in an order dated February 17,
1970.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a result, the possession of the
land in dispute shifted to the <span class="SpellE">Firmalos</span> and there
remained until about half a year later when Judge Pineda retired from the bench
and the respondent judge again took over.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 31, 1970, a writ of execution was issued by the
respondent judge in civil case 1218, enforcing the judgment of October 28,
1968.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This writ was served upon the <span class="SpellE">Firmalos</span> and the possession of the property in question was
thereby effectively returned to the <span class="SpellE">Tarucs</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On September 2, 1970, the <span class="SpellE">Firmalos</span>
filed an urgent motion for the recall of the above writ, mounting an attack on
the jurisdiction of the court in civil case 1218 to adjudicate the ownership
and possession of the prop­erty which admittedly belonged to the category of
public land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion was denied by
the respondent judge on September 12, 1970.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He ruled that the court's "final" judgment may be annulled
only by an independent action for that purpose and not by mere motion filed by
the aggrieved party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further, the
respondent judge declared the writ of preliminary mandatory injunction issued
in civil case 1528 in favor of the <span class="SpellE">Firmalos</span> dissolved
and without force and effect.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is in the context of this situation that the present petition
found its way to this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The central issue presented to us for resolution is, whether the court
below had the power to determine, in civil case 1218, which of the adverse
claimants therein had the better right to the ownership of the property in
litigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his decision, the respondent judge, after discrediting the
claim of the <span class="SpellE">Firmalos</span>, held that:</p>

<blockquote>"... On the other hand, though it is
shown by the evidence of the plaintiffs [the <span class="SpellE">Tarucs</span>]
that the land in question is a public land and applied before [<u>sic</u>] a
patent title by the late Daniel <span class="SpellE">Taruc</span> under Free
Patent Application No. 17-6267, it could be con­cluded that plaintiffs have an
equitable title or interest in the land in question because by their <span class="SpellE">contin</span>[u]<span class="SpellE">ous</span>, adverse, open and
peaceful posses­sion of said land since 1929 up to the present, <u>they are
entitled to a free patent title to said land and<span style="">&nbsp; </span>they are regarded as equitable owners of the
same</u> as a basis of their action." (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">In effect, the court below was, knowingly
or unknowingly, substi­tuting its judgment in place of the two decisions that
at that time had already been rendered by the Director of Lands and the Secre­tary
of Agriculture and Natural Resources in favor of the <span class="SpellE">Firmalos</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But even while the <span class="SpellE">Tarucs</span>
have concealed (intentionally or other­wise) in their complaint or omitted from
their evidence the fact that the administrative proceedings over the same
property had already reached that stage where only the President's action on
Daniel <span class="SpellE">Taruc's</span> appeal stood in the way of a grant of
title to the <span class="SpellE">Firmalos</span>, the court should have
nevertheless desisted from passing judgment upon the respective claims of the
parties over the parcel of public land in dispute.</p>

<p class="BODY">The action commenced by the <span class="SpellE">Tarucs</span> is
not one of the <span class="SpellE">possessory</span> actions which, we have
held, courts have power to determine notwithstanding that the property affected
thereby is public land.</p>

<blockquote>"Courts have jurisdiction over <span class="SpellE">possessory</span> actions involving public lands to determine the
issue of physical possession (in forcible entry cases before inferior courts)
or the better right of possession (in <span class="SpellE"><u>accion</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>publiciana</u></span> cases before courts of first
instance.)"<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Neither is the action one for a judicial
review of the decision of the Director of Lands, something which jurisprudence
recognizes in those instances where there is fraud, imposition or mistake other
than error of judgment in estimating the value or effect of the evidence,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
or where the correctness of the legal conclusions of the Director is in issue.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
The <span class="SpellE">Tarucs</span>' action was for "quiet­ing of
title" and necessitated determination of the respective rights of the
litigants, both claimants to a free patent title, over a piece of property,
admittedly public land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
as relied upon by jurisprudence,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
lodges "the power of executive control, adminis­tration, disposition and
alienation of public lands with the Director of Lands subject, of course, to
the control of the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In sum, the decision rendered in civil case 1218 on October 28,
1968 is a patent nullity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court
below did not have power to determine who (the <span class="SpellE">Firmalos</span>
or the <span class="SpellE">Tarucs</span>) were entitled to an award of free
patent title over that piece of property that yet belonged to the public
domain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither did it have power to
adjudge the <span class="SpellE">Tarucs</span> as entitled to the "true
equitable ownership" thereof, the latter's effect being the same:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the exclusion of the <span class="SpellE">Firmalos</span>
in favor of the <span class="SpellE">Tarucs</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the decision of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
in civil case 1218 dated October 28, 1968 is hereby set aside as being null and
void, together with the writ of execution and the order of Septem­ber 12, 1970

In view of the conflicting claims regarding which of the parties has been in
longer possession of the property the Regional Land Officer of <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> de <span class="SpellE">Oro</span> city conducted a
hearing (at which both sides presented their evidence) and made an ocular ins­pection
of the disputed land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, the
Director of Lands, in a decision dated December 16, 1963, found the
preponderance of evidence in favor of the <span class="SpellE">Firmalos</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Daniel <span class="SpellE">Taruc</span>
appealed to the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources alleging that
the Regional Land Officer erred (a) in finding "that the late <span class="SpellE">Ireneo</span> <span class="SpellE">Firmalo</span> had been in
exclusive possession of the land in question long before the war up to his
death in 1955; and (b) in disregarding the tes­timonies of <span class="SpellE">Taruc's</span>
tenants and the adjoining landowners to the effect that he (<span class="SpellE">Taruc</span>)
was the actual occupant and pos­sessor of the land." In a decision dated
April 28, 1966, the Secretary found the errors assigned to be without basis,
and affirmed the Director's findings of fact as well as the latter's
adjudication of the land to the <span class="SpellE">Firmalos</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Taruc's</span> appeal to
the President was similarly adjudged to be without merit.</p>
