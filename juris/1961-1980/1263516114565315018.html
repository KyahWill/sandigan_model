THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF QUEZON, THE PROVINCIAL FISCAL OF QUEZON AND
ARACELI TORRE­CHANTE, RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.P., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Respondent Araceli Torrechante filed on July 21, 1964 a complaint
for libel against petitioner Raquel Doce be­fore the Municipal Court of Real,
Quezon Province.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At­tached to the
complaint were the affidavits of respondent and her witness, one Dionisio Destojo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to res­pondent, also annexed to the
complaint was a photostatic copy of the letter<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
sent by petitioner to her which was the basis of the complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">The complaint was amended on August <span style="">4, </span>1964, with the further allegation that Torrechante suffered
moral damages on account of the libelous letter sent by peti­tioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On August 12, 1964, Judge Cabungcal, the
Munici­pal Judge at Real, was allowed by the Court of First Ins­tance to
inhibit himself from the case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, Judge Juntereal of the <span style="">Municipality </span>of Infanta, Quezon, was de­signated to hear the case
at the Municipality of Real in place of Judge Cabungcal.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 28, 1964, Judge Juntereal issued a warrant of arrest
for petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The officer's return
shows that this was served on petitioner on December 16, 1964.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
She was not detained however, because of the bail bond admit­tedly prepared and
filed by her even as early as July 24, 1<span style="">964
yet.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On April 23, 1965, the case was called for the se­cond stage of
the preliminary investigation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner appeared without counsel and she asked for postponement which
was granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On December 4, 1965,
petitioner filed a manifestation requesting that the preliminary investigation
which had been reset to December 11, 1965 be <span style="">con­ducted </span>in Lucena City where she
resides instead of <span style="">at </span>the
Municipality of Real.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner apparently failed to show up at Real on December 11,
1965 for the municipal court subsequently issued an order, dated January 13,
1966, stating that pe­titioner's manifestation was an implied waiver of her
right to the preliminary investigation and ruling "x <span style="">x x </span>that
there is <span style="">a </span>prima-facie case
against the accused."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
The case was then forwarded to the Court of First Instance.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 21, 1966, the provincial fiscal filed the information
for <span style="">libel </span>against petitioner
before the Court of First Instance of Quezon sitting at Lucena City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner was then able to secure
postponements of the first two dates set for the arraignment, which was 'final­ly
reset on June 21, 1966.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this latter
date, without being arraigned, petitioner filed <span style="">a </span>motion to quash on the <span style="">ground that there had neither been </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">preliminary examina­</span><span style="">tion nor investigation in the case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The court <u>a</u> <u><span style="">quo</span></u><span style=""> </span>denied the motion, by <span style="">its </span>order da­ted June 22, 1966, ruling
that it had jurisdiction over the person of petitioner and "x x x that a
preliminary investigation had<span style=""> </span>been previous<span style="">l</span>y
conducted in accordance with established procedure.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
When her motion for reconsideration failed, petitioner instituted the present
petition for certiorari and prohibition.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is petitioner's principal submission that the court a quo did
not acquire jurisdiction to try her for the <span style="">offense </span>Charged because: (1) the warrant of arrest was
defectively issued, and (2) <span style="">there </span>was
no preliminary investigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is merit in the assertion that the warrant of arrest was
irregularly issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section <span style="">87 </span>of the Judiciary Act as amended by
Republic Act <span style="">3828</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> requires </span>that the Municipal Judge
issuing the same, <u>personally</u> <span style="">examine
</span>under oath the witnesses, and by <u><span style="">searching</span></u><span style=""> </span>questions
and answers which are to be reduced to writing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Here, instead of searching questions and answers, we have only the <span style="">affidavits of respondent and her one
witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, said affidavits were
sworn to before Judge Cabungcal, not before Judge Juntereal who issued the
warrant of arrest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">However, the giving of bail bond by petitioner cons­titutes a
waiver of the <span style="">irregularity </span>attending
her arrest.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Besides, by her other personal appearances before the municipal court and the
court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u><span style="">, </span>petitioner
vo­luntarily submitted herself to the court's Jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the absence of preliminary examination
becomes moot already, the court having acquired jurisdiction over the person of
petitioner and could therefore proceed with the preliminary investigation
proper.</p>

<p class="BODY">Now, it was petitioner's fault that no full dress <span style="">preliminary investigation proper </span>as
contemplated in Rule 112, Section 10, of the Rules of Court was conducted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was aware that it had been set on
December 11, 1965, but apparently, petitioner failed to show up in court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She must have assumed that her
request-manifestation of Decem­ber <span style="">4, </span>1965
would be granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Following the ordinary
course of Judicial procedure, it must be presumed that the criminal case was
called <span style="">for </span>preliminary
investiga­tion on December 11, 1965. <span style="">Since </span>petitioner did not show up, the court
considered this as waiver on her part.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was nothing more left for the court to do but forward the records
of the case to the Court of First Instance upon finding the existence of <u>prima</u>
<u>facie</u> case against the ac­cused.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since petitioner had already been afforded the oppor­tunity for
preliminary investigation proper and consider­ing further that the municipal
judge, herself had already found a <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u>, case for libel,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
there was no more need for the provincial<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>fiscal to conduct his own prelimi­nary investigation under <span style="">Section </span><span style="">14 </span>of Rule 112.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyway, petitioner's rights could still be
amply protected in the forthcoming trial of the cause.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition, for lack of merit, is hereby
dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Costs against petitioner
Raquel Doce.</p>
