				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">A conflict between a sales application filed by Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Gorgonio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pabiling</span> and a homestead
application of <span class="SpellE">Crisanto</span> <span class="SpellE">Parinacio</span>
predecessor in interest of herein respondent <span class="SpellE">Isidoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Parinacio</span> having been decided by the Director of Lands -
hereinafter referred to as the Director - in favor of <span class="SpellE">Pabiling</span>,
an appeal was taken by <span class="SpellE">Crisanto</span> <span class="SpellE">Parinacio</span>
to the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Re­sources - hereinafter referred
to as the Secretary - who reversed the decision of the Director and rendered
another decision in favor of the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Crisanto</span> <span class="SpellE">Parinacio</span>, who had died meanwhile.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon denial of his motion for reconsideration
of the latter decision, <span class="SpellE">Pabi­ling</span> filed, with the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span> - hereinafter
referred to as the CFI - this civil action for certiorari, against <span class="SpellE">Isidoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Parinacio</span>, the Director
and the Secretary, to annul the lat­ter's decision and his order denying said
motion for reconsideration, to revive the decision of the Director and to
recover from <span class="SpellE">Isidoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Parinacio</span>
the possession of the disputed land, as well as damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The CFI having, in due course, rendered
judgment dismissing the case, with double costs against <span class="SpellE">Pabiling</span>,
the latter appealed to the Court of Appeals, which, upon submission of the case
for decision on the merits, certified the records to the Supreme Court, upon
the ground that the issues raised in the appeal are purely questions of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">With reference to the first assignment of error, it appears that,
when this case was called for trial in the CFI, on January 29, 1962, <span class="SpellE">Pabiling's</span> counsel moved for postponement, upon the ground
that <span class="SpellE">Pabiling</span> was not present, owing, perhaps, to
"inability to get a transportation from his place or x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
due to circumstances beyond his control.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Court denied the motion; but, instead of proceed­ing immediately
with the hearing, it called a recess, "to give coun­sel a chance to wait
for his client." When the session was resumed later, that same day, said
counsel stated that, "in order to facilitate the termination of this
case", he would "just present our docu­mentary evidence, " which
he did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, respondents pro­ceeded
to introduce similar evidence, which formed part of the records of the Bureau
of Lands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the presentation of
certified copies of said documents and the filing of memoranda by both par­ties,
the CFI rendered its aforementioned decision, from which, after the denial of a
motion for reconsideration thereof, <span class="SpellE">Pabiling</span>
interposed the present appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is clear from the foregoing that the first assignment of error
is devoid of merit, for: 1) <span class="SpellE">Pabiling's</span> failure to
appear be­fore the trial Court has not been explained, much less justified; 2)
no effort has ever been made to show that his testimony, if introduced in
evidence, would probably change the result of the case; 3) no petition for new
trial, to introduce said testimony, has been filed; and 4) <span class="SpellE">Pabiling's</span>
testimony had been introduced in the Bureau of Lands - hereinafter referred to
as the Bureau - and formed part of the documentary evidence presented in the
CFI and considered by the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, this being an action for certiorari, based upon the
theory that the decision of the Secretary is "null and void, for being
contrary to evidence, law and jurisprudence", no other evi­dence than that
which the Secretary had before him should be con­sidered in the determination
of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, "the findings
of the Secretary can not be enervated by new evidence not laid before him, for
that would be tantamount to holding a new investigation, and to substitute for
the discretion and judgment of the Secretary the discretion and judgment of the
court, to whom the statute had not entrusted the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is immaterial that the present action
should be one for prohibition or injunction and not one for certiorari, in
either event the case must be resolved upon the evidence submitted to the
Secretary, since a judicial review of executive decisions does not import a
trial <u>de</u> <u>novo</u>, but only an ascertainment of whether the executive
findings are not in violation of the Constitution or of the law, and are free
from fraud or imposition, and whether they find reasonable support in the evidence.

<p class="BODY">As regards the second assignment of error, the records show that
the decision of the Director is dated June 15, 1959; that copy of said decision
was sent by registered mail, in Manila, on July 6, 1959, addressed to "<span class="SpellE">Crisanto</span> <span class="SpellE">Parinacio</span>, c/o Santiago <span class="SpellE">Pari­nacio</span>, Cordon, <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>;
" and that the envelope containing said copy was received at the post
office of Cordon, <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>, on July 9, 1959.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch as <span class="SpellE">Parinacio's</span>
notice of appeal from said decision is dated <st1:date year="1959" day="7" month="12">December 7, 1959</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Pabiling</span>
concludes that the appeal had not been perfected within the period of 60 days
prescribed in the rules and regulations of the Department of Agriculture and
Natural Re­sources - hereinafter referred to as the Department.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Pabiling</span> insists in this pretense -
despite the fact that the envelope containing copy of the decision of the
Director was returned "unclaimed" to its sender - upon the ground
that the postmaster of Cordon, <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span> - who is
presumed to have complied with his duty - must have sent the corresponding notice
to the addressee and that the latter is deemed to have received said decision
upon expiration of five (5) days from receipt of said notice, which, <span class="SpellE">Pabiling</span> further assumes, must have been more than 60 days
before December 7, 1959.</p>

<p class="BODY">This process of reasoning presupposes, however, that the
addressee had received said notice, on which there is absolutely no
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And there could have been no
possible receipt of such notice by its addressee, namely, "Mr. <span class="SpellE">Crisanto</span> <span class="SpellE">Parinacio</span> c/o Santiago <span class="SpellE">Parinacio</span>, Cordon, <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>,
" because:1) <span class="SpellE">Crisanto</span> <span class="SpellE">Parinacio</span>
had died on December 4, 1957, and the Director's attention was called thereto,
on June 18, 1959, and the deceased was, accordingly substituted, in the
administrative proceedings in the Bureau, by his heirs, represented by herein
respondent, <span class="SpellE">Isidoro</span> Parinacio;<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a> 2) no person by the name of
Santiago <span class="SpellE">Parinacio</span> existed in Cordon, <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>.; and 3) according to the records of the Bureau,
the ad­dress of <span class="SpellE">Crisanto</span> <span class="SpellE">Parinacio</span>
is <span class="SpellE"><u>Inanama</u></span><u>, <span class="SpellE">Angadanan</span></u>,
<span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>, so that, even if alive, he could not have
possibly received the notice from the postmaster of <u>Cordon</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, since the <span class="SpellE">Parinacios</span> were
represented, in the Bureau, by counsel, the notice should have been sent to the
latter, not to his client.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate,
the CFI found that <span class="SpellE">Isidoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Parinacir</span>
did not know of said decision until the last week of October 1959, when
Patrolman Isidro Zuniga of <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span> inquired from him
about the identity of the Santiago <span class="SpellE">Parinacio</span>, who
turned out to be a non existent person.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In short, there is nothing to show that either the Director or the
Secretary had erred in giving due course to <st1:city><st1:place>Paris</st1:place></st1:city>
appeal from the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">Being interrelated, the last three assignments of error will be
discussed jointly, for they refer to the merits of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pertinent facts are:</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Pabiling</span> had, in 1932, filed, with the
Bureau, a sales application for a tract of land of about 32 hectares, located
in the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Mu­nicipality</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Angadanan</span></st1:placename></st1:place>, <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
application and that of one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Sumen</span>, were in conflict with a sales application of Marcel
Villanueva, Said conflict was, on October 3, 1936, decided, adversely to the
latter, by the Director, who rejected Villanueva's appli­cation and gave due
course to the applications of <span class="SpellE">Pabiling</span> and <span class="SpellE">Sume</span> On November 23, 1938, <span class="SpellE">Sumen</span>
sold his improvements on the land covered by his application to <span class="SpellE">Valentin</span> <span class="SpellE">Nacino</span>, in view of which
the Director cancelled <span class="SpellE">Sumen's</span> a application and
accepted the sales ap­plication of <span class="SpellE">Nacino</span>, with
reference only to a portion of the land covered by the same and known as Lot
No. 7333 of the Santiago <span class="SpellE">Cadas­ter</span>, the rest of said
land being still <span class="SpellE">unsurveyed</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, <span class="SpellE">Nacino</span> died and, claiming
to have succeeded to his rights under said application, his father-in-law, <span class="SpellE">Crisanto</span> <span class="SpellE">Parinacio</span>, addressed a
communication to the Director complaining about <span class="SpellE">Pabiling's</span>
alleged refusal to recognize his (<span class="SpellE">Parinacio's</span>) rights
over said <span class="SpellE">unsurveyed</span> tract of land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This led to an investigation by the Bureau,
which culminated in a compromise agreement embodied in a joint affidavit,
Exhibit 1, dated October 20, 1947, and acknow­ledged, by both parties, before
Junior Public Lands Inspector <span class="SpellE">Mar­celino</span> <span class="SpellE">Hernaez</span>, whereby <span class="SpellE">Pabiling</span>
relinquished, in favor of <span class="SpellE">Crisanto</span> <span class="SpellE">Parinacio</span>, whatever rights and interests the former had
over the area actually held by the latter, as set forth in a sketch appearing
on the back of said instrument.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, the District Land Of­ficer issued an order, dated <st1:date year="1947" day="29" month="11">November 29, 1947</st1:date>, dropping <span class="SpellE">Parinacio's</span> aforementioned protest and amending <span class="SpellE">Pabiling's</span> application, by ex­cluding <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
the area covered by said agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
conformity with the same, soon later, or on <st1:date year="1948" day="3" month="5">May 3, 1948</st1:date>, a homestead application<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a> filed by <span class="SpellE">Parinacio</span>,
on <st1:date year="1947" day="21" month="10">October 21, 1947</st1:date>, for
said area, was approved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In due course
thereafter, an order for the issuance of a patent <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>,
in favor of <span class="SpellE">Parinacio</span>, was issued on <st1:date year="1953" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1953</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, the public auction for the sale of the land covered by
<span class="SpellE">Pabiling's</span> application had been held in 1949 and said
land was formally awarded to him on <st1:date year="1951" day="20" month="9">September
 20, 1951</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometime later, or
6n June 21, 1953, <span class="SpellE">Pabiling</span> protested against <span class="SpellE">Parinacio's</span> afore­mentioned homestead application, upon the
ground that it had been filed through stealth and machinations, the land
therein applied for having allegedly been held by <span class="SpellE">Parinacio</span>
with his (<span class="SpellE">Pabiling's</span>) permis­sion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Director decided the issue in favor of <span class="SpellE">Pabiling</span>, but, on appeal taken by the <span class="SpellE">Parinacios</span>,
the Secretary reversed the Director's decision and found for the <span class="SpellE">Parinacios</span>, stating</p>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> During
the investigation of his protest, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Pabiling</span> repudiated the terms of the joint affidavit and
maintained that what he agreed to relinquish was an area eighty (80) meters
distant from the boundary line of Santiago and <span class="SpellE">Angadanan</span>
(Alicia), along the <span class="SpellE">Nagbacalan</span> Creek to a <span class="SpellE">balala</span> tree; that the distance was actually measured by the
parties without the presence of the Junior Land Inspector concerned who
remained in the house of <span class="SpellE">Parinacio</span> while they were
measuring the area; that at the time they signed the affidavit there was no
sketch appearing at the back thereof.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On the other hand, the Junior Public Land Inspector concerned
testified that he actually measured the area together with the parties and the
two others and after which he prepared the affidavit and have the same
translated to the par­ties by one Pedro <span class="SpellE">Leano</span>, a tax
collector who happened to be present at the time and who like­wise affixed his
signature to the affidavit; and that he was quite positive, that at the time
the parties affixed their signatures the sketch was already drawn at the back
of said document.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"This case hinges on the appreciation of the probative value
of the joint affidavit in the light of the surrounding facts relevant thereto.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Uncontroverted</span> is the fact that at
the time of the ocular investigation on October 20, 1947 leading to the
amicable settlement, <span class="SpellE">Parinacio</span> was found to be in
actual occupation of the area in controversy (portion "B" shown in
the sketch drawn at the back hereof) and to have fully im­proved the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Uncontroverted</span> also
is the fact that at the time of the ocular investigation conducted sometime in
1954 by reason of the pro­test of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Pabiling</span>, <span class="SpellE">Parinacio</span> was still in
actual occupation of the same area.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These facts certainly are strong and convincing reasons for us to give
faith and credit to the aforesaid joint affidavit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it were true that the sketch appearing in
said joint affidavit did not express the true area relinquished by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Pabiling</span>, he could have
immediately protested against the continued occupation and possession of <span class="SpellE">Parinacio</span> of the <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>
area as he is just staying in portion "A" (See sketch), adjacent to
the said area occu­pied by <span class="SpellE">Parinacio</span>, and as thus
situated, he can be considered to have been fully aware of what was taking place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But this he failed to do and instead he
tolerated <span class="SpellE">Parinacio's</span> continued occupancy and only
protested in 1953 after a lapse of five (5) years and nine (9) months from the
execution of the amic­able settlement on <st1:date year="1947" day="2" month="10">October 2, 1947</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This circum­stance would compel us to conclude that he res­pected the
said joint affidavit and recognized the rights of <span class="SpellE">Parinacio</span>
over the said area for the said period, and after which he decided to change
his mind and repudiated the affidavit.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Moreover, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Pabiling's</span> claim that he relinquished only an area of
eighty (80) me­ters wide from the Santiago-<span class="SpellE">Angadanan</span>
boundary, along the <span class="SpellE">Nagbacalan</span> Creek, to a <span class="SpellE">Balala</span> tree, cannot be relied upon as that is only the
measure of the distance of only one side of the area, leaving us entirely in
the dark to conjecture the distances of the other sides of the area, if we are
to sustain his claim and segregate the true area he relinquished in favor of <span class="SpellE">Parinacio</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In view of the foregoing considerations, the decision
appealed from should be, as hereby its, set aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sales Application No. 16263 (E?V-793)
of <span class="SpellE">Gorgonio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pabiling</span> should
be, as hereby it is, amended, by excluding <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
portion "B" shown in the sketch drawn at the back here­of, and as
thus amended, the said application and H. A. No. V-8447 (E-V-7884) of <span class="SpellE">Crisanto</span> <span class="SpellE">Parina­cio</span>, now his
heirs, covering said portion "B" shall be given further due course.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is urged that the findings of fact made by the Director are more
weighty than those of the Secretary, because the former had observed the <span class="SpellE">behaviour</span> of the witnesses whom the latter has not
seen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their testimony was taken,
however, in the presence of neither the Director nor the Secretary, but before
subordinate officers of the Bureau.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Besides, a decision of the Director is conclusive upon question's of
facts and not subject to review by the courts <u>if affirmed</u> by the
Secretary and supported by substantial evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar, said decision was not
affirmed by the Secretary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Worse still,
it was set aside and reversed by the latter, who, by law, has <u>control</u>
over the Director, whose decisions must, accordingly, yield to those of the
Secretary</p>

<p class="BODY">Then, again, <span class="SpellE">Pabiling's</span> case is
anchored upon his testi­mony, to the effect that he had not understood the
contents of the aforementioned compromise agreement - subscribed and sworn to
by him and <span class="SpellE">Crisanto</span> <span class="SpellE">Parinacio</span>
before Bureau of Lands Inspector <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> Hernaez on
October 20, 1947 - in which be (Pabiling) relinquished, in favor of <span class="SpellE">Parinacio</span>, whatever rights and interests he (<span class="SpellE">Pabiling</span>) had over the land described in the sketch
appearing on the back of said instrument.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Pabiling</span> would now have us believe, further,
that said sketch did not exist when he affixed his signature on Exhibit 1.</p>

<p class="BODY">This testimony was contradicted, however, by that of Inspector <span class="SpellE">Hernaez</span>, who positively affirmed that the sketch was
already on said document when the parties thereto signed thereon and that,
before the did so, he saw to it that its contents were properly trans­lated to
and understood by them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering the
other factors set forth in the decision of the Secretary, it cannot be said
that he erred in attaching more weight to the testimony of said inspector, than
to that of <span class="SpellE">Pabiling</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In fact, even if the Secretary had, hypothetically, erred in the
appreciation of the relative veracity and weight of the testimony of said
witnesses, this would not render him guilty of a "grave abuse of
discretion, amounting to lack of jurisdiction”, warranting the issuance of the
writ of certiorari prayed for herein.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a></p>
