to review an order of the respondent court, dated <st1:date month="7" day="21" year="1964">July 21, 1964</st1:date>, or­dering the execution of the judgment
of the Municipal (now City) Court of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> City,
pending the appeal and before the trial of the case before the <span style="">said </span>respondent court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">On </span><st1:date year="1959" day="19" month="3"><span class="GramE">March 19, 1959</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">,
<span class="SpellE">Jesusa</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.</span> de <span class="SpellE">Murga</span>, herein private respondent, filed an action for
unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> before the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> City against <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span>
Chan, peti­tioner herein, to recover the possession of <span style="">two parcels of land, known </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">lots 36 and 38 of the
cadastral plan of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> City, which were leased
to the defendant for a term of <span class="GramE">ten(</span>10) years from
January 31, 1949, as evidenced by a written contract of lease attached to the
complaint.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Upon the allegations in
the complaint and the answer, the bone of contention revolves around clause
"7" of the contract of lease which reads thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"7. That upon the expiration of the term of ten (10) years
above expressed, the said <span class="SpellE">Jesusa</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.
de <span class="SpellE">Murga</span> shall have the option to pur­chase the
building or buildings be­longing and constructed by the said <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> Chan, and the price of said building or buildings
shall be de­termined by three(3) commissioners, two of whom shall be appointed
by each of the parties, and the remain­ing commissioner to be appointed by
both.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, in the event that the
said <span class="SpellE">Jesusa</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Murga</span> shall not exercise the right herein granted her for
any reason or cause, this contract of lease shall be automati­cally renewed but
the period for said renewal shall, however, be fixed and adjusted again by the
parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is agreed further that in
case of said renewal, the rental shall also be adjusted by the parties
depending on the business condition which shall then at that time <span class="GramE">prevail</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It appears that on </span><st1:date month="7" day="23" year="1958"><span style="">July 23,
 1958</span></st1:date><span style="">, the plaintiff
sent a letter to the defendant expressing her inten­tion to renew the contract
of lease based on an in­crease rental of P</span>700.00 <span style="">instead of P500.00 as stipu­lated in the contract of lease.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Replying to the offer of the plaintiff, the
defendant said - </span>"Much <span style="">as </span>I
am <span style="">willing to consider the suggested
increase of rental, however, </span>I <span style="">would
like to please (plead) with you that, due to very poor business at present, </span>I
<span style="">may not be able to consider your
indicated increase." On </span>Decem­ber 19, of the same year, the
plaintiff sent another <span style="">letter to the
defendant inviting the latter to </span><span style="">a
</span><span style="">con­ference to discuss the
matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So on </span><st1:date month="1" day="15" year="1959"><span style="">January 15, 1959</span></st1:date><span style="">, the plaintiff, thru her representative, and
the de­fendant met at the office of attorney Fernando Blanco to discuss the
terms of </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">new contract of lease, more particularly </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">to the amount of the rent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
part­</span><span style="">ies, </span><span style="">however, failed to come to an agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1959" day="19" month="1"><span style="">January 19, 1959</span></st1:date><span style="">, the plaintiff again wrote the de­fendant
informing the latter that "she is waiving her right to exercise the
aforementioned option and offers a new rental of P100.00 more than the
prevailing, without signing a <span class="GramE">contract,</span> or P200.00
more than the old rent with a five (5) year contract." The defendant
having declined the offer of the plaintiff, the latter filed the present case
before the </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span style="">Municipal</span></st1:placename><span style="">
 </span><st1:placetype><span style="">Court</span></st1:placetype><span style=""> </span><st1:placename><span style="">of</span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Zamboanga</span></span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After a trial of the
case, on </span><st1:date month="2" day="12" year="1964"><span style="">February 12, 1964</span></st1:date><span style="">, the Municipal Judge rendered a decision,
the <span class="SpellE">disposi­tive</span> portion of which reads as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">“x
<span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>judgment is
hereby rend­ered in favor of the plaintiff, sent­encing the defendant to
immediately vacate and return the possession of lots 36 and 38, subject of the
pre­sent action, and removing <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> all the
improvements introduced thereon by the defendant, to pay monthly rental of
P600.00 pesos from the month of February 1, 1959, up to the time he actually
and completely vacates and surrenders the possession of lots 36 and 38 to the
plaintiff due to the expiration of the period of lease fixed in the contract of
lease which was not renewed, Exhibit A, of the plaintiff; to pay attor­ney's
fees of P500.00, and the costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The defendant appealed
from the decision to the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>
City.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On July 9, 1964, and
before the trial of the case, the plaintiff filed a motion for execution of the
judgment of the Municipal Court alleging that, although the defendant had filed
a <span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span> bond to guarantee the payment of the
rentals fixed in the decision of the Municipal Court, said defendant, however,
"has failed and omitted to deposit the said difference of P100.00 monthly
within the first ten (10) days of each calendar month, x <span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"; </span>that is, the difference
between P500.00, the stipulated rental in the contract of lease, and P600.00
adjudged in the decision of the Municipal Court from February to July 1964.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The defendant opposed the motion, and alleged that the contract
of lease is "subject to the term of automatic renewal, and which under the
contract, the former (defendant) was to pay to the latter (plaintiff) the
monthly rental of P500.00, and which rent has been collected every month by the
plaintiff", up to and including the month of July 1964.</p>

<p class="BODY">In other words, admittedly, the defendant had paid to the
plaintiff the stipulated rental of P500.00 every month up to and including July
1964, when the motion for execution of the decision was filed in court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Admitted, likewise, is that the difference
between P500.00, stipulated rental, and P600.00 awarded in the decision, or the
sum of P100.00 every month, from February to July 1964, a total of P600.00, has
not been paid to the plaintiff or deposited in court on or before the 10th day
of each calendar month, from February to July 1964, although the amount of
P600.00 was deposited in court on July 10, 1964, by the de­fendant.</p>

<p class="BODY">Acting on the motion for execution and the oppo­sition thereto,
the court granted the motion, and ordered the execution of the judgment of the
Municipal Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the order, the court
said:</p>

<blockquote>"That during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of this
case before the Municipal Court, and when <span style="">a </span>compromise agreement was about to be
reached by the parties, the plaintiff pursuant to defendant's plea, accepted
the P500.00 monthly rental due under the expired contract so that the same may
not accumulate to an <span class="SpellE">unpayable</span> proportions; <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"While it is true that plain­tiff has been collecting P500.00
as monthly rental yet it should be noted that the adjudged rental of the
Municipal Court is P600.00 monthly having found the con­tract of lease to have
expired and the defendant only deposited the sum of P600.00 on July 10, 1964
which amount represents the difference between the rents agreed in the expired
contract and the adjudged rental for the period covering February to July 1964.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This failure on the part of the defendant to
deposit the adjudged rent in full is fatal and thus entitled the plaintiff to <span style="">a </span>perfect
right to secure immediate execution."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The issue to be resolved upon the pleadings and the annexes
thereto <span style="">is, </span>whether the failure
of the defendant to pay or deposit the sum of P100.00 every month from February
to July 1964, although he had paid to the plaintiff P500.00 every month for the
same period of <span style="">six </span>months up to
and including July 1964, which stands for the stipulated rental under contract,
the execution of the judgment of the Municipal Court, as ordered by the
respondent Judge, <span style="">is </span>warranted
under the facts obtaining in the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although under Sections <span style="">8
</span>and 9 of Rule 72 of the Rules of Court, the landlord, in whose favor <span style="">a </span>decision for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
has been rendered by the court, is entitled to ask for the execution of the
judgment <span style="">if </span>the
tenant fails to pay or deposit, on or before the 10th day of each calendar
month, the rent for the proceeding month, as determined in the decision, which
requirement is mandatory, however, there is nothing to preclude the judgment
creditor from waiving his right.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the present case, the facts clearly show, <span style="">as </span>found by the respondent Judge,
that acceding to defendant's plea, the plaintiff accepted the pay­ments of the
monthly stipulated rental of P500.00 up to July 1964, without demanding the
payment of P100.00, which is the difference between the stipu­lated rental and
that fixed in the decision of the court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The conduct of the plaintiff implicitly constitutes an acceptance of the
plea of the defend­ant to pay only the sum of P500.00 <span style="">a </span>month instead of P600.00 fixed in
the judgment, otherwise, the plaintiff would have raised a voice of protest and
would have asked the execution of the judgment immediately upon default.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The permissible logical inference upon the
foregoing <span style="">is,
</span>that the plaintiff, by accepting the payment of P500.00 every month, the
stipulated rental from February to July 1964, with­out demanding the payment of
the difference of P100.00 every month <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, had
waived the right to demand payment of the full amount of the monthly rental as
fixed in the judgment, for the purpose of staying the execution thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And considering that the defendant had
deposited with the court the sum of P600.00 on <st1:date month="7" day="10" year="1964">July 10, 1964</st1:date>, to cover the unpaid difference of the
rental for the said period of six months, the plaintiff suffered no material
damage or prejudice in her rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="">is </span>the
defendant who would stand to suffer irreparable damage and injury should the buildings
he had constructed on the land, which according to him is valued at no less
than P70, 000.00, would be demolished.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under the special conditions of the case, the mantle of equity should be
extended to petitioner who, in good faith, had acted under the circumstances in
the manner indicated.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the writ is granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The order com­plained of is set aside, and
the preliminary injunction heretofore issued is made permanent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Without costs.</span></p>
