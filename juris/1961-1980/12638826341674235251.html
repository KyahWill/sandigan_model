				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for <i>certiorari</i> to review the decision
of the Workmen's Compensation Commission dated <st1:date year="1976" day="12" month="1">January 12, 1976</st1:date> affirming the decision of Regional Office
No. 5, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> dated <st1:date year="1975" day="16" month="12">December 16, 1975</st1:date>, dismissing the petitioner's
claim for compensa­tion benefits against the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
(Bureau of Public Schools).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court,
by resolution dated <st1:date year="1976" day="1" month="8">August 1, 1976</st1:date>,
gave due course to the petition, treated it as a special civil action and
required the parties to file simultaneous memoranda.</p>

<p class="BODY">The following facts are embodied in the decision of the
respondent Commission:</p>

<blockquote>"It appears from the records of this case that claimant joined
the service of the respondent in 1938 as a teacher and retired from the service
on June 4, 1973, at the rate of P4,188.00 per annum; that per service record her
service was continuous from 1952 to her date of retirement in 1972; that on
September 18, 1971, she was allegedly treated by <span style="">Dr. Agustin F. Cuevas for <span class="SpellE">amoebiasis</span>,
intestinal, colitis, amoebic, gastri­tis and anemia; that after treatment, her
ailments were off and on; that </span>from February 23, 1973 up to April <span style="">14, </span>1973, she was on sick leave
allegedly due to an illness; that she retired on June 4, 1973 at the age of 60
years (1) month and (6) days, having been born on April 28, 1913.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is from the foregoing facts as found by us that we are to
resolve on whether or not there was any causal connection between claimant's
ailment of the intestines caused by amoeba which resulted into the inflammation
of her intestines and stomach walls and her former work as teacher of
respondent Bureau.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find no error in
the decision of the Referee below when he dismissed this claim for lack of
merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Firstly (1), <u>there was no
showing in the records that the claim­ant's work as a teacher had exposed her
to amoeba,</u> which is a parasite taken in thru food and drinking water, or
thru dirty hands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, (2) <u>her
own service record showed that there was no disability for labor </u>from the
time of her employment up to her retirement in 1973.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, (3) <u>her retirement from the
service had failed to show that it was due to any disability</u>"
(underlining supplied; <span style="">p. </span>10,
rec.).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The decision under review must be set aside.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is sufficient evidence that as a grade school teacher
assigned in several barrio <span class="GramE">schools,</span> petitioner had
been exposed to amoeba, a parasite taken thru the food and drinking water or
thru dirty hands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner offered
Exhibit A, Annex B of petition, which positively established that during her
entire government service as a public school teacher,</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> I had
been assigned to teach in several barrio schools where the only source of
drinking water was the ordinary open wells.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>During those times I had no inkling that those sources of drinking water
could have been polluted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a result I
started having abdominal pains which began to bother me and affected my health
and efficiency as a classroom teacher until finally I was forced to retire from
the service prior to the forced retirement age.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, while participating in scouting activities I had to drink
water in the barrios which I think only now was unfit to drink.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Aside from <span class="GramE">this scouting
activities</span> I had to do other extracurricular activities like adult
education and food produc­tion drive in the barrios which con­sumed my time and
consequently I was always forced then to take my meals and drank (sic) water
available in the barrios.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In addition,
while living in <span style="">the barrios as a
teacher I had to drink whatever </span><span style="">water
offered me especially during public </span><span style="">gatherings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, </span><span style="">I </span><span style="">felt I got </span><span style="">the sickness
from the barrios where I was </span><span style="">assigned
</span><span style="">to </span><span style="">teach because it was only during and after </span><span style="">my </span><span style="">teaching assignment </span><span style="">there
that I began </span><span style="">to suffer the
sickness until at present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I began to
feel weak and anemic."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's Exhibit A, Annex G of petition, an affidavit executed
by <span style="">Dr. Agustin </span><span style="">F. </span><span style="">Cuevas, </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">licensed active private medical practitioner
in <span class="SpellE">Daet</span>, <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Norte,
strongly corroborated petitioner's </span>Exhibit A, as well as showed that
petitioner's ail­ment disabled her for labor from time to time during <span style="">her </span><span style="">employment </span><span style="">up </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">her retirement in 1973, thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> Mrs.
Valeriana O. Morales has been my patient for intestinal amoebiasis on and off
since September 18, 1971 and <span style="">the last
time I </span>treated her was on <span style="">March
31, 1975 when she was </span>confined <span style="">at
G.S. <span class="SpellE">Briola</span> Hospital in <span class="SpellE">Daet</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Norte for chronic intestinal <span class="SpellE">amoebiasis</span>;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“4.
That intestinal <span class="SpellE">amoebiasis</span> can be acquired by
drinking water from <span style="">open </span>wells
in her teaching stations;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“5.
That this <span style="">condition
may be cured but rather resistant to treatment parti­cularly since </span>this
condition is endemic in <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Norte, especially
in the barrios, the possibility of <span class="SpellE">reinfestation</span> is
highly probable;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“6.
That definitely this disease is disabling since it produces a chronic anemia
and frequently affects the liver where it may gradually develop as amoebic
abscess of the liver."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Exhibit D, Annex B of petition, also confirmed that petitioner <span style="">was </span>on sick leave from February 23,
1973 up to <span style="">April 14, 1973; that in </span>spite
of constant treatment, <span style="">her ailment of
intestinal </span><span class="SpellE">amoebiasis</span> was on and off; that she
<span style="">was </span>suffering from "chronic
diarrhea with blood and sometimes mucus in my stool with gas pains, which
continued for a long time," and which Dr. Cuevas found to be "amoebic
dysentery or intestinal <span class="SpellE">histolytica</span>"; that her
health, according to her school principal <span style="">(Annex
F, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. E), </span>"deterio­rated and as a
result of which she was often absent"; and that she had to retire
effective June 4, 1973, at age 60, after about 35 years of government service,
for she was no longer physically fit to continue serving efficiently as a
school teacher, "in order to rehabilitate her failing health and <span style="">prolong her </span>life."</p>

<p class="BODY">Aside from actual proof of disability arising from <span style="">her </span>employment, the presumption of <span style="">compensability as long </span>as the ailment
supervenes <span class="GramE"><span style="">during</span></span><span style=""> employment, r</span>emains <span class="SpellE">unrebutted</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Memorandum-Circular No. 133 issued by the Executive Secretary on <st1:date year="1967" day="16" month="10">October 16, 1967</st1:date> allows optional
retirement before reaching the compulsory retirement age of 65 only when the
employee "is physically incapacitated to render sound, efficient
service."</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, THE <span style="">DECISION </span>OF THE WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION
