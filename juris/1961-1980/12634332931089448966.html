				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for certiorari with preliminary injunction to
review the decision rendered by respondent judge, in Civil Case No. 52276 and
in Special Civil Action No. 52383 both of the Court of First Instance of
Manila.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiffs, in Civil Case No. 52276 private respondents herein,
are engaged in the manufacture, sale and distribution of filled milk products
throughout the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The products of private respondent,
Consolidated Philippines Inc. are marketed and sold under the brand "<span class="SpellE">Darigold</span>;" whereas those of private respondent,
General Milk Company (Phil.), Inc., under the brand "Liberty;" and
those of private respondent, Milk Industries Inc., under the brand "Dutch
Baby." Private respondent, <st1:place><st1:placetype>Institute</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Evaporated Filled Milk Manufacturers</st1:placename></st1:place>
of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
is a corporation organized for the principal purpose of upholding and
maintaining at its highest the standards of local filled milk industry, of
which all the other private respondents are members.</p>

<p class="BODY">Civil Case No. 52276 is an action for declaratory relief with ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> petition for preliminary injunction wherein
plaintiffs pray for an adjudication of their respective rights and obligations
in relation to the enforcement of Section 169 of the Tax Code against their
filled milk products.</p>

<p class="BODY">The controversy arose from the order of defendant, Commissioner
of internal Revenue now petitioner herein, requiring plaintiffs-private
respondents to withdraw from the market all of their filled milk products which
do not bear the inscription required by Section 169 of the Tax Code within
fifteen (15) days from receipt of the order with the explicit warning that
failure of plaintiffs-private respondents to comply with said order will result
in the institution of the necessary action against any violation of the
aforesaid order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 169 of the Tax
Code reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Section 169.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Inscription
to be placed on skimmed milk.</u> - All condensed skimmed milk and all milk in
whatever form, from which the fatty part has been removed totally or in part,
sold or put on sale in the Philippines shall be clearly and legibly marked on
its immediate containers, and in all the language in which such containers are
marked, with the words, "This milk is not suitable for nourishment for
infants less<i> </i>than one year of age," or with other equivalent
words."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court issued a writ of preliminary injunction dated February
16, 1963 restraining the Commissioner of Internal Revenue from requiring
plaintiffs-private respondents to print on the labels of their filled milk
products the words, "This milk is not suitable for nourishment for infants
less than one year of age or words of similar import," as directed by the
above-quoted provision of law, and from taking any action to enforce the above
legal provision against the plaintiffs-private respondents in connection with
their filled milk products, pending the final determination of the case, Civil
Case No. 52276, on the merits.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1969" day="25" month="7">July 25, 1969</st1:date>,
however, the Office of the Solicitor General brought an appeal from the said
order by way of certiorari to the Supreme Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
In view thereof, the respon­dent court in the meantime suspended disposition of
these cases but in view of the absence of any injunction or restraining order
from the Supreme Court, it resumed action on them until their final disposition
therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">Special Civil Action No. 52383, on the other hand, is an action
for prohibition and injunction with a petition for preliminary injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners therein pray that the respondent
Fair Trade Board desist from further proceeding with <span class="SpellE">FTB</span>
<span class="SpellE">I.S</span>. No. 1, entitled "Antonio R. de <span class="SpellE">Joya</span> vs. <st1:place><st1:placetype>Institute</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Evaporated Milk Manufacturers</st1:placename></st1:place> of
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
etc." pending final determination of Civil Case No. 52276.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The facts of this special civil action show
that on <st1:date year="1962" day="7" month="12">December 7, 1962</st1:date>,
Antonio R. de <span class="SpellE">Joya</span> and <span class="SpellE">Sufronio</span>
Carrasco, both in their individual capacities and in their capacities as Public
Rela­tions Counsel and President of the Philippine Association of Nutrition,
respectively, filed <span class="SpellE">FTB</span> <span class="SpellE">I.S</span>.
No. 1 with Fair Trade Board for misleading advertisement, mislabeling and/or
mis­branding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Among other things, the
complaint filed include the charge of omitting to state in their labels any
statement sufficient to identify their filled milk products as "imitation
milk" or as an imitation of genuine cows milk, and omitting to mark the
immediate containers of their filled milk products with the words: "This
milk is not suitable for nourishment for infants less than one year of age or
with other equivalent words," as required under Section 169 of the Tax
Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Board proceeded to hear the
complaint until it received the writ of preliminary injunction issued by the
Court of First Instance on <st1:date year="1963" day="19" month="3">March 19,
 1963</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon agreement of the parties, Civil Case No. 52276 and Special
Civil Action No. 52383 were heard jointly being intimately related with each
other, with common facts and issues being also involved therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1971" day="16" month="4">April 16, 1971</st1:date>,
the respondent court issued its decision, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
part of which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>'"Wherefore, judgment is hereby rendered:</blockquote>

without authority in law, the order of said defendant dated September 28, 1961,

sale by the petitioners of their filled milk products and declaring as null the
proceedings so far undertaken by the respondent Board on said complaints."
(pp. 20-21, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From the above decision of the respondent court, the Commissioner
of Internal Revenue and the Fair Trade Board joined together to file the
present petition for certiorari with preliminary injunction, assigning the
following errors:</p>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">I.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

LOST HIS AUTHORITY TO ENFORCE THE SAME AND THAT THE PROPER AUTHORITY TO PROMOTE
THE HEALTH OF INFANTS IS THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, THE SECRETARY OF
HEALTH AND THE SECRETARY OF JUSTICE, AS PROVIDED FOR IN RA 3720, NOT THE
COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE.</blockquote>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN RULING THAT THE POWER

FOOD AND DRUG INSPECTION, THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, THE SECRETARY OF
HEALTH AND THE SECRETARY OF JUSTICE, AND THAT THE FAIR TRADE BOARD IS WITHOUT
JURISDICTION TO INVESTIGATE AND PROSECUTE ALLEGED MIS­BRANDING, <span class="SpellE">MISLABELLING</span> AND/OR MISLEADING ADVERTISEMENT OF FILLED MILK
PRODUCTS.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(pp. 4-5, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The lower court did not err in ruling that Section 169 of the Tax
Code has been repealed by implication.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Section 169 was enacted in 1939, together with Section 141 (which
imposed a specific tax on skimmed milk) and Section 177 (which penalized the
sale of skimmed milk without payment of the specific tax and without the legend
required by Section 169).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However,
Section 141 was expressly repealed by Section 1 of Republic Act No. 344, and
Section 177, by Section 1 of Republic Act No. 463.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By the express repeal of Sections 141 and
177, Section 169 became a merely declaratory provision, without a tax purpose,
or a penal sanction.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, it seems apparent that Section 169 of the Tax Code does
not apply to filled milk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The use of the
specific and qualifying terms "skimmed milk" in the <span class="SpellE">headnote</span> and "condensed skimmed milk" in the text
of the cited section, would restrict the scope of the general clause "all
milk, in whatever form, from which the fatty part has been removed totally or
in part." In other words, the general clause is restricted by the specific
term "skimmed milk" under the familiar rule of <span class="SpellE"><u>ejusdem</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>generis</u></span> that general and unlimited terms are
restrained and limited by the particular terms they follow in the statute.</p>

<p class="BODY">Skimmed milk is different from filled milk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to the "Definitions, Standards
of Purity, Rules and Regula­tions of the Board of Food Inspection,"
skimmed milk is milk in whatever form from which the fatty part has been
removed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Filled milk, on the other hand,
is any milk, whether or not condensed, evaporated concentrated, powdered,
dried, <span class="SpellE">dessicated</span>, to which has been added or which
has been blended or compounded with any fat or oil other than milk fat, so that
the resulting product is an imitation or semblance of milk cream or skim
milk." The difference, therefore, between skimmed milk and filled milk is
that in the former, the fatty part has been removed while in the latter, the
fatty part is likewise removed but is substituted with refined coconut oil or
corn oil or both.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot then be
readily or safely assumed that Section 169 applies both to skimmed milk and
filled milk.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Board of Food Inspection way back in 1961 rendered an opinion
that filled milk does not come within the purview of Section 169, it being a
product distinct from those specified in the said Section since the removed fat
portion of the milk has been replaced with coconut oil and Vitamins A and D as
fortifying substances (p. 58, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This opinion bolsters the Court's stand as to
its interpretation of the scope of Section 169.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Opinions and rulings of officials of the government called upon to
execute or implement administrative laws command much respect and weight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Astu­rias Sugar Central Inc. vs.
Commissioner of Customs, G. R. No. L-19337, <st1:date year="1969" day="30" month="9">September 30, 1969</st1:date>, 29 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 617;
Tan, et. al. vs. The <st1:place><st1:placetype>Municipality</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pagbilao</span></st1:placename></st1:place>, et. al., L-14264, <st1:date year="1963" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1963</st1:date>, 7 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span>
887; <span class="SpellE">Grapilon</span> vs. Municipal Council of <span class="SpellE">Carigara</span>, L-12347, <st1:date year="1961" day="30" month="5">May
 30, 1961</st1:date>, 2 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 103).</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court is, likewise, induced to the belief that filled milk
is suitable for nourishment for infants of all ages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners themselves admitted that:
"the filled milk products of the petitioners (now private respondents) are
safe, nutritious, wholesome and suitable for feeding infants of all ages"
(p. 44, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>) and that "up to the present,
Filipino infants fed since birth with filled milk have not suffered any
defects, illness or disease attributable to their having been fed with filled
milk." (p. 45, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">There would seem, therefore, to be no dispute that filled Milk is
suitable for feeding infants of all ages.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Being so, the declaration required by Section 169 of the Tax Code that
filled milk is not suitable for nourishment for infants less than one year of
age would, in effect, constitute a deprivation of property without due process
of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 169 is being enforced only against respondent
manufacturers of filled milk product and not as against manufacturers,
distributors or sellers of condensed skimmed milk such as <span class="SpellE">SIMILAC</span>,
<span class="SpellE">SMA</span>, <span class="SpellE">BREMIL</span>, ENFAMIL, <span class="SpellE">OLAC</span>, in which, as admitted by the petitioner, the fatty part
has been removed and substituted with vegetable or corn oil.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The enforcement of Section 169 against the
private respondents only but not against other persons similarly situated as
the private respondents amounts to an unconstitutional denial of the equal
protection of the laws, for the law, if not equally enforced, would similarly
offend against the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Yick</span> <span class="SpellE">Wo</span> vs. Hopkins, 118 <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
356, 30 L. ed. 220).</p>

<p class="BODY">As stated in the early part of this decision, with the repeal of
Sections 141 and 177 of the Tax Code, Section 169 has lost its tax
purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since Section 169 is devoid of
any tax purpose, petitioner Commissioner necessarily lost his authority to
enforce the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was so held by
his predecessor immediately after Sections 141 and 177 were re­pealed in
General Circular No. V-85 as stated in paragraph IX of the Partial Stipulation
of facts entered into by the par­ties, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> As
the act of selling skimmed milk without first paying the specific tax thereon
is no longer unlawful and the enforcement of the requirement in re­gard to the
placing of the proper legend on its immediate containers is a subject which
does not come within the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Internal Revenue, the
penal provisions of Section 177 of the said Code having been repealed by
Republic Act No. 463." (p. 102, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's contention that he still has jurisdiction to enforce
Section 169 by virtue of Section 3 of the Tax Code which provides that the
Bureau of Internal Revenue shall also "give effect to and administer the
supervisory and police power conferred to it by this Code or other laws"
is untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Bureau of Internal
Revenue may claim police power only when necessary in the enforcement of its principal
powers and duties consisting of the "collection of all national internal
revenue taxes, fees and charges, and the enforcement of all forfeitures,
penalties and fines connected therewith." The enforcement of Section 169
entails the promotion of the health of the nation and is thus unconnected with
any tax purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is the exclusive
function of the Food and Drug Administration of the Department of Health as
provided for in Republic Act No. 3720.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In parti­cular, Republic Act No. 3720 provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Section 9.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> It shall be the duty of the
Board (Food and Drug Inspection), conformably with the rules and regulations,
to hold hearings and conduct investigations relative to matters touching the
Administration of this Act, to investigate processes of food, drug and cosmetic
manufacture and to submit reports to the Food and Drug Administrator,
recommending food and drug standards for adoption.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said Board shall also perform such additional
functions, properly within the scope of the administration thereof, as maybe
assigned to it by the Food and Drug Administrator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decisions of the Board shall be advisory
to the Food and Drug Administrator."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Section 26.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> provisions of law
clearly show that petitioners, Commissioner of Internal Revenue and the Fair
Trade Board, are without jurisdiction to investigate and to prosecute alleged
misbranding, mislabeling and/or misleading advertisements of filled milk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The jurisdiction on the matters cited is
vested upon the Board of Food and Drug Inspection and the Food and Drug
Administrator, with the Secretary of Health and the Secretary of Justice, also
intervening in case criminal prosecution has to be instituted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To hold that the petitioners have also
jurisdiction as would be the result were their instant petition granted, would
only cause overlapping of powers and functions likely to produce confusion and
conflict of official action which is neither practical nor desirable.</p>
