				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Direct appeal, on questions purely of law, from
a decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Albay</span>.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiffs, <span class="SpellE">Amando</span>, Francisco I, <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> and Benita, all surnamed <span class="SpellE">Añonuevo</span>,
are children of the deceased Tomas <span class="SpellE">Añonuevo</span>, by his
first marriage to <span class="SpellE">Pascuala</span> <span class="SpellE">Baldivina</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They brought this action, in said court, for
the partition of six (6) parcels of land-one (1) located in <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Albay</span>, the others in <span class="SpellE">Libog</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Albay</span>, and more particularly described in paragraph
(4) of the complaint-allegedly belonging to their aforementioned father,
Defendants Alberto, Francisco II, <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span>, David
and Mercedes, likewise, surnamed <span class="SpellE">Añonuevo</span>, are
plaintiffs' half-brothers and half-sister.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They are children of said Tomas <span class="SpellE">Añonuevo</span>, by
his second mar­riage to <span class="SpellE">Ciriaca</span> <span class="SpellE">Apon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendants <span class="SpellE">Eduvijis</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Brigido</span>, both sur­named <span class="SpellE">Añonuevo</span>,
are children of the deceased, <span class="SpellE">Sixto</span> <span class="SpellE">Añonuevo</span>, another son of Tomas <span class="SpellE">Añonuevo</span>,
by his aforesaid first marriage, whereas defendants Oscar and Fe, both surnamed
<span class="SpellE">Enciso</span>, are children of Rafaela <span class="SpellE">Añonuevo</span>,
also, deceased, a daughter, by second marriage, of Tomas <span class="SpellE">Añonuevo</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiffs alleged that said parcels of land were acquired by him
during the lifetime of his first wife, <span class="SpellE">Pascuala</span> <span class="SpellE">Baldivina</span>, with funds coming from her <span class="SpellE">paraphernal</span>
property; that after her death, Tomas <span class="SpellE">Añonuevo</span>
brought said lands to his second marriage, with­out a liquidation of the
conjugal partnership with his first wife or a settlement of her estate; that
plaintiffs were then minors; that upon the death of Tomas <span class="SpellE">Añonuevo</span>
in 1950 - his second wife had died prior thereto - plaintiffs demanded a
partition of said lots; that defendants proposed that the lands be held by
defendant Alberto <span class="SpellE">Añonuevo</span>, on behalf and for the
benefit of all of the heirs of Tomas <span class="SpellE">Añonuevo</span>; and
that in 1955, however, the defendants - except <span class="SpellE">Edu­vijis</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Brigido</span> <span class="SpellE">Añonuevo</span> and
Oscar and Fe <span class="SpellE">Enciso</span> - assumed exclusive possession of
the lands and excluded the plaintiffs, as well as <span class="SpellE">Eduvijis</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Brigido</span> <span class="SpellE">Añonuevo</span>, and
Oscar and Fe <span class="SpellE">Enciso</span>, from any participation in the
produce of said lands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs
prayed, therefore, that the same be partitioned and that the defendants be
sentenced to render accounts of the produce thereof, in addition to paying
damages, attorney's fees and costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defendants filed an answer, admitting some allegations of the
complaint and denying other allegations thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They, like­wise, set up affirmative defenses
and a "counterclaim" or cross-complaint for the partition of nine (9)
other lots - situated in <span class="SpellE">Le­gaspi</span> and otherwise known
as lots Nos. 4318, 5694, 5705, 5765, 5805, 5881, 5907, 5945 and 7242 -
allegedly belonging to their common father and held by the plaintiffs.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <span style="">due </span>course,
thereafter, the lower court rendered a deci­sion directing the partition of the
six (6) parcels of land described in the complaint and of three (3) of the nine
(9) lots which are the subject-matter of the "counterclaim"
(cross-complaint) - namely, lots Nos. 5705, 5765 and 5805 - and dismissing the
same as re­gards the remaining six (6) lots.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Plaintiffs have interposed the present appeal insofar as the lower court
has ordered the parti­tion of said three (3) lots Nos. 5705, 5765 and 5805.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiffs maintain that, since <span class="SpellE">Teofila</span>
<span class="SpellE">Añonuevo</span> had transfer certificates of title to these
lots, in her name and that of her husband, Juan C. <span class="SpellE">Arandia</span>,
the appealed decree for the partition thereof vio­lates the principle of
indefeasibility of a <st1:place>Torrens</st1:place> title.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this connection, the records show and the lower court found
that said lots were originally covered by Original Certificates of Title in the
name of Tomas <span class="SpellE">Añonuevo</span>, who died on December 17,
1950; that on May 31, 1957, plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Teofila</span> <span class="SpellE">Añonuevo</span> filed a petition for the reconstitution of said
Original Certificates of Title, upon the ground that the same were in her name
and that of her husband, Juan C. <span class="SpellE">Arandia</span>, and had
been destroyed or lost; that said petition for reconstitution was filed in
Cadastral Case No. RT-457 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Albay</span>;
that on August 20, 1957, Branch I of said court, to which the petition had been
assigned, issued an order granting it; that on September 30, 1957, herein
defendant Alberto <span class="SpellE">Añonuevo</span> filed a motion for
reconsideration of this order, alleging that <span class="SpellE">Teofila</span> <span class="SpellE">Año­nuevo</span> had no right to seek the aforementioned
reconstitution, the original certificates of title involved therein having been
issued, not in her name, but in that of her deceased father, Tomas <span class="SpellE">Añonuevo</span>; that on February 28, 1958, said Branch I of the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Albay</span> granted the motion
for reconsideration and amended its order of August 20, 1957, by denying the
reconstitution of the original certi­ficates of title over the aforementioned
lots Nos. 5705, 5765 and 5805; that, soon thereafter, or on April 8, 1958, <span class="SpellE">Teofila</span> <span class="SpellE">Añonuevo</span> filed with the
same Court, but before Branch II thereof, a motion for re­constitution - in
Cadastral Case No. 506 - of transfer certificates of title allegedly covering
said lots Nos. 5705, 5765 and 5805, upon the ground that said transfer
certificates of title were in her name and that of her late husband, Juan C. <span class="SpellE">Arandia</span>, and had been destroyed or lost; that on August 1,
1958, said Branch II of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Albay</span>
granted the motion for the reconstitution; and that, accord­ingly, Transfer
Certificates of Title Nos. RT-952(NA), 951(NA) and 950(NA), covering said lots
Nos. 5705, 5765 and 5805, respectively, were issued, on September 2, 1958, in
the name of said spouses.</p>

<p class="BODY">Defendants herein maintain, that the "reconstitution"
of these transfer certificates of title had been secured through fraud, misre­presentation
and deceit; and that, accordingly, the order for the re­constitution thereof
should be nullified, and the lots aforementioned partitioned, in accordance
with law, among the heirs of Tomas <span class="SpellE">Año­nuevo</span>,
including defendants herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After due
trial, the lower court rendered judgment for the defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence, this appeal by the
plaintiffs.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiffs' theory to the effect that said judgment is inconsist­ent
with the indefeasibility of <st1:place>Torrens</st1:place> certificates of
title is untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision
appealed from does not impair the validity of the decrees in pursuance of which
the lots in question were registered under the <st1:place>Torrens</st1:place>
system, or review said decrees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a
matter of fact, plain­tiffs do <u>not</u> claim to have any such decrees in
their favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Teofila</span>
<span class="SpellE">Añonuevo</span> had merely "reconstituted"
transfer certificates of title, which were issued upon misrepresentations made
by her, in Cadastral Case No. RT-506, to the effect that she and her late
husband had bought lots Nos. 5705, 5765 and 5805 from the original owner
thereof, Tomas <span class="SpellE">Año­nuevo</span>, and that the corresponding
transfer certificates of title of said spouses were subsequently lost or
destroyed.</p>

<p class="BODY">In fact, no such transfer certificates of title had ever
existed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs would have the lower
court believe that <span class="SpellE">Teofila</span> <span class="SpellE">Añonuevo</span>
and Juan C. <span class="SpellE">Arandia</span> had bought lots <span style="">Nos. </span>5705 and 5805 from Tomas <span class="SpellE">Añonuevo</span> on <st1:date year="1950" day="20" month="12">December
 20, 1950</st1:date>, although Tomas <span class="SpellE">Añonuevo</span> had
died 3 days <u>before</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Similarly, in
their petition for reconstitution in Cadastral Case No. 457, <span class="SpellE">Teofila</span> <span class="SpellE">Añonuevo</span> alleged that
these lots and lot No. 5765 were <u>originally</u> registered in her name and
that of her deceased husband, which was <u>an</u> <u>impossibility</u> because
the decrees for the registration of said lots were issued in <u>1927</u>, and
the evidence introduced by her in said cadastral case was to <span style="">the </span>that she and Juan C. <span class="SpellE">Arandia</span> had bought lot No. 5705 in <u>1933</u>, lot No.
5765 in <u>1935</u>, and lot No. 5805 in <u>1</u><u><span style="">93</span>8</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, if these
allegations were true, <span class="SpellE">Teofila</span> <span class="SpellE">Añonuevo</span>
and Juan C. <span class="SpellE">Arandia</span> would have had transfer cer­tificates
of title in their favor on or before <st1:date year="1957" day="31" month="5">May
 31, 1957</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet, the petition,
filed by them on that date, for reconstitution of the <u>original</u>
certificates of title to said lots, evidently proves that they then had no such
<u>transfer</u> certificates of title, for, otherwise, the petition would have
referred to the latter, not to the former.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then, again, the absence of such transfer certificates of title,
despite the purchases allegedly made by said spouses from 1933 to 1938,
establishes, beyond doubt, that no such purchases had really been made by
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The filing of the second petition
for reconstitu­tion in Branch II of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Albay</span> underscores the intent to conceal, from the judge who
<span class="GramE">presided</span> it, the first peti­tion for reconstitution
and the adverse findings, made by Branch I of the same Court, in connection
therewith.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is thus apparent that the "reconstituted"
certificates of title invoked by plaintiffs herein had been secured through
misrepre­sentation, deceit and fraud.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This notwithstanding, the lower court has neither reviewed the order of
reconstitution in Cadastral Case No. 506, nor annulled the "owner's
duplicate" certificates issued in compliance therewith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It, in effect, regarded <span class="SpellE">Teofila</span>
<span class="SpellE">Añonuevo</span> as a mere trustee for the heirs of Tomas <span class="SpellE">Añonuevo</span>, with the obliga­tion to give and convey to them
their respective shares.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence, the decision ordering the partition, which is in accordance
with law and the elementary principles of justice, equity and fair play.</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed,
with costs against plaintiffs-appellants.</p>
