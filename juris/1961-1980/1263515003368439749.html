the Court of First instance of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="GramE">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span class="GramE"> in its Case No. 43372, upholding a motion to dismiss.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">At issue is the question whether or not the provision of a
fidelity bond, that no action shall be had or maintained thereon unless
commenced within one<span style=""> </span>year from
the making of a claim for the loss upon which the action is <span style="">based, is </span>valid or void, in view of
Section 61-A of the Insurance Act invalidating<span style=""> </span>stipulations limiting the time for commencing an action thereon
to less <span style="">than </span>one year from the
time the cause of action accrues.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Material to this decision are</span> the
following facts:</p>

<p class="BODY">According to the allegations of the complaint, in order to
guarantee the <span class="SpellE">Asingan</span> Farmers' Cooperative Marketing
Association, Inc. (FACOMA) against Loss on account of "personal
dishonesty, amounting to larceny or <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>" of
its Secretary-Treasurer, Ricardo A. <span class="SpellE">Ladines</span>, the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, Alpha Insurance &amp; Surety Company had issued,
on 14 February 1958, its bond, No. P-FID-15-58, for the sum of Five Thousand
Pesos (P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>) with said Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Ladines</span> as principal and the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
as <span class="SpellE">solidary</span> surety.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the same date, <span style="">the </span><span class="SpellE">Asingan</span> FACOMA assigned its rights to the appellant,
Agricultural Credit Cooperative and Financing Administration (<span class="SpellE">ACCFA<span class="GramE">,for</span></span> short) , with approval
of the principal and the surety.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">During the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the bond, Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Ladines</span>
converted and misappropriated, to his personal benefit, some P11<span class="GramE">,513.22</span> of the FACOMA funds, of which P6,307.33 belonged to
the ACCFA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon discovery of the loss,
ACCFA immediately notified in writing the surety company on </span><st1:date year="1958" day="10" month="10"><span style="">10
 October, 1958</span></st1:date><span style="">, and
presented the proof of loss within the period fixed in the bond; but despite
repeated demands the surety company refused and failed to pay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Whereupon, ACCFA filed suit
against <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> on </span></span><st1:date year="1960" day="30" month="5"><span class="GramE"><span style="">30 May 1960</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="">.</span></span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Defendant Alpha Insurance &amp; Surety Co., <span style="">Inc., </span>(now <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>)
moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a cause of action, giving
as reason that (1) the same was filed more than one year after plaintiff made
claim for loss, contrary to the eighth condition of the <span style="">bond, </span>providing as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"'EIGHT.</span> LIMITATION OF ACTION</blockquote>

<blockquote>'No action, suit or proceeding shall be had or maintained upon this
Bond unless the same be commenced within one year from the time of making claim
for the loss upon which such action, suit or proceeding is based, in accordance
with the fourth section hereof.' "</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">(2)
the complaint failed </span>to show <span style="">that
plaintiff had filed civil or criminal action against <span class="SpellE">Ladines</span>,
as required by conditions 4 and 11 of the bond; and (3) the </span><span class="SpellE">Ladines</span> was a <span style="">necessary
and indispensable party but had not been joined a such.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">At first, the Court of First Instance
denied dismissal; but, upon reconsideration, the court reversed its original
stand, and dismissed <span class="GramE">the complain</span> on the ground that
the action was filed beyond the contractual limitation period (Record on
Appeal, pages 56-59).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><span style="">Hence,
this appeal.</span></span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We find the appeal
meritorious.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">A fidelity bond is, in effect, in the nature of a contract of
insurance a loss from misconduct, and is governed by the same principles of
interpretation Mechanics Savings Bank &amp; Trust Co. vs. Guarantee Company, 68
Fed. <span class="GramE">459; Chan <span class="SpellE">Wei</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Nemorosa</span>, 103 Phil. 57.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the condition of the bond in
question, limiting the period for bringing action thereon, is subject to the
provisions of Section 61-A of the Insurance Act (No. 2427), as amended by 4101
of the pre-Commonwealth Philippine Legislature, prescribing that -</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 61-A. - <span style="">A </span>condition,
stipulation or agreement in any policy of insurance, limiting the time for
commenÂ­cing an action <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span> <span style="">to a </span>period of less than one year from
the time when the cause of action accrues is void."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">Since
a "cause of action" requires, as essential elements, not only a legal
right of the plaintiff and a correlative obligation of the defendant but also
"an act omission of the defendant in violation of said legal right" (<span class="SpellE">Maao</span> Sugar Gen vs. Barrios, 79 Phil. 666), the cause of
action does not accrue until the </span>party <span style="">obligated refuses, expressly or impliedly, to comply with its duty </span>(in
<span style="">this case, to pay the amount of the
bond).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The year for instituting </span>action
in <span style="">court must be reckoned, therefore,
from the time of <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> </span>refusal <span style="">to comply with its bond; it can not be
counted from the creditor's </span>filing of <span style="">the claim of loss for that does not import that the surety company </span>will
<span style="">refuse to pay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In so far, therefore, as condition eight of
the bond requires action to be filed within one year from the filing of the
claim for </span>loss, such <span style="">stipulation
contradicts the public policy expressed in Section 61-A </span>of the <span style="">Philippine Insurance Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Condition eight of the bond, therefore, is </span>null
and void, <span style="">and the appellant is not
bound to comply with </span><span style="">its </span><span style="">provisions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In Eagle Star Insurance
Co. vs. <span class="SpellE">Chia</span> Yu, 96 Phil. </span>696, <span style="">701, this Court </span>ruled:</p>

<blockquote>"It may perhaps be suggested that the policy clause relied on
by the insurer for defeating plaintiff's action should be given the
construction that would harmonize it with section 61-A of the Insurance Act by
taking it to mean that the time given the insured for bringing his suit is
twelve months after the cause of section accrues.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the question then would be:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When did the cause of action accrue? On that
question we agree with the <span style="">court below
that plaintiff's cause of action did not accrue until his claim was finally
rejected by the insurance company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
is because, before such final rejection, there was no real necessity for
bringing suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the policy provides
that the insured should file his claim, first, with the carrier and then with
the insurer, he had a right to wait for his claim to be finally decided before </span>going
to <span style="">court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law does not encourage unnecessary </span><span style="">li</span><span style="">tigation."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The discouraging of
unnecessary litigation must be deemed a rule of public </span>policy, <span style="">considering the unrelieved congestion in the
courts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As a consequence of the
foregoing, condition eight of the Alpha bond is null and void, and action may
be brought within the statutory period of limitation for written contracts (New
Civil Code, Article 1144).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case of <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Fult</span> </span>Fire <span style="">Insurance Co., 2 S. C. </span>R. <span style="">A. 945 (31 July 1961), relied upon by the
Court </span><u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, <span style="">is no
authority against the views herein expressed, since </span>the effect of
Section 61-A <span style="">of the Insurance law on
the terms of the policy or contract </span>was not there considered.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span style="">condition of previous
conviction (paragraph b. clause 4, of the contract) </span>having been <span style="">deleted by express agreement, and the surety
having assumed <span class="SpellE">solid<span style="">ary</span></span></span>
liability, <span style="">the other grounds of the
motion to dismiss are equally untenable </span><span style="">A </span>creditor <span style="">may proceed
against <u>any</u> <u>one</u> of the <span class="SpellE">solidary</span>
debtors, or some or all </span>of them <span style="">simultaneously
(Article 1216, New Civil Code).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed order granting the motion to
dismiss is reversed and set aside, and the records are remanded to the Court of
First Instance, with instructions to require defendant to answer and thereafter
proceed in conformity with the law and the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.</span></p>
