				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> of the February 13, 1976
decision of the respondent Commission reversing the October 1, 1975 award of
its Acting Referee in RO4 WC Case No. 159497, a compensation claim filed by
herein petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records disclose that petitioner filed on <st1:date year="1974" day="6" month="9">September 6, 1974</st1:date> with the Department
of Labor, Regional Office No. 4 a notice of injury and claim for
compensation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The claim alleged <u><span style="">inter</span></u><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span> that in the course of his
employment with respondent employer, he contracted pulmonary tuberculosis; that
he stopped working on <st1:date year="1969" day="15" month="12">December 15,
 1969</st1:date>, by reason of his illness; and that he notified in December,
1969 his superior of his ailment (p. 61, WCC rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">Attached to and made an integral part of the claim were the:</p>

<blockquote>(1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Physician's Report of Sickness or Accident
signed by petitioner's attending physician stating that the ailment was
diagnosed as pulmonary tuberculosis and was caused by stress and strain of
employment; that the ailment was the result of the nature of and aggravated by
employment; that he first administered treatment to petitioner in August, 1967
and continues up to the present; that the ailment caused petitioner indefinite
total disability for work; and that if petitioner cannot resume his former
occupation, he can do only light household chores [p. 30, WCC rec.];</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's 1970 <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
Institute Case Record which revealed that he was confined in said Institute
from November 27, 1970 to December 21, 1970; that the final diagnostic finding
was PTB minimal right, bronchitis, and the results:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>T.B. active improved <span style="">[p. </span>47,WCC <span class="SpellE">rec</span>]; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>(3)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's service record which showed that
he was hired by respondent employer on <st1:date year="1949" day="1" month="2">February
 1, 1949</st1:date>, resigned in May, 1953, re-employed on <st1:date year="1954" day="1" month="1">January 1, 1954</st1:date> and his last day of service as <st1:date year="1969" day="15" month="12">December 15, 1969</st1:date> <span style="">[p. </span>41, WCC rec.].</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On October 1, 1975, the Acting Referee rendered a decision
ordering respondent employer to pay the sum of six thousand (P6,000.00) pesos
as disability benefits of petitioner under Section 14 of the Workmen's
Compensation Act, as amended; the sum of three hundred (P300.00) pesos as
attorney's fees; and sixty-one (P61.00) pesos as administrative fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The aforesaid award was principally anchored
on his finding that the claim was <span class="SpellE">uncontroverted</span> and
that the subject illness supervened in the course of employment, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Respondent Department of Public Highways or (the) Office of
the Solicitor General failed to file an employer's report or any <span class="SpellE">controversion</span> whatsoever making the instant claim as
uncontested.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The case was called for trial on the merits with respondent
Office of the Solicitor General duly notified.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On (the) scheduled hearing, no appearance was made for the
respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon motion of counsel for
claimant, the case was submitted for decision on the basis of the records,
affidavit and evidence(s) on hand.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The records show that sometime in 1949, the claimant was
employed by the respondent as carpenter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As such his duty was to construct or repair bridges and buildings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was last receiving P9.30 per day, working
6 days a week.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After working for several
years he develop(ed) an ailment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 1967
he contracted PTB and he underwent medication.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He continued working but his physical condition continued to deteriorate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unable to perform his work well due to
illness and pursuant to the advice of his physician he stopped working on <st1:date year="1969" day="15" month="12">December 15, 1969</st1:date> and (is) still
disabled up to the present.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is very unfortunate that the respondent failed to file an
employer's report or register any <span class="SpellE">controversion</span>
whatsoever.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No appearance was even made during
the scheduled hearing despite due notice.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This being the case, with the foregoing environmental facts, the noble
task of deciding as to whether or not the instant claim is within the area of
(the) compensatory provision of the Workmen's Compensation Act, as amended, is
pass(ed) on to us.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"There is no doubt that the claimant was in good health when
he started his employment with the respondent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The nature of his employment exposed him to various elements like heat
of the sun, sudden rain, sudden change of temperature, dust, dirt, the fact
that his work required exertion of too much effort and also the fact that he
used to perspire profusely which (sic) elements were derogatory to health.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After working for several years he developed
pulmonary tuberculosis minimal which disabled him for labor at the age of
55.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is, therefore, clear that
claimant's illness supervened in the course of his employment and was
aggravated by the same.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The time-honored principle of causation and aggravation
find(s) its best application in this case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>According to the Supreme Court in one of the leading cases:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>‘The precise medical causation of the illness
is not significant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As long as the
illness supervened in the course of employment, the presumption of causation
and aggravation applies; the burden to overthrow the presumption, by
substantial evidence, to disconnect the sickness from the employment is laid by
the statute at the door of the employer' (<span class="SpellE">Magalona</span>
vs. WCC, et al., G.R. L-21849, Dec. 11, 1967).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In this case respondent failed to present substantial
evidence to prove that claimant’s illness was not and could not have been
caused by the nature of his employment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For failure to present such substantial evidence to overcome the
abovementioned presumption, compensability of the instant claim is beyond
question.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the light of the foregoing principles x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>, we find the instant claim
meritorious, hence compensable under the Workmen's Compensation Act, as
amended. x <span class="SpellE">x</span> " (pp. 15-17, WCC rec.).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From the decision of the Acting Referee, respondent employer,
through its counsel, the Solicitor General, filed on November 10, 1975 a motion
for reconsideration seeking the reversal of the same on the grounds that the
illness contracted by claimant is not compensable as it does not disable him
for labor; that the instant claim was filed beyond the period provided for in
Section 24 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, as amended; that the injuries or
diseases that are compensable are those which produce disability, and thereby affect
the earning power of the employee; that optional retirement without disability
does not give the retiree a right to compensation under the Workmen's
Compensation Act, as amended; that in such a case there being no longer any
employee-employer relationship respondent is not required to controvert the right
of the claimant to compensation; and finally, that the illness having been
contracted after claimant had already retired from the service of the
respondent, the Workmen's Compensation Act, as amended, does not apply (pp. 11,
12, WCC rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1979" day="19" month="1">January 19, 1979</st1:date>,
Assistant Chief of Section <span class="SpellE">Danilo</span> L. <span class="SpellE">Reynante</span> denied for lack of merit the aforesaid motion, but
ordered the elevation of the records of the claim to the respondent Commission
for review, it appearing that the said motion was filed within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period (p. 7, WCC rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1976" day="2" month="2">February 2, 1976</st1:date>,
respondent Commission, although maintaining the basic factual findings of the
Acting Referee, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"A perusal of the records of this case disclosed that claimant
was a carpenter of the respondent, receiving P9.30 a day who stopped working on
December 14, 1969 due to illness which he contracted sometime in 1967 diagnosed
as Pulmonary Tuberculosis and other related diseases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In support of such claim, claimant submitted
the hospital record of the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> Institute for the
year 1970 where it is reflected that he has been finally diagnosed for PTB
minimal, right and bronchitis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Per service
record, he had been connected with the respondent since <st1:date year="1949" day="1" month="2">February 1, 1949</st1:date> until <st1:date year="1969" day="15" month="12">December 15, 1969</st1:date>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">nevertheless reversed the <st1:date year="1975" day="1" month="10">October 1, 1975</st1:date> decision of the
Acting Referee, reasoning as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"We observe that the record does not disclose of claimant
having been ill of PTB in 1969.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was
diagnosed to have PTB already in 1970.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is no evidence on record that he was disabled from work by reason
of PTB while he was still employed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
therefore find that he contracted the disabling illness after his retirement
and therefore not within the ambit of the compensatory provision of Section 2
of the Act.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the light of the foregoing, we are constrained to reverse
the decision appealed from for we find that the claimant became ill when
already retired and did not suffer any disability by reason of the illness of
PTB while still an employee of the herein respondent negates an award for
compensation" (pp. 5-6, WCC rec.).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this recourse.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner contends that the respondent Commission gravely abused
its discretion in concluding that his PTB ailment was contracted by him after
he retired from the service; and in dismissing his case without factual or
legal basis.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">WE </span>agree.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">I</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, respondent
Commission's finding that petitioner contracted his tuberculosis after he
retired from the service, is not only bereft of any evidentiary support but is
likewise patently contrary to the undisputed evidence of petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">To begin with, there is nothing in the record to show that
petitioner had already been retired from his work, nor is there any evidence to
that effect ever presented by the respondent employer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, the <span class="SpellE">uncontradicted</span>
evidence tends to show that petitioner contracted his ailment before, or in
1967, and stopped working at the age of 55 by reason thereof on, <st1:date year="1969" day="15" month="12">December 15, 1969</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The report of petitioner's attending
physician to that effect is not refuted by any evidence of respondent employer,
except perhaps its <u>bare allegation</u> to the contrary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such unsupported allegation cannot prevail <span style="">over the documented stand of petitioner that
he stopped working by reason of his ailment of tuberculosis (Enriquez vs. WCC,
G.R. No. L-42640, </span><st1:date year="1979" day="28" month="9"><span style="">September 28, 1979</span></st1:date><span style="">).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is thus surprising how the respondent Commission arrived at its questioned
conclusion in the light of the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> facts, not
to mention the fact that respondent employer never appeared in the hearing of
the case, hence, it could not have submitted any rebutting evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the factual circumstances obtaining in
this case, it can be reasonably concluded that petitioner stopped working on </span><st1:date year="1969" day="15" month="12"><span style="">December
 15, 1969</span></st1:date><span style=""> by reason
of his PTB ailment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It could not have
been otherwise as it is incontrovertible that petitioner did not retire nor
resign on that date; and respondent employer had not ventured any cause or
reason - like abandonment or absence without leave - why petitioner had to stop
working on that date if he were not actually disabled by reason of his
ailment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For considering his services
with respondent employer of about 20 years, he could not have just stopped
working without any compelling reason.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>As
a matter of fact, petitioner had to be subsequently confined at the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> Institute from <st1:date year="1970" day="27" month="11">November 27, 1970</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1970" day="21" month="12">December 21, 1970</st1:date> (p. 47, WCC rec.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is therefore a rational basis for the
petitioner's observation that the proximity of the date he stopped working and
his hospitalization by reason of his tuberculosis makes it imperative to
decisively presume that he was disabled by his aforesaid tuberculosis (p. 61,
rec.); and that furthermore, that at the time he stopped working on December
15, 1969, he was already afflicted there with (Bautista vs. WCC, 88 SCRA 121,
130-131 [1979]; Lorenzo vs. WCC, 85 SCRA 440, 441 [1978]); because tuberculosis
is not an instantaneous disease as it is caused by an imperceptible germ that
feeds on the lungs, whose presence in the body cannot be easily discerned and
its incipient stage may not be readily discovered (<u>ibid</u>.).</p>

<p class="NUM"><span style="">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that petitioner did not go on sick leave at any time from
1967, the year he claimed </span>to have contracted his ailment of PTB, and
December 15, 1969 when he stopped working, is not a sufficient basis to
conclude that he was not sick of PTB during that period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, WE can take judicial notice of the fact
that many employees afflicted with PTB, specially at its incipient or early
stage, persist in working despite their ailment, by reason of their sheer
determination to continue earning a living for themselves and their families
(Romero vs. WCC, 77 SCRA 482, 489 [1977]).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, in the case of Manila Railroad Company vs. <span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span>
and WCC (109 Phil. 716 [1960]), the worker was found on November 19, 1953 to be
afflicted with a moderately advanced PTB, but he was able to continue working
until a few months before he died on January 27, 1958 of said illness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE">Lambino</span> vs. del
Rosario (6 SCRA 1017 [1962]) the employee was found in April, 1952 to be
afflicted with a far advanced PTB, but he was able to work<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>up to the time of his death on May
7, 1953, by reason of said ailment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Again, in <st1:place>Manila</st1:place> Railroad Company vs. <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de Chavez (12 SCRA 142 [1964]), the laborer was
confined in the hospital from November 22, to December 2, 1956 for PTB, after
which he was able to work briefly only to be confined again; and he died on
August 10, 1957 of the aforesaid illness.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Finally, in <span class="SpellE">Corales</span> vs. Employees Compensation
Commission (84 SCRA 764 [1978]; 88 SCRA 547 [1979]), the employee continued
working up to his compulsory retirement in 1975 despite his ailment of
tuberculosis contracted way back in 1965.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">II</p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, because it is now indubitable that petitioner's
ailment supervened in the course of employment, the presumption is that the
illness of the petitioner either arose out of or was at least aggravated by
said employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With this legal presumption,
the burden of proof shifts to the employer, and the employee is relieved of the
burden to show causation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent
employer has not adduced, even at this late stage, any substantial evidence to
overthrow the aforesaid presumption.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This presumption of compensability is further reinforced by Section 2 of
the Workmen's Compensation Act, as amended, which expressly mentions
tuberculosis as a compensable illness when contracted in the course of
employment, be it "directly caused by such employment or either aggravated
by or the result of the nature of such employment" (<span class="SpellE">Aninias</span>
vs. WCC, G.R. No. L-43021; <span class="SpellE">Redoblado</span> vs. WCC, G.R.
No. L-44391, 83 SCRA 806; 4 PHILAJUR, 657 [1978]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, in <span style="">numerous cases involving the same and/or substantially similar nature
of work as well as conditions or circumstances of work as that of herein
petitioner, WE ruled that tuberculosis is an occupational disease, hence
compensable (Bautista vs. WCC, 88 SCRA 121, 129 [1979], citing several cases).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">III</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, the right of petitioner to compensation was <span class="SpellE">uncontroverted</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, respondent employer's defenses, if any, are barred (Delos Santos
vs. WCC, 88 SCRA 134 [1978]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent
employer's contention that its duty to controvert is excused, lacks factual
basis in view of the decisive fact that, as shown above, contrary to its
assertion, the ailment of petitioner supervened in the course of his employment
with respondent employer.</p>
