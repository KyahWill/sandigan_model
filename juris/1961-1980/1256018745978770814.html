				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal from a decision of the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan.
Originally certified to the Court of Appeals, the latter subsequently
forwarded the records to this Court, only questions of law being raised
in the appeal.
<p>On September 27, 1944, two (2) deeds of "sale with right to
repurchase" within two (2) years from said date were executed, one
(Annex A) by defendant Tomasa Lavarias de Sajonas, for the sum of
P1,000.00, and another (Annex B) by her so- defendant Brigida Estrada
de Sajonas, for the sum of P700, both in favor of Rodolfo Sajonas, of a
residential lot of about 565 sq. m. situated in Binmaley, Pangasinan,
belonging to said defendants as co-owners thereof. Over eight (8) years
later, or on April 7, 1953, Rodolfo Sajonas executed an "absolute deed
of sale" (Annex C) of said lot in favor of plaintiff Ramon Melendez,
who instituted the present action on July 22, 1954, alleging that he is
the owner of the lot aforementioned, in view of said "absolute deed of
sale" by Rodolfo Sajonas, and the two (2) deeds of "sale with right to
repurchase" adverted to above, and to the failure of the aforesaid
defendants to exercise their right of redemption within the stipulated
period, and that said defendants, who had remained in possession of the
lot in question, began to claim the same, on or about November 25,
1953, as owners thereof. Hence, plaintiff prayed that he be declared
owner of said lot and that the defendants be ordered to remove their
house therefrom, to turn over to him the possession of said lot, and to
pay him the value of the products thereof, as well as damages and costs.</p>
<p>In their verified answer, defendants denied the genuineness and due
execution of said deeds of "sale with right of repurchase", and alleged
that Brigida Estrada de Sajonas had merely borrowed from Rodolfo
Sajonas the sum of P700.00 mentioned in Annex B, that this debt of P700
had already been settled and that plaintiff knew that the lot in
question belongs to the defendants.</p>
<p>After the introduction of the testimony of, several witnesses for
the plaintiff, both parties agreed in open court that defendants Tomasa
Lavarias de Sajonas and Brigida Estrada de Sajonas had received the
aforementioned sums of P1,000 and P700, respectively, in Japanese
money, and the Annexes A and B were executed merely as security for the
payment of said amounts. Then they submitted the case for decision on
the amount to be paid by said defendants to the plaintiff.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the lower court rendered the decision appealed from,
holding that, since defendants could have settled their aforementioned
debt at any time within 2 years from September 27, 1944, the Ballantyne
scale was applicable, and that for this reason, and considering that
the "present peso is only P.315 compared to the pre-war peso,"
defendants should pay to the plaintiff the sum of P180.00, with
interest thereon at the rate of 6% per annum from July 22, 1954, and
the costs. Plaintiff has appealed from this decision.</p>
<p>The first issue raised by him refers to the aforementioned
stipulation. It appears that several days after it was made and upon
receipt of copy of defendants' memorandum maintaining that, pursuant to
the Ballantyne scale, plaintiff was entitled to recover no more than
P56.66, his counsel moved that plaintiff be relieved from said
stipulation, upon the ground that he (counsel) had agreed thereto
"improvidently, inadvertently, mistakenly, or as a consequence of
fraudulent inducements," because he had "failed to realize fully the
possible effects" of the stipulation and "he further forgot that his
client who is a third party and is a purchaser in good faith, * * * had
paid P600.00 for the property in question * * *." The denial of this
motion by the lower court is assigned by the plaintiff as an error,
upon the theory that the stipulation would lead to an injustice. We
find no merit in this pretense.</p>
<p>Although plaintiff wanted to collect the aggregate sum of P1,700 on
the peso to peso basis, the issue between the parties really boiled
down to whether, under the facts and the law, the Ballantyne scale
should apply. As regards the consideration paid by plaintiff to Rodolfo
Sajonas, it may not be amiss to note that, according to defendants'
answer, "plaintiff had full knowledge of the fact that the property in
question did not belong to his vendor at the time he bought the same
but that it belonged to the defendants because the plaintiff as notary
public ratified a * * * deed of sale with right to repurchase on May
14, 1947 involving the parcel of land in question executed by Brigida
Estrada de Sajonas, so that when the plaintiff allegedly bought the
parcel of land in question from Rodolfo Sajonas on April 7, 1953, he
knew that fact * * *." Although there is no evidence in support of this
allegation, owing to the stipulation in question, it is obvious that,
in the absence thereof, defendants would be entitled to introduce such
evidence.</p>
<p>Under his second assignment of error plaintiff maintains that, in
view of defendants' failure to pay their obligation within the
stipulated period of two (2) years from September 27, 1946, they may no
longer avail of the benefits of the Ballantyne scale. This pretense is
devoid of merit. Non-payment of said obligation, despite the expiration
of said period, had no other effect than to give creditor the right to
sue for the recovery of the amount due, plus damages for said default
in the performance of said obligation. (Articles 1170 and 1193, Civil
Code of the Philippines.)</p>
<p><strong style="font-weight: normal;">Wherefore</strong>, the decision appealed from is hereby
affirmed, with the costs of this instance against plaintiff-appellant,
Ramon B. Melendez. It is so ordered.</p>
<p><em>Bengzon, C.J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Barrera, Paredes, Regala,</em> and <em>Makalintal, JJ.,</em> concur.</p></div>
