				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Original action for certiorari and prohibition challenging the
jurisdiction of respondent judge of the Court of First Instance of Iloilo to
take cognizance of twenty separate petitions for mandamus with preliminary
mandatory injunction filed by private respondents and to issue orders for the
release from customs custody of forty crates of imported articles described to
be used sheet containers and used sample wood panels and other similar articles
but reported upon customs examination to be parts of slot and jackpot machines.</p>

<p class="BODY">The twenty pairs of respondents, totalling forty of them all with
given addresses at Manila, Quezon City and Rizal, are conceded­ly the
consignees of the forty crates which arrived at the port of Manila on board the
M/S "Tagaytay" and were trans-shipped to the port of Iloilo arriving
there on November 5, 1970 on board the M/B "Don Camilo".</p>

<p class="BODY">Claiming that petitioners customs authorities of Iloilo had re­fused
to act on the informal entries filed for the release of the forty crates,
without requiring them either to submit additional documents but refusing to
accept payment of the takes, duties and other charges allegedly due on the
shipments and without instituting seizure proceedings against the shipments,
the forty respondents, through respective designated attorneys-in fact (twenty
of them representing the twenty pairs of consignees, at one crate per
consignee) filed December 10, 1970, through common counsel, Atty, Romeo F.
Zamora,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
the twenty separate petitions for mandamus with respondent court.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Respondents alleged uniformly in their petitions that they had learned that in
mid-November of 1970, the 40 crates had been opened, examined and inventoried
by the customs authorities' without due notice to them and were found to
contain parts of slot machines, which are of prohibited importation under
section 102 (e) of the Tariff and Customs Code, but that they were submitting
to respondent court for "judicial interpretation" the proposition
that the cited provision "does not prohibit parts only thereof, but only
those complete and assembled units so that the same can be utilized for
gambling purpose, which the law prohibits. "</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents prayed respondent judge for the immediate issuance of
a preliminary mandatory injunction for the release under bond of the shipments
alleging that otherwise "upon notice to respondent [collector] of instant
petition, the respondent [collector] will immediately institute seizure
proceedings over subject shipments thereby divesting and/or abetting (sic) this
Court from acquiring jurisdiction over the subject matter and making the
petition at bar academic and moot to the irreparable and great damage of your
petitioners." Res­pondents, without any appraisal of the collector or his
examiners, unilaterally computed by themselves the specific amounts allegedly
due by way of "total lawful taxes, duties and other charges due on the
shipments" and prayed respondent judge to issue a writ of mandamus
"commanding the respondent [collector] to accept (their) payment"
therefor.</p>

<p class="BODY">Late in the afternoon of December 11, 1970, without summons
having been issued by respondent court, respondents' counsel served upon
petitioner deputy collector Armada a notice addressed to peti­tioner collector
Señeres that he would submit his petitions for preli­minary mandatory
injunction for the respondent court's resolution at 8:30 a.m., the next day,
December 12, 1970.  Armada refused to re­ceive
the notice since it was addressed to the collector who was in Manila on
official business and since no court summons had been issued in the said cases
as to place him under the jurisdiction of res­pondent court.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On December 12, 1970, respondent judge nevertheless issued <u>ex-parte</u>
his order of the same date granting the writs of preliminary mandatory
injunction prayed for by the forty respondents in the twenty cases below, upon
the filing of bonds amounting to double the amounts unilaterally computed by
respondents as the amounts of taxes, duties and charges payable by them<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
and directing the release unto pe­titioners of the questioned articles. Respondent
judge premised his ex-parte mandatory injunction order <u>inter alia </u>"that
said provision (sec. 102 (e) of the Tariff and Customs Code) relied upon by the
res­pondent does not prohibit importation of parts thereof but only those
complete and assembled units, thereby requiring the interpretation of the same
which is a proper function of this Court; that it is the sense of this Court
that the instant importation does not fall as a prohibited importation within
the purview of the provisions of law aforequoted as they are merely spare parts
and not machines and not jackpot machines and pinball machines or similar
contrivances that the petitioners have established their clear legal right to
claim the subject shipment x x x; that respondent's unwarranted and unjust
refusal to act on the corresponding entry without instituting any seizure
proceedings against subject shipments and in not allowing the petitioners to
pay the lawful taxes due thereon, thereby hindering the ultimate release of
said shipment to the petitioners has caused great and irreparable damage and
injury to the herein petitioners x x x".</p>

<p class="BODY">The required bonds were filed on the same day, December 12, 1970,
and the order and writ of preliminary mandatory injunction were served in the
afternoon of the same day on petitioner wharfinger Hortillosa.  It was also on the same day, December 12,
1970, only that respondent judge issued his order of the same date finding
"the instant petitions for mandamus .... sufficient in form and
substance" and requiring petitioner collector Señeres as therein
respondent to answer the petition within ten days.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner collector filed on December 14, 1970 an urgent motion
to dissolve the writ of preliminary mandatory injunction for the release of the
slot machine parts, on the grounds, <u>inter alia</u>, of respondent court's
lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter, res­pondents' lack of cause of
action, the grave and irreparable damage that would be caused to the Government
and grave abuse of discre­tion and violation of the Rules in the issuance of
the writ.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Pe­titioner movant attached to his petition the very letter of December 4, 1970
of Eduardo Ramila as representative of the forty respondents-consignees asking
for a 10-day extension at least to file entries for the forty shipments
"on the ground that the complete shipping documents are not as yet
received for reasons not presently known to the above consignees"<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
and informed respondent judge that as of then, respondents had not yet filed
the necessary documents but had nevertheless filed their premature petitions
with the court for mandamus to order the release of the articles.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent judge denied dissolution of his mandatory injunction
per his order of December 15, 1970, summarily disregarding the statutes and
jurisprudence cited by petitioner and peremptorily ruling that "(T)here
can hardly be any question that since the nature of the cause of action in this
proceedings is mandamus, this Court is vested with jurisdiction to entertain
the same more so because the cause in­volves a justiciable controversy between
the parties in the interpretation of a provision of the Tariff and Customs Code
of the Philippines (Sec. 102, par. 'e'), which calls for the exercise of the
interpretative power of the Court."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the next day, December 16, 1970, respondents filed an urgent
motion to cite petitioners Armada and Hortillosa for contempt and to authorize
the sheriff to break open the bodega under the custody of wharfinger Hortillosa
to effect release of the forty crates.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent judge overruled petitioners' opposition per his order
of December 17, 1970, took the wharfinger's manifestation that he could not
release the articles pursuant to the mandatory writ except after pro­per
identification of respondents-consignees and completion of the docu­ments
necessary and required of all importers for release from customs of articles
imported into the country as "a deliberate move to delay if not render the
writ ineffective" and ordered wharfinger Hortillosa "to open the
customs bodega, release and deliver the subject articles to the Provincial
Sheriff of Iloilo or his authorized deputy, and in the event of the failure
and/or refusal of the former, the Provincial Sheriff or his Deputy is hereby
authorized, as prayed for, to break open the pad­lock of the bodega where
subject goods are contained for him to effect delivery to the petitioners
herein.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Respondent judge further set the contempt hearing for December 23, 1970 at 8:30
a. m.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the present action.  The Court per its resolution of De­cember 28, 1970 required respondents
to answer the petition and issued a writ of preliminary injunction enjoining
the enforcement of respondent judge's orders and writ of mandatory injunction
and restraining res­pondent judge from taking any further cognizance of the
twenty cases before him.</p>

<p class="NUM">1. It is the settled law and jurisprudence in this jurisdiction
that the customs authorities acquire exclusive jurisdiction over goods sought
to be imported into the Philippines, for the purpose of enforce­ment of
Philippine customs laws, from the moment the goods are actually under their
possession and control, even if no warrant for seizure or detention thereof has
previously been issued by the port collector of customs. The port collector is
called upon to "cause all such articles to be appraised and classified,
and shall assess and collect the duties, taxes and other charges thereon, and
shall hold possession of all imported articles upon which duties, taxes, and
other charges have not been paid or secured to be paid disposing of the same
according to law."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
When the goods are challenged as being of prohibited importation and the
collector questions the legality of the importation, as in the case of the
jackpot machine parts at bar, the law expressly imposes upon the collector the
obligation <u>"to exercise such jurisdiction in respect thereto as will
prevent importation</u>".<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="BODY">The collector's decision may be appealed to the commissioner of
customs, whose decision, <u>inter alia</u>, in cases involving <u>seizure,
detention or release of property affected</u>, may in turn be reviewed only by
the Court of Tax Appeals under the exclusive appellate jurisdiction conferred
on said court under section 7 of Republic Act 1125.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">2. Respondent court manifestly had no jurisdiction to interfere with
the Iloilo port customs authorities' custody over the forty crates of alleged
slot machine and jackpot machine parts sought to be imported under respondents'
misdeclaration of their being merely used sheet and meal containers and panels,
much less to order their forcible release notwithstanding their entry not yet
having been covered by the required entry documents nor the collector having
directed their ap­praisal, since he was preparing seizure and forfeiture
proceedings against the forty crates for being of prohibited importation and
unmanifested in violation of section 2530 (f) and (g) of the Tariff and Customs
Code and Central Bank Circular No. 265.  In fact, the collector did is­sue the corresponding warrant of seizure
and detention under date of December 17, 1970<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
and notices dated January 27, 1971 were sent in Seizure Identification Case No.
13-70<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
advising respondents the hearings to be held on February 15 to 17, 1971 by the
collector's hearing officer for the forfeiture of the forty crates.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As held by the Court in the 1966 leading case of <u>Pacis vs.
Averia</u><a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
where the Court emphasized the need of the cooperation of all branches of the
Government for the success of the law enforcement agencies in curbing smuggling
- by virtue of the enactment of the Tariff and Customs Code (Rep. Act 1937) as
well as the Court of Tax Appeals Law (Rep. Act 1125), "on grounds of
public policy, it is more reasonable to conclude that <u>the legislators
intended to divest the Court of First Instance of the prerogative to replevin a
property which is a subject of a seizure and forfeiture proceedings for
violation of the Tariff and Customs Code.  Other­wise, actions for forfeiture of property for violation of Customs
laws could easily be undermined by the simple device of replevin</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">"Furthermore, Section 2303 of the Tariff and Customs Code re­quires
the Collector of Customs to give to the owner of the property sought to be
forfeited written notice of the seizure and to give him the opportunity to be
heard in his defense.  <u>This provision
clearly indicates</u> <u>the intention of the law to confine in the Bureau of
Customs the determina­tion of all questions affecting the disposal of property
proceeded against  in a seizure and
forfeiture case.  The judicial recourse
of the property owner is not in the Court of First Instance but in the Court of
Tax Appeals, and only after exhausting administrative remedies in the Bureau of
Cus­toms</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">3. In the early 1967 case of <u>Commissioner of Customs vs.
Cloribe</u>l,<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
respondent judge's fallacious concepts that his court may assume and exercise
jurisdiction in mandamus cases involving the exercise of its
"interpretative power" over disputed provisions of the Tariff and
Customs Code were long laid to rest.  The Court, in no un­certain terms, there pointed out that in cases of
illegal importation, as in the case at bar, the Commissioner of Customs must
first review the collector's ruling and "by a formal decision" rule
on the legality of the importation.  It
is only after a decision adverse to the importer is rendered that the importer
may then "summon the aid of the Corres­ponding court." But such
disposition of the customs commissioner, the Court stressed, "will not
come under the court of first instance on appeal.  Such appeal shall be addressed to the court of tax appeals.  Because, at bottom, the problem is: Was the
importation authorized by law? "</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court then cited the early 1955 jurisprudence<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
that "x x x Section 7 of Republic Act No. 1125 <u>has taken away the power
of courts of first instance to</u> <u>review the actuations of the customs
autho­rities in a case involving seizure, detention or release of property, or
other matters arising under the Customs Law or other law administered by the
Bureau of Customs. And this, notwithstanding the fact that com­plaints may be
styled 'mandamus', ‘prohibition' or 'certiorari'.  For, in reality, these are but expressions in varying forms of a
petition to review the actuations of the customs authorities.  Expressive of the rule is our opinion in the
Millarez case, viz</u>:</p>

<blockquote>'Republic Act No. 1125, section 7, effective June 16, 1954 gave the
Court of Tax Appeals exclusive appellate jurisdiction to review on appeal,
decisions of the Com­missioner of Customs, involving 'seizure, detention or
release of property affected x x x or other matters arising under the Customs
Law or other law administered by the Bureau of Customs.' In our opinion this
provision necessarily has taken away the power of the Manila court of first
instance to 'review' decisions of the Customs au­thorities, 'in any case of
seizure' - as in this case - under section 1383 et seq. of the Revised
Administrative Code.'</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">"<u>It matters not that no seizure proceedings were
had.  Section 7 of the charter of the
Court of Tax Appeals does not limit the appellate jurisdiction of said court to
seizure proceedings.  The law employs
the term 'seizure, detention or release</u>.’"<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="NUM">4. <u>Papa vs. Mago</u><a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></u></span></a>
reiterated the doctrine of the lack of jurisdiction of the regular courts of first
instance over customs authorities in the enforcement of customs laws, thus:
"It is the settled rule, therefore, that the Bureau of Customs acquires
exclusive juris­diction over imported goods, for the purposes of enforcement of
the customs laws, from the moment the goods are actually in its possession or
control, even if no warrant of seizure or detention had previously been issued
by the Collector of Customs in connection with seizure and forfeiture
proceedings."</p>

<p class="BODY">In the recent case of <u>Ponce Enrile vs. Vinuya</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
reaffirming anew the settled doctrine of <u>Papa</u> and <u>Pacis vs. Averia</u>,
<u>supra</u>, the Court, per Mr. Justice Fernando, emphasized anew that the
regular courts of first instance are "devoid of jurisdiction" to
issue replevin or release orders for goods under customs custody:
"(R)espondents, however, notwithstanding the compelling force of the above
doctrines, would assert that respondent Judge could entertain the replevin suit
as the seizure is illegal, allegedly because the warrant issued is invalid and
the seizing officer likewise was devoid of authority.  This is to lose sight of the distinction, as earlier made mention
of, between the exist­ence of the power and the regularity of the proceeding
taken under it.  The governmental agency
concerned, the Bureau of Customs, is vested with exclusive authority.  Even if it be assumed that in the exercise
of such exclusive competence a taint of illegality may be correctly imputed,
the most that can be said is that under certain circumstances the grave abuse
of discretion conferred may oust it of such jurisdiction.  It does not mean however that
correspondingly a court of first instance is vested with competence when
clearly in the light of the above decisions the law has not seen fit to do
so.  The proceeding before the Collector
of Customs is not final. An appeal lies to the Commissioner of Customs and
there­after to the Court of Tax Appeals.  It may even reach this Court through the appropriate petition for
review.  The proper ventilation of the
legal issues raised is thus indicated.  Certainly a court of first instance is not therein included.  It is devoid of jurisdiction."</p>

</span><!--[endif]-->The doctrine was last reaffirmed anew in <u>Luna vs. Pacis</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
­where the Court, per Mr. Justice Zaldivar, affirmed the court of first
instance's 1964 order dismissing and disclaiming jurisdiction over a mandamus
action instituted by therein appellant to seek release of for­feited property
from the Manila customs authorities, on the settled doctrine of the 1955 case
of <u>Millarez</u>, maintaining the exclusive appellate jurisdic­tion of the
Court of Tax Appeals over decisions of the customs commis­sioner, as
subsequently reiterated by the Court in a long line of decisions<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
and from which the Court has found no plausible reason to depart.</p>

</span><!--[endif]-->Indeed, prescinding from the patent lack of jurisdiction of
respondent court over the mandamus cases filed in the court below, the Court
finds that respondent judge proceeded in gross disregard of the Rules of Court
in hearing the petitions on December 12, 1970 aria peremptorily issuing on the
same date his mandatory order and writ for the release upon bond of the forty
crates, even before he had found, as required by the Rules,<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
the petitions to be sufficient in form and substance, and caused the issuance of
summons to petitioner col­lector (as respondent therein).  Petitioner deputy collect or Armada was
wholly justified in refusing to receive on the preceding afternoon respondents'
counsel's notice to petitioner collector that he would sub­mit the next morning
to respondent judge his "urgent" petitions for pre­liminary mandatory
injunction, since no summons had then as yet been issued to said petitioner as
to place him under the respondent court's jurisdiction and respondents' counsel
had no authority whatsoever un­der the Rules to serve any binding notice with
regard to his petitions, which had not yet been given due course by respondent
court, such as to require said petitioner to have been present on the next
morning before respondent court.</p>

</span><!--[endif]-->Respondent judge likewise appears to have cast aside the basic
postulates governing the issuance of preliminary mandatory in­junction orders,
as restated by Mr. Justice Sanchez for the Court in <u>Cloribel</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
<u>supra</u>:  "(B)y Section 1,
Rule 58, 1964 Rules of Court, it is now expressly provided - though already
long generally recognized - that a court, at any stage of an action prior to
final judgment, may require the performance of a particular act, in which case
it shall be known as a preliminary mandatory injunction.' But, stock must be
taken of the truism that, like preventive injunctions, it is but a provisional
remedy to which parties may resort 'for the preservation or protection of their
rights or interests, and for no other purpose, during the pen­dency of the
principal action.'  More than this, as a
mandatory injunc­tion 'usually tends to do more than to maintain the status
quo, it is generally improper to issue such an injunction prior to the final
hearing.  Per contra, it may issue 'in
cases of extreme urgency; where the right is very clear; where considerations
of relative inconvenience bear strong­ly in complainant's favor; where there is
a willful and unlawful invasion of plaintiff's right against his protest and
remonstrance, the injury being a continuing one; and where the effect of the
mandatory injunction is rather to reestablish and maintain a preexisting
continuing relation between the parties, recently and arbitrarily interrupted
by the defendant, than to es­tablish a new relation.' Indeed, 'the writ should not
be denied the com­plainant when he makes out a clear case, free from doubt and
dispute.' "</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, respondent judge's mandatory writ obviously
was not designed to maintain the status quo.  Neither had respondents made out "a clear case free from doubt and
dispute." To paraphrase <u>Cloribel</u>, the most convincing argument, of
course, is that to enforce respondent judge's writ for the release of the forty
crates of slot and jackpot machine parts, would have been practically to decide
the case in favor of respondents.  In
just one <u>ex-parte</u> hearing and without any evidence of his having
reflected on his court's lack of jurisdiction over the subject-matter,
respondent judge had indeed <u>pre-judged</u> the petitions before him and
already expressed his "sense" in his order of December 12, 1970 that
the importation of the forty crates were not of prohibited importation and
could not be deemed covered by section 102 (e) of the customs code, "as
they are merely spare parts and not machines and not jackpot machines and
pinball machines or similar contrivances." As in the case of <u>Cloribel</u>,
"to proceed with the case below on the merits would then be a useless
ceremony" because respondents would have gotten already what they wanted
in their suits below, i.e. release of the forty crates, and the government
would have lost its lawful hold on the controverted shipments of slot machine
parts and "literally shall have been left 'holding the bag' ". The
questioned illegal articles would then have been released from customs, despite
the Tariff and Customs Code's prohibition, by virtue of respondent judge's
orders peremptorily and hasti­ly issued without jurisdiction, and would have
been quickly disposed of by respondents-consignees, presumably at great profit
to service the various illegal jackpot machines in the country or to be
assembled as complete units and no subsequent corrective order of any court
would have availed to re­cover the articles and bring them back to the custody
of the customs autho­rities, for forfeiture and eventual destruction, if
ultimately ruled by pro­per competent authorities to be of prohibited
importation.</p>

<p class="NUM">8. The government attorneys thus appear to have valid ground for
complaining of respondent judge's orders of December 12, 15 and 17, 1970,
having been precipitously granted, to the extent of authorizing the destruction
of the customs warehouse padlock to enable respondents to forcibly realize
"their scheme to obtain possession of the imported articles" before
this Court could act on the petition filed on December 21, 1970, expecting that
the Court might not hold sessions until after the long Christmas holidays and
thus render moot and academic the petition with its prayer for a restraining
order against enforcement of the challenged orders, with grave and irreparable
damage to the public in­terest.<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent judge, notwithstanding his attention having been
timely called, by petitioners in their urgent motion of December 14, 1970 for
dissolution of the mandatory injunction, to the settled law and jurisprudence
on his court's lack of jurisdiction and this Court's admonition against the
precipitous issuance of injunctive writs, appears to have failed to pay due
heed thereto.  Mr. Justice Reyes'
injunction for the Court in <u>Palanan Lumber &amp; Plywood, Inc. vs. Arranz</u><a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
is apropos: "(I)t is not amiss to recall here that time and again<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court has had occasion to deplore the readiness of some judges to grant
and issue in­junctions ex parte against acts of public functionaries, <u>ignoring
the pre­sumption of regularity and validity of official actuations, in
disregard of the deference and courtesy due to a co-ordinate branch of the
govern­ment, and with no other guide than the far from impartial assertions in
pleadings of interested parties, which a summary hearing would have shown to be
either dubious or unfounded</u>.  <u>The
result has been that all too often, the public interest has been prejudiced</u>
through unnecessary delays.  It bears
repeating here that preliminary injunctions remain extraordinary remedies that <u>should
be dispensed with circumspection, and that both sides should be first heard
whenever possible</u>."<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="NUM">9. Finally, per its resolution of March 18, 1971, the Court
required counsel for respondents, Atty. Zamora, "considering the fact of
record that all the shipments were consigned to the port of Iloilo while all
the consignees are residents of Manila, Quezon City and Rizal, to submit with
his memorandum the name(s) of the person or persons who employed him as well as
copies of any written contracts for his legal services executed by him with the
twenty pairs of respondents and/or with their respective
attorneys-in-fact." In his compliance dated April 12, 1971, Atty. Zamora
manifested that "his legal services (sic) for said cases was <u>verbally</u>
engaged first by respondents' attorneys-in-­fact Messrs. Alberto Belardo,
Ricardo Cordero, Renato Nable, Romeo Bautista and Agustin Revilla for the
respective shipments of consignees-respondents that they represent.
Subsequently, the other above-named attorneys-in-fact followed in verbally
employing my professional services, likewise, for respective
consignees-respondents that they represent.  Hence, being the attorney of record of the above-named respondents whose
respective shipments are similarly situated, I deemed it wise to file similar
or identical petition with the court below (respondent court)."</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court is intrigued by the fact of record that 40 individuals
-private respondents - all with given addresses in Manila, Quezon City and
Rizal would be the consignee each of a crate of 40 shipments ap­parently
misdeclared as used metal containers and other articles of similar nature but
actually consisting of slot or jackpot machine parts; that the entire forty
crates would be shipped on the same vessel from Singapore for Manila with
instructions to trans-ship to the port of Iloilo; and that said forty
respondents-"consignees" have apparently not acted on their own
account but through designated attorneys-in-fact duly pre-authorized to clear
their shipments as well as to engage <u>verbally</u> the services of common
counsel for the purpose.  The Court
therefore directs the Solicitor-General to investigate the matter further with
the assistance of the appropriate governmental investigative agency and to ascertain
the true facts of the transaction, and the identity and participation of
private respondents and their attorneys-in-fact, as well as the full facts of
how they came to engage the services of their common counsel, Atty. Zamora, and
to inform the Court in due course of the results of such investigation and the
appropriate action taken thereon, if any.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the writs of prohibition and certiorari
prayed for are granted, respondent court being clearly without jurisdiction
over the subject matter of Civil Cases Nos. 8449 to 8468 filed before it, which
cases respondent judge is hereby ordered to dismiss. The order and writ of
preliminary mandatory injunction of December 12, 1970 as well as the other
orders of December 15, 1970 and December 17, 1970 (Annexes C, C-1, G and J,
petition) issued by respondent judge are declared null and void, and the writ
of preliminary injunction heretofore issued by this Court is made per­manent.  With costs against private respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Clerk of Court is directed to furnish copy of this decision
to the Honorable, the Secretary of Justice, particularly with reference to the
matters dealt with in paragraphs 6 to 8 thereof.  He is likewise directed to furnish copy hereof to the Honorable,
