<p class="BODY">The record shows that at about 8:00 o'clock in the evening of
June 27, 1965, <span class="SpellE">Susante</span> Tobias, <span class="SpellE">Regulo</span>
Tobias, <span class="SpellE">Justino</span> Tobias, <span class="SpellE">Deogracias</span>
Tobias, Ramon <span class="SpellE">Villaflor</span>, Rolando Jara­millo, and the
late Jesus Tobias were in the national highway, in front of a drugstore, in <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo, <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, waiting for a bus bound for <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon seeing the group, Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Tabion</span>, a member of the police force of <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>.
Domingo, <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>,
addressed his companions:<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>

As they were approaching the Tobias group, the policemen deployed and took up
strategic positions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon seeing <span class="SpellE">Susante</span> Tobias, then a member of the town council, <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Tabuloc</span> sidled up to him
and put his hands on his shoulders, saying:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Would you mind coming here, lawyer, and let us have a talk."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a> <span class="SpellE">Susante</span> Tobias went with <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Tabuloc</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sensing
some trouble, the rest of the Tobias group went inside the drugstore.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span class="SpellE">Susante</span> Tobias
came near the other policemen, he noted that their weapons were aimed at
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Realizing the danger he was in, <span class="SpellE">Susante</span> Tobias parried the muzzles of the guns nearest him
and dashed into the drugstore.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No sooner

To escape the barrage, <span class="SpellE">Susante</span> Tobias and his
companions sought refuge at the back of the drugstore and hid behind some
"sidings".<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>

Once inside, Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Tabion</span> went towards the back
of the drugstore and fired his gun indiscriminately at the persons hiding
thereat and immediately went out.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Shooting, thereafter, continued.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The gunshot fired by Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Tabion</span>
hit Jesus Tobias who was hiding behind some panels.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He exclaimed that he had been shot and was
evacuated to the nearby house of Ramon <span class="SpellE">Villa­flor</span>
even as the shooting continued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the
house of <span class="SpellE">Villaflor</span>, Jesus Tobias was brought to the
house of one Mrs. Tremor where they borrowed a jeep and in which Jesus Tobias
was taken to the provincial hospital where he died a few minutes later.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

so that only Enrique <span class="SpellE">Fagel</span> was tried and thereafter
convicted of the crime charged.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused Enrique <span class="SpellE">Fagel</span> does not deny
that the late Jesus Tobias died as a result of the gunshot wounds inflicted
upon him by Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Tabion</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Enrique <span class="SpellE">Fagel</span>
claims that he did not participate in the shooting incident and was somewhere
else when it happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said that he
arrived at the municipal build­ing of <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo a
few minutes before 6:00 o'clock in the evening of June 27, 1965 and immediately
proceeded to the back of the municipal building in order to cook their supper,
which he and Pat. <span class="SpellE">Tualla</span> and some other members of
the municipal force ate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After he had
eaten, he went to buy some cigarettes at a store located north of the municipal
hall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While there, he heard a gun report
coming from the south.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Being a
policeman, he went to the place where the shot emanated from.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While on his way, he met Pat. Ignacio <span class="SpellE">Tadena</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter
was helping Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Tabion</span> who was wounded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, he helped Pat. <span class="SpellE">Tadena</span>
in taking Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Tabion</span> to the hospital at <span class="SpellE">Vigan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, before
they lifted <span class="SpellE">Tabion</span> to the jeep which would carry him
to the hospital, he fired his gun into the air in order to scare those who shot
<span class="SpellE">Tabion</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The defense of alibi cannot prevail over the positive testi­mony
of the witnesses identifying and pointing to the accused Enrique <span class="SpellE">Fagel</span> as one of the policemen involved in the shooting
incident in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pat. <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> <span class="SpellE">Tabarnilla</span> of the <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo police force testified that Enrique <span class="SpellE">Fagel</span> was in the group of policemen who went towards the
drugstore on the night in question; and that not long thereafter he heard gun
shots coming from that direction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
further stated that after the shooting incident, <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tabuloc</span> and Enrique <span class="SpellE">Fagel</span>
returned to the municipal building and challenged the other policemen who did
not join them in the shooting incident.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
Ignacio <span class="SpellE">Tadena</span>, another member of the police force of
<span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo, who was discharged from the information
and utilized as a state witness, categorically declared that Enrique <span class="SpellE">Fagel</span> was one of the policemen who shot at the persons
inside the drugstore.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a> <span class="SpellE">Susante</span> Tobias also identified Enrique <span class="SpellE">Fagel</span>

<p class="BODY">Besides, this claim is inconsistent with his earlier admission
that he was present during the said shooting incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in his sworn statement given to PC
investigators after the incident, Enrique <span class="SpellE">Fagel</span>
stated:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Will
you narrate what really happened in the night of <st1:date year="1965" day="27" month="6">June 27, 1965</st1:date> at <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo, <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At

building of <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo, <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sur</span> when I was called by Pat. <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ta­buloc</span> informing me that Pat. Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Tabion</span> saw a boy by the name <span class="SpellE">Lando</span>

near to the <span class="SpellE">Farmacia</span>, Councilor <span class="SpellE">Zusante</span>
Tobias approached us and said "ANIATTI UMAYYO SISIIMUN DITOY" and
Pat. <span class="SpellE">Tabuloc</span> answered that we were not watching them
and told them that a boy name <span class="SpellE">Lando</span> loaded a carbine
and enter­ed inside the drugstore, but Councilor <span class="SpellE">Zusante</span>
Tobias said that <span class="SpellE">Lando</span> is not there and
simultaneously <span class="SpellE">Lando</span> came out of the door of the
drugstore hold­ing a carbine at his back."<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The accused also contends that he cannot be found guilty of the
crime charged because of the absence of conspiracy between him and Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Tabion</span> who fired the fatal shot that killed Tobias.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention is without merit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Conspiracy has been clearly shown by <span class="SpellE">Fagel's</span>
direct and active participation in shooting at the persons inside the
drugstore.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is, therefore, as guilty
as the actual assailant in the commission of the crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused further contends that evident premeditation was not
present in the commission of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This contention is, likewise, without merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears that a month previous to the
incident, <span class="SpellE">Susante</span> Tobias filed an administrative case
with the Municipal Council of <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo, <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> against the accused
policemen Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Tabion</span>, Enrique <span class="SpellE">Fagel</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Tabuloc</span> for having maltreated a boy and a barrio captain.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a> <span class="SpellE">Susante</span> Tobias also brought the mother of the boy and some
witnesses to the NBI Branch office at <span class="SpellE">Vigan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, and after
investigation, Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Tabion</span>, Enrique <span class="SpellE">Fagel</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Tabuloc</span> were charged in court.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
Because of this, the <span class="SpellE">aforenamed</span> policemen harbored
ill-feelings against <span class="SpellE">Susante</span> Tobias.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They no longer talked with him.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
At about 3:00 o'clock in the afternoon of June 27, 1965, Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Tabion</span> openly showed his ill-feelings and personal grudge
against <span class="SpellE">Susante</span> Tobias when, upon seeing Martin <span class="SpellE">Tela</span>, first cousin of the wife of <span class="SpellE">Susante</span>
Tobias, in the house of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Cristeta</span> <span class="SpellE">Tela</span>, he stabbed him three times with a <span class="SpellE">balisong</span>,
saying:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"I do not like you because
I suppose you are not with us including Atty. <span class="SpellE">Susante</span>
Tobias who has not been helping us in spite of the fact that he is the present
councilor of <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo, <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span>
<st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Sur</span>.</st1:place></st1:country-region>"<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
"If I will only meet your brother-in-law, he does not care to take our
side, there will be a time when I will be able to find him.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
Then, at about <st1:time minute="30" hour="19">7:30 o'clock</st1:time> in the
evening Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Tabion</span>, Enrique <span class="SpellE">Fagel</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Luciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Tabuloc</span> and <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tabuloc</span> arrived at the
municipal building of <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All were armed with firearms and appeared to
have drank some wine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thirty minutes
later, they told Ignacio <span class="SpellE">Tadena</span> to go with them and
look for Martin <span class="SpellE">Tela</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But, they proceeded towards the house of <span class="SpellE">Susante</span>
Tobias.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before reaching the said house,
however, they saw a group of persons in the highway, in front of the
drugstore.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Tabion</span>
said:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"They are the ones now,"
and went towards them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As they
approached the group, the policemen deployed and took up strategic positions.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
After exchanging a few words with Atty. <span class="SpellE">Susante</span>
Tobias, who thereafter ran to the drugstore for his life, the policemen fired
at the men inside the drugstore.</p>

<p class="BODY">These circumstances speak eloquently of a conspiracy generated by
an all consuming hatred to kill <span class="SpellE">Susante</span> Tobias.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court, therefore, did not err in
considering that evident premeditation qualified the crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court did not also err in finding that the accused took
advantage of his public position as a policeman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He committed the crime with the aid of a gun
which he had been authorized to carry as a peace officer.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Treachery was also present.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Tabion</span> shot the unarmed,
unsuspecting and defenseless Jesus Tobias who was then hiding behind some
panels inside the drugstore, where he had taken refuge from the combined
firepower of the high-powered guns of the policemen.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although not alleged in the information, We hold as proven by the
evidence the aggravating circumstance that the offense was committed by a band
because there were more than three attackers all armed with high-powered guns,
and all firing in concert around the besieged drugstore.<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">For the killing of Jesus Tobias, therefore, the crime committed
is murder qualified by evident premeditation and aggravated by the
circumstances of treachery, taking advantage of his public position, and
committed by a band.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The six cases of
attempted murders are likewise qualified by evident premeditation and committed
with the same aggravating circumstances.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the lower court should be, as
it is hereby, affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, for
lack of the required number of votes for the imposition of the death penalty,
the accused Enrique <span class="SpellE">Fagel</span> is sentenced to suffer the

<p class="OTHERHEADING">DISSENTING IN PART</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">MAKASIAR, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">The qualifying circumstance of evident premeditation could be
appreciated only against accused Enrique Fagel, insofar as the attempted murder
on Susante Tobias is concerned; because he bore a grudge against and repeatedly
threatened Susante Tobias for filing administrative charges against him and the
other accused policemen for maltreating a boy and a barrio captain, which is
also the basis of a criminal charge filed in court by the NBI.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The murder victim Jesus Tobias and the
victims of the attempted murder happened only to be with Susante Tobias at the
time the crime was committed at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="20">8:00 P.M.</st1:time>
of <st1:date year="1965" day="27" month="6">June 27, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellant had no ill-will towards the
victims other than Susante Tobias.</p>

<p class="BODY">This point is emphasized only in the interest of legal precision;
because it will not alter the result due to the presence of the qualifying and
aggravating circumstances of <span class="GramE">treachery</span>, armed band,
and taking advantage of public position.</p>
