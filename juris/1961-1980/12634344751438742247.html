armed men sacked two places in <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
Occidental:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Toboso</span>
town in the early morning; and <st1:place><st1:placename>Cadiz</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
in the evening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the raid on <span class="SpellE">Toboso</span>, the Circuit Cri­minal Court at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
in Criminal Case No. CCC-XII-27, found the accused Carlos <span class="SpellE">Caramonte</span>
guilty of robbery in band with multiple <span class="GramE">homicide</span> and
less serious physical injuries, and sentenced him to death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But for the raid on <st1:place><st1:placename>Cadiz</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, the Court of First Instance,
Branch I, at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Silay</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, in Criminal Case No. 690,
acquitted the same accused <span class="SpellE">Caramonte</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is an appeal from the judgment of
conviction.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the time the trial of this case started, of the several
accused mentioned in the Third Amended Information, all were at large except
Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Cañete</span> and <span class="SpellE">Caramonte</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Trial proceeded against these two; but before
the prosecution rested its case, it moved that the case be dismissed against <span class="SpellE">Cañete</span>, on the ground of insufficiency of evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no objection on the part of the
accused, and the court dismissed the case against <span class="SpellE">Cañete</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the case proceeded only as against the
accused <span class="SpellE">Caramonte</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">One witness - <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span> Salinas -
testified for the prosecution in both cases.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In Criminal Case No. 690, which resulted in the judgment of acquittal, <st1:city><st1:place>Salinas</st1:place></st1:city>
was discharged to become a state witness.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the instant case, he testified that he resides at <span class="SpellE">sitio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Amamansa</span>, barrio <span class="SpellE">Pasil</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bantayan</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This place is found on the <st1:place><st1:placetype>island</st1:placetype>

which is a part of <span class="SpellE">Bantayan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="30" month="12">December 30, 1967</st1:date>,
at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="16">4:00 p.m.</st1:time>, <st1:city><st1:place>Salinas</st1:place></st1:city>
left his house for <span class="SpellE">sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tunga</span>
to buy matches from the store of one Agustin <span class="SpellE">Cañete</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he arrived, he saw, about ten meters
away from the store, a group composed of:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Carlos <span class="SpellE">Caramonte</span>, <span class="SpellE">Isabelo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Montemayor</span>, <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tagsawa</span> alias Turing, <span class="SpellE">Tambok</span>,
Boy, <span class="SpellE">Kiampao</span>, Cesar <span class="SpellE">Cañete</span>,
Roberto Rivera, and <span class="SpellE">Tatong</span> <span class="SpellE">Mansueto</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">When <st1:city><st1:place>Salinas</st1:place></st1:city>
approached the group squatting on the ground, he heard that they were planning
to stage robberies at <span class="SpellE">Toboso</span> and <st1:place><st1:placename>Cadiz</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Specifically, at arm's length, he heard <span class="SpellE">Montemayor</span> tell the others:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"We'll rob <span class="SpellE">Toboso</span> and <st1:place><st1:placename>Cadiz</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>." When he left the place,
the group remained but later they also went away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They divided into two groups and went to the
seashore.</p>

<p class="BODY">At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="17">5:00 p.m.</st1:time>, <st1:city><st1:place>Salinas</st1:place></st1:city>
reached home and went to the seashore.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He watched while a group of seven - <span class="SpellE">Caramonte</span>,
Turing, <span class="SpellE">Tambok</span>, Mario, Boy, <span class="SpellE">Ponyot</span>,
and <span class="SpellE">Kiampao</span> - boarded a yellow <span class="SpellE">pumpboat</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was about 40 to 50 meters away from the
point of departure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He followed with his
eyes the progress of the boat until it was about four to five kilometers away.</p>

<p class="BODY">The scenario shifts from <span class="SpellE">Botiguez</span> <span class="GramE">island</span> to <span class="SpellE">Toboso</span> town which, on <st1:date year="1967" day="31" month="12">December 31, 1967</st1:date>, between <st1:time minute="0" hour="1">1:00 to 1:30 a.m.</st1:time>, was the venue of advisory
celebration for the newly-elected mayor and other town officials held at the
town plaza.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of those who abstained
from participating in the celebration was Lim Eng <span class="GramE">Yu,</span>
a merchant who preferred to go to sleep in his house located about 10 meters
from the plaza.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At about <st1:time minute="20" hour="1">1:20 a.m.</st1:time>, he was awakened by several shots
fired near the municipal building, about 30 meters away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He peeped through the window and saw several
men with carbines passing through <st1:street><st1:address>Del <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span> <span class="GramE">street</span></st1:address></st1:street>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He hid himself, and then heard the front door
being broken down with an axe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
gaining entry, the malefactors broke the second door leading upstairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They fired several shots and destroyed the
clothes closets.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lim did not recognize
any one of the three or four persons who broke into his house.</p>

<p class="BODY">Together with Lim in his house at this time, were his daughter
Elizabeth Lim, and two maids:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Dioleta</span> <span class="SpellE">Disol</span> and Lolita <span class="SpellE">Pahayahay</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lolita
testified that when the three girls heard the sound of the axe upon the door,
they hid under the bed in the living room.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The armed men espied <span class="SpellE">Dioleta's</span> feet sticking
out from under the bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They pulled <span class="SpellE">Dioleta</span> out and dragged her downstairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The band ordered them to look for money, but
the girls did not know where it could be found.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Later, the band brought them to the seashore, which is about half a
kilometer's distance from the house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There they were released, and they ran back home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the marauders left, Lim found that they
had broken his wooden safe open and taken the amount of P2<span class="GramE">,600.00</span>,
as well as some pieces of jewelry.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the time of the robbery, at about <st1:time minute="30" hour="13">1:30</st1:time> a. m., a group of policemen were taking a coffee
break at a store on <st1:street><st1:address>Del <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span>
  street</st1:address></st1:street>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This group was composed of:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the
Chief of Police, Sgt. Charles Valencia, Pat. <span class="SpellE">Salustiano</span>
<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Taganele</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span>
and Pat. <span class="SpellE">Sotero</span> <span class="SpellE">Baynosa</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As they left the store to go home, a burst of
gunfire exploded in the vicinity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
policemen, seeing that the <span class="GramE">band of malefactors were</span>
armed, sought refuge in different places.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>'The band gave chase to Pat. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Baynosa</span></span><span class="GramE">.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>He testified that
he ran towards the market place and emerged only after one hour, after the band
had disappeared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Baynosa</span>
found <st1:country-region><st1:place>Valencia</st1:place></st1:country-region>'s
dead body at the mu­nicipal kiosk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
had been hit on the head by a bullet.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Chief of Police directed Pat.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Baynosa</span></span><span class="GramE"> to investigate the robbery.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The policeman went to Lim's house and recovered:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>an axe; 29 pieces of .30 cal. shells; and one
piece of live .45 cal. bullet.</p>

<p class="BODY">At about the same time, between <st1:time minute="30" hour="1">1:30
 to 2:00 a.m.</st1:time>, <span class="SpellE">Vivencio</span> Rosales and his
son Nelson were inside a bus identified as <span class="SpellE">Simwin</span> No.
50.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were poised to go home after
attending the victory ball.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His son took
a seat near the bus driver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then a
person unknown to <span class="SpellE">Vivenrio</span> approached the bus and
ordered the driver not to start the vehicle and not to put on the lights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the driver, disregarding the stranger's
directive, started the bus, immediately afterwards an explosion occurred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the first explosion, Nelson was hit on
the left side of the head and died five hours after arrival at the
hospital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The passenger beside Nelson,
George <span class="SpellE">Baynosa</span>, was also hit and he died from the
gunshot wound.</p>

<p class="BODY">Dr. Enrique <span class="SpellE">Gauzon</span>, Acting Municipal
Health Officer of <span class="SpellE">Toboso</span>, testified that at about <st1:time minute="45" hour="1">1:45 a.m.</st1:time>, he examined the cadaver of Sgt.
Charles Valencia, and later issued a post-mortem report.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dr. <span class="SpellE">Gauzon</span> was of
the opinion that death was caused by severe hemorrhage from the cerebral
gunshot wound.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He testified that the
wound was probably caused by a carbine, a <span class="SpellE">Garand</span>, or
a Thompson.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dr. <span class="SpellE">Gauzon</span>
also examined the body of Nelson Rosales and arrived at the similar conclusion
that the cause of death was severe hemorrhage from a gunshot wound.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further, the doctor also examined the cadaver
of George <span class="SpellE">Baynosa</span> and found one bullet wound.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He issued the opinion that the wounds on the
three cadavers he examined could have been caused by .38 or .45 cal. bullets.</p>

<p class="BODY">Dr. <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> <span class="SpellE">Respicio</span>,
Jr., a physician engaged in private practice, testified that he examined Lim <span class="SpellE">Katian</span> at the <st1:place><st1:placename>Magdalene</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place> on <st1:date year="1967" day="31" month="12">December 31, 1967</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lim informed the doctor that he was shot in <span class="SpellE">Toboso</span>; his wounds actually healed on the 11th <span style="">day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The
doctor turned over the bullet to the PC.</p>

<p class="BODY">After this telescopic view of the events at <span class="SpellE">Toboso</span>,
we return to <span class="SpellE">Botiguez</span> <span class="GramE">island</span>
and find <st1:city><st1:place>Salinas</st1:place></st1:city> on the day of the
robbery, <st1:date year="1967" day="31" month="12">December 31, 1967</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="6">6:00
 a.m.</st1:time>, he had climbed to the top of a coconut tree in order to
gather tuba.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From this vantage point, at
a distance of about 50 meters, he saw the yellow <span class="SpellE">pumpboat</span>
coming back to the seashore.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He saw the <span class="SpellE">pumpboat</span> disgorge seven persons who were <span class="SpellE">Caramonte</span> and his six other companions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The band pro­ceeded towards barrio <span class="SpellE">Pasil</span>.</p>

</span>"Let's raid <st1:place><st1:placename>Cadiz</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>."

join the raiding party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although
initially hesitant, <st1:city><st1:place>Salinas</st1:place></st1:city>
accepted the invitation and boarded a blue <span class="SpellE">pumpboat</span>
with the others at the seashore of <span class="SpellE">Tabunok</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They left at <st1:time minute="0" hour="19">7:00

heard shots; after about 30 minutes, the group came back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While they were at sea, he heard Boy groaning
and complaining that he was wounded on his left thigh.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ronnie Boy was also wounded on the left
arm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They reached <span class="SpellE">Amamansa</span>
at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="4">4:00 a.m.</st1:time> and brought the two

<p class="BODY">On January 3 and 5, 1968, the III PC Zone at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
received a spot report from the PC at <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>

sergeant showed to <span class="SpellE">Caramonte</span> the warrant of arrest
issued by the judge of the Cadiz City Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Caramonte</span> argued as an alibi that on the day
of the robbery, on <st1:date year="1967" day="31" month="12">December 31, 1967</st1:date>,
he took his oath as municipal councilor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, the sergeant verified that <span class="SpellE">Caramonte</span>
actually took his oath on a later day, and therefore <span class="GramE">effected</span>
the arrest.</p>

<p class="BODY">Judge Francisco <span class="SpellE">Ledesma</span> of the Cadiz
City Court testified that before him, on January 23, 1968, <span class="SpellE">Caramonte</span>

1968, another affidavit, marked as Exhibit "H".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Exhibit "G", consisting of 12

made about ten corrections on Exhibit "G".</p>

<p class="BODY">In the affidavit marked as Exhibit "H", consisting of
four pages, Carlos <span class="SpellE">Caramonte</span> admitted his

 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused also corrected Exhibit

judge's office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were no policemen
in the judge's chamber.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judge
advised <span class="SpellE">Caramonte</span>, in English, of his constitutional
rights, and told him that he could correct the affidavit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, <span class="SpellE">Caramonte</span>
made about seven corrections on both the original and the carbon copies of the

<p class="BODY">The defense presented ten witnesses to prove the defense of
alibi, i.e., that on <st1:date year="1967" day="31" month="12">December 31, 1967</st1:date>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>in the morning, <span class="SpellE">Caramonte</span>
was at Barrio <span class="SpellE">Pasil</span>, <span class="SpellE">Botiguez</span>
<span class="GramE">island</span>, in Rafael <span class="SpellE">Escario's</span>
house; in the afternoon, he went to the cockpit at <span class="SpellE">Silanga</span>;
and in the evening, he attended the celebration hosted by the barrio captain in
his honor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the trial judge
discounted the defense of alibi, as well as the defense that <span class="SpellE">Caramonte</span> made his extra-judicial con­fession only because
of force and intimidation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial
judge conceded that not one of those who saw the shooting at Lim's house was
able to identify the robbers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also
conceded that <st1:city><st1:place>Salinas</st1:place></st1:city> as a witness
is unreliable, and that his testimony alone can not sustain a judgment of
conviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the trial court was
convinced that <span class="SpellE">Caramonte's</span> extra-judicial confession,
<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "F", is valid, having been the result
of reflection after several days in jail.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court disregarded <span class="SpellE">Caramonte's</span>
claim that he signed Exhibit "F" only because of force and
intimidation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It stressed that <span class="SpellE">Caramonte</span> not only signed his confession, but also
introduced corrections on the affidavit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, he did not report the alleged acts of force and intimidation
to Judge <span class="SpellE">Bontua</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, the trial court applied the presumption of regularity in the
performance of public function.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
trial court applied the same presumption with respect to the re-enactment of
the crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court then rendered judgment as follows:</p>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, the Court finds the accused CARLOS CARAMONTE guilty
beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of robbery in band with multiple homicide
and less serious physical injuries as charged in the information, and
considering the aggravating circumstances that the act was com­mitted by a
band, that the crime was committed during nighttime to facilitate the
commission and its accomplishment, that the crime was committed with evident
premeditation, that the crime was committed with the use of superior strength,
and that it was committed with the use of fast motor vehicle without any
mitigating circumstance to off­set the same, hereby sentences said accused
Carlos <span class="SpellE">Caramonte</span> to suffer the penalty of DEATH, to
indemnify each of the heirs of the deceased Charles <span style="">B. Valencia, George <span class="SpellE">Baynosa</span> and Nelson
Rosales each in the sum of P12,000.00; and another sum of P10,000.00 each to
the heirs of said deceased as moral damages, to indemnify Lim <span class="SpellE">Katian</span> the sum of P3,000.00 for the </span><span style="">injuries he received and another sum of
P3,000.00 as moral damages, to indemnify Lim Eng Yu the sum of P2,600.00, the
amount stolen, and to pay the costs.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In its Brief, the defense assigned two errors:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that the lower court erred in convicting the
accused and imposing on him the extreme penalty of death on the basis of his
coerced confession and his voluntary re-enactment of the crime charged; and
that the lower court erred in ignoring the defense of alibi, notwithstanding
its finding that there was no identification what­soever that the accused
committed the crime charged.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense pointed out that the Court of First <span class="GramE">Instance,</span> Branch I, of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
Occidental acquitted <span class="SpellE">Caramonte</span> in Criminal Case No.
690 for the robbery at <st1:place><st1:placename>Cadiz</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defense claimed that the prosecution, in
spite of the judgment of acquittal in that case, is bent on securing <span class="SpellE">Caramonte's</span> conviction.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It stressed that while the accused made a confession in Exhibit
"F", he ini­tially denied participation in the robberies in Exhibit
"G".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It argued that it should
be Exhibit "G" and not Exhibit "F" which should be accepted
because Exhibit "G" was subscribed earlier - some three days after <span class="SpellE">Caramonte's</span> arrest - on <st1:date year="1968" day="23" month="1">January 23, 1968</st1:date>; while Exhibit "F" was
subscribed later, on <st1:date year="1968" day="2" month="2">February 2, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why did <span class="SpellE">Caramonte</span>
deny his guilt in the first affidavit and then some days later repudiate that
document and admit his participa­tion in the <span class="SpellE">Toboso</span>
robbery? The defense claims that the answer lies in the "intensive
investigation" conducted by Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span> for
the intervening days that <span class="SpellE">Caramonte</span> was detained.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue on appeal hinges on the validity of the extra­judicial
confession made by the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Rules of Court, Rule 130, <span class="GramE">Section</span> 29 provides:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The declaration of an accused expressly
acknowledging his guilt of the offense charged, may be given as evidence
against him." But following the time-honored <u>caveat,</u> it has been
constantly held that when the accused successfully proves that a confession was
given as a result of violence, intimidation, threat, or promise of a reward or
leniency, the confession becomes inadmissible.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Court is ever cogni­zant of the time-honored admonition that
confessions, especially those made extra-judicially, should be carefully
scrutinized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court does not accept
confessions readily, because experience has shown that some law officers are
not above extorting confes­sions through violence and intimidation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the true test of admissibility is that
the confession is made freely and voluntarily.</p>

<p class="BODY">But the rule is that a confession is presumed to be voluntary
until the contrary is proved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
defense has the burden to show that the confession is involuntary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Generally, the question of admissibility of
extra-judicial confessions is necessarily addressed to the sound discretion of
the judge, and since such discretion must be controlled by all the attendant
circumstances, the courts have wisely forborne to mark with absolute precision
any rules limiting the admission or exclusion of such testimony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their admissibility must depend largely in
each case upon the facts and circumstances surrounding the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(US vs. De Leon and De
Leon, No. 9656, August 20, 1914, 27 Phil. 506).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">In determining whether a confession is voluntary or not, the age,
character and situation of the accused at the time it was made are important
elements <span style="">i</span>n the consideration of
the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Much depends upon the
intelligence of the accused or want <span style="">of </span>it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="">defendant
</span>must realize the importance of his act.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The accused was 37 years old and a college degree-holder at that time<span style=""> he gave </span>his confession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not only <span class="GramE">that he was</span>
a responsible public offi­cial, having been newly elected municipal
councilor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even <span style="">counsel </span>for the accused stresses his strong character by
emphasizing that although born to poverty, he rose above the handicap of his
eco­nomic position to claim moderate success in his professional life.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused made numerous corrections on Exhibits "F",
and "G" and “H” in front of the municipal judges before whom they
were subscribed and sworn to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
corrections embody information best known only to the accused, and it is
improbable that coercion wrung them out of him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, testimony of the accused that his confession was not voluntary
can not prevail as against that of a justice of the peace to the effect that
the confession was volunta­rily signed in his presence (People vs. Cabrera, No.
<span class="GramE">L-1311, </span><st1:date year="1949" day="25" month="2"><span class="GramE">February 25, 1949</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 82 Phil.
839; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Baluran</span>, No.</span> <span class="GramE">L-28582, </span><st1:date year="1970" day="25" month="3"><span class="GramE">March 25, 1970</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 32 SCRA 71.)</span>
The accused contends that we should disbelieve Exhibit "F" because in
an earlier affidavit, Exhibit "G"; he denied his participation in the
<span class="SpellE">Toboso</span> robbery.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But a variation in the declaration of a witness is not always sufficient
to discredit his testimony (US vs. <span class="SpellE">Briones</span>, No. 9589,
November 12, 1914, 28 Phil. 367).</p>

<p class="BODY">Parenthetically, Exhibit "G" - the validity of which
the defense presses on this Court - indicates certain aspects of the character
and personality of the accused <span class="SpellE">Caramonte</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For one, it appears that he knew his
acquaintance <span class="SpellE">Isabelo</span> <span class="SpellE">Montemayor</span>
was wanted by the authorities for past robberies committed in 1962 and 1966;
yet, although they both resided at <span class="SpellE">Botiguez</span> <span class="GramE">island</span>, <span class="SpellE">Caramonte</span> <span style="">did </span>not report <span class="SpellE">Montemayor's</span>
presence to the authori­ties at <span class="SpellE">Bantayan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For another, it appears that on <st1:date year="1967" day="30" month="12">December 30, 1967</st1:date> at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="17">5:00</st1:time> <span style="">p.
</span>m.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Caramonte</span>
was present while <span class="SpellE">Montemayor's</span> group planned the
robbery at <st1:city><st1:place>Cadiz</st1:place></st1:city> city.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead of dissuading them, <span class="SpellE">Caramonte</span> said: "It's up to you.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For me I have a different life already."
The <span class="GramE">clause "I have a different life already" -
which appear</span> several times in the affidavit - implies an unsavory aspect
of <span class="SpellE">Caramonte's</span> personal history antecedent to the
instant case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, it appears that
although <span class="SpellE">Caramonte</span> was privy to the plans for the
raid at <st1:place><st1:placename>Cadiz</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
he did not attempt to stave off the crime by reporting it to the authorities in
that city.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the handwritten correction
marked as Exhibit "G-9", <span class="SpellE">Caramonte</span> added
the explanation that his failure to make a report was due <span style="">to </span>fear of fatal reprisal at the hands
of the conspirators.</p>

<p class="BODY">It has been held that conflicting confessions can not be a ground
for acquitting the defendant, for if a confession could be rejected on such
ground, all that would be necessary in any case to dispense with a damaging
confession would be for an accused to tell another story out of harmony with
the preceding one (US vs. Acacia, No. 12875, October <span style="">26, 1917, 37 Phil. 71).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And when
</span>extra-judicial confession is followed by a re-enactment of the crime by
the accused himself in accordance with his confession, such confession may be
deemed voluntary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(PP.
vs. <span class="SpellE">Conde</span>, L-2921, June 27, 1951, 89 Phil. 298).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether or not a confession is voluntary
depends upon the credibility of the witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This matter lies within the special competence of the trial court whose
conclusion concerning the credibility of witnesses will not be disturbed by the
appellate court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(PP. vs. <span class="SpellE">Pereto</span>, L-20894, December 29, 1967, 21 SCRA 1469; PP. vs. <span class="SpellE">Secapuri</span>, L-17518-19, February 28, 1966, 16 SCRA 199; PP.
vs. <span class="SpellE">Pasiona</span>, L-18295, February 28, 1966, 16 SCRA 212;
PP. vs. <span class="SpellE">Quintab</span>, L-21417, January 31, 1966, 16 SCRA
146)</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court was convinced that the extra-judicial confession
of the accused was a truthful emanation from a man resigned to his fate because
of the seeming lack of help from his friends and associates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court noted that when <span class="SpellE">Caramonte</span>
was arrested at <span class="SpellE">Botiguez</span> <span class="GramE">island</span>,
he requested that the arresting party pass <span class="SpellE">Bantayan</span>,
in order to seek aid from his family and some town officials.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But no help issued, and on that day <span class="SpellE">Caramonte</span> was brought to <st1:city><st1:place>Cadiz</st1:place></st1:city>
city, where he was detained for several days.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>During this period <span style="">of </span>waiting,
<span class="SpellE">Caramonte</span> gradually lost faith that help would ever
be forthcoming.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this state of mind,
he executed his extra-judicial confession.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was so resigned to retribution that on <st1:date year="1968" day="28" month="1">January 28, 1968</st1:date>, he sent a collect telegram (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 24) to a certain Mrs. Myrna <span class="SpellE">Surmillion</span>
stating:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"No need of counsel, I'm
happy to die; only God's justice for me." The upshot of this telegram was
that on the next day, counsel did arrive at <st1:city><st1:place>Cadiz</st1:place></st1:city>
city.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But this form of succor came too
late, for <span class="SpellE">Caramonte</span> had already signed his
extra-judicial confession.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense of alibi is traditionally received by the courts with
less than cordiality, for it is easily concocted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this case, the alibi of the accused can
not prevail over his voluntary confession contained in Exhibits "F"
and "H".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is evident that
his alibi is a last-ditch effort to salvage what, in a moment of truth, he has
voluntarily ad­mitted as to his criminal participation.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court finds the appellant guilty as
charged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The penalty for the crime is
death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, for lack of the
necessary number of required votes, the decision appealed from is modified in
respect of the principal penalty to <u><span style="">reclusion</span></u><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span></span>
but affirmed in all other respects.</p>
