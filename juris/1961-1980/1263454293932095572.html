				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petition for writ of certiorari to review and set aside the
decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>
del Norte, in Civil Case No. 1435, for injunction.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record shows that on <st1:date year="1963" day="7" month="3">March
 7, 1963</st1:date>, Guadalupe C. <span class="SpellE">Adaza</span>, then
Provincial Governor of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> <span class="GramE">del</span>
Norte, instituted Administrative Case No. 3 against Roberto P. <span class="SpellE">Poculan</span> who was <span style="">then
</span>serving on his first term <span style="">of
office </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">muni­cipal </span>mayor of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del <span style="">Norte, charg</span><span style="color: windowtext;">ing the latter with abuse of authority, oppression </span><span style="color: windowtext;">and maladministration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>B</span><span style="color: windowtext;">asis for the charge was </span><span style="color: windowtext;">an incident that took place on February 23, 1963, dur­ing
which, allegedly, the mayor, "with grave abuse of authority and taking
advantage of his position, with intent to oppress, did then and there, <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>, illegally, and feloniously, assault, maul and
attack with the use of his fist and a home-made gun, locally known as ‘<span class="SpellE">paliuntod</span>’, one ANTONIO ARAPOC," inflict­ing upon him
physical injuries which caused his death two days later.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style="color: windowtext;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the same day, Governor <span class="SpellE">Adaza</span> issued
Execu­tive Order No. 1, ordering the suspension from office of Mayor <span class="SpellE">Poculan</span> for thirty days, pursuant to sections 2188-2189 of
the Revised Administrative Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
the lapse of said period of suspension, however, the mayor was reinstated.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the close of Mayor <span class="SpellE">Poculan's</span> term of
office, the administrative case against him was still pending, the Provincial
Board having failed to act upon it to its finality.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then <span class="GramE">came</span> the 1963 local elections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Poculan</span> was
reelected mayor of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Rizal</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Felipe <span class="SpellE">Azcuna</span> was
elected governor, replacing <span class="SpellE">Adaza</span>, and there was also
a change in the composition of the Provincial Board.</p>

<p class="BODY">The new members of the Provincial Board pro­ceeded to investigate
the administrative case against <span class="SpellE">Poculan</span>, and on
February 14, 1964, rendered decision and passed Resolution No. 42-A, ordering
his suspen­sion for a period of two years.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The decision was appealed by the Mayor to the President on March 6 of
that year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On March 13, the Provincial
Governor issued Executive Order No. 7 implementing Resolution No. 42-A,
designating the Vice Mayor to act <span style="">as </span>Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same day also, the governor directed
the commander of the Philippine Constabulary unit de­tailed in the province to
serve his order upon the suspended Mayor.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, Mayor <span class="SpellE">Poculan</span> had filed with
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del Norte an
action for Prohibition, later amended, for Certiorari and Mandamus, with
Preliminary Mandatory and Prohibi­tory Injunction, to restrain the Provincial
Board <span style="color: windowtext;">from enforcing
its resolution. The petition, however, was dismissed on the ground, among
others, that it was not the proper remedy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Whereupon, Mayor <span class="SpellE">Poculan</span> filed the
present action for Injunction, praying once more that the Provincial Board <span class="GramE">be</span> restrained from enforcing its order of sus­pension.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As prayed for, a preliminary injunction writ
was issued at the commencement of the proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was submitted for decision on the
pleadings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On July 3, 1964, the court,
finding the petition to be meritorious, rendered judgment declaring null and
void <span style="">the Board</span>'s<span style=""> </span>resolution suspending the Mayor, on
the principle that his reelection had purged him of the administrative charges
filed against him during his first term of office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Motion for reconsideration of the decision
having been denied, the Provincial Board filed the instant petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue raised in this appeal is whether or not the Provincial
Board of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del Norte may proceed with the
administrative investigation of reelected mayor Roberto P. <span class="SpellE">Poculan</span>
for misconduct, allegedly com­<span style="">mitted by
the latter during his prior term of office.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to Section 2188 of the Revised Adminis­trative Code,
municipal officers may be dealt with ad­ministratively for "neglect of
duty, oppression, corruption, or other form <span style="">of maladministration of office, </span>and conviction by final judgment
of any crime involving moral turpitude." It will be noted that, for crimes
involving moral turpitude, the law requires, not only a <u style="">judgment</u> of conviction, but, also, that the same be <u style="">final</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering that the alleged illegal killing of Antonio <span class="SpellE">Arapoc</span> by respondent <span class="SpellE">Poculan</span> is
not essentially connected with the performance of the official duties of the
latter, it is clear, therefore, that the Provincial Board of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> cannot administratively proceed against him until
after a judgment of conviction shall have been rendered by a court of justice
and said judg­ment has become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner herein does not claim and the
records do not show that there is such a final judgment against respondent <span class="SpellE">Poculan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that the administrative charge against him alleges
"grave abuse of authority" and "intent to oppress"; but,
these averments refer to the conditions under which the crime imputed to <span class="SpellE">Poculan</span> has allegedly been committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are part and parcel of the com<span style="color: windowtext;">mission
of said offense, and, as such, should be pass­ed upon in the corresponding
criminal case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, they may, if
established, affect the imposable penalty.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As a consequence, the administrative proceeding based upon said
"abuse" and "intent" must, like the proceed­ing for the
offense itself, be deferred until after the rendition of final judgment in the
criminal case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There is no merit in petitioner's contention that the court <u style="">a</u> <u style="">quo</u>
should have declined to pass upon the decision of the provincial board in view
of the appeal of said decision to the office of the President which is still
pending - in other words, that the mayor failed to exhaust all administrative
remedies before bringing his case to court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The principle of exhaustion of ad­ministrative remedies does not
necessarily apply in <span style="">cases </span>where
the <span style="">question </span>in dispute is
purely a legal one and nothing of an administrative nature is to be or can be
done,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
or where circumstances are such that said remedies would be completely futile
and meaningless.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
As adverted to above, the act of the Provincial Board in taking cognizance of
and resolving Administrative Case No. 3 is unjustified.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>Accordingly</b>, the decision of the lower court is hereby
affirmed, and the petition for certiorari, denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs at this instance</p>
