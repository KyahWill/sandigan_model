				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In a sworn letter complaint dated October 5, 1972, addressed to
the President of the Philippines and to the Secretary of Justice, <span class="SpellE">Custodio</span> <span class="SpellE">Escabillas</span> charged
respond足ent municipal judge, Luis D. Martinez, of <span class="SpellE">Hagonoy</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Davao</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> with gross
misconduct in office and gross ignorance of the law, by extending the terms of
a lease contract in defiance of the verdict of this Court; and unreasonable
delay and palpable incompetence for deliberate failure to decide Civil Case No.
261 within 90 days after the same was submitted for decision, in violation of
Section 5, R.A. 296, otherwise known as the Judiciary Act of 1948 in relation
to Section 70 of the Rules of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Complainant, <span class="SpellE">Custodio</span> <span class="SpellE">Escabillas</span>, purchased two parcels of land, lots A and B,
from spouses Pedro N. de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes and Beatriz <span class="SpellE">Torrecampo</span> on <st1:date year="1970" day="7" month="1">January
 7, 1970</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Corresponding
Transfer Certificates of Title regarding said two lots were issued by the
Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>
in the name of the complainant, <span class="SpellE">Custodio</span> <span class="SpellE">Esca足billas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
A is covered by TCT No. T-3539 with an annotation at its back of the lease
contract entered into by its former owners, Pedro N. de <span class="SpellE">los</span>
Reyes and Beatriz <span class="SpellE">Torrecampo</span> with the <span class="SpellE">Bangayans</span> in 1963.</p>

<p class="BODY">Previous to the said sale, lots A and B were the subject matter
of Civil Case No. 4939 where the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> thru the late Judge <span class="SpellE">Manases</span>
Reyes upheld in its decision dated May 15, 1969, the right of spouses Reyes and
<span class="SpellE">Torrecampo</span> to repurchase the said lots from the <span class="SpellE">Bangayans</span> with a directive that the unexpired period of the
lease contract between the contending parties regarding lot A should be
respected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequent to this directive
of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, Pedro de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes and
Beatriz <span class="SpellE">Torrecampo</span> together with complainant, <span class="SpellE">Custodio</span> <span class="SpellE">Escabillas</span>, filed on
April 30, 1970, a motion for the clarification of the judgment of May 15, 1969
regarding the expiry date of the lease contract and for a directive to cancel
the lease of lot A.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same date, <span class="SpellE">Custodio</span> <span class="SpellE">Escabillas</span> filed a
petition for cancellation of encumbrance appearing <span class="GramE">in</span>
TCT No. <span class="GramE">T-3539 which was docketed as Miscellaneous Case No.
67 in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> issued its Order of <st1:date year="1970" day="20" month="5">May 20, 1970</st1:date>, entitled "IN RE:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>PETITION FOR CANCELLATION OF ENCUMBRANCE
APPEARING ON TCT NO. T-3539 - CUSTODIO ESCABILLAS, Applicant", where it
explicitly stated that the lease contract in favor of defendants <span class="SpellE">Bangayans</span>, as found in the decision in Civil Case No. 4939,
expired on April 15, 1970; and thereupon, authorized the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, upon payment of
necessary fees, to cancel the annotation regarding the lease in favor of <span class="SpellE">Lino</span> <span class="SpellE">Bangayan</span> from TCT <span style="">No. </span><span class="GramE">T-3539.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the same order, complainant was directed
to file an action for illegal <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> against the <span class="SpellE">Bangayans</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Order of <st1:date year="1970" day="20" month="5">May 20,
 1970</st1:date>, was appealed to the Supreme Court by way of review on <i>certiorari</i>
and pending resolution of the same by this Court, complainant herein filed on <st1:date year="1971" day="13" month="8">August 13, 1971</st1:date>, an action for
unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> against the <span class="SpellE">Bangayans</span>
in the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Hagonoy</span>, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>
case was dismissed by respondent judge for being premature.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile on <st1:date year="1971" day="3" month="8">August 3,
 1971</st1:date>, the Supreme Court denied the petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>
filed by the <span class="SpellE">Bangayans</span> and a subsequent amended
petition was likewise denied <span style="">by </span>this
Tribunal on <st1:date year="1971" day="5" month="10">October 5, 1971</st1:date>
for "lack of merit".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, complainant <span class="SpellE">Custodio</span> <span class="SpellE">Escabillas</span> filed Civil Case No. 261 for unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> involving the same property against the <span class="SpellE">Bangayans</span> before the <span class="SpellE">sala</span> of the
respondent judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case underwent
trial and its last hearing was terminated on <st1:date year="1972" day="3" month="3">March 3, 1972</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1972" day="31" month="8">August 31, 1972</st1:date>, the respondent judge
rendered his deci足sion by ordering the <span class="SpellE">Bangayans</span> to
surrender lot A to the complainant after the former shall have collected from
the latter the amount of P9<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>; to pay P1,000.00
as attorney's fees and P200.00 as representation expenses.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The said decision of the
respondent judge became the subject matter of the present administrative action
filed by <span class="SpellE">Custodio</span> <span class="SpellE">Escabillas</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Complainant claims that the respondent judge acted with gross
misconduct in office and gross ignorance of law when he extended the terms of
an expired lease contract, in defiance of the order of this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have succinctly evaluated the record of this case and find
that there is no truth to complainant's assertion that the respondent judge
extended the terms of an expired lease contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence discloses that the respondent
did not in any manner alter or modify the terms of the said contract which had
been held to have expired on April <span style="">15,
1970 by the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of
fact, the respondent judge, in his decision in Civil Case No. 261, vehemently
refused to interfere with the terms of the lease contract on the ground that he
had no authority to intervene in an issue which had already become final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus he said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The most important question to be resolved by this Court is
whether the lease contract expired on <st1:date year="1970" day="15" month="4">April
 15, 1970</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While defendants
claim that the lease contract will expire on December 11, 1975 since the period
from 1964 when he purchased the land up to 1969 when it was repurchased should
not be included in the lease contract during the said period as he was
occupying the land as an owner and not as a lessee, this Court cannot find
justification to such contention on account of the finality of the Order of the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> (Branch V), the <span class="SpellE">dis足positive</span>
portion of which reads thus -</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'Wherefore, the court holds that lease in favor of the defendants,
as found in Civil Case No. 4939, expired on April 15, 1970, and hereby authorized
the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, upon payment of the necessary fees, to cancel the
annotation regarding the lease in favor of <span class="SpellE">Lino</span> <span class="SpellE">Bangayan</span> from Transfer Certificate of Title No. 3539.'</p>

<blockquote>"The aforesaid order having become final, same became the law
on the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court is therefore
devoid of any authority to alter or amend much less reverse said Order having
been affirmed by the Honorable Supreme Court."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The charge of gross misconduct in office and ignorance of law
filed against the respondent judge is therefore clearly without merit.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On the charge of
unreasonable delay and palpable incompetence for deliberate failure to dispose
of </span>Civil <span style="">Case </span>No. <span style="">261 within the 90 day period, the record
shows that the said case was submitted for decision on March 3, 1972 and it was
finally decided by the respondent on August 31, 1972 or more than five months
after the same was submitted for decision.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It then appears that the respondent </span>judge violated the ninety day
period provided for by Section 5, R.A. No. 296 within which to decide a case
submitted before him for decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent judge attributes the delay in disposing of said Civil
Case No. 261 to its voluminous records which he claims needed a proper and
prudent evaluation in resolving the issues posed therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is no defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We cannot ignore nor countenance such
inaction of the respondent for more than five months.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For surely, this would defeat the very
purpose and spirit of Section 5, R.A. No. 296, which is for a speedy
administration of justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A judge
should be prompt in the performance of his judicial duties for delay in the
administration of justice is a common complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in an earlier case this Court said:</p>

<blockquote>"Much of the popular criticism of the courts, which must be
frankly admitted is all too often justified, is based on the laws' delay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Congested condition of the courts docket is
deplorable and intolerable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It can have
no other result than the loss of evidence, the abandonment of cases, and denial
and frequent defeat of justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It lowers
the standard of the courts, and brings them into disrepute." <span class="GramE">(In re Impeachment of <span class="SpellE">Flordeliza</span>, 44
Phil. 608).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is, therefore, for a good reason that judges are enjoined to
strictly comply with the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period of 90
days in disposing of a case submitted for decision.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">, </span>finding the charge of gross
misconduct in office and ignorance of law to be without merit, we hereby
dismiss the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Respondent
Judge, however, having been found to have violated the provisions of Section 5,
R.A 296, otherwise known as the Judiciary Act of 1948, is hereby <span style="">REPRIMANDED </span>and enjoined to strictly
comply with the provisions of said Act.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Let a <span style="">copy </span>of this
resolution be spread in his record.</p>
