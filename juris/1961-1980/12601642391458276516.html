				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Sometime in 1956 a dispute arose between petitioner Benguet Consolidated, 
Inc. and respondent Coto Labor Union (NLU) concerning certain demands made by 
the latter. When the Secretary of Labor failed to settle the case amicably, he 
certified the same to the Court of Industrial Relations, which was docketed as 
Case No. 1029-V, and immediately it was taken cognizance of by its presiding 
judge, Hon. Jose S. Bautista.
<p>Shortly thereafter, petitioner filed a motion to dismiss on the ground of 
lack of jurisdiction for the reason that the case having been endorsed by the 
Secretary of Labor pursuant to Section 16 (<i>c</i>) of the Minimum Wage Law, it 
should be heard not by a single judge but by the court <i>en banc</i>. 
Respondent judge denied the motion, and its appeal to the court <i>en banc</i> 
having been denied, petitioner elevated the case to us which led this Court to 
promulgate a decision on May 29, 1959 in G. R. No. L-12394,<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[*]</sup></span> the pertinent portion of which reads as 
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We agree with the claim of petitioner that whenever the Secretary of Labor 
endorses a dispute to the Court of Industrial Relations concerning a demand for 
minimum wage which involved an actual strike, the same should bo acted upon by 
the court <i>en banc</i> as provided for by law [Section 16 (c), Republic Act 
602], but this claim is now of no consequence it appearing that the decision of 
Judge Bautista was <i>affirmed</i> by the court <i>en 
banc</i>."</p></blockquote>
<p>Upon the receipt of our decision denying said petition, the trial judge set 
the case for hearing on July 29, 1960. Six days before the scheduled trial, 
however, petitioner found that no formal complaint and answer were filed therein 
and so it moved for postponement of the trial stating that the filing of said 
pleadings is necessary in order that the issues may be properly joined. Again, 
on July 26, 1960, petitioner filed a supplemental motion calling the attention 
of respondent judge to the ruling of this Court in the above-cited case (G. R. 
No. L-12394) that this controversy can only be acted upon by the court <i>en 
banc</i>, and not by him alone; so that if the calendar of the court would not 
permit a hearing of the case <i>en banc</i>, the same should be postponed. 
Respondent judge denied both motions on July 27, 1960, and pending determination 
of petitioner's urgent motion for reconsideration before the court <i>en 
banc</i>, the former proceeded with the trial manifesting that he will receive 
the.evidence only as a trial court or representative of the court <i>en 
banc</i>. This move of respondent judge prompted petitioner to interpose the 
present petition raising as main issue whether the case can be heard by a single 
judge or by the court <i>en banc</i> only.</p>
<p>As held by us in the former controversy between the same parties, in cases of 
this nature the industrial court shall act <i>en banc</i> in rendering the 
decision as provided by Section 16 (<i>c</i>) of Republic Act 602. But this does 
not necessarily mean that all the judges should sit for the reception of the 
evidence, or that the evidence should be received by the court <i>en banc</i>. 
It is enough that one judge be assigned to receive the evidence who will submit 
his report to the court <i>en banc</i> for deliberation and decision. To 
literally interpret the law as petitioner wants us to do, that is, to have all 
the judges sit during the trial, would not only be cumbersome and inexpeditious 
but will jeopardize the functions of the other judges in trying the cases 
pending before them. This cannot be the intendment of the law.</p>
<p>Anent the contention of petitioner that a formal complaint and answer should 
first be filed before proceeding with the trial in order that the issues may be 
properly joined, suffice it to state that such is unnecessary for when the 
Secretary of Labor certified the case to the industrial court he already 
specified in his certification the points he wanted to be passed upon by the 
court. What is important is to have the case set for hearing immediately in 
order that it may be decided within the period prescribed by law.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span></p>
<p>Wherefore, petition is denied. The order appealed from is affirmed, without 
costs. The preliminary injunction issued by this Court is hereby 
dissolved.</p><i>Bengzon, C.J., Padilla, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., 
Barrera, Paredes,</i> and <i>Dizon, JJ.,</i> concur. <br><br><br>
