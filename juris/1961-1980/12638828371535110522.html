The complaint charging the accused with rape was not filed until <st1:date year="1971" day="5" month="5">May 5, 1971</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was alleged in the complaint that the

month.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Her sister, who was another maid in the same

She stayed in the same house­hold for one more year, but the wife of the

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The lack of credibility
of certain assertions made by her on the witness stand that cast grave doubts
on her accusation was noted in the manifestation of the Acting Solicitor
General.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The most notable instance of
the improbable character of her version of what transpired was the long delayed
birth of the child arising from the alleged act of rape long after the
nine-month usual period of pregnancy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
set forth therein:<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>"From the
month of February, 1970, the starting period of her conception of a child,
after her alleged sexual intercourse with the appellant during the last week of
<span style="">January, 1970, there is a supervening
period of fifteen (15) months, more or less:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This Honorable Court made the correct observation that 'the average
duration of human pregnancy, counting from the first day of menstrual period,
is about two hundred eighty days or forty weeks' (People v. Castro, 58 SCRA
473, quoting William's <span class="SpellE">Obstretrics</span>, 14th Ed., p.
236), which is about nine complete months.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Even the complainant herself, already 22 years old when she testified in
the court below * * * declared that she knows that it takes nine (9) months for
a fetus to stay in the womb of a mother * * *.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There may be pre­mature births of seven-month old or eight-month old
babies, but it is biologically improbable for a baby to overstay in the womb of
its mother, even if already dead, for more than </span><span style="">six </span><span style="">(6) months.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In her effort to explain thin biological
improbability, complainant made additional declarations which only produced
further improbable situations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>[Here
reference was made to her </span>admission <span style="">that she gave birth in October, 1970 and then on </span><st1:date year="1971" day="14" month="4"><span style="">April
 14, 1971</span></st1:date><span style="">.] Granting
that she gave birth to a baby in October, 1970, which is well within the
nine-month period of pregnancy, </span><span style="">counting
</span><span style="">from her last menstrual period
in February, 1970, it is biologically improbable for her to give another birth
on the fifth month, or on April 14, 1971, counting from her alleged last birth
of a baby in October, 1970.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If her
declaration that she gave birth to a baby in October, 1970, allegedly fathered
by the appellant, at a time when she was still staying in the house of the
appellant as the family's housemaid, were true, there would have been a big
family scandal."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In addition to certain
admissions already noted, there were others, equally damaging to the
prosecution, elicited during a rather searching cross-examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When asked whether or not her failure to
reveal the alleged rape to her parents was "because Jesus <span class="SpellE">Nazareno</span> never forced you to have intercourse with
him,"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> her answer was categorical:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Yes, sir."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> On the occasion of the alleged first time
she was subjected to sexual abuse and upon receiving the answer from her that
there was penetration, the matter was sought to be clarified further with the
query of whether it was due to the fact that she "did not put up any
resistance."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Again, the reply was:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Yes, sir."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">A subsequent question was whether she
"readily submitted to him."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Again, </span><span style="">she </span><span style="">replied:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Yes, sir."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> It was a rather severe cross-examination to
which she was subjected and unfortunately for her cause she was quite
candid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus she did admit likewise that
she did not move at all in order to avoid penetration.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> She even went to the extent of replying
affirmatively to the question of "whether she enjoyed the whole sexual
act."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> As regard her testimony that there was
another rape on the last week of January, 1970, again, the searching
cross-examination under which she was subjected elicited such answers as her
having really wanted it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court failed to take into consideration the <span class="SpellE">uncontradicted</span> testimony of the appellant favorable to
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It believed that it was his threat
as "a possessor of a .22 caliber revolver Magnum with <span style="">six </span>live bullets"<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
that enabled him to perpetrate the act without resistance on her part, when
according to evidence not refuted under questioning by the trial judge himself,
the license for such a firearm was acquired for the first time in 1971.<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
Moreover, it was the trial judge who, likewise, in the course of his questioning
the appellant, ascertained the fact that his wife was a classroom teacher, her
school located one kilometer away from the house but returning every noontime
to take her lunch, her afternoon class being only from the hours <st1:time minute="58" hour="14">two to three</st1:time>.<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>
It was at noontime on both occasions, the first week and the last week of
January, 1970, that allegedly complainant was subjected to sexual abuse by
appellant.<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Lastly, the lower court failed to take into account other
attendant circumstances which, if properly appraised, could have reinforced the
conclusion that the judgment should be one of acquittal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It suffices to mention one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are intimations in the record that
complainant was far from desirous of having appellant charged with this
offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her reluctance was duly noted
by his counsel, who made the observation that "in the first two hearings
conducted by the trial court <span style="">[complainant]
did not appear to testify on her own behalf.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In view of her absence during the trial, she was ordered arrested and
lodged in the municipal jail; </span>it was only then, after this apparent
compulsion, that she hesitantly testified against the accused."<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a>
Such an assertion finds confirmation in the records of the criminal case sent
to us by the lower court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It included an
order of arrest worded thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"[To
any officer of the law]:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You are hereby
commanded to arrest [<span class="SpellE">Rayda</span> <span class="SpellE">Aumada</span>]
who is said to be found at [<span class="SpellE">Calinaban</span>, <span class="SpellE">Baganga</span>, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Oriental] and who
has been charged before me with the offense (her failure to appear during the
trial on the aforesaid case) and bring her forthwith before me to be dealt with
according to law."<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It does clearly appear
therefore that the Office of the Solicitor General was left with no choice
except to recommend reversal of the appealed decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is to the credit of the then Acting
Solicitor General Vicente V. Mendoza and his associates that they took pains to
set forth in detail the weakness of the case for the prosecution which
unfortunately the lower court glossed over, thus ignoring the constitutional
presumption of innocence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>1. It is quite <u>apropos</u> therefore that the Manifestation
submitted by the then Acting Solicitor General Vicente V. Mendoza to quote this
relevant excerpt from the opinion of Justice <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>
in People v. <span class="SpellE">Maisug</span>:<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a>
"By and large, the evidence on record does not engender enough faith that
appellant is guilty of the charge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
somehow it is discernible that it is more the inadequacy of details in the
state's evidence that makes it difficult for Us to arrive at definite
conclusions rather than, perhaps, the actual facts themselves, still We cannot
pin responsibility on appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
moral conviction that may serve as basis of a finding of guilt in criminal
cases is only that which is the logical and inevitable result of the evidence on
record, exclusive of any other consideration.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Short of this, it is not only the right of the accused to be freed, it
is, even more, our constitutional duty to acquit him."<a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a>
Only thus may there be fealty to the constitutional presumption of
innocence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A recent restatement–of its
mandatory character may be found in People v. <span class="SpellE">Dramayo</span>:<a style="" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a>
"Only if the judge below and the appellate tribunal could arrive at a
conclusion that the crime had been committed precisely by the person on trial
under such an exacting test should the sentence be one of conviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is thus required that every circum­stance
favoring his innocence be duly taken into account.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The proof against him must survive the test
of reason; the strongest suspicion must not be permitted to sway judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The conscience must be satisfied that on the
defendant could be laid the responsibility for the offense charged; that not<span style=""> </span>only did he perpetrate the act but
that it amounted to a crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is
required then is moral certainty."<a style="" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>2. Two recent cases, as previously noted, where precisely the
acquittal in a prosecution for rape was based by this Court on the
constitutional presumption of innocence not having been overcome, was referred
to in the Manifestation:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>People v. Reyes
and People v. Lopez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The opening
paragraph of the opinion in the former was as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The state policy on the heinous offense
of rape is clear and unmistakable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Life
is made forfeit under certain circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At first blush, the harshness of the penalty may give cause for concern,
considering that by the very nature of its commission, it is both sordid and
joyless, the pleasure derived, if any, being minimal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be thereafter sentenced to a long period
of confinement, perhaps for the rest of one's life, even to suffer death may
appear excessive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, there is
sound reason for such severity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">It is an intrusion into the right of privacy,
an assault on human dignity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No legal
system worthy of the name can afford to ignore the traumatic consequences for
unfortunate victim and grievous injury to the peace and good order of the
community.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>* * * <span style="">Nonetheless, the seriousness with which the
state rightfully views the matter with the corresponding imposition of the
punish­ment that fits the crime calls for extreme care on the part of the
judiciary to avoid an injustice done to an accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For it is equally true that this is an
offense </span>to which, as is often the case, only two people can testify,
thus requiring the most conscientious effort on the part of the arbiter to weigh
and appraise the conflicting testimony.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If a reasonable doubt exists, the verdict must be one of
acquittal."<a style="" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></span></span></a>
In People v. Lopez, the opinion stressed:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"In the light of the credible and competent facts of record, this
Court cannot view the matter in the same way the lower court did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The state of moral certainty as to the guilt
of the accused was not reached.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * * <span style="">It </span>bears repeating likewise that in
reversing the appealed decision and acquitting the accused, this Court is not
insensible to the misfortune that befell the hapless complainant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As it was in the lower court, so here, there
is all the sympathy for her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She is more
to be pitied than censured."<a style="" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></span></span></a>
The last sentence is particularly appropriate.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The reality, the cold hard fact, was that she was the mother of an
unwanted child, in all probability conceived under circumstances where
undoubtedly her freedom of will could not have full play.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All that the reversal of <span style="">the </span>judgment signifies then, to stress
the matter anew, is that, as far as this particular complaint for rape was
concerned, there was failure of proof to satisfy the rigorous standard the law
exacts, compelled by the Constitution no less, to justify conviction.</blockquote>
