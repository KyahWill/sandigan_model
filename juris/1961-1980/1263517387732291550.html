				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Respondents-appellants seek to overturn the decision of the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> of January 6, 1966
granting petitioners-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>’ petition for relief
from judgment, setting aside the July 23, 1965 decision of the Municipal Court
of <span class="SpellE">Man­daluyong</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, in
Civil Case 1365 and ordering a new trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">The background facts are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="15" month="9">September 15, 1964</st1:date>,
the Ford truck of petitioner Roberto Tan Ting driven by <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span>
Bautista, the other petitioner, and the Volkswagen delivery panel truck owned
by respondent Federico O. <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span>, Inc. (hereinafter
called <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span>) were involved in a traffic accident
along <span class="SpellE">Epifanio</span> de <span class="SpellE">los</span> <st1:street><st1:address>Santos
  Avenue</st1:address></st1:street>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
said traffic accident, <span class="SpellE">Quintin</span> Delgado, a helper in <span class="SpellE">Borromeo's</span> delivery panel truck, sustained injuries which
resulted in his instantaneous death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span> had to pay Delgado's widow the sum of P4,444
representing the compensation (death benefit) and funeral expenses due Delgado
under the Workmen's Compensation Act.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="17" month="6">June 17, 1965</st1:date>,
upon the averment that the said vehicular accident was caused by petitioners'
negligence, <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span> started suit in the Municipal
Court of <span class="SpellE">Mandaluyong</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
to recover from petitioners the compensation and funeral expenses it paid to
the widow of <span class="SpellE">Quintin</span> Delgado.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">At the scheduled hearing of the case on <st1:date year="1965" day="23" month="7">July 23, 1965</st1:date>, neither petitioners nor their
counsel appeared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span>
was thus allowed to present its evidence <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same day, <st1:date year="1965" day="23" month="7">July 23, 1965</st1:date>, the municipal court rendered
judgment in favor of <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span> and against the
petitioners in the principal sum of P4,444, and P500 attorneys' fees, and
costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondents aver that this
judgment has been executed and satisfied.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="6" month="8">August 6, 1965</st1:date>,
petitioners received copy of the municipal court's decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="13" month="8">August 13, 1965</st1:date>,
petitioners moved to set aside the decision.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1965" day="14" month="8">August 14, 1965</st1:date>,
this motion was denied.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="16" month="8">August 16, 1965</st1:date>,
copy of this order of denial was sent by registered mail to counsel of petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said counsel did not receive this registered
mail and the mail matter was returned to the court unclaimed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, said counsel learned of this denial
on <st1:date year="1965" day="2" month="9">September 2, 1965</st1:date>
allegedly "in the course of his investi­gation."</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners filed a notice of appeal dated <st1:date year="1965" day="2" month="9">September 2, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They, however, paid the appellate docket fee and deposited their cash
appeal bond only on <st1:date year="1965" day="28" month="9">September 28, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their appeal was consequently turned down by
the municipal court, for the reason that the deposit of the bond and the
payment of the docket fee were done after the lapse of the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nothing was done by petitioners until <st1:date year="1965" day="26" month="10">October 26, 1965</st1:date>, when they lodged a <span style="">petition </span>for relief from the inferior
court's judgment in the Court of First instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
They there claimed excusable negligence for the failure of petitioners' counsel
to appear in the <st1:date year="1965" day="23" month="7">July 23, 1965</st1:date>
hearing at the municipal court and asserted that they had a good and
substantial defense in that "there was no contractual relationship between
the parties, whether ex­press or implied." They sought preliminary
injunction, prayed for trial <u>de</u> <u>novo</u> on the merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A restraining order was at first issued by
the court; but the prayer for preliminary injunction was eventually denied.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents' answer contended that the petition for relief was
filed out of time; that petitioner' counsel's failure to attend the hearing of <st1:date year="1965" day="23" month="7">July 23, 1965</st1:date> does not constitute
excusable negligence; and that the affidavits attached to the petition do not
show good and substantial defense.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners thereafter moved for judgment on the plead­ings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No objection thereto was interposed by
respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court then
rendered the judgment mentioned in the first part of this opinion.</p>

<p class="BODY">A move to reconsider failed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, this appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">We vote to reverse the lower court's judgment for the following
reasons:</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition for relief
from judgment under Rule 38 of the Rules of Court is unavailable to
petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">A basic precept is that when another remedy at law is open to a
party, he cannot sue out a petition for relief under Rule 38.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, a petition for relief is not a substitute for appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has been held that where a defendant could
have appealed - but did not appeal - from the decision of the inferior court to
the Court of First Instance but instead filed a petition for relief, his
petition was inappropriate as it "would amount to reviving his <span style="">right </span>to
appeal which he had irretrievably lost through the gross inaction of his
counsel."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Here, petitioners learned of the municipal court judgment on <st1:date year="1965" day="6" month="8">August 6, 1965</st1:date>, when they received a
copy of its decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They moved to set
aside that judgment on <st1:date year="1965" day="13" month="8">August 13, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that time, a petition for relief could not
be availed of because the judgment of the municipal court had not yet become
final.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
But, on <st1:date year="1965" day="2" month="9">September 2, 1965</st1:date>,
petitioners learned of the court's order of <st1:date year="1965" day="14" month="8">August 14, 1965</st1:date> denying their motion to set aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They could have appealed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because, <u>nothing</u> in the record
suggests that the <u>notices</u> to peti­tioners to take delivery of the
registered envelope - containing the inferior court's resolution denying
petitioners' motion to set aside the decision - <u>were</u> <u>ever</u> <u>served</u>
on said petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>, secretary of
petitioners' counsel, in her affidavit dated October 23, 1965, Annex E of the
petition for relief, categorically denied receipt of any such notice,
thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"That I have not received any
<span style="">registry </span>notice corresponding
to a registered mail at the Manila Post Office containing an order by the
Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Mandaluyong</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
dated August 14, 1965."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">But petitioners did not perfect their appeal to the Court of
First Instance on time - they paid the appellate docket fee and deposited their
appeal bond only on September 28, eleven (11) days late.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clearly, their failure to seasonably appeal
was through their own fault.</p>

<p class="BODY">And, when they did file a petition for relief on October 26,
1965, it was way beyond the sixty-day period from August 6, 1965, the time they
first learned of the judgment to be set aside, as required by Section 3, Rule
38 of the Rules of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">We, accordingly, rule that petitioners' petition for relief must
fail.</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners failed to
make out a case of excusable neg­ligence for counsel's non-attendance at the <st1:date year="1965" day="23" month="7">July 23, 1965</st1:date> hearing.</p>

<p class="BODY">Their counsel, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Leopoldo</span> V. <span class="SpellE">Repotente</span>, Jr., explains his failure to attend the hearing
in this wise - "he relied on the assurance of his associate, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Lucenito</span> N. <span class="SpellE">Tag<span style="">le</span></span><span style="">,</span> that the latter will attend to the
case for him since on that same date <u>he</u> (Atty. <span class="SpellE">Repotente</span>)
<u>had</u> <u>another</u> case before the City Court of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City." In his sworn statement, <span style="">Atty.
</span><span class="SpellE">Tagle</span> in turn stated that he was unable to
attend the hearing despite his promise to do so because, in his own words,
"when I transferred to my new office at A &amp; T Building <span class="SpellE">Escolta</span>, Manila, the record of this case was misplaced,
mislaid or otherwise lost by my helpers and was not among those turned over to
my possession" and "it was only a few days after the date of hearing
on July 23, 1965, that I found the record of this case in one of the drawers of
my table in <span style="">my </span>former office
and it was only then that I realized my failure to attend the hearing on July
23, 1965, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</p>

<p class="BODY">We cannot view such negligence of petitioners' two attorneys as
excusable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no plausible reason
for <span class="SpellE">Repotente</span> to entrust the hearing of the case to
another lawyer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His lame excuse was that
he requested <span class="SpellE">Tagle</span> to attend the hearing of said case
for him because he had another hearing at the City Court of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is unworthy of serious
consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, as respondents aver
- and this is not denied by petitioners - the hearing of <st1:date year="1965" day="23" month="7">July 23, 1965</st1:date> before the municipal court was set
in open court during the initial date of hearing held on <st1:date year="1965" day="1" month="7">July 1, 1965</st1:date> <u>after</u> Atty. <span class="SpellE">Repotente</span> consulted his calendar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Repotente</span>
agreed <span style="">in </span>open court to set the
trial of the case for <st1:date year="1965" day="23" month="7">July 23, 1965</st1:date>,
it may very well be presumed that his other case in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city> was not yet calendared
for hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He could not have, in good
faith, agreed to set the case for hearing on the day on which he had another
previously scheduled trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further, he
failed to notify his clients of the hearing set for <st1:date year="1965" day="23" month="7">July 23, 1965</st1:date>; they also failed to appear
thereat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, <span class="SpellE">Repotente's</span>
inadvertence cannot be labeled as excusable.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nor may Atty. <span class="SpellE">Tagle</span> offer as excuse the
fact that the record of the case "was misplaced, mislaid or otherwise
lost".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is a stereotyped
excuse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is resorted to by lawyers in
order to win new trial of the case and thereby move farther away the day of
reckoning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be remembered is that the
life of each case is in its record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
the record of the case was misplaced, mislaid or lost, he should have nevertheless
attended the scheduled hearing and requested for a postponement by reason
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But he did not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appropriate it is to recall here that a
prudent lawyer <u>keeps</u> <u>a</u> <u>separate</u> <u>record</u> <u>or</u> <u>diary</u>
<u>of</u> <u>hearings</u> of cases he handles and of his professional
engagements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A lawyer's schedules of
hearings - intended as a reminder - are not noted by the lawyer in his record
of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That would be useless for
the purpose.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is then no excusable negligence to which the peti­tion for
relief can cling.</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even on the merits,
petitioners' case must fall.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span> paid the widow of its
employee, <span class="SpellE">Quintin</span> Delgado, compensation (death
benefit) and funeral expenses for the latter's death while in the course of
employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This obligation arises from
law - Section 2 of the Workmen's Compensation Act.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
The same law in its Section 6 also provides that "[<span class="SpellE">i</span>]n
case an employee suffers an injury for which compensation is due under this Act
by any other person besides his employer, it shall be optional with such
injured employee either to claim compensation from his employer, under this
Act, or sue such other person for damages, in accordance with law; <u>and</u> <u>in</u>
<u>case</u> <u>compensation</u> <u>is</u> <u>claimed</u> <u>and</u> <u>allowed</u>
<u>in</u> <u>accordance</u> <u>with</u> <u>this</u> <u>Act</u>, <u>the</u> <u>employer</u>

<p class="BODY">It is evident from the foregoing that "if compensation is
claimed and awarded, and the employer pays <span style="">it, </span>the employer becomes subrogated to and acquires, by
operation of law, the worker's rights against the <span class="SpellE">tortfeasor</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">No need then there is to establish any contractual rela­tionship
between <span class="SpellE">Quintin</span> Delgado and herein petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, there is none.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The cause of action of respondent corporation
is one which does not spring from a creditor-debtor relationship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It arises by virtue of <span style="">its subrogation </span>to the right of <span class="SpellE">Quintin</span> Delgado to sue the guilty party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such subrogation is sanctioned by the
Workmen's Compensation Law aforesaid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is as a <span class="SpellE">subrogee</span> to the rights of its deceased
employee, <span class="SpellE">Quintin</span> Delgado, that <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span>
filed a suit against petitioners in the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Mandaluyong</span>,
