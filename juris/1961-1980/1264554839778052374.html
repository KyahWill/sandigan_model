<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The record shows that on 
</span><st1:date month="6" day="9" year="1947"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 9, 
1947</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
Jose F. <span class="SpellE">Aparri</span> mortgaged a piece of land to the 
Philippine National Bank to secure the payment of F600.00. The mortgage was 
registered in the Office of the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Masbate</span> on </span><st1:date month="6" day="21" year="1947"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 21, 
1947</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date month="7" day="1" year="1953"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">July 1, 
1953</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, a 
criminal case for <span class="SpellE">malversation</span> of public funds 
amounting to P5<span class="GramE">,467.24</span> was filed against <span class="SpellE">Aparri</span> in the Justice of the Peace Court of <span class="SpellE">Masbate</span>, </span><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Masbate</span></span></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, VOL. 121, APRIL 30,1965, 591 
<span class="SpellE">Aparri</span> vs. Court of Appeals, et al. which, on 
</span><st1:date month="7" day="9" year="1953"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">July 9, 
1953</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
issued a writ of preliminary attachment against <span class="SpellE">Aparri's</span> properties, including the one he had mortgaged to 
the Philippine National Bank.<sup><span style="color: red;">[1]</span></sup> 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In the meantime, <span class="SpellE">Aparri</span> failed to pay his indebtedness and so the Philippine 
National Bank <span class="SpellE">extrajudicially</span> foreclosed the mortgage. 
Subsequently, the property was sold at public auction for P1<span class="GramE">,500</span> to <span class="SpellE">Salvacion</span> E. <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE">de</span> Ferro, to whom a 
certificate of sale was given on </span><st1:date month="1" day="28" year="1955"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">January 28, 
1955</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Of the amount of P1.500, Pl,400 
was paid to the Philippine National Bank; P18.60 was paid to the sheriff for his 
fees and P477.40 was retained by the sheriff on the strength pf an opinion of 
the Auditor Genera], in view of <span class="SpellE">Aparri's</span> pending 
criminal case, and the writ of preliminary attachment issued therein. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">There is no question that within 
the one-year period of redemption, <span class="SpellE">Aparri</span> tendered to 
Ferro the sum of P1<span class="GramE">,265.32</span> and that when the latter 
refused to receive the same, <span class="SpellE">Aparri</span> paid the amount to 
the provincial sheriff. The sheriff refused to execute the corresponding 
certificate of redemption in favor of <span class="SpellE">Aparri</span> even as 
he refused to place Ferro in possession of the property and to execute in her 
favor a final deed of sale.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Ferro brought the matter on 
mandamus to the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Masbate</span>. 
After trial, the lower court rendered judgment in favor of the petitioner and 
against the respondent— <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On appeal to the Court of 
Appeals, said decision was affirmed. <span class="GramE">Hence, <span class="SpellE">Aparri's</span> petition to review.</span> Section 464—466 of the 
Code of Civil Procedure, however, 4148, provides: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"In all cases in which an 
extrajudicial sale is made under the special power hereinbefore referred to, the 
debtor, his successors in interest or any judicial creditor or judgment creditor 
of said debtor, or any person having a lien on the property subsequent to the 
mortgage or deed of trust under which the property is sold, may redeem the same 
at any time within the term of one year from and after the sale, and such 
redemption shall he governed by the provisions of sections four hundred, and 
sixty-four to four hundred and sixty-six, inclusive, of the Code of Civil 
Procedure, in so far as these are not Inconsistent with the provisions of this 
Act"<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Sections 464-466 of the Code of 
Civil Procedure, however, have been superseded by Sections 29 to 31 of Rule 39 
of the Revised Rules of Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Under Section 30 of Rule 39f in 
order to effect redemption, the judgment debtor must pay the purchaser within 
twelve months after the sale, "the amount of his purchase, with one per centum 
per month interest thereon in addition, up to the time of redemption, together 
with the amount of any assessments or taxes which the purchaser may have paid 
thereon after the purchase, and interest on such last-named amount at the same 
rate," otherwise, the purchaser may justly refuse the tender if it is for less 
than this amount (See Ordonez vs. <span class="SpellE">Villaroman</span>, Phil., 
116; 44 Off. <span class="GramE">Gas.,</span> No. 6, 2226) Indeed, the payment 
mentioned in the rule must be made by tendering and delivering to the purchaser 
the sum of money required for the purpose. Obviously, he cannot be compelled to 
accept a promissory note; much less may he be compelled to accept an amount in 
the possession of a third person, which amount, to make things worst, is the 
subject of an adverse claim by another party. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This is exactly the situation 
obtaining in the present case. <span class="SpellE">Aparri</span> tendered to Mrs. 
Ferro only the sum of P1<span class="GramE">,265.32</span>, an amount admitted to 
be P 177.40 less than what he was under obligation to pay as redemption money. 
In effect, he told the purchaser: Here, take this sum of Pl<span class="GramE">,265.32</span>, and get the remaining P477.40 from the office of the 
Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Masbate</span> who, as stated heretofore, was not 
willing to part away with the amount because it was claimed by the Government by 
reason of the preliminary attachment levied upon the parcel of land subject of 
redemption. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Aparri</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> contends that as the prosecution 
in the criminal case did not make any move to attach the surplus amount of 
P477.40, the sheriff had no right to retain the same and that, added to this 
amount the sum of P1<span class="GramE">,265.32</span>, which he had paid to the 
sheriff, is equal to the amount paid by Ferro for the land and its taxes, 
assessments and interest. We disagree with this contention. The rule is that if 
any property under attachment is sold by order of the court because it is 
fungible in nature or by virtue of a writ of execution issued to satisfy the 
judgment rendered, the proceeds of the sale take the place of the property and 
should be used by the Sheriff to pay the judgment, and the balance, if any, 
should be retained by him security for the satisfaction of the claims of other 
parties with a subordinate Hen on the same property, such that of another 
attaching creditor. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petitioner further argues that 
because the lien by attachment upon the property in question was junior to the 
mortgage lien in favor of the Bank, the attaching creditor had nothing more than 
the right to redeem the Property after the extrajudicial foreclosure sale. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Distinction should be made, in 
this connection, of the three different kinds of sales tinder the law, namely: 
an ordinary execution sale; a judicial foreclosure sale, and an extrajudicial 
foreclosure sale. While the three are identical in most of the essential 
formalities required to make the sale, they differ from one another in important 
respects as far as it concerns their respective effects on the rights of the 
parties and the subject matter of the sale. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">There is no question that in the 
case of an execution sale of real estate to satisfy a money judgment, a <span class="SpellE">redemptioner</span>, as far as the property sold is concerned, has 
only the right to redeem it within the period and under the conditions provided 
by law. However, the case is different when the sate is the result of judicial 
foreclosure proceedings. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Section 4 of Rule 68 provides 
that the money realized from the sale of the mortgaged property, after deducting 
the cost of the sale, shall be paid to the mortgagee foreclosing his mortgage, 
and the balance or residue, if any, shall be paid to junior <span class="SpellE">encumbrancers</span> in the order of their priority to be 
ascertained by the court. Only if there be no such junior <span class="SpellE">encumbrancers</span> or there be a balance or residue after paying 
their claims, is said balance or residue to be delivered to the mortgagor. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Act No. 315, as amended by Act 
No. 4148, which governs extrajudicial foreclosure sales, expressly provides that 
the debtor, his successors in interest or any judicial creditor of said debtor, 
or any person having a lien on the property subsequent to the mortgage under 
which it was sold, may redeem the same within one year from and after the date 
of the sale, said redemption to be governed by the provisions of Sections 
464-466 of the Code of Civil Procedure (now the pertinent sections of Rule 39). 
The said provision, however, is silent on the matter of what should be done in 
the event the highest bid made for the property at the extra judicial 
foreclosure sale is in excess of the mortgage debt; whether the balance or 
residue shall be delivered to the mortgagor or shall be used to pay the junior 
<span class="SpellE">encumbrancers</span>. Neither does said statute specifically 
limit the right of junior <span class="SpellE">encumbrancers</span> to the 
exercise of their right of redemption. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The problem, therefore, is 
whether in the event there be a balance or residue, the same should be delivered 
to the mortgagor, following the rule in ordinary execution sales where the 
property sold is not subject to any existing subordinate liens, or it should be 
used to pay the junior <span class="SpellE">encumbrancers</span>, as is provided 
in the case of judicial foreclosure sales. It is the considered opinion of this 
Court that the rule and practice in judicial foreclosure sales with respect to 
any balance or residue should be likewise applied to extra judicial foreclosure 
sales in a similar event, considering that both are foreclosure sales. 
Accordingly, the balance or residue of P 177.40 above referred to should be used 
to pay junior liens on the property subject of the extrajudicial foreclosure 
sale, such as the lien by attachment acquired by the Government. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Coming now to Ferro's 
counter-assignment of error that— <o:p></o:p></span></p>
