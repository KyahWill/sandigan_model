				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Found guilty by the Court of First Instance of Leyte of the crime of murder 
and assessed the penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua</em>, plus the usual 
concomitants, accused Floro Tila-on, Beltran Agrava and Victor Dazo appealed to 
this Court. Subsequently, however, Floro Tila-on moved to withdraw his appeal, 
and it was granted by this Court in its resolution of August 6, 1959, thereby 
leaving to be resolved only the cause of the two other appellants.
<p>The State's evidence shows that at about 5:00 o'clock in the afternoon of 
June 18, 1955, the three defendants Floro Tila-on, Beltran Agrava, and Victor 
Dazo came to the store-residence of Severo Agustin at barrio Tangas, 
municipality of Burauen , Leyte . Present were Severo and his wife, Margarita 
Amarille, their 13 year-old daughter, Visitacion Agustin, who was playing at 
their front yard, and Isabel Manasis, who was at the store to buy kerosene. 
Margarita and Isabel testified that the three accused pretended to buy some 
cigarettes, and when Severo turned his back to the trio to get the merchandise, 
Floro suddenly and without warning stabbed the former with a dagger, finding its 
mark at the back of the unwary victim. Visitation's attention was for the first 
time attracted when the victim moaned, and instantly turning her gaze in the 
direction of the wailing, she saw Floro at the moment he pulled out the dagger 
from her father's back. The stunned witnesses then saw Beltran Agrava almost 
simultaneously drive in the second bolo thrust at the victim; and as Severo 
reached for his own bolo which was hung in one of the posts, Victor Dazo gave 
him the final stab. Despite his wounds, Severo was able to turn around and swing 
his bolo, reaching and hitting Victor Dazo on the right thigh as the latter was 
attempting to leave. Senseless and confused, the three eyewitnesses finally 
scampered to safety.</p>
<p>Coming back later to the scene of the crime, Margarita and Visitation saw the 
lifeless body of Severo sprawled by the door of the store.</p>
<p>The autopsy report made by Dr. Jose Lucinario, the municipal health officer, 
indicates that death was due to internal hemorrhage caused by the three 
stab-wounds inflicted at the back of the victim's body (Exhibit "A").</p>
<p>As to the motive for the killing, it was shown that, some time in 1952, the 
deceased victim and his family were robbed by Floro Tila-on and consorts (not 
his co-accused) and threatened with death should the victims report the matter 
to the authorities. But despite the stern warning, Severo nonetheless reported 
the incident to the barrio lieutenant and the military police. In this 
connection, it may become worthy of note that Floro Tila-on and the appellants 
herein are closely related to one another.</p>
<p>The defense gave an entirely different version of the incident, the gist of 
which would reveal that Severo Agustin, in a fit of jealously, was the 
aggressor, and pictures Victor Dazo as the object of Severo's assault, and Floro 
Tila-on as the mediator who was forced to kill the deceased in self-defense and 
in defense of Victor.</p>
<p>Carefully reviewing the evidence for the People and the defense, this Court 
is convinced of the guilt of the appellants. In contrast to the testimony of the 
witnesses for the prosecution, which we find to be substantially and naturally 
coherent, the asseverations of the defense, upon the other hand, vary in 
significant respects. Thus, (1) Victor Dazo testified that he was assaulted and 
wounded by Severo because the latter was supposedly enraged upon seeing the 
former and Margarita Amarillo drink tuba together; but that before stabbing and 
hitting Victor on the right thigh, the deceased reportedly remarked, "Why are 
you coming here? Are you courting my wife" Defense witness Gorgonio Alipar heard 
altogether differently. The witness declared that before stabbing Victor, Severo 
exclaimed, "You are boastful! You take a drink!" Compare this with the testimony 
of accused Beltran Agrava who attested that no conversation of any kind 
transpired before the alleged wounding of Victor by Severo. (2) Victor Dazo 
himself stated that during the duel between the deceased and Floro Tila-on, 
which supposedly ensued because the latter intervened on Victor's behalf, he 
(Victor) was already lying wounded. Defense witness Rufo Rubino, on the other 
hand, insisted that Victor was merely in a sitting or squatting position. (3) 
Rufo further claimed that Codrato Agustin allegedly challenged Floro to a fight 
after the latter stabbed Severo, and that as a matter of fact, Codrato 
unsuccessfuly tried to spear Floro. Others, however, stated that no such 
challenge was made and no fight ever ensued between the two because Codrato ran 
away after having been stoned by Floro's companion. (4) After the stabbing 
incident, Severo, according to defense witness Gorgonio Alipar, went slowly up 
to his house, with the bolo still in his hand. Floro Tila-on himself testified, 
however, that Severo fell to the ground after having been critically 
wounded.</p>
<p>Certain improbabilities in the defense's account of the killing are equally 
impressive. For instance, despite the alleged close struggle between Severo 
Agustin and Floro Tila-on, wherein the former was by and large the armed 
aggressor who delivered several blows at Floro, first with a bolo and later with 
a scythe, the later emerged unscathed. This accused also claims that he began 
stabbing the deceased after he (Floro) successfully wrested the bolo away from 
Severo and the latter continued the attacked with a scythe. If this assertion is 
true, then it is hardly probable that the stab-wounds received by Severo would 
have all landed, as indeed they did, on the rear portion of his body. Appellant 
Victor Dazo also declared that in the course of struggle between the deceased 
and Floro Tila-on, Codrato Agustin, a son of Severo, assaulted him (Victor) with 
a spear; yet inspite of the charges preferred against him by the Agustin family, 
Victor neither reported the matter nor made any similar accusation against 
Codrato to the proper authorities.</p>
<p>We need not go further into reciting other inconsistencies and 
improbabilities in the testimony of the accused and their witnesses before it 
can convince us that the theory offered by the defense is but a fiction. In 
truth, going over the testimony of Gorgonio Alipar and Rufo Rubino, one cannot 
but be assured that they could not have really been with the accused during and 
immediately after the incident in question; and why the accused had to resort to 
said witnesses to build up their defense merely gives a strong indication of 
appellants' consciousness of guilt.</p>
<p>On the part of the State witnesses, on the other hand, no sufficient motive 
was shown or pretended to induce them to falsely implicate the appellants.</p>
<p>Finally, the rule is now firmly established to the point of becoming 
elementary in this jurisdiction and elsewhere that where there is an 
irreconcilable conflict in the testimony of witnesses, the appellate court will 
not disturb the findings of the trial court when the evidence of the successful 
party, considered by itself, is adequate to sustain the judgment appealed 
from.</p>
<p>The commission of the offense was characterized by treachery, considering 
that the attack was sudden, achieved from behind the accused who was apparently 
misled into remaining passive and unsuspecting, and executed while the latter 
was not in a position to offer an effective defense (see Art. 14, par. 16, 
Revised Penal Code).</p>
<p>Appellants are guilty as principals by direct participation, it appearing 
that they took part in stabbing the deceased victim inflicting wounds which all 
proved to be fatal (see Art. 17, par. 1, Revised Penal Code). That each of the 
accused knew of the criminal design of the other can be sufficiently inferred 
from the circumstances of the assault, such as the arrival of the accused at 
the' same time, their presence from the start and up to the consummation of the 
crime, and, most important of all, the fact that the malefactors acted in 
concert all throughout its commission pursuant to the same evident objective 
(see People <em>vs</em>. Mandagay, et al., 46 Phil., 838). It is thus proved 
that there was a conspiracy among the accused, thereby making their criminal 
responsibility collective.</p>
<p>There being no mitigating or aggravating circumstances to take into account, 
as none were proved, the penalty imposable is <em>reclusi√≥n perpetua</em>, which 
is the medium period of the penalty prescribed by law for the crime of murder 
(Art. 248, Revised Penal Code).</p>
<p>Wherefore, finding no error in the judgment appealed from, the same is hereby 
affirmed. Costs in this instance against the appellants.</p><em>Bengzon, C.J., 
Padilla, Labrador, Concepcion, Barrera, Paredes, Dizon, De Leon,</em> and 
<em>Natividad, JJ.,</em> concur.</div>
