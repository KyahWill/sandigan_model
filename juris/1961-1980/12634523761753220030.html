				<BR><STRONG>ESGUERRA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal from the judgment of the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija, Branch IV, Guimba, finding the accused, Ben Dayag, guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape defined and penalized under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua (life imprisonment); to suffer the accessories provided for by law and to pay the costs.<br><br>As charged in the information, the crime was allegedly committed as follows:<br><blockquote>"That on or about the 5th day of February, 1968, in the municipality of Talugtog, Province of Nueva Ecija, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, by means of force and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously lie with and have sexual intercourse with Lourdes Cinense, against the latter's will and consent.<br><br>"Contrary to law."</blockquote>The accused having pleaded not guilty to the charge, the prosecution sought to establish its case through the uncorroborated testimony of the alleged rape victim, Lourdes Cinense.&nbsp; From the decision of the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> based on said uncorroborated testimony, We find the following:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><blockquote>"The complaining witness Lourdes Cinense declared that on February 5, 1968, at about 4:30 on the afternoon, she went to her hut at Barrio Sta. Catalina, Talugtog, Nueva Ecija, to feed her pigs and chickens.&nbsp; This hut was about two kilometers away from their house in Barrio Cinense, Talugtog.&nbsp; At that time, her husband Juan Pedro was then in the farm at Barrio Cinense, attending to the second crop.&nbsp; While she was feeding her pigs under her house at Sta. Catalina, the accused Ben Dayag entered the door of the house, embraced her, kissed her and laid her down. She struggled but Ben Dayag forced her down and in the course of her struggle, her dress was torn.&nbsp; The accused, also through force, removed her pantie and forced her down and when she was lying down, this lay on top of her, kissed her, embraced her and did not loosen his hold on her.&nbsp; He then inserted his private organ in her sexual organ and commenced the act of sexual intercourse, all the time she was struggling to get loose from his hold but the accused held her tightly and threatened her with his long gun that if she would move, he would shoot her.&nbsp; This threat infused fear on her and as a result, the accused was able to commit the sexual intercourse which lasted for about ten minutes.&nbsp; After this sexual act, Ben Dayag released his hold on her, embraced her again and afterwards, left her after wearing his pants.&nbsp; Lourdes Cinense after the sexual intercourse, sat down and felt tired for what had been done to her.&nbsp; Afterwards, she went home and upon arrival, she cooked their food.&nbsp; Her husband Juan Pedro arrived home between 7:00 and 8:00 o'clock in the evening and saw Lourdes Cinense trembling.&nbsp; He then inquired why she was in that condition and Lourdes Cinense complained to him that she had been raped by Ben Dayag.&nbsp; Juan Pedro at once went out to call their children who were in the house of his mother.&nbsp; <i>Afterwards, he returned to their house and there saw his wife lying prostrate with her mouth foaming and he learned that she had taken poison.</i>&nbsp; He shouted for help from the neighbors who came immediately and his brother also came to their succor.&nbsp; His brother and cousin took Lourdes Cinense to Guimba for medical treatment.&nbsp; Juan Pedro stayed in the house worrying of what had happened to his wife.&nbsp; He went out of his house in search of Ben Dayag to kill him but fortunately he did not find the accused.&nbsp; He returned to his house and on second thought he reflected that if he would kill Ben Dayag he would answer therefor so he finally decided to take the matter to the courts of justice.&nbsp; Lourdes Cinense was taken to the clinic of Dr. Duval at Guimba, Nueva Ecija, in a jeep owned by Barrio Captain Benjamin Patacsil.&nbsp; She was treated in the clinic for four days, beginning the night of February 5, 1968.&nbsp; After her release from the clinic, Lourdes Cinense filed the complaint against Ben Dayag, Exhibit "A".&nbsp; Thereafter Ben Dayag could not be seen anymore in the neighborhood."</blockquote>On the other hand the accused denied the commission of the crime and interposed the following alibi, as stated in the decision:<br><blockquote>"Ben Dayag, whose true name is Bienvenido Dayag, testifying for himself, declared that on February 5, 1968, he was in his house at Barrio Cinense, Talugtog, Nueva Ecija; that at about 8:00 o'clock in the morning of said date, he went to the barrio hall of Barrio Cinense to do some work there; that he had many companions in undertaking the work and some of his companions were Honorato Lomboy, David Gamit, Ventura Abad, Juan Pedro, Ireneo Santiago and others; that his wife Normacion Pascual was also in the barrio hall, working with Valeriana Santiago, Maria Manangan, Lourdes <i>Cinense and others; that the men finished their work later while the women left their work very much earlier; that on the afternoon of said date, the men worked from 2:00 to 5:00 o'clock;</i> that when he went home his companions were Lourdes Cinense, Valeriana Santiago, Maria Manangan and his wife; that Juan Pedro was also going home following them; that when he reached his house he let his carabao drink; that after his carabao had drunk, he went inside his house and did not leave it and slept at about 8:00 o'clock." (Italics ours)</blockquote>This testimony of accused Dayag was corroborated by his wife, Normacion Pascual, but the trial court rejected their testimonies as unworthy of credence, accepted as true the uncorroborated testimony of complainant Lourdes Cinense and found defendant Ben Dayag guilty of rape as charged.&nbsp; Hence this appeal.<br><br>Appellant, through counsel <i>de oficio,</i> makes the following assignment of errors:<br><br><table Â ="" align="center" border="0" width="85%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%"><div align="justify">1. </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">"That the court erred in alleging (sic holding) that the defense of alibi of the defendant-appellant is not worthy of credit because no impartial and unbiased evidence coming from disinterested residents of barrio Cinense, Talugtog, Nueva Ecija, was presented to corroborate it;<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">2. </div></td> <td><div align="justify">"That the trial court erred in alleging (sic holding) that evidence of maltreatment in the person of the complaining witness Lourdes Cinense, is not borne by competent evidence, it having been the result of mere insinuation;<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">3. </div></td> <td><div align="justify">"That the trial court erred in alleging (sic ruling) that it cannot accept the testimony of Dra.

Catalina, Talugtog, Nueva Ecija, to feed my pigs and chickens;<br><br>"That when I was getting the can of rice bran inside the hut, one Ben Dayag, entered the hut without my consent, so that I asked him "WHY"?&nbsp; and he said and pointed to me his firearm." <i>IF YOU WILL SHOUT, I AM GOING TO SHOOT YOU", </i>and dragged me inside the hut, and once inside the hut, he (Ben Dayag) began kissing me, embraced me, laid me down the floor and laid on top of me;<br><br>"That upon receiving such abusive acts, I struggled and tried to get loose of his hands, <i>until I became unconscious so that he was able to have sexual intercourse on me;</i><br><br>"That upon regaining consciousness, I tried to stand up but again Ben Dayag, embraced me and laid me down to the floor and stepped on my legs to prevent me to stand up and pointed again his firearm to me and said "IF YOU ARE GOING TO TELL YOUR HUSBAND OR THE POLICE AUTHORITIES ABOUT THIS MATTER, I AM GOING TO KILL YOU AS SOON AS I HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO," then he left."</blockquote>On February 16, 1968, in the preliminary examination before the Municipal Judge of Talugtog, the same Lourdes Cinense stated under oath that the accused said nothing to threaten her.&nbsp; She said as follows:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0,

Catalina, Talugtog, Nueva Ecija.&nbsp; There is absolutely no evidence on record of any mark of violence, bruise or scratch on the body, face or hands of the assailant or of the offended party except those found by Dra. Duval on the latter.&nbsp; But the swelling and contusions found by the doctor appear to have been caused by blows received from Lourdes' brother and husband and not from herein accused, (TSN Nov. 20, 1968 and February 11, 1969).&nbsp; The alleged torn dress and panties were not presented in evidence.&nbsp; Complainant's uncorroborated yarn is not that kind of innocent story of a rape victim on the basis of which one accused of so heinous an offense may be condemned to a living death (People vs. Ariarte, G.R. No. 40736, 60 Phil. 326, 328).&nbsp; The prosecution, therefore, miserably failed to prove that force and intimidation were really employed by accused to cow the victim to make her submit to his lustful desires.&nbsp; It is well-settled that â<br><blockquote>"Evidence to be believed, must not only proceed from the mouth of a credible witness but it must be credible in itself such as the common experience and observation of mankind can approve as probable under the circumstances.&nbsp; We have no test of truth of human testimony, except its conformity to our knowledge, observation and experience.&nbsp; Whatever is repugnant to these belongs to the miraculous, and is outside of juridical cognizance."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></blockquote>The alibi of accused Ben Dayag, corroborated by his wife, Normacion Pascual, while weak in itself, was never contradicted by the prosecution.&nbsp; In the case of People <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Fraga<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> this Court said:<br><blockquote>"The rule that alibi must be satisfactorily proven was never intended to change the burden of proof in criminal cases; otherwise, We will see the absurdity of an accused being put in a more difficult position where the prosecution's evidence is vague and weak than where it is strong."</blockquote>The onus probandi in establishing the guilt of the accused still rests with the prosecution and in this case We can see that it does not have strong and solid grounds to stand on.&nbsp; In People <span style="font-style: italic;">vs. </span>Bulawin, 29 SCRA 710, 721, it was ruled thus:<br><blockquote>"Of course alibi is known to be the weakest of all defenses.&nbsp; It is easy to concoct, difficult to disprove.&nbsp; Nonetheless, where the evidence for the prosecution is weak and betrays lack of concreteness on the question of whether or not defendant is the author of the crime charged, alibi as a defense assumes importance."<br></blockquote>The accused cannot be convicted because of the weakness of his alibi.&nbsp; The prosecution must prove his guilt by the strength of its evidence and not by the weakness of that of the accused.&nbsp; During the trial, the prosecution never questioned or impugned the veracity of defendant's alibi and we see no reasonable explanation why both the complainant, Lourdes Cinense, and husband, Juan Pedro, did not refute appellant's testimony that they were all in the barrio hall of barrio Cinense the whole day of February 5, 1968, working on a community project in connection with a beautification contest between barrio Cinense and barrio Casanova.<br><center><br>II<br></center><br>The defense contends that the complainant took poison not because of the dishonor she allegedly suffered by reason of the rape committed by appellant but because of the maltreatment administered on her person by complainant's own brother, Nolasco Cinense, and her own husband, Juan Pedro, who was jealous of appellant Ben Dayag whom he suspected of having an affair with his wife, Lourdes Cinense.&nbsp; This was revealed to appellant's wife, Normacion Pascual, who had a conversation with Lourdes in the latter's house early in the morning of February 7, 1968 (T.S.N. pp. 5-6, Jan. 20, 1969).&nbsp; This incident of maltreatment when she was boxed on the face and kicked was witnessed by Normacion Pascual, wife of accused Ben Dayag, when she was in the house of Rosita Barawid.&nbsp; (T.S.N. January 20, 1969, pp. 5, 11).&nbsp; This was corroborated by the Barrio Captain and Dra. Duval who came to know of the maltreatment from Celedonia Cinense, aunt of the victim, who was among those who ran to the rescue of Lourdes Cinense immediately after the attempted suicide and later accompanied Lourdes (in the jeep of the Barrio Captain and with the Barrio Captain himself) to the clinic of Dra. Duval.&nbsp; It is not true that Lourdes Cinense was taken to the clinic of Dra. Duval on the night of February 5th but on the 7th.&nbsp; Dra.

Duval is credible.&nbsp; For We do not find any reason or motive why she would falsify her clinical records.&nbsp; It is undisputed that she prepared the card on the very day the complainant was admitted, which was on the 7th, and not on the 5th or 6th as prosecution would like it to appear.&nbsp; The testimony of Dra. Duval was corroborated by none other than that of the Barrio Captain, Benjamin Patacsil, who accompanied Lourdes Cinense to Dra. Duval's clinic and whose jeep was used in conducting her to the same.&nbsp; Significant too is the fact that Barrio Captain Patacsil is the nephew of Juan Pedro, husband of Lourdes Cinense (T.S.N. September 11, 1968 p. 8) and, therefore, the Barrio Captain could not have contrived lies to contradict the testimony of his aunt-in-law.&nbsp; Barrio Captain Benjamin Patacsil testified as follows:&nbsp; (T.S.N.

 * * *</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br>The rejection by the Trial Judge of Dra. Duval's testimony, supported as it is with records duly signed by her, on the sole ground that the doctor wrote the date on the line which bears the sign:&nbsp; "Binding margin, do not write here," is based on a flimsy and hollow justification.&nbsp; In the usual course of business there are occasions when one inadvertently writes on a restricted space such as the one aforementioned.<br><br>There is one incident the significance of which runs counter to the usual pattern of human behavior and normal reaction in times of stress.&nbsp; Reference is made to the fact that immediately after the occurrence of the foiled suicide by herein complainant, when the Barrio Captain was called for and the patient was brought to the hospital, no report to him was made about the commission of rape by appellant as the impelling factor for the attempted suicide.&nbsp; What Celedonia Cinense, an aunt of the victim, related to the Barrio Captain is that Lourdes took poison after a quarrel between Lourdes and her brother, Nolasco Cinense, and the former was maltreated by his brother and by her husband himself, Juan Pedro.&nbsp; (T.S.N. February 11, 1969 p. 11) This narration was repeated to Dra. Duval when the latter took the history of the case.&nbsp; In a small barrio as Cinense news about crimes against chastity, as the alleged attack against the complainant herein, spread like wildfire and will certainly not escape the ears of everyone, much less the Barrio Captain who is highly regarded as a person in authority therein.&nbsp; But nowhere in the record was the matter of rape reported nor mentioned to the barrio captain or to Dra. Duval either by the aunt or the children of Lourdes who, according to her husband, Juan Pedro, were called immediately after their mother was raped by Dayag.&nbsp; Lourdes Cinense testified too that when she took poison, her son, Nonito Pedro, 15 years of age, was around.&nbsp; (Summary Statement of February 16, 1968 before the municipal court of Talugtog).<br><br>The above circumstances cast a heavy pall of doubt on the prosecution's evidence that rape was committed on the person of the complainant, or that the accused committed the same.<br><blockquote>"Of course We are agreed, that no woman in her right senses would concoct such a tale repugnant to her virtue, and undergo the rigors of a public trial covering her very honor, <i>but this is no guaranty that all self-inflicted indignities are for the sake of truth"</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> for the books disclose too many instances of false charges of rape, attempted rape and kindred offenses to permit the courts to enter a judgment of conviction of a crime of this nature without having in mind the possibility that the complaining witness may have been actuated by some sinister motive in bringing the charge.&nbsp; On the other hand, the only evidence on which convictions of these heinous offenses can be had is frequently the uncorroborated testimony of the injured woman, ...
