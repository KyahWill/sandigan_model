				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from an order of the Court of First Instance of Rizal, 
Pasay City Branch, Hon. Emilio Rilloraza, presiding, dismissing a petition to 
declare defendants in contempt.
<p>The record discloses the following facts: Prior to 1949, the defendants 
brothers and sisters, were in the exclusive possession and administration of 60 
salt beds in Dilain, Parañaque, Rizal. On August 15, 1949, the Court of Appeals 
declared plaintiffs owners of an undivided one-fourth and defendants, the 
undivided three-fourths of the salt beds in question. On March 15, 1952, an 
agreement was entered into between the parties to the effect that during the 
collection season of the salt products on the salt beds the following procedure 
shall be followed in the measurement and storing of the said products: (1) every 
morning the salt collected will be measured by basket and after measurement will 
be brought inside the bodega; (2) the bodega will have two padlocks with 
different keys, one to be held by the plaintiffs and the other by the 
defendants, provided that the representative of the plaintiffs will be present 
during the day, from morning until working hours are closed, or that the camarin 
will remain opened until the close of the day in the afternoon. Ths agreement 
was signed by Antonio Rodriguez in representation of the defendants and by 
plaintiffs Trinidad Ferrer and by defendants Eusebia de Leon, Jose Lara and 
Josefa Rodriguez. This agreement was approved by the judge.</p>
<p>The above agreement was followed from 1952 to date. According to the motion 
filed by the plaintiffs to hold the defendants in contempt and to restrain acts 
of depredation, defendant Jose L. Rodriguez and the other defendants, on 
December 18, 1956, caused the door of the said bodega to be forced open by 
cutting off and breaking the chain locking the bodega, without the knowledge of 
the plaintiffs or their representatives, and caused to be measured and disposed 
of several hundred sacks of salt without the knowledge or presence of the 
plaintiffs or their representatives; that in order to carry out their acts of 
depredation the defendants were aided by one Abelardo Marquez, who is the son of 
one of the <i>kasamas</i> of the defendants, who acted in conspiracy with the 
defendants in breaking down the bodega door and disposing of the salt contained 
therein, together with live other persons, namely, Andres San Agustin, Ernesto 
Marquez, Fausto Santos, Casiano Sarmiento and Marcial Hernandez; that these acts 
are in deliberate disobedience of the order of the court and also an unlawful 
interference with the proceedings of the case; that to insure the success of 
their nefarious acts in appropriating the salt to the prejudice of the 
plaintiffs, defendants called the chief of police, Angel Sarmiento, who is the 
husband of one of the defendants, to help them, and said chief of police sent 
three policemen, Ricardo Santos, Vicente Cirenidad and Aurelio de Leon, to the 
salt land to assist defendants in the disposition of the salt; that on December 
24, 1956, the defendants, with the help of one Rogel and two policemen again 
forced open the bodega by breaking the padlock chain of plaintiffs, and again 
got and carted away several hundred cavanes of salt; that prior to these acts of 
depredation, there were about 2,500 cavanes of salt inside the bodega and at the 
time of the filing of the motion the defendants had already taken away to the 
prejudice of the plaintiffs, almost all, if not all, these 2,500 cavanes of 
salt. The prayer of the motion is (1) that all the defendants, their overseer 
Andres San Agustin and Abelardo Marquez, Ernesto Marquez, Fausto Santos, Casiano 
Sarmiento and Marcial Hernandez, who aided defendants in their acts of 
depredation, be declared in contempt of court; (2) that injunction issue against 
said defendants and their workers prohibited from committing further acts of 
depredation against plaintiffs and from disposing of the salt of the lands in 
question.</p>
<p>The above complaint was filed on December 24, 1956, and on January 30, 1957, 
defendants filed an answer to the complaint alleging that they have honored and 
observed faithfully the agreement entered into by the parties; that on December 
17, 1956 when the buyer Abelardo Marquez went to the house of the defendants, 
the latter advised Abelardo Marquez and Ponciano Ferrer to see Juanito Ferrer 
(plaintiffs' representative) so he can be present at the time of the withdrawal 
of the salt; that when Juanito Ferrer was contacted he replied that he was 
instructed by plaintiff Trinidad Ferrer not to go to the warehouse, and upon 
defendants learning of this, invited Trinidad Ferrer to be present so she can 
see for herself the actual disposal of the salt; that she ignored the invitation 
and gave as an alibi her plan to consult her lawyer first; that thereupon 
defendant Jose L. Rodriguez asked the desk sergeant of the Parañaque Police 
Department to give them two policemen who can witness the withdrawal of 100 
cavanes of salt; that on December 23, another salt dealer by the name of Rogelio 
Mijares informed the defendants of his intention to withdraw the following day 
285 cavanes of salt which he had already paid for, and thereupon defendants sent 
a messenger to notify plaintiffs' representative of the intended disposal of the 
salt, but the plaintiffs' representative failed to appear on the scheduled time 
and when plaintiff Trinidad Ferrer herself was notified, neither did she consent 
to witness the withdrawal of the salt; and that in view of said negligence of 
plaintiff Trinidad Ferrer the defendants had to request the police department of 
Parañaque to send policemen to witness the withdrawal of the salt from the 
camarin.</p>
<p>Upon the above pleadings and other subsequent pleadings containing arguments 
on points of law, the judge on September 30, 1959, dismissed the case on the 
ground that the facts and circumstances did not justify the defendants being 
declared in contempt. Against this order the plaintiffs have prosecuted this 
appeal.</p>
<p>The reason stated by the court in its order dismissing the case is that 
Abelardo Marquez, Ernesto Marquez, Fausto Santos, Casiano Sarmiento, Marcial 
Hernandez, Angel Sarmiento, Ricardo Santos, Vicente Cirenidad and Aurelio de 
Leon, are not parties to the civil case and are strangers thereto, and neither 
are they parties to the agreement dated March 15, 1952. Consequently, they 
cannot be held responsible for the charge of contempt.</p>
<p>In their brief, the plaintiffs-appellants argue that conspiracy between the 
acquitted defendants and the other respondents was alleged specifically, that 
the respondent Angel Sarmiento is the husband of defendant Maria Rodriguez, and 
that the other respondents are policemen under the said chief of police Angel 
Sarmiento. It is also argued that as the motion for contempt specifically 
alleged that the non-party respondents acted in conspiracy with the other 
respondents who were parties to the case, the court erred in dismissing the said 
case without presentation of evidence.</p>
<p>As a general rule, persons who are not parties to an action or proceeding are 
not subject to the jurisdiction of a court trying a case, are not supposed to be 
aware of the court's order and cannot, therefore, be declared guiRy of contempt 
for violating its orders.</p>
<p>In order that a person may be declared guilty of contempt for violating a 
court's order within the meaning of the following provision of the Rules:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SEC. 3. * * * *</p>
<p>"(b) Disobedience of or resistance to a lawful writ, process, order, 
judgment, or command of a court, or injunction granted by a court or judge;" 
(Rule 64, Rules of Court.)</p></blockquote>
<p>the disobedience or resistance must be willful, and there cannot be 
willfulness without, knowledge of the existence of the order and its provisions. 
(Narcida vs. Bowen, 22 Phil. 365; People vs. Rivera, 91 Phil., 354).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, persons who are not parties in a proceeding may be declared 
guilty of contempt for willful violation of an order issued in the case if said 
persons are guilty of conspiracy with any of the parties in violating the 
court's order.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In a proceeding to punish for criminal contempt for willful disobedience of 
an injunction, the fact that those disobeying the injunction were not parties 
<i>eo nomine</i> to the action in which it was granted, and were not personally 
served, is no defense, where the injunction restrains not only the parties, but 
those who act in connection with the party as attorneys, agents, or employes, 
and the parties accused, with knowledge of the order and its terms, acting as 
the employes of a party, willfully violate it." (People <i>ex rel</i>. Stearns, 
et al. vs. Marr, et al., 74 N.E. 431.)</p></blockquote>
<p>An examination of the motion to declare defendants in contempt uses the term 
"in conspiracy" in one of its paragraphs but this is a mere conclusion of law, 
no facts having been pointed out to show that the defendants knowingly conspired 
with the defendants in violating the court's order. Without an express 
allegation that the defendants-appellees, not parties, had knowledge of the 
existence of the prohibition and its terms, and that they willfully violated the 
same, in conspiracy with the other defendants, the complaint for contempt cannot 
stand.</p>
<p>The order dismissing the complaint for contempt against the parties who are 
not defendants in the action is hereby affirmed, with costs against 
complainants-appellants. So ordered.</p> <i>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Barrera, Paredes, 
Dizon, Regala,</i> and <i>Makalintal, JJ.</i>, concur.</div>
