				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">An appeal by the Republic
of the Philippines from the decision of the Court of Appeals which affirmed the
decision of the Court of First Instance of Manila granting the petition of
respondent Lee <span class="SpellE">Wai</span> Lam to change his name to
"William Lee Wong".<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On October 6, 1954,
respondent Lee <span class="SpellE">Wai</span> Lam filed a petition in the Court
of First Instance of Manila, docketed as Special Proceedings No. 24254,
entitled "Petition For Change of Name of Lee <span class="SpellE">Wai</span>
Lam to 'William Lee Wong' ", alleging, substantially, (1) that petitioner
is of age, single, a Chinese national, and a resident of 22 <span class="SpellE">Elizondo</span>
St., <span class="SpellE">Quiapo</span>, Manila; (2) that petitioner has been </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">bona fide resident of Manila since 1935; (3)
that the reason why petitioner asks for a change of name is "because his
usual name before he entered the Philippines, was 'William Lee' but when his
Landing Certificate of Residence was issued, when he landed here, it was merely
mispronounced and misspelled to 'Lee <span class="SpellE">Wai</span> Lam'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The word 'Lee' stands for the adopted family
of his grandfather, whereas '<span class="SpellE">Wai</span> Lam' stands for the
given name which should have been placed as 'William', whereas his family and
other blood relationship have been known by the family name 'Wong'</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">; (4) that petitioner had been known by the
name "William Lee Wong" in the different schools that he attended,
namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Philippine Sun <span class="SpellE">Yat</span> <span class="SpellE">Sen</span> where he studied the
elementary course, in the Far Eastern University where he studied the high
school course, and in the <span class="SpellE">Mapua</span> Institute of
Technology where he studied civil engineering; and so the name "William Lee
Wong" appears in his school records.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Court of First
Instance of Manila issued an order setting the petition for hearing and
directing that a copy thereof be published as required by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said order reads in part:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"A verified petition having been filed by petitioner, thru
counsel, praying for the reasons alleged therein that his name <u>Lee <span class="SpellE">Wai</span> Lam </u>be changed to <u>William Lee Wong</u>;<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>"It appearing that said petition is sufficient in form and
substance, this Court hereby sets the foregoing petition for hearing on March
16, 1955, at 8:30 a.m. and directs that a, copy of this order be published <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>in the DAILY MIRROR <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>once a

the petition may file their opposition x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>‚Äù<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Republic of the
Philippines, thru the Solicitor General, opposed the petition upon the grounds,
substantially, that the necessity for the change had not been established; and
that if the petitioner had been using the name "William Lee Wong"
since his arrival in the Philippines up to the present, as claimed by him, that
fact constitutes a violation of Commonwealth Act No. 142 which prohibits the
use of <u>aliases</u> without judicial authority.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After hearing, the lower court granted the petition, holding that
the grounds for the opposition of the Solicitor General are not obstacles to
the grant of the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Republic
appealed to the Court of Appeals, on both questions of fact and of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of
the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the present appeal, the Solicitor General contends that the
Court of Appeals committed the following errors:</p>

<blockquote>1. "The Court of Appeals erred in ruling that the petition for
change of name was sufficient as to form and substance and that applicant
although not yet of age at the time of its filing had sufficient capacity to
verify the same; and further erred in ruling that the insufficiency of the
petition cannot be raised for the first time on appeal." <a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>2. "The Court of Appeals erred in ruling that the evidence on
record was sufficient proof of the truth of the allegations of the petition for
the change of name sought."</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">3. "The Court of
Appeals erred in ruling that the grounds for </span>the opposition to the
change of name are no obstacle to the grant of <span style="">the </span>petition."</blockquote>

<blockquote>4. "The Court of Appeals erred in affirming the decision of
the trial court granting the change of name sought."</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">1. We find no merit in </span>the
first assigned error.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE">Tse</span> vs. Republic,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court held that "no rule provides that a person desiring to change
his name should be of age and that if he is a minor the verification made by
him <span style="">is </span>of no legal effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>(t)he jurisdiction of
courts over the subject matter depends upon the nature of the action or
proceeding and not upon the capacity or incapacity to sue of the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="">is </span>not an absolute pre-requisite to
jurisdiction over an action by a minor that he should sue through a guardian <u>ad</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>litem</u></span>." In the <span style="">earlier case </span>of <span class="SpellE">Oshita</span> vs. Republic,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
this<span style=""> </span><span style="">Court </span>said that the requirement <span style="">regarding verification of a pleading is a formal, not a jurisdictional, </span>requisite.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Verification is simply intended to secure an
assurance that <span style="">what are </span>alleged
in <span style="">the </span>pleading are true and
correct and not <span style="">the </span>product of
the imagination or <span style="">a matter </span>of speculation, and that the pleading is filed in good
faith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The requirement regarding
verification of <span style="">a </span>pleading <span style="">is </span>simply
a condition affecting the form of pleading, the non-compliance of which does
not necessarily render the pleading fatally defective.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court may order the correction of the
pleading if verification <span style="">is </span>lacking,
or act on the pleading although it is not verified if the attending
circumstances are such that strict compliance with the rule may be dispensed
with in order that the ends of justice or the law may thereby be served.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2. The second, third and fourth assigned errors may be discussed
jointly, all of them having reference to the question of whether or not there <span style="">is </span>a "proper and reasonable
cause" or any compelling reason, which may justify the change of name.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In this connection, it may be well to first define what
constitutes "proper and reasonable cause" for <span style="">a </span>change of name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court, in Yu Chi Han vs. Republic,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
had expressed what is a "proper and reasonable cause" which would
warrant a change of name, thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"This Court has already had the occasion to express the view that
the State has an interest in the names borne by individuals and entities for
purposes of identification and <span style="">that a </span>change
of name <span style="">is </span>a
privilege and not <span style="">a </span>matter of right, so that before a person can be authorized to
change his name given him either in his certificate of birth or civil registry
he must show proper or reasonable cause, or any compelling reason which may
justify such change.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, the
request should be denied (<span class="SpellE">Ong</span> <span class="SpellE">Peng</span>
<span class="SpellE">Oan</span> <span style="">vs. </span>Republic, L-8035, November 29,
1957).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The following may be considered,
among others, as proper and reasonable causes that may warrant the grant of a
petition for change of name:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) when the
name is ridiculous, tainted with dishonor, or is extremely difficult to write
or pronounce; (2) when the request for change is a consequence of a change of
status, such <span style="">as
</span>when a natural child is acknowledged or legitimated; and (3) when the
change is necessary to avoid confusion (<span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>,
Civil Code of the Philippines, 1953 ed., Vol. I, p. <span style="">660)."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the case now before
Us, the reasons of respondent Lee <span class="SpellE">Wai</span> Lam in asking
for a change of name, as </span>found by the Court of Appeals, are:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"(a) that he desires to adopt officially
the given name 'William' which <span style="">was </span>his real name in China, and not <span class="SpellE">Wai</span> Lam which <span style="">was </span>placed by mistake in his landing
certificate; (b) that 'William' stands for the Chinese name '<span class="SpellE">Wai</span> Lam'; (c) that the family name 'Lee' which he now bears
is the adopted family name of his grandfather which is also carried by his
father; (d) that the family name 'Wong' which he wants to adopt is the family
name of his ancestors in China; (e) that he <span style="">was </span>officially registered in different
schools and universities, such as Philippine Sun <span class="SpellE">Yat</span> <span class="SpellE">Sen</span>, Far Eastern University, National University and <span class="SpellE">Mapua</span> Institute of Technology, as 'William L. Wong' and was
graduated and given certificates and diplomas from said educational
institutions under the name 'Wil¬≠liam L. Wong'; (f) that he has been known to
his friends and in society in general as 'William L. Wong'; (g) that <span style="">he has been officially registered in the
Bureau of Immigration under other names as 'William Lee Wong', 'William Lee',
and 'William W. Lee'; and (h) that he wants to reconcile and harmonize his
school records and his immigration papers, especially because his application
for post graduate studies in the University of Michigan, U.S.A., has been
accepted on the basis of his school records in the Philippines wherein he was
regis¬≠tered, as above stated under the name 'William L. Wong'."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We note, from the reasons
above stated, that res¬≠pondent does not claim that his name "Lee <span class="SpellE">Wai</span> Lam" </span><span style="">is </span>ridiculous, or tainted with dishonor, or
is difficult to write or pronounce.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Neither is it claimed that the change of name is asked because of a
change in his status.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor has it been
shown that the use of the name, Lee <span class="SpellE">Wai</span> Lam, has
produced confusion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It simply appears
that respondent wants to correct an alleged error because his actual name in
China was "William Lee" not "Lee <span class="SpellE">Wai</span>
Lam"; that out of filial attachment he wants to adopt his grandfather's
(and his father's) surname "Lee" and his ancestral family name
"Wong"; that he has been known in school, among his friends and the
society in general, as "William Lee Wong"; and that his other names
registered in the Bureau of Im¬≠migration are "William Lee Wong",
"William Lee" and "William W. Lee", all of which he wants
to reconcile and harmonize by simply adopting one name, "William Lee
Wong".</p>

<p class="BODY">In Yap <span class="SpellE">Ek</span> <span class="SpellE">Siu</span>
vs. Republic, <a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
petitioner Yap <span class="SpellE">Ek</span> <span class="SpellE">Siu's</span>
plea to change his name to "William <span class="SpellE">Tanchon</span>"
because "<span class="SpellE">Tanchon</span>" is the authorized surname
of his father, a naturalized Filipino citizen, out of <span style="">a </span>sense of filial respect, was not
considered sufficient cause to change his name; nor his claim that his Filipino
playmates have called him from childhood by the name "William".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Jesus Ng <span class="SpellE">Yao</span> <span class="SpellE">Siong</span> vs. Republic,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
the petitioner's claim that his various names caused much confusion in the
school records and unnecessary delay and embarrassment to him in his dealing
with the public was not considered a proper and reasonable justifica¬≠tion to
legally authorize a change of name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
Grant vs. Republic,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
it was held that the fact that the petitioner has been using a different name
and has become known by it, does not constitute a proper and reasonable cause
to legally authorize a change of name.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In Chiu Hap Chiu vs. Republic,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
although the petitioner had presented a <span class="SpellE">photostatic</span>
copy of a certification issued in his favor as Doctor of Medicine by the '<st1:place><st1:placetype>University</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Sto</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.
Tomas wherein <span style="">it </span>appears that
his name is Lo Hap Chiu, such proof was not considered sufficient to justify a
request for change of his name to Lo Hap Chiu.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And in Yu Chi Han vs. Republic, <u>supra</u>, where the petitioner had
shown his desire to continue <span style="">using the
name, Alejandro Go Yu, given after his birth or after his baptism, in his
dealing in the community or in the schools he attended, this Court declared
that the petitioner has not shown any proper and compelling reason that may
justify the request for change of name.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Based on the rulings we have cited, we do not consider the reasons
presented by the respondent as proper and reasonable to authorize the change of
his name as prayed for by him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The alleged error in placing the name or the res¬≠pondent as Lee <span class="SpellE">Wai</span> Lam and not "William Lee" in his <span style="">Landing Certificate of Residence is not a
convincing ground to warrant change of his name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He has been using officially the name "Lee
<span class="SpellE">Wai</span> Lam" all along, and he has not been heard to
complain that he has been prejudiced by the use of that name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The name "Lee <span class="SpellE">Wai</span>
Lam" appears not only in respondent's Landing Certificate of </span><span style="">Resi¬≠</span><span style="">dence (LCR) but </span><span style="">also </span><span style="">in his Alien Certificate of Registration
(ACR).</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> He should retain, rather than change that
name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As We have stated, the State has
an interest in the name borne by an individual, and this is more so in the case
of an alien whose identity, as a rule, is established by the name appearing in
his alien certificate of registration (ACR).</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The alien's name in the ACR should not be
changed for trivial or capricious reasons.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, since change of name </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">not a right but </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">privilege,
this privilege should not be granted to an applicant who asks to change his
name because he finds himself in difficulty due to his having used a name, or
names, other than his official or real name.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case of <span class="SpellE">Ty</span> Bio <span class="SpellE">Giao</span> vs. Republic, <a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court said:</p>

<blockquote>"In cases of this nature, the possible consequences of a
change of name must be carefully taken into account, and the policy of the
courts should be to deny the application in the absence of clear proof that the
change is really necessary and will not in any¬≠way serve any unlawful
purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The State has an interest in
the name borne by each individual for purposes of identification, and the same
should not be changed for trivial reasons."</blockquote>

<blockquote>3. Regarding the use of <u>alias</u> or <u>aliases</u>, in the
instant case it is not denied that respondent used names other than "Lee <span class="SpellE">Wai</span> Lam" without judicial authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Jesus Ng <span class="SpellE">Yao</span> <span class="SpellE">Siong</span> vs. Republic, <u>supra</u>, this Court warns
applicants for <span style="">change </span>of name
against the unauthorized use of alias or aliases, thus:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The admitted fact that petitioner had been using aliases
ushers us to another problem: Can a court of justice lawfully grant an
application for a change <span style="">of </span>name
where he has violated a law regarding the use of aliases?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This poser comes to the fore, because petitioner
was never authorized to use an alias by a competent court pursuant to the
provisions of Commonwealth Act 142 entitled 'An Act to regulate the use of
aliases'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With reference to the name <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> <span class="SpellE">Keng</span> Jesus or Jesus <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> <span class="SpellE">Keng</span> Lee which he has used in
school, or <span class="SpellE">Keng</span> Lee <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> by
which he is known to his friends and the general public, or <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>
<span class="SpellE">Keng</span> Lee which he uses in his income tax returns, or
Jesus Ng <span class="SpellE">Yao</span> <span class="SpellE">Siong</span> which
appears in his alien certificate of registration, none of these names is <span style="">a </span>'pseudonym
for literary purposes', or a name 'by which he had been known since his
childhood' or 'authorized by a competent court'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This use is prohibited by that law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While we are loathe to attach a felonious
label to the use of these different names, we say that such use appears to be a
violation of Section 1 of said Commonwealth Act 142, punishable with
imprisonment ranging from 1 month to 6 months pursuant to Section 4 of said
statute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither did he use those other
names as 'pen names' or 'stage names'; and another statute prohibits him from
using the <span style="">same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>To grant the petition here is to
sanction an unlawful act which might reach the proportions of a crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Tan vs. Republic, <u>supra</u>, warns that
this cannot be done."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the case or <span class="SpellE">Ty</span> Bio <span class="SpellE">Giao</span> </span><span style="">vs. </span><span style="">Republic, <u>supra</u>, the petition for
change of name was denied it having been found that the petitioner had used and
had been known under several names.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said
this Court:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"But the most important reason justifying denial of
petitioner's application is the fact, admitted by him, that during his
residence in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
he had used and had been known under several names, without legal authority to
do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pos¬≠sibility therefore exists
-- should he be allowed now to change his name -- that confusion would arise in
the minds of those who had previously known him under different names."</blockquote>

<blockquote>4. Finally, and in connection also with the use or aliases, this
Court has ruled that an applicant for change of name should include in his
petition -- in the title and body thereof -- not only his real name and the
name sought to be adopted, but also his aliases or other names used.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the <u>title</u> or the
petition for change of name should include the real name and all the aliases --
not only in the body thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again We
quote from Jesus Ng <span class="SpellE">Ya</span> <span class="SpellE">Siong</span>
vs. Republic, <u>supra</u>:<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>"1. Change of name is a judicial proceeding <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>rem</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Jurisdiction to hear and determine a petition <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>,
by law, is acquired after publication of the 'order reciting the purpose of the
petition' and the 'date and place for the hearing thereof' - for three (3)
successive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Publication is notice <span style="">to the whole world that the proceeding has for its object 'to bar indifferently
all who might be minded to make an objection of any sort against the right
sought to be established.'<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"But, for that publication to be effective, it must give a
correct information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To inform, the
publication should recite, amongst others, the following facts: (1) the name or
names of the applicant, (2) the cause for which the change of name is sought,
and (3) the new name asked for.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"...<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner himself
admits that he is known by all these names.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This gives rise to the necessity or including his aliases in the title
of the petition -- not only in the body thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So that, the title of this petition should
read 'In the matter of the change of name of <u>Jesus Ng</u>, otherwise known
as Jesus Ng <span class="SpellE">Yao</span> <span class="SpellE">Siong</span>,
Jesus <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> <span class="SpellE">Keng</span> Lee, <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> <span class="SpellE">Keng</span> Lee Jesus, <span class="SpellE">Keng</span> Lee <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> and <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> <span class="SpellE">Keng</span> Lee' (this last being the
name he uses in his income tax returns).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The reason for this is obvious.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Notices in the newspapers, like the one under consideration, usually
appear in the back pages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reader, as
is to be expected, merely glances at the <u>title</u> of the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is only after he has satisfied himself
that the title interests him, that he proceeds to read down further.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The probability is that the portions in the
publication heretofore quoted will escape the reader's notice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The purpose of which the publication is made,
that is, to inform, may thus be <span class="SpellE">unserved</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We accordingly hold that for a publication of a petition for
a change of name to be valid, the title thereof should include, <u>first</u>,
his real name, and second, <span style="">his aliases,
it any."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
