<span class="SpellE">Artieda</span>, alias David, alias Abe, has remained at

<p class="BODY">The three brothers, namely, Antonio, Rodolfo and David, all
surnamed <span class="SpellE">Artieda</span>, together with their first degree
cousin, <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> Dorado, and other "Does"
were originally charged with the complex crime of Kidnapping with Murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial Court, however, found only the
crime of Murder as established, and Antonio as the only one guilty thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Information filed on <st1:date year="1973" day="30" month="1">January
 30, 1973</st1:date> reads as follows:</p>

thereafter, in the pursuit of their criminal intent, purpose and design, tied

death of the said SIMEON RIVERA.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As a factual backdrop, it may be stated that prior to the
incident involved herein, the younger brother of the appellant was killed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The victim, Simeon Rivera, was charged in
Court for his death but was acquitted for insufficiency of evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Prior to the judgment of acquittal, Simeon
had escaped from jail.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence for the prosecution may be summarized as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 8, 1972, at about 9:00 o'clock in the evening, Simeon
Rivera and his wife <span class="SpellE">Apolonia</span> <span class="SpellE">Heraldo</span>,
were already lying down about to go to sleep in their house at barrio <span class="SpellE">Palayan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nagcarlan</span>, Laguna, when
someone called "Tao <span class="SpellE">po</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Tao <span class="SpellE">po</span>, we are
authorities, P.C." <span class="SpellE">Apolonia</span> stood up, got a lamp
and opened the door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She held the lamp
over her head to be able to identify the persons who called and she saw the
accused <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> Dorado, Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Artieda</span>
and Antonio <span class="SpellE">Artieda</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She greeted them "Good evening".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her husband, who followed her, greeted them,
too.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All of a sudden, <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> Dorado, who was on the first step of the stairs,
pulled her husband causing him to fall to the ground face downward and hit him
on the leg with a gun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Artieda</span> got a rope from his pocket and with it, tied the
hands of the victim at his back with the help of Rodolfo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All this while, <span class="SpellE">Apolonia</span>
was very near the accused pleading with them to spare her husband.</p>

<p class="BODY">While the victim was being assaulted, <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span>
<span class="SpellE">Artieda</span> went inside the house and thrust the point of
his gun at the stomach of Mario <span class="SpellE">Pomperada</span>, the son of
<span class="SpellE">Apolonia</span>, causing him to fall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Apolonia</span> pleaded
with him not to hurt her son, and whispered to the latter to jump down and run,
which he did going towards the direction of his uncle's house.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the victim was taken towards the direction of the house of <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Artieda</span>, appellant's
father, <span class="SpellE">Apolonia</span> ran to her brother-in-law, <span class="SpellE">Garding</span> <span class="SpellE">Pomperada</span>, whose house
was about 250 meters away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her son, who
was already there, had informed his uncle that his step-father was forcibly
taken away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She did not tell her
brother-in-law that she recognized four of her husband's abductors
"because I was afraid since they (witness pointing to the three accused)
threatened me before they left" and "I might be the next
victim." She only asked her sister-in-law, <span class="SpellE">Juling</span>,
about the relation of <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> Dorado to <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Artieda</span>, and was told that
<span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> is the nephew of <span class="SpellE">Rufino's</span>
wife, Aurelia.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She spent the rest of the
night in her brother-in-law's house.</p>

<p class="BODY">The following morning she returned to their house at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="17">5:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the morning to cook rice, which
she brought to the <span class="SpellE">Nagcarlan</span> municipal building for
her husband.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Failing to find her husband
at the detention cell, she went upstairs to the office of the Mayor and
inquired if he had caused the arrest of her husband by the PC, to which the
Mayor replied in the negative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In her
talk with the latter, neither did she reveal the identities of the
"abductors" of her husband out of fear for her safety and that of her
son.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Following the advice of the Mayor,
she reported the incident to the Chief of Police without, however, informing
the latter either of the persons who were responsible for it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Chief of Police then advised her to go to
the PC because the police had no long arms or guns.</p>

<p class="BODY">The following day, <st1:date year="1972" day="10" month="5">May
 10, 1972</st1:date>, at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9:00 o'clock</st1:time>
in the morning, the Chief of Police, policeman Gonzalo <span class="SpellE">Sotoya</span>
and Cesar <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>, barrio councilman Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Pomperada</span> of <span class="SpellE">Palayan</span> and others
found the dead body of Simeon Rivera in a forest in barrio <span class="SpellE">Palayan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Rural Health Physician of <span class="SpellE">Nagcarlan</span>, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Ciriaco</span> <span class="SpellE">Porteras</span> and Sanitary Inspector Cesar <span class="SpellE">Sumaribe</span>,
examined the body of the victim, which was already in a decomposed stage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The doctor placed the time of death at about
2 1/2 days to 3 days earlier.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pictures

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The body was brought to the municipal
building and was later on buried.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1972" day="12" month="5">May 12, 1972</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Apolonia</span> <span class="SpellE">Heraldo</span> decided to
reveal all she knew and to give her statement to Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Calcetas</span>
of the PC, naming appellant and two others as three of those who forcibly took
her husband on the night of <st1:date year="1972" day="8" month="5">May 8, 1972</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense, for its part, pleaded alibi and sought to impeach
the credibility of <span class="SpellE">Apolonia</span> <span class="SpellE">Heraldo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant Antonio <span class="SpellE">Artieda</span>
maintains that on <st1:date year="1972" day="8" month="5">May 8, 1972</st1:date>,
from <st1:time minute="30" hour="18">half past six o'clock</st1:time> in the
evening until <st1:time minute="0" hour="14">two o'clock</st1:time> in the early
morning of the following day, he was at <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
Laguna, at the place where the shows were being held because it was then their
town fiesta.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His witness, <span class="SpellE">Aquilino</span> <span class="SpellE">Carpena</span>, confirmed that
he saw Antonio there at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00 o'clock</st1:time>
in the evening near the place where "<span class="SpellE">beto-beto</span>"
games were being played.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the lower Court found "reasonable basis to
conclude that Antonio <span class="SpellE">Artieda</span> participated directly
and actively in the killing of Simeon Rivera.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And (that) x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> it
was qualified by treachery and aggravated by cruelty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was further aggravated by the circumstance
of nighttime for undoubtedly this circumstance facilitated the commission of
the crime." Accordingly, it sentenced Antonio <span class="SpellE">Artieda</span>
to death in its Decision dated <st1:date year="1974" day="26" month="4">April
 26, 1974</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of
which is worded thus:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing considerations, the
accused Antonio <span class="SpellE">Artieda</span> is hereby declared guilty
beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder with the attendance of two
aggravating circumstances, for the killing of Simeon Rivera.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"This Court is reluctant to impose the supreme penalty of
death, especially in this case where the accused evidently decided to take the
law in their own hands because they had no more recourse left against Simeon
Rivera whom they must have believed to be the killer of the younger brother of
the accused <span class="SpellE">Artiedas</span> <span class="SpellE">inspite</span>
of his acquittal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But this circumstance
cannot be considered mitigating for it cannot even be considered as an
immediate vindication of a wrong.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The law does not leave this Court any choice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It requires that the penalty of death be
imposed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore the accused Antonio <span class="SpellE">Artieda</span> is hereby sentenced to suffer the supreme penalty
of death as provided by Article 248 in relation to Article 64, paragraph 3, of
the Revised Penal Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is further
ordered to indemnify the heirs of Simeon Rivera in the sum of eighteen thousand
pesos (P18,000.00) as moral damages, and to pay one-third of the costs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"With respect to the two accused, Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Artieda</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> Dorado, they are hereby acquitted
because their identity as among those who abducted the victim Simeon Rivera,
has not been established with proof beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their immediate release from preventive
imprisonment is hereby ordered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With
two-thirds of the costs <u>de</u> <u>officio</u>.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Notwithstanding the execution of this extrajudicial confession by
the appellant, the nature of the offense and the gravity of the penalty imposed
by the trial Court dictate that we delve into the merits of the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his first assigned error, appellant contends that the trial
Court erred in concluding that <span class="SpellE">Apolonia</span> <span class="SpellE">Heraldo</span> recognized and identified Antonio <span class="SpellE">Artieda</span> as one of the persons who "abducted" (<span class="SpellE">dinukot</span>) her husband Simeon Rivera.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He maintains that <span class="SpellE">Apolonia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Heraldo</span> was not candid and truthful in her testimony
because she did not reveal immediately to her brother-in-law nor to the
authorities the identities of the persons who forcibly took her husband away on
the night of <st1:date year="1972" day="8" month="5">May 8, 1972</st1:date>
until after the lapse of four (4) days.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As testified to by <span class="SpellE">Apolonia</span> <span class="SpellE">Heraldo</span>, however, she did not disclose the names of the
culprits because she was threatened by them and she was afraid that she might
be the next victim if she had immediately disclosed the truth to the
authorities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This attitude of <span class="SpellE">Apolonia</span> does not destroy her credibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As this Court held in People vs. <span class="SpellE">Almirez</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
failure of the witness to expose the name of the killer due to fear of reprisal
when he informed the authorities does not discredit him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Experience has shown that witnesses are
reluctant to identify the accused until they are safe enough from probable
harm.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Antonio <span class="SpellE">Artieda</span> was recognized and
identified by <span class="SpellE">Apolonia</span> <span class="SpellE">Heraldo</span>
and her son, Mario <span class="SpellE">Pomperada</span>, as Antonio was already
known to them long before the happening of the incident in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They came close enough to appellant to enable
them to recognize him, especially <span class="SpellE">Apolonia</span> <span class="SpellE">Heraldo</span>, who was even elbowed on the stomach and breast by
Antonio as she pleaded that the assailants spare her husband.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, even if there were no moon that night, as
the defense has successfully established through a witness from the Weather
Bureau, it was not impossible for appellant to have been recognized by the said
witness particularly since the latter was carrying a lamp.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that there is no direct evidence linking appellant to
the killing of the victim; but he was positively identified as one of the
persons who had forcibly taken away (<span class="SpellE">dinukot</span>) Simeon
Rivera, who was found dead two days later.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Examination of the body of the victim, which was already in a decomposed
stage, revealed that he was already dead for 2 1/2 days when he was found and,
therefore, must have been killed in the evening of May 8, 1972 after he was
forcibly taken from his home by at least four men.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It can be logically concluded that the group
collectively, or one of them individually, killed the victim, and that as a
group which acted in unison, the act of one is the act of all.</p>

<blockquote>"Where the accused was a member of a band that appeared at the
house of the deceased for the purpose of killing the latter, as he was in fact
killed by two of the shots fired by some members of the band, the accused is
liable for the resulting homicide although there was no evidence that he fired
a shot at the deceased."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appellant further contends that the lower Court erred in
concluding that the motive in the killing of Simeon Rivera was revenge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is admitted, however, that the brother of
appellant was killed and the victim in this case, Simeon Rivera, was charged
for his death, but was acquitted for insufficiency of evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant, therefore, had a motive to kill
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant argues that if he really
had the intention to kill Simeon, he could have easily done so when the latter
escaped from jail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, having
successfully gotten away from the law, the victim must have taken every
possible pre­caution to hide not only from the authorities but especially from
the family of the deceased who believed he was the culprit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant, therefore, could not have carried
out his intention when the victim was in hiding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As this Court has had occasion to rule in
People vs. <st1:country-region><st1:place>Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region>,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
circumstantial evidence is sufficient to convict.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, "Although there is no direct
evidence pointing to the accused as the person who inflicted the wound that
caused the death of the deceased, when the circumstances pointed out by the
lower Court constitute more than sufficient evidence to convince the appellate
court that he is the only person with sufficient motive to wish the death of
the deceased, it is held that the appellant was properly convicted of
homicide."</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense of alibi interposed by appellant cannot prosper in
the face of positive identification by prosecution witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant's witness, <span class="SpellE">Aquilino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Carpena</span>, merely stated that he saw appellant at <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, Laguna, at the place where the shows were being held
at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the
evening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The "abduction" was
effected earlier, or at <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9:00 o'clock</st1:time>,
Barrio <span class="SpellE">Palayan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nagcarlan</span>,
Laguna, where the crime was committed is more or less four (4) kilometers away
from <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, Laguna, and the distance between the two
places could be negotiated by walking for about an hour.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Appellant, therefore, has not established by convincing evidence that he was at
another place for such a period of time that it was impossible for him to have
been at the scene of the crime at the time of its commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As this Court has held, the defense of alibi
is an issue of fact that hinges on credibility and in this respect, the
relative weight which the trial Court assigns to the testimony of witnesses
must, unless patently and clearly inconsistent with the evidence on record, be
accepted.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Neither did the trial Court err in holding that the qualifying
circumstance of treachery was present in the commission of the offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the killing of the victim was carried
out without risk to appellant is shown by the fact that when the body's victim
was found, his hands were tied together at his back as, in fact, they were
already tied when he was forcibly taken from his home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had no clothes on except his underwear,
and he had a gaping wound on the abdomen from which his intestines protruded (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. "A", "A-1", "B",
"C" &amp; "C-1'').<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
killing of a victim while bound is regarded as treacherous.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
However, in so far as <span class="SpellE">nocturnity</span> is concerned, under
the circumstances ob­taining, it must be deemed absorbed in treachery, as it
cannot be perceived distinctly <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
There being no showing either that the other wounds found on the body of the
victim were inflicted to prolong his suffering before the fatal wound was
dealt, it cannot be concluded that the aggravating circumstance of cruelty was
duly proven.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">For consideration now is the effect of the extrajudicial
confession by appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fundamental
rule is that when the admission takes place after the prosecution has presented
its evidence, the mitigating circumstance of plea of guilty can no longer be
con­sidered.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
The extrajudicial confession herein was made during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of this appeal, for which reason, the mitigating circumstance of plea of guilty
can no longer be considered in appellant's favor.</p>

<p class="BODY">The crime committed herein is Murder, qualified by treachery,
with no other modifying circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The proper penalty is <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>
