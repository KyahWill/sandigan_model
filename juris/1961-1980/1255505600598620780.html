				<H3>EUGENIO CHAVEZ, PETITIONER VS. THE COURT OF AGRARIAN RELATIONS AND AQUILINO DE LOS REYES, RESPONDENTS. <BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MAKALINTAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR>On April 8,  1959  Eugenio Chavez  filed  a petition  in
    
respondent court  (5th Regional District, San Pablo City),
    
praying that respondent Aquilino  de los Reyes be ordered
    
to reinstate him  as tenant and to pay damages and attorney's fees.  On June 30, 1960  judgment was rendered
    
 dismissing the petition on  the ground that petitioner was
    
 not  a  tenant of  respondent.  By  subsequent  resolution
    
 the court declined to reconsider the dismissal. <div align="justify">
<p>Petitioner  appealed.  His  two   main  contentions  are:
      
(1)  the court's finding that he was  not a tenant of respondent is not  supported by substantial evidence; and
      
                
      

      
 (2)  under the  provisions  of Section  9 of Republic Act
      
 1199, as amended by  Republic  Act  2263,  he  should  be
      
 deemed to have  succeeded  his deceased father as tenant
      
 on respondent's  land.</p>
<p>The following facts,  stated by respondent court in  its
      
decision, appear  to be undisputed:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "Troadio Frontera was formerly the owner of a
parcel of riceland with an area of 1½ hectares, more or less, located
at Barrio Dalig, Balayan, Batangas. On this property the tenant was a
septuagenarian, one Pablo Chavez, who worked the same principally with
the aid of his son Eugenio Chavez, petitioner herein. Sometime in
1957., Aquilino de los Reyes, herein respondent, purchased the property
from Troadio Frontera, with the intention of working it himself, but
much as he desired, he could not take possession of the land because
the then incumbent tenant, Pablo Chavez, did not want to surrender the
land to its new owner.</p>
  <p>"On July
27, 1957, Aquilino de los Reyes filed a petition with this Court
against Pablo Chavez (CAR Case No. 136-Batangas 57), asking for
authority to dispossess said tenant, on grounds, firstly, that Pablo
Chavez was already incapacitated to work the land because of old age;
and secondly, that he wanted to work the land himself. Pablo Chavez
contested this suit claiming, as defenses, that he was then only 74
years of age and besides his son Eugenio Chavez was working the land
for him with the knowledge and consent of the former owner, and that
the landholder's action, in regard to the latter's intention to
cultivate the land himself, was premature because the landholder had
not complied with the provisions of Sec. 50(a) of Republic Act No. 1199
regarding service of notice of such intention to the tenant and to the
court. Pablo Chavez was represented in said CAR Case No. 136-Batangas
'57 by Attorney Ambrosio Flores, Supervising Trial Attorney of the
Agricultural Tenancy Commission. This suit was later on dismissed by
this Court, without prejudice, in an order dated January 4, 1958, on
motion of Aquilino de los Reyes and with the conformity of Pablo Chavez.</p>
  <p> "On October 21, 1958, Pablo  Chavez died  of  old  age (senility).
              
At that time the land was already planted with palay, which was
              
later to be harvested in  February, 1959."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> The lower court found further that on January 5, 1959 Crispina
Codizal, widow of Pablo Chavez, and petitioner Eugenio Chavez, in their
own names and in representation of the heirs of said Pablo Chavez,
entered into a written agreement (Exh. 2) with Troadio Frontera and
respondent Aquilino de los Reyes, in virtue of which the widow and the
heirs received from the last two the sum of P500.00 as full
compensation for the improvements introduced by Pablo Chavez on the
land. The agreement also provided that the heirs of Pablo Chavez would
continue to take care of the standing palay crop, the same to pertain
exclusively to them when harvested, and that thereafter they would no
longer have any right to the land and its improvements. Two days after
the agreement was signed Cristina Codizal, thru petitioner, attempted
to return the money to respondent, but the latter rejected it. After
the palay was harvested in February 1959 petitioner attempted to
deliver 30% of the net produce to respondent, upon whose refusal to
accept petitioner deposited it with the Chief of Police of Balayan,
Batangas. Respondent thereafter took possession of the land and started
cultivating it himself.</p>
<p>The first questions  here is  whether or  not petitioner
                
was respondent's tenant at the time the latter repossessed
                
the land.   The  Agrarian Court found that  he was not.
                
This  factual finding,  supported as it is by substantial
                
evidence, may no longer be reviewed by this  Court.<sup><font color="#ff0000">[1]</font></sup>   Petitioner testified that he was  merely helping his father
                
Pablo  Chavez, who  in  1956 was still strong,  enough to
                
work the  land.  This  entirely  belies  petitioner's  claim
                
that in 1954 he assumed tenancy  of  the  landholding  by
                
virtue of  a mutual agreement he and his father had  with
                
Troadio  Frontera because  at  that time his father was
                
already old and sickly.  Again, in the answer of Pablo
                
Chavez to respondent's  petition in CAR case No.  136-
                
Batangas, he staunchly  denied that  he could be evicted
                
for being old and sickly,  alleging that he  was  only  74 years old and that during his temporary incapacity his
                  
son, herein petitioner, performed  the actual cultivation
                  
of the land with the  knowledge and  consent of the land-owner; and although admitting that Aquilino de los Reyes
                  
was a good farmer and intended to work the land personally, therein  respondent Pablo Chavez averred by was
                  
of  defense  that the  action for eviction was premature
                  
because he had not been served notice pursuant to Section
                  
50, par.  (a), of  R.A, 1199.  That  petition was subsequently dismissed  without prejudice.  Petitioner herein,
                  
Eugenio Chavez, admittedly had knowledge of the case,
                  
but made no claim at all that he and not his father was
                  
already the tenant at  the time.</p>
<p>One  other circumstance  militates  against petitioner.
                    
This is the agreement he and his mother entered into
                    
with  Troadio  Frontera  and  respondent de  los  Reyes. 
                    
From  the tenor thereof  it  is apparent that whatever
                    
rights  petitioner might have in regard to the land stemmed
                    
from his being an heir of Pablo  Chavez, not from his
                    
being himself the tenant of respondent; and that as such
                    
heir he, together with the  other heirs, had nothing more
                    
to do with the land after the standing crop was harvested
                    
in February 1959.</p>
<p>Petitioner assails the validity of the agreement on the ground that
he did not voluntarily affix his thumbmark thereto. He does not,
however, allege that fraud, force or intimidation intervened in its
execution. The incontrovertible fact remains that he signed it, perhaps
with reluctance, but certainly not with that lack of volition which
would justify annulling the same. And regardless of the express terms
of the agreement, its clear implication is that up to his death on
October 21, 1958, Pablo Chavez was recognized by the parties as the
tenant of respondent on the land. That tenancy relationship was
terminated when he died, according to section 9 of Republic Act 1199.</p>
<p>  This bring us to the next question, concerning the effect
                      
of the amendment  to  the said  provision  in  Republic Act
                      
2263,  which took effect  on June 19, 1959.  As amended,
                      
the law  is that in ease of the tenant's death the tenancy
                      
relationship  shall  continue  between the  landholder  and
                      
one  member  of the tenant's immediate  farm household
                      
who is related to the tenant within the second degree by
                      
consanguinity  and  who  shall  cultivate the  land  himself
                      
personally.   Petitioner maintains that this new provision
                      
should apply in this case,  pursuant to section 22  of the
                      
same  amendatory act, which  states  that its  provisions "are applicable to all  cases pending in any court at the
                      
time of the  approval of this  act."  The ruling  of the
                      
respondent court on this  particular point is, in our opinion,
                      
correct.   It states:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"But then, it may be argued that  Republic Act No. 2263, which
                            
amends Section 9 of Republic Act No. 1199 and which makes its
                            
provisions applicable to cases pending at the time  of its approval,
                            
of which this case is one,  gives successional rights to the  heirs
                            
at the deceased tenant.  Petitioner  is  an  heir of the  deceased,
                            
Pablo Chavez; ergo<em>, </em>he is entitled  to succeed his  father,  so runs
                            
the argument.  This contention loses sight of the fact that at the
                            
time the  petitioner filed this case on April 6, 1959,  the law did not
                            
give any successional rights to the heirs of the deceased tenant.
                            
What has been legally extinguished—the tenancy relationship, that
                            
is—cannot be resurrected without impairing the substantive  right
                            
of the  landholder which has already become vested in him."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Succession presupposes the existence of a right or property in the
decedent to which the heir can succeed at the time transmission takes
place, that is, at the moment of death of the decedent. Since the law
in force on October 21, 1958, when the tenant Pablo Chavez died, was
Republic Act 1199, under which the tenancy relationship between him and
respondent De los Reyes was terminated by reason of such death, the
subsequent enactment of Republic Act 2263 did not operate to confer
upon petitioner any successional right to continue as tenant. We held
as much in the case of Ulpiendo <i>vs.</i> CAR 109 Phil.,
                          
             
                          

                          
964,  where  we  said: "The amendment to section 9, Republic Act No.  1199 by Republic Act No.  2263 providing
                            
for  the continuance of the relationship in  the event  of
                            
the tenants's death or incapacity 'between the  landholder
                            
and one member  of the  tenant's immediate farm household who is  related to the tenant within the second degree
                            
of consanguinity and who shall  cultivate the land himself
                            
personally * * *"  which took effect on  19 June  1959, cannot  be applied  retroactively." To hold otherwise  would
                              
lay open this particular provision of the  law to the objection
                              
of unconstitutionally,  on the ground  that  it  impairs  a
                              
substantive  right  that has  already  become vested.<sup><font color="#ff0000">[2]</font></sup></p>
<p> In any event, Section 9 of Republic Act 2263 provides an exception
to the right of succession by a relative of the tenant within the
second degree, namely,if the landholder "shall cultivate the land
himself personally or through the employment of mechanical farm
implements x x x." In fact he served notice upon Pablo Chavez and upon
the Agrarian Court on November 26, 1957 that he would take over the
land for that purpose, pursuant to Section 50 (a) of Republic Act 1199,
which required such notice at least one year before an ejectment case
could be instituted. Of course, the suit of ejectment became
unnecessary upon the death of Pablo Chavez resulting in the termination
of the tenancy relationship.</p>
<p>Wherefore,  the  judgment  appealed  from  is  affirmed,
                                    
with costs.</p>

<p>  <sup><font color="#ff0000">[2]</font></sup> As a general rule,
where there is no direct constitutional prohibition, the legislative
branch of government, whether federal or state, may pass retrospective
laws, such as, in their operation may affect pending suits and give to
a party a remedy which he did not previously possess, or modify an
existing remedy, or remove an impediment in the way of legal
proceedings. Such acts are of a remedial character and are the peculiar
subjects of legislation. x x x Where, of course a legislative act in
reference to pending litigation impairs vested rights it cannot be
upheld. 11 Am. Jur. 1212-1213. </p>
<p> The general rule, which is almost universally supported by the
authorities, is that retrospective laws are unconstitutional if they
disturb or destroy existing or vested rights, as where they disturb or
destroy existing or vested rights embodied in judgments or judicial
decisions, or create new obligations with respect to past transactions,
as by creating a substantive right, or a fundamental cause of action
where none existed before and making such right retroactive, or by
arbitrarily recreating a right or liability already extinguished by
operation of law. (16A C.J.S. 99-102).</p>
