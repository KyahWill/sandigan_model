therein plaintiffs instituted the present ap­peal, questioning the authority of
the City of <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> to impose a fee of P10.00 or
P5,00 as the case may be, for every cadaver coming from other places and buried
in private cemeteries within that city.</p>

Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cajote</span> and <span class="SpellE">Leopoldo</span>

charged by, and actually paid to, the City Treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span>
"entrance fees" for the burial of their re­spective relatives in the
La Loma cemetery, allegedly pursuant to Or­dinance No. 94, series of 1962,
filed the action in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span>
against the city government, its Mayor and Treasurer (<span class="SpellE">Civ</span>.
Case No. 9-C), contesting the legality of the afore­mentioned city ordinance, on
the ground that it was a revenue-raising measure which is beyond the taxing
authority of the defendant city government to enact, and praying that it be
declared <u>ultra</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>vires</u></span> and <u>void</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>ab</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>initio</u></span>, and that
the fees they paid to defendants be returned to them.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the defendants had filed their answer, the case was sub­mitted

the entrance fee in question".</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Based on those facts, the court dismissed
the case, on the ground that the questioned ordinance was authorized under the

and other pertinent laws.</p>

<p class="BODY">Defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, answering
plaintiffs-appellants' conten­tion that the collection of the amounts involved
in this appeal was unauthorized, claim that it was justified by the general
grant of taxation to chartered cities by Republic Act 2264, otherwise known as
the Local Autonomy Act and as a valid exercise of police power.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The issue in this case
calls for the determination of the validity of the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>
Ordinance No. 94, series of 1962, and of the col­lection from
plaintiffs-appellants of the so-called entrance fees, al­legedly made pursuant
to said ordinance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It may be pointed out that the disputed ordinance speaks of two
kinds of fees:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>one, in connection with
the exhumation of the remains (of a dead person), for P1.00, and the other,
imposed whenever a ca­daver is sought to be buried in that city coming from
other places, in the sum of P10.00 for an adult's, and P5.00 for a
child's.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Taken in its entirety, it is
clear that what is being regulated through this ordinance is not the burying of
the mortal remains of a person, but the exhuma­tion and transfer of a cadaver -
activities affecting corpses that had previously been buried.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">In </span>other
words, the term "transfer" used in the ordinance does not refer to
the conducting or conveying of an un­buried dead body from one place - let is
say, the funeral parlor or site where the vigil was held - to the burial
grounds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rather, the transfer permit
mentioned in the ordinance is required whenever a ca­daver, previously interred
in a burial place, is removed <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> for transfer
to a private cemetery in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the permit called for under the
ordinance is not for the burying of the dead may even be de­duced from the fact
that a "burial permit" is also being admittedly is­sued by defendant
municipal corporation for a fee of P0.50.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Further­more, it is noteworthy that while Ordinance No. 94 refers to a
"trans­<span style="">fer permit", the
amounts collected from plaintiffs-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> were re­</span>ceipted
for as "entrance fees" thereby giving rise to the presumption that
the defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> must have been aware that
the impos­ition of such transfer fees in the cases involved herein was indeed
unauthorized.</p>

<p class="BODY">The inescapable conclusion is that, although the ordinance which
regulates the exhumation and/or transfer of corpses from other burial grounds to
those located in the City of <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> is within the
legis­lative power of the respondent city government to enact,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a> the im<span style="">position
of the transfer fees <span style="">under Ordinance
No.94, on the interment </span>of the respective dead relatives of herein
appellants in the La Loma cemetery, was not justified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellants' prayer, therefore, for the return
by </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span style="">defendant</span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style=""> Treasurer of the alleged entrance fees, must
be granted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">With regard to the defenses interposed on behalf of the respon­dent
City, premised upon the provisions of the Local Autonomy Act, suffice it to
observe that, while section 2 (on Taxation) of Republic Act 2264 confers on
chartered cities <span style="">and municipalities </span>-?</p>

<blockquote>"authority to impose municipal license
taxes or fees upon<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>persons engaged in
any occupation or business, or exercising privileges</u> in chartered cities or
municipal­ities <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>by requiring them to secure licenses at
rates fixed by the municipal board or city council",</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">respondents
have failed to show that the persons merely burying a cadaver in a private
cemetery constitutes either an occupation or business or the exercise of
privileges that would justify the imposition of taxes thereon within the terms
and intent </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the enabling act, the
terms em­ployed by the statute in themselves <span style="">denoting <span class="SpellE">habituality</span> or a repetition </span>of
acts, and not a solitary act.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent City also endeavors to justify the fees prescribed by
the ordinance in question as a proper exercise of the police power, claiming
that it -?</p>

<blockquote>"involves the assignment of police
officers to insure that the funeral procession <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>is
orderly so as not to cause great and serious inconvenience to the public.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the procession traffic has to be
re-routed at times; policemen have to use the city's motorcycles or cars; the
streets and other City property have to suf­fer certain degree of
depreciation."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Brief for <span class="SpellE">Appel­lees</span>, pp. 24-25).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">While undeniably the above-described activity of city officers is
called for by every funeral procession, <span style="">yet
we </span>are left without ex­planation why the Ordinance should collect the
prescribed fees sole­ly in the case of cadavers coming <u>from places outside</u>
the <st1:place><st1:placetype>territory</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:placename></st1:place> City for burial in <u>private</u>
cemeteries within the City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Surely,
whether the corpse comes from without or within the City limits, and whether
interment is to be made in private or public cemeteries, the City police must
regulate traffic, and must use their City cars or motorcycles to maintain
order; and the City streets must suffer some degree of erosion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clearly, then, the ordinance in question does
unjustifiably discriminate against private cemeteries, in violation of the
equal protection clause of the Constitution, <span style="">a </span>defect adequate to invalidate the questioned portion of the
measure.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the decision appealed from is reversed and the
questioned portion of Ordinance No. 94, series of 1962 of the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:place></st1:city>, is declared <u>ultra</u>
