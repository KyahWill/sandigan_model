				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Abra</span>, in its Criminal Case No. 626, finding the two
appellants Juan <span class="SpellE">Brioso</span> and Mariano <span class="SpellE">Taeza</span> guilty of murder, and sentencing each to suffer life
imprisonment and to indemnify, jointly and severally, the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Silvino</span> <span class="SpellE">Daria</span> in the sum of P6<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> but without subsidiary imprisonment in case of
insolvency, and to pay the costs.</p>

<blockquote>An information filed by the Provincial Fiscal dated 16 January 1967
charged the two accused, Juan <span class="SpellE">Brioso</span> and Mariano <span class="SpellE">Taeza</span>, with the crime of murder under Article 248 of the
Revised Penal Code, committed as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 23rd day of December, 1966, in the
Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Tayum</span>, Province of <span class="SpellE">Abra</span>, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this
Honorable court, the above-named accused, armed with firearms of different
calibers, by con federating and mutually helping one another, with deliberate
intent to kill and without justifiable motive, with treachery and evident
premeditation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and felonious­ly,
assault, attack and shot one, <span class="SpellE">Silvino</span> <span class="SpellE">Daria</span>, in­flicting upon him multiple gunshot wounds on the
different parts of his body, which wounds caused his death thereafter.</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">CONTRARY TO LAW, with the aggravating circumstances in the
commission of the crime, to wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a)
treachery and evident premeditation; (b) advantage was taken of superior
strength; and (c) with the use of firearm."</p>

<p class="BODY">The records of the case show that on <st1:date year="1966" day="23" month="12">23 December 1966</st1:date>, between 8 and 9 in the
evening, the spouses <span class="SpellE">Silvino</span> <span class="SpellE">Daria</span>
and Susana <span class="SpellE">Tumalip</span> were in their house at barrio <span class="SpellE">Tiker</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tayum</span>, <span class="SpellE">Abra</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="GramE">husband was making rope
in the annex of their house, while</span> the wife, four meters away, was
applying candle wax to a flat iron.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Silvino</span> <span class="SpellE">Daria</span> was using a lamp
where he worked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Outside, the night was
bright because of the moon overhead.</p>

<p class="BODY">Cecilia Bernal, a niece and neighbor of the spouses, was alarmed
by the barking of dogs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She peeped
through a crack in the wall of her house and saw appellants herein pass
southward in the direction of the house of <span class="SpellE">Silvino</span> <span class="SpellE">Daria</span> that was six meters away. <span style="">&nbsp;</span><span class="SpellE">Brioso</span> was carrying
a long gun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her suspicions awakened, she
went downstairs and, shielded by the fence, witnessed each appellant point a
gun at the bamboo wall of <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Daria</span></span><span class="GramE">' s</span> house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two
detonations followed, and there­after she heard <span class="SpellE">Daria</span>
moaning and his wife call for help, saying her husband had been shot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Bernal went to the house and found the victim
prostrate, wounded and unable to speak.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The widow, however, testified that right after being shot, she rushed to
her husband's side and he told her that he was shot by Juan <span class="SpellE">Brioso</span>
and Mariano <span class="SpellE">Taeza</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Silvino</span> <span class="SpellE">Daria</span>
expired one hour later as a result of gunshot wounds in the abdomen and
leg.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A few days later, Cecilia Bernal
and the widow, Susana <span class="SpellE">Tumalip</span>, executed affidavits
pointing to the two accused as the killers (Exhibits "B" and
"C", respectively).</p>

<p class="BODY">The cause of the death of <span class="SpellE">Silvino</span> <span class="SpellE">Daria</span> was "Shock due to severe hemorrhage secondary to
gunshot wounds at the abdomen and leg", as found by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Isabelo</span> B. Lucas, Municipal Health Officer of <span class="SpellE">Tayum</span>, <span class="SpellE">Abra</span>, contained in his
Medico-Legal Necropsy Report, Exhibit "A".</p>

<p class="BODY">The motive for the killing appears to have been the dis­approval
by the spouses <span class="SpellE">Silvino</span> and Susana <span class="SpellE">Daria</span>
of Mariano <span class="SpellE">Taeza's</span> courtship of <span class="GramE">their</span>
daughter, <span class="SpellE">Angelita</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Angelita</span> was even sent to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
for her to avoid Mariano <span class="SpellE">Taeza</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The courtship is admitted by Mariano <span class="SpellE">Taeza</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The two accused appealed the conviction and assigned the fol­lowing
errors as committed by the court <u>a quo</u>:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The lower court erred in relying on the
uncorroborated and contradictory testimony and statement of the prosecution
witness Cecilia Bernal on the physical identity of the accused;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The lower court erred in disregarding the
affidavit (Exhibit 2) of Antonio <span class="SpellE">Daria</span>, son of the
deceased, clearing the accused Mariano <span class="SpellE">Taeza</span>, which
affidavit had been identified in court by the fiscal before whom the same was
executed; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The lower court erred in finding the accused
guilty of the crime of murder.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The assigned errors are discussed
together, being closely interrelated.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find no discrepancy in the testimony of Cecilia Bernal on the
material points.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She stated that she did
not see Mariano <span class="SpellE">Taeza</span> carry a gun when both the
accused passed by.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But this brief
observation does not necessarily mean that he was not actually armed or carrying
a gun on his person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that he
did was proved when both the said accused were seen pointing their respective
gun at the victim and each subsequently fired once at him, <span class="SpellE">Taeza</span>
using a short weapon (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span> <span class="SpellE">Millare</span>,
page 17) that could have been carried concealed in his person.</p>

<p class="BODY">The house of Cecilia Bernal was only six meters away from that of
<span class="SpellE">Silvino</span> <span class="SpellE">Daria's</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The night was brightly illuminated by the
moon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ce­cilia Bernal had known both
accused for a long time and it is admitted that they also know her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There could have been no difficulty in
identifying the accused under the circumstances.</p>

<p class="BODY">Cecilia Bernal had no motive to impute falsely this heinous
charge of murder against the above-said accused, considering that Mariano <span class="SpellE">Taeza</span> is a nephew of the deceased by a first degree
cousin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even Juan <span class="SpellE">Brioso</span>
specifically said that he knew of no reason why she should testify against
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, her statement that she came
to court only to tell the truth should be believed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The witness also stated that she was hard of
hearing and could not understand some of the questions; thus, the alleged
inconsistencies in her testimony do not detract from the "positive and
straightforward"<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
identification of the accused as the ones who were seen at the scene of the
crime and who actually shot <span class="SpellE">Silvino</span> <span class="SpellE">Daria</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is noteworthy that the trial judge observed witness Bernal
closely, warning her several times not to exaggerate, yet in the decision gave
her full credence, being obviously satisfied of her truthfulness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The general rule, based on logic and
experience, is that the findings of the judge who tried the case and heard the
wit­nesses are not disturbed on appeal, unless there are substantial facts and
circumstances which have been overlooked and which, if properly considered,
might affect the result of the case<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>,
which in this case have not been shown to exist.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the testimony of Cecilia Bernal finds corroboration in
the declaration of the victim, who told his wife that it was Juan <span class="SpellE">Brioso</span> and Mariano <span class="SpellE">Taeza</span> who shot
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This statement does satisfy the re­quirements
of an ante mortem statement. Judged by the nature and extent of his wounds, <span class="SpellE">Silvino</span> <span class="SpellE">Daria</span> must have realized
the seriousness of his condition, and it can be safely inferred that he made
the same under the consciousness of impending death<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>,
considering that he died only one hour after being shot.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense of both the accused is <u>alibi</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mariano <span class="SpellE">Taeza's</span> own
account was that in the evening of <st1:date year="1966" day="23" month="12">23
 December 1966</st1:date> he was at the barrio clinic of <span class="SpellE">Tiker</span>
playing the guitar with Antonio <span class="SpellE">Daria</span> (son of the
deceased), <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> <span class="SpellE">Valera</span>
and Jose <span class="SpellE">Cabais</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While in the said place, they heard two gun explosions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon afterwards, <span class="SpellE">Macrino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Arzadon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Taurino</span> Flores
came running towards them, informing Antonio <span class="SpellE">Daria</span>
that his father was already dead. </p>

<p class="BODY">Exhibit "2", the alleged affidavit of Antonio <span class="SpellE">Daria</span>, was presented in court to corroborate Mariano <span class="SpellE">Taeza's</span> testimony.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But while the said affidavit was identified by the Provincial Fiscal as
having been subscribed and sworn to before him, he also stated that he did not
know Antonio <span class="SpellE">Daria</span> personally and that was the only
time he appeared before him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Exhibit
"2" does not have the seal of the <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span>
Office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More­over, the said exhibit was
never identified by the supposed affiant and there was no opportunity for the
prosecution to cross-examine him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
stated in People vs. Mariquina<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">4</span></span></a>, affidavits are generally not
prepared by the affiants themselves but by another who uses his own language in
writing the affiants' statements, which may thus be either omitted or
misunderstood by the one writing them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For this reason, and for the further reason that the adverse party is
deprived of the opportunity to cross-examine the affiants, affidavits are
generally rejected in a judicial proceeding as hearsay, unless the affiants
themselves are placed on the witness stand to testify thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view hereof, <span class="GramE">We</span>
find Exhibit "2" of no probative value, and that the lower court did
not err when it rejected the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
this con­nection, it is <span class="SpellE">markworthy</span> that the
prosecuting attorney stated in open court that Antonio <span class="SpellE">Daria</span>
had also executed another affidavit (Exhibit "D") in the <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span> office "to the effect that he went to the
office of defense counsel, - - - - - - - - and there affixed his <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span> on a statement that was never read to
him".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Be that as it may, not one of
the other persons who, Mariano <span class="SpellE">Taeza</span> claimed, were
with him in the barrio clinic (<span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> <span class="SpellE">Valera</span> and Jose <span class="SpellE">Cabais</span>) was
produced in court to support his <u>alibi</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Mariano <span class="SpellE">Taeza's</span> testimony, therefore, remains
uncorroborated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has been repeatedly
held that in the face of direct evidence, <u>alibi</u> is necessarily a weak
defense and becomes more so if uncorroborated.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">5</span></span></a> It is worse if the <u>alibi</u>
could have been corroborated by other persons mentioned by the accused but they
are not presented.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">6</span></span></a><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY">By Mariano <span class="SpellE">Taeza's</span> own admission, he
and the other accused, Juan <span class="SpellE">Brioso</span>, are close
friends.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was shown that Mariano <span class="SpellE">Taeza's</span> house is only about two hundred meters from that of
<span class="SpellE">Silvino</span> <span class="SpellE">Daria's</span> and that
the barrio clinic is only about eighty to one hundred meters from the said
victim's place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mariano <span class="SpellE">Taeza</span> himself stated that <span class="SpellE">Silvino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Daria</span> died "may be less than thirty minutes, may
be five minutes" after his arrival-at the victim's house with the latter's
son and other persons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As held in
another case<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">7</span></span></a>
the defense of <u>alibi</u> is so weak that in order to be believed there
should be a demonstration of physical impossibility for the accused to have
been at the scene of the crime at the time of its commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mariano <span class="SpellE">Taeza</span> was
so near the victim's house that it was easy for him to be there when the
shooting occurred.</p>

<p class="BODY">The other accused, Juan <span class="SpellE">Brioso</span>, stated
that he was in <span class="SpellE">sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Catungawan</span>,
barrio <span class="SpellE">Basbasa</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tayum</span>, on <st1:date year="1966" day="23" month="12">23 December 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was there upon invita­tion of his first
cousin, <span class="SpellE">Nestorio</span> Flores, to cut and mill sugar
cane.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He left his house in <span class="SpellE">Addamay</span> at 8 in the morning of the said day, arriving in <span class="SpellE">Catungawan</span> before the <st1:time minute="0" hour="12">noon</st1:time>
meal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They cut sugar cane from 4 to 5 in
the afternoon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At <st1:time minute="30" hour="18">6:30</st1:time>, after supper, he, his cousin, and the latter's son,
Felix Flores, started milling the sugar cane which they had cut.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The milling lasted up to 2 in the early
morning of the following day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He never
left the place where they were milling.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He learned of the death of <span class="SpellE">Silvino</span> <span class="SpellE">Daria</span> only when he returned to <span class="SpellE">Addamay</span>
because his parents informed him of the news.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He admitted knowing Cecilia Bernal and that she likewise knows him.</p>

<p class="BODY">He denied being a close friend of Mariano <span class="SpellE">Taeza</span>
(thereby con­tradicting Mariano <span class="SpellE">Taezas</span> s testimony)<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">8</span></span></a>;
denied that he had gone to the house of <span class="SpellE">Angelita</span> <span class="SpellE">Daria</span>, and his having knowledge of the courtship of <span class="SpellE">Angelita</span> by Mariano <span class="SpellE">Taeza</span>; or
that both of them used to drink and go out together.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On cross-examination, however, he admitted
that he went with Mariano <span class="SpellE">Taeza</span> when they attended
dances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One such occasion was during the
birthday of his first degree cousin in <span class="SpellE">Addamay</span> way
back in 1965.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Nestorio</span> Flores was presented to
corroborate the <u>alibi</u> of the accused.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But while both exhibited wonderful memory as to what happened between
sunset and <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time> of <st1:date year="1966" day="23" month="12">23 December 1966</st1:date>, they contradict
each other as to what happened in the earlier hours or events.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As already stated, Juan <span class="SpellE">Brioso</span>
testified that he left his place in <span class="SpellE">Addamay</span> at 8 in
the morning and arrived at his cousin's house before the <st1:time minute="0" hour="12">noon</st1:time> meal of <st1:date year="1966" day="23" month="12">23
 December 1966</st1:date>; but <span class="SpellE">Nestorio</span> Flares
asserted that it was 8 in the morning when Juan <span class="SpellE">Brioso</span>
arrived.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Brioso</span>
claimed that they cut sugar cane from 4 to 5 in the afternoon of the said
day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His cousin testified that they cut
sugar cane in the morning after <span class="SpellE">Brioso's</span> arrival
until lunchtime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Brioso</span>
stated that they milled sugar cane for the third time in that place in 1966,
the first occasion being on 29 November and the second on 8 December.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:place>Flores</st1:place> denied this,
saying that they did not cut sugar cane in November, 1966, although in other
years they did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He further stated that
it was already in December of that year that <span class="SpellE">Brioso</span>
came.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the same witness showed
uncertainty as to the exact date, when he answered even on direct examination
that "may be that was the time when he came".<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">9</span></span></a> In cases of positive identification
of the culprit by reliable witnesses, it has been held that the defense of <u>alibi</u>
must be established by "full, clear and satisfactory evidence."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">10</span></span></a>
It is obvious that this witness, who is a close relative of the accused, was
merely presented in court in an attempt to save Juan <span class="SpellE">Brioso</span>
from punishment for the crime committed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We believe the trial court when it found that the witness has an in­terest
in the fate of the accused Juan <span class="SpellE">Brioso</span>, and,
therefore, his testimony should not be given credence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Evidence also shows that from <span class="SpellE">Tiker</span> to <span class="SpellE">Catungawan</span> <span class="GramE">is</span> only about nine
kilometers and only a two-hour walk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
place is also accessible by motor transportation, although motor vehicles are
allegedly rare in the said place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As in
the case of Mariano <span class="SpellE">Taeza</span>, it was not physically
impossible for Juan <span class="SpellE">Brioso</span> to be at the <u>locus <span class="SpellE">criminis</span></u> at the time the crime was committed.</p>

<p class="BODY">It has been clearly and sufficiently proved that the killing of <span class="SpellE">Silvino</span> <span class="SpellE">Daria</span> was qualified by
treachery <u>(<span class="SpellE">alevosia</span></u>)<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">11</span></span></a> <span class="GramE">The</span> victim was quietly making rope in his own house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was caught off-guard and defenseless when
suddenly and unexpectedly the two accused fired at him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had no chance either to evade or repel the
aggression.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court correctly
held that treachery absorbs <span class="SpellE">nocturnity</span> and abuse of
superior strength.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">12</span></span></a> But while these aggravating
circumstances are always included in the qualifying cir­cumstance of treachery,
the commission of the crime in the victim's dwelling is not,<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">13</span></span></a>
hence the crime is murder attended by one aggravating circumstance, which has
been held to be present where the victim was shot inside his house although the
triggerman was outside.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">4</span></span> There being no mitigating circumstance
to offset it, the apposite penalty is death.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, for lack of sufficient votes, the penalty imposable is reduced
to life imprisonment.</p>
