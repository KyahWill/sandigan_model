Appeals dismissing the present case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner is the registered owner of Lot No. 2955 of the Cadas­tral
Survey of <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>, containing an area of 10,364
square meters, more or less, located in the barrio of <span class="SpellE">Macasandig</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> de <span class="SpellE">Oro</span> City, <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Oriental.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Alleging that on <st1:date year="1964" day="16" month="9">September 16,
 1964</st1:date>, he was compelled by the Municipal Judge of <span class="SpellE">Baungon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Imbatug</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bukidnon</span>, to appear before the latter's office and then and
there coerced and forced, under threat of prosecution and loss of said Lot No.
2955, in its entirety, to execute a deed of <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>
of one-half thereof to herein respondent <span class="SpellE">Vivencia</span>
Velez <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Gaerlan</span>,
petitioner, acting through Atty. Tommy C. <span class="SpellE">Pacana</span>,
filed with the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span>
Oriental a complaint, dated <st1:date year="1965" day="26" month="4">April 26,
 1965</st1:date> - which was docketed as Civil Case No. 2521 of said Court <sup>_
</sup>against Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Gaerlan</span>, for the annulment of said
deed of <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>, with damages and other
incidental <span class="SpellE">reliefs</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In her answer with counterclaim, dated May 13, 1965, filed by
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Pantaleon</span> Z. <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>,
Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Gaerlan</span> admitted the execution of the contested
deed of <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> before the municipal judge of <span class="SpellE">Baungon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bukidnon</span>, and alleged
that the subject matter of said deed is part of a bigger lot of over 15,000
square meters, which, long before the war, had been entrusted to the care and
administration of petitioner's father; that, upon the latter's death, said land
was partitioned between petitioner and his brother, Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Bacarro</span>,
who got a portion of about 5,000 square meters, the rest, with an area of over
10,000 square meters, having been left with petitioner herein; that, through fraud
and grave abuse of confidence, petitioner and Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Bacarro</span>
had caused their respective shares in said land to be registered in their
names; and that heeding the pleas for mercy of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Gaerlan</span>
and her daughter, Miss <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span> <span class="SpellE">Gaerlan</span>,
petitioner executed freely and voluntarily the contested deed of <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 13, 1966, Attys. <span class="SpellE">Cecilio</span>
P. <span class="SpellE">Luminarias</span> and Alfredo C. Caballero entered their
appearance, in said Case No. 2521, as counsel for petitioner herein, ''in
collaboration with Atty. Tommy C. <span class="SpellE">Pacana</span>, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> with a request that
henceforth notices and other processes incident hereto be likewise
furnished" said attorneys.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
same date, Hon. Bernardo <span class="SpellE">Teves</span>, as Judge of the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Oriental, Branch IV,
issued, in said Civil Case No. 2521, an order reading:</p>

<blockquote>"Considering the manifestation of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>
for the defendant, which is well-taken, the plaintiff is hereby directed to
make the proper amendment to his complaint within ten (10) days and furnish a
copy of the document to Atty. <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Failure to comply with this order will result
in the dismissal of this complaint."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On September 27, 1966, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Gaerlan</span>
filed a written manifesta­tion inviting attention to the fact that petitioner
had not complied with said order of September 13, 1966, despite the expiration
of the period of time therein set forth, and to the case of Castillo v. <span class="SpellE">Sebullina</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
in which the Supreme Court upheld the dismissal of said case, by the trial
Judge, upon refusal of counsel for the plaintiff to recall the witnesses whose
testimony had been taken, at a former hearing, before another judge, said
counsel having insisted on their right to rely upon the transcript of the notes
taken of the aforementioned tes­timony.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereupon, Judge <span class="SpellE">Teves</span> issued an order of the
same date (September 27, 1966) dismissing the complaint as well as - "upon
manifestation of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>" - the
counterclaim of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Gaerlan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On or about <st1:date year="1966" day="25" month="10">October 25,
 1966</st1:date>, a "motion for reconsideration and/or new trial" was
filed by Atty. Caballero, on behalf of petitione<span style="">r </span>herein, "<u>after duly relieving his previous counsel</u>."
In support thereof, petitioner alleged, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>,
that Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Gaerlan</span> had not filed any pleading
objecting to his complaint; that Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Gaerlan</span> is the
one in possession of the contested deed of <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>
in her favor; and that when the case was called before Branch II of the Court,
her counsel was furnished by petitioner's counsel, in open court, a true copy
of the contested document, after the filing of her answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's affidavit of merit was attached,
as <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. A, to said motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In said affidavit, petitioner asserted that
the land in question had been acquired by his father by virtue of a deed of
sale executed, in his favor, by Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Gaerlan</span>, on <st1:date year="1909" day="8" month="10">October 8, 1909</st1:date>, and duly
acknowledged before a notary public on the same date, copy of which deed of
sale is attached as <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. A-1 to said affidavit of
merit and to the motion for reconsideration and/or new trial; that, at the
hearing of the lot in question in the corresponding cadastral proceedings,
nobody, except the peti­tioner herein, claimed said lot; and that he had not
been furnished copy of the contested deed of <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The motion was denied by Judge <span class="SpellE">Teves</span> in
an order dated <st1:date year="1966" day="14" month="11">November 14, 1966</st1:date>,
copy of which was served on the same day upon Atty. <span class="SpellE">Pacana</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Notice of said order was not received by
Atty. Caballero until <st1:date year="1967" day="15" month="3">March 15, 1967</st1:date>,
on which date he filed the corresponding notice of appeal, appeal bond and
record on appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On March 31, 1967,
Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Gaerlan</span> objected to the approval of said record
on appeal, upon the ground, among others, that the period to appeal should be
reckoned from November 14, 1966, when copy of the order of the same date was
served upon Atty. <span class="SpellE">Pacana</span>, and that the orders of
September 27 (dismissing the complaint) and November 14, 1966 (denying the
motion for reconsideration and/or new trial) were, therefore, final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, when Atty. Caba­llero filed, on March 15, 1967,
the notice of appeal, appeal bond and record on appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon this ground, Judge <span class="SpellE">Teves</span>
disapproved the record on appeal and dismissed petitioner's appeal in an order
dated <st1:date year="1967" day="15" month="4">April 15, 1967</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's motion for reconsideration of
this order was similarly denied on <st1:date year="1967" day="27" month="5">May
 27, 1967</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="30" month="5">May 30, 1967</st1:date>,
petitioner filed with the Court of Appeals a petition - docketed therein as
CA-G. R. No. 39632-R - against Judge <span class="SpellE">Teves</span> and Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Gaerlan</span>, to review by <i>certiorari</i> the afore­mentioned
orders of Judge <span class="SpellE">Teves</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By a resolution dated July 17, 1967, the
Court of Appeals dismissed said petition, upon the ground that the period to
appeal from the orders complained of should be computed from said notice to
Atty. Tommy C. <span class="SpellE">Pacana</span>, on Novem­ber 14, 1966, and
that, consequently, the notice of appeal, appeal bond and record on appeal
filed by Atty. Caballero on March 15, 1967, were "three months late."
Hence, the present petition for review against the Court of Appeals, Judge <span class="SpellE">Teves</span> and Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Gaerlan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue in this case hinges on whether or not petitioner's
period to appeal from the order of Judge <span class="SpellE">Teves</span>, dated
November 14, 1966, denying his (petitioner's) motion for reconsideration and/or
new trial, of October 25, 1966, began to run on November 14, 1966, when copy of
said order was served upon petitioner's original counsel, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Pacana</span>, or on March 15, 1967, when no­tice of said order
was served upon Atty. Caballero.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Citing
Olivares and <span class="SpellE">Colegio</span> de <st1:city><st1:place>San Jose</st1:place></st1:city>
vs. Leola, et al.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a>, Judge <span class="SpellE">Teves</span>
adopted the first alternative and so did the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
true that, in <st1:country-region><st1:place>U. S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
vs. Borromeo,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">3</span></span></a> the Supreme Court held that:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No substitution of attorneys will be allowed
unless the following requisites concur:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There must always be filed a written
application for such substitution.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There must always be filed the written con­sent
of the client to such substitution.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There must always be filed the written con­sent
of the attorney substituted if such consent can be obtained.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In case such written consent can not be
procured, there must be filed with the application for sub­stitution proof of
the service of notice of such motion in the manner required by the rules upon
the attorney to be substituted.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Unless these formalities are complied with no substitution
will be permitted and the attorney who pro­perly appeared last in the cause
before such applica­tion for substitution will be regarded as the attorney of
record and will be held responsible for the proper conduct of the cause."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is conceded that this rule governs the <u><span style="">substitution</span></u><span style=""> </span>of attor­neys, but this is <u>not</u>
the question confronting Us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By entering
his appearance on September 13, Atty. Caballero did <u>not</u> substitute Atty.
Tommy C. <span class="SpellE">Pacana</span>, but became <u>one</u> of the
attorneys for the petitioner herein, "in collaboration with Atty. <span class="SpellE">Pacana</span>." Neithe<span style="">r
</span><span style="">did Atty. Caballero substitute
or try to substitute the latter on </span><st1:date year="1966" day="25" month="10"><span style="">Octo­ber 25, 1966</span></st1:date><span style="">, when petitioner's motion for
reconsideration and/or new trial, of that date, was filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Atty. Caballero was petitioner's counsel
since </span><st1:date year="1966" day="13" month="9"><span style="">September 13, 1966</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The statement in said motion
for reconsideration and/or new trial of October 25, 1966, to the effect that,
through Atty. Caballero, petitioner, "after duly reliev­ing his previous
counsel," moved "for the reconsideration of the order of x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> September 27, 1966, and/or
for new trial," had the effect of <u>retaining</u> Caballero, or <u>continuing</u>
his services, as coun­sel for the petitioner, and <u>dropping</u> Atty. <span class="SpellE">Pacana</span> as such counsel.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The question narrows down, therefore, to whether petitioner could
- <u>as regards the Court and Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Gaerlan</span></u> -
validly dispense with the services of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Pacana</span>,
without securing his consent, or without proof that he had been notified of
petitioner's aforemen­tioned motion for reconsideration and/or new trial, or
without any notice thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The answer
is in the affirmative, for "(a) client may at <u>any</u> time dismiss his
attorney x <span class="SpellE">x</span> x",<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">4</span></span></a> without
prejudice, of course, to such rights as the latter may have against the former.
Independently of such rights, if any, the relations between Atty. <span class="SpellE">Pacana</span> and petitioner herein, as attorney and client,
ceased, therefore, from the <u>filing</u> of said motion for reconsideration
and/or new trial, insofar as the Court is concerned, and from the receipt of
copy thereof by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>, insofar as Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Gaerlan</span> was concerned.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, it was Atty. <u>Caballero</u>, <u>not</u> Atty. <span class="SpellE">Pacana</span>, to whom Atty. <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>
served copy of his pleading <u>subsequently</u> to <st1:date year="1966" day="25" month="10">October 25, 1966</st1:date>,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">5</span></span></a> thereby
indicating that he (Atty. <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>) no longer
considered Atty. <span class="SpellE">Pacana</span> as one of the attorneys for
the petitioner herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact,
in her opposition to the motion for reconsideration and/or new trial, as well
as in her opposition to the motion for reconsideration of the order of April
15, 1967, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Gaerlan</span> referred to Atty. Alfredo
Caballero as "Counsel for the Plaintiff, " thus leaving no room for
doubt that she no longer con­sidered Atty. <span class="SpellE">Pacana</span> as
one of his (petitioner's) attorneys, in view of the statement in said motion
for reconsideration and/or new trial, to the effect that he (Atty. <span class="SpellE">Pacana</span>) had been duly re­lieved as petitioner's
counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Similarly, the order of <st1:date year="1966" day="14" month="11">November 14, 1966</st1:date>, which opens with
the statement "acting upon the motio<span style="">n
</span><span style="">for reconsideration and/or new
trial, filed by Atty. Alfredo C. Caballero, <u>counsel for plaintiff</u> x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>" - not <u>one</u> of the
attorneys for plaintiff - suggests that Judge <span class="SpellE">Teves</span>
had drawn the same con­clusion from the aforementioned statement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In this connection, it is noteworthy that, although the rule laid
down in U. S. v. Borromeo<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">6</span></span></a> was
quoted with approval in Olivares and <span class="SpellE">Colegio</span> de San
Jose v. Leola, et al.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">7</span></span></a>, the
decision in the latter case explicitly adverted to the fact that the record
thereof <u>failed</u> to show that the party concerned "had dispensed with
the services" of its original counsel.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the case at bar, petitioner's aforesaid motion for reconsideration
and/or new trial positively stated, not only that he had relieved his previous
counsel, but, also, that this had been "duly" done, thereby
indicating that the matter had been taken up with Atty. <span class="SpellE">Pacana</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, there is no­thing in the record to
indicate the contrary or that Atty. <span class="SpellE">Pacana</span> still
claims to represent or to be entitled to represent petitioner herein.</p>

<p class="BODY">Again, in <span class="SpellE">Rustia</span> vs. Judge of First
Instance<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">8</span></span></a>, a case was dismissed on motion of the plaintiffs,
without the intervention of his attorney of record,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">9</span></span></a> based
upon a compromise agreement en­tered into with the defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although said attorney was notified neither
of said motion nor of the order of dismissal, the validity of the compromise
agreement and of the order of dismissal was upheld upon the ground that,
"(b)y appearing personally and presenting a motion they (plaintiffs)
impliedly dismissed their lawyer," for <span style="">"a client may dismiss his lawyer at any time" and has
"an undoubted right to compromise a suit without the intervention of his
lawyer." Now, if a party may thus "impliedly" dismiss his
counsel, it stands to reason that the dismissal may be made by stating in a
pleading, like the above-mentioned motion for reconsideration and/or new trial,
that said counsel had been duly relieved as such by his client, even if the
former had not been served notice or copy of the motion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="text-transform: uppercase;">In view of the
foregoing</span></b>, We hold that respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Teves</span>
had committed a grave abuse of discretion amounting to excess of jurisdiction
in refusing to approve petitioner's record on appeal and in dismissing his
appeal in the aforementioned Civil Case No. 2521, <span style="">and that the Court of Appeals had, likewise, erred in dismissing </span>the
petition for <i>certiorari</i> filed by petitioner herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the resolution of the Court of Appeals
complained of should be, as it is hereby reversed, and the orders of Judge <span class="SpellE">Teves</span>, dated April 15 and <st1:date year="1967" day="27" month="5">May 27, 1967</st1:date>, are, in turn, annulled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Teves</span>
