Co. Ltd., <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span> <span class="SpellE">Unchuan</span>
and International Construction Corporation claimed from the Armed Forces of the
Philippines P3<span class="GramE">,601,971.84</span> for extra work done <span style="">as </span>contractors on the <span class="SpellE">Mactan</span> Airfield.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Secretary of National Defense wanted to pay only P<span style="">659<span class="GramE">,935</span> </span>for said extra work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The parties aforementioned submitted the
dispute to arbitration under Republic Act 876.</p>

<p class="BODY">After hearing said parties, on <st1:date year="1961" day="21" month="4">April 21, 1961</st1:date> the arbitrator awarded P2<span class="GramE">,372,331.40</span>
in favor of the claimants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A petition
was thereupon filed by said claimants in the Court <span style="">of </span>First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, on <st1:date year="1961" day="19" month="5">May <span style="">19, </span>1961</st1:date>,
for con­firmation of the award, as provided for in the same Repub­lic Act 876.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Armed Forces of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
thru the Secretary of National Defense, was furnished a copy <span style="">of said pe</span>tition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No answer was filed, but the Secretary of
National Defense sent a letter to the court stating that the project involved
"is a joint venture of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and P.I. governments under the Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement and is
financed exclusively by <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
funds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, although the
arbitrator's decision has already been accepted by the General Military Council
<span class="SpellE">chairmanned</span> by the Secretary of National Defense, the
same has to be concurred in by the Chief Advisor, JUSMAG, representing the <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
government, in order to give it binding effect."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The petition </span>was <span style="">consequently heard </span><u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1961" day="3" month="7"><span style="">July 3, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="">, the Court of First Instance rendered its </span>decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And on <st1:date year="1961" day="13" month="7">July 13, 1961</st1:date>, the Secretary of National Defense received
a copy of the decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Five months
later</u>, on <st1:date year="1961" day="12" month="12">December 12, 1961</st1:date>,
after the writ execution had been issued and garnishment made pursuant thereto,
the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
filed with the aforesaid court a motion for intervention with motion to set
aside the decision and stay execution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It assailed the propriety of the arbitration in the absence of
stipulation in the contract providing for it and further reiterated the
contention that the concurrence of the Joint U.S. Military Advisory Group
(JUSMAG) was needed to give effect to the award.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners opposed the motion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Subsequently, execution was <span style="">stayed
and all pending matters were held in abeyance at the request of the parties, as
they tried, unsuccessfully, to explore possible ways of settling the dispute.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1965" day="16" month="2"><span style="">February
 16, 1965</span></st1:date><span style="">,
petitioners asked for an alias </span>writ of execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was granted the next day but later
suspended by the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1965" day="28" month="7">July 28, <span style="">1965</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>the Secretary of National Defense
paid P659<span class="GramE">,935</span> to petitioners, leaving P1,712,396.40 of
the claim based on the arbitrator's award.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="1" month="10">October <span style="">1, 1966</span></st1:date><span style=""> the court </span><u>a</u> <u>q</u><u><span style="">uo</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">denied the </span>Republic's
motion for intervention and reconsideration of the decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said <span style="">order
</span>is <span style="">hereunder quoted:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Considering <span class="SpellE">movant-intervenor's</span>
motion dated <st1:date year="1961" day="12" month="12">December 12, 1961</st1:date>
to set aside the <span style="">decision of this Court
and to stay execution; the Court </span>hereby finds said motion unmerito­rious
and, therefore, denies the same.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On the issue of jurisdiction, it is believed that this Court
has jurisdiction to confirm the arbitrator's award in question (Exhibit
"10").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The argument of <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> that Republic Act 876 does not cover arbitra­tion
of the kind or class subject of this case has no relevance to the issue of
jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, section 2 of
said Act covers arbitration of this nature since the parties may submit to
arbitration even with­out a contract to this effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 607 and 608, of the Revised
Administrative Code do not affect this Court's jurisdiction; and the argument
that no appropriation of public funds has been secured by <span class="SpellE">movant-intervenor</span>
<span style="">the Armed Forces of the Philippines, if
such be the fact, does not deprive this court of its power to confirm the
arbitrator's award.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> still can </span><span style="">and </span><span style="">should appropriate
the funds with which to settle </span><span style="">its
</span><span style="">obligation to petitioners espe­</span><span style="">cially considering that the United States </span>Government
<span style="">is </span>not a party to the contract
(Exhibit "5").<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">The Court does not accept <span class="SpellE">intervenor's</span>
theory </span>that this case is within <span style="">the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Auditor </span>General since Commonwealth Act <span style="">327, </span>in the opinion of this Court,
contemplates cases where the parties have not agreed to arbi­trate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In short, by availing of arbitra<span style="">tion </span><span style="">and inviting petitioners to arbitrate, </span><span class="SpellE">movant-intervenor</span>
and/or its agencies have abandoned the procedure enjoined under said
Commonwealth <span class="GramE">Act,</span> otherwise the arbitration
proceedings would be rendered useless and reduced to <span style="">an </span>idle ceremony.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On the issue of due process, the records show that copy of
the petition for confirmation was sen<span style="">t </span>to
and received by the 'Armed Forces of the Philippines c/o the Secretary of
National Defense', the latter being the official of <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>
having control and supervision of the Armed Forces.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Service of said petition was done in
obedience to Section 23 of the <span style="">Arbitrati</span>on
Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And since there <span style="">is </span>no law designating the party to be
sued in case of breach of contracts involving construction of military bases,
service upon the Secre<span style="">tary </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">both sufficient and lawful (Santos vs. Santos as administrator of CAA,
G.</span>R. <span style="">No. L-4699, </span><st1:date year="1952" day="26" month="11"><span style="">Nov.
 26, 1952</span></st1:date><span style="">).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The issue of execution upon the Armed Forces' fund deposited
in private banks has prodded this Court to study extensively the authorities
pro and con.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The weight of authority
sustains the view that 'public funds' <span style="">are
not </span>subject to execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
there <span style="">is </span>reason in petitioners'
argument that such funds have lost their 'public character' since title thereto
have passed to the bank and <span style="">said funds
being </span>fungibles, are commingled with other deposits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, in so far <span style="">as </span>the prayer for stay of execution <span style="">is </span>concerned, the same has been rendered academic with <span style="">the lifting on </span><st1:date year="1965" day="23" month="7"><span style="">July 23, 1965</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>of writ of execu<span style="">tion issued in this </span>proceeding, and
particu<span style="">larly </span>the alias writ of
execution dated <st1:date year="1965" day="17" month="2">February 17, 1965</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Finally, the motion for intervention was filed after the
Court had already disposed of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Intervention </span><span style="">is </span>allowed only ‘at any stage of the trial,' the term 'trial' <span style="">being used in its restricted sense, that is,
the period </span><span style="">for </span><span style="">the introduction </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">evidence by both parties.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

moved to dismiss the appeal, alleging that the Republic lacks personality to

moved to intervene.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said motion was
opposed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court deferred action

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Required by <span class="GramE">Us</span> to show </span>cause <span style="">why the appeal should not be dismissed for failure to file the printed

notice to file printed record on appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the ground of inexcusable failure to file the printed record on appeal on

disfavor on excuses such as that offered by appellant's counsel, which appears
to be a "habitual subterfuge employed by litigants who fail to observe the
procedural requirements prescribed in the Rules of Court." <span class="GramE">(Philippine Air Lines, Inc. v. <span class="SpellE">Arca</span>,
