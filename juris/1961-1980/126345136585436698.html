the review of a decision of the Court of First Instance of Manila granting the
petition for naturalization of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, Chua <span class="SpellE">Beng</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The records before us
show that the petition should have been dismissed because:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's attesting
witnesses were <span class="SpellE">Hermenegildo</span> V. Lopez, a practicing
lawyer, residing in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, and <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span>
S. <span class="SpellE">Bagaporo</span>, an employee of <span class="SpellE">Dy</span>
Pac Lumber Co.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>None of them has been
shown to meet the conditions essential to be <span style="">"credible persons," as the term is used in Section 7 of the
Naturalization Law, and elucidated in <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> vs.
Republic, L-10642 (May 30, 1958).</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In fact, not even their
testimony is credible, owing to the flaws therein pointed out by appellant and
referred to in the decision appealed from.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, Atty. Lopez would have us believe that he met the petitioner in
the premises of the New Manila Lumber Company in 1946, because the former had
made, through the latter, three (3) big orders of lumber, in connection with
the construction of his (Lopez') house in <span class="SpellE">Tondo</span>, Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This assertion was proven to be false, for
petitioner was then residing in <span class="SpellE">Pagsanjan</span>, Laguna,
and did not establish himself in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> until June, 1947, or work with said company
until 1948.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, petitioner - who
is a machinist-mechanic - testified that he had never handled the sale of
lumber or participated therein, he having limited himself to attending to the
repair of machines.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Upon the other hand, in a
seeming attempt to impress upon the Court that he was well acquainted with the
petitioner, <span class="SpellE">Bagaporo</span> testified that he had met every
member of the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> family, including his father,
somewhere in </span><st1:address><st1:street><span style="">Asuncion Street</span></st1:street><span style="">, </span><st1:city><u><span style="">Manila</span></u></st1:city></st1:address><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
turnout, however, that petitioner's father had died <u>in</u> </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><u><span style="">China</span></u></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">, in 1938, long before <span class="SpellE">Bagaporo</span>
had met the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When this
circumstance came to light, <span class="SpellE">Bagaporo</span> tried to
extricate himself by saying that the person he met at </span><st1:street><st1:address><span style="">Asuncion Street</span></st1:address></st1:street><span style=""> might have been petitioner's father-in-law;
but, this cannot be true, for the latter had died <u>before</u> his daughter
and petitioner were married.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Although the lower court
attached little significance to the foregoing circumstances, we consider the
same sufficiently important to cast doubt upon the veracity of said witnesses
and the credibility of their testimony.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While petitioner was testifying
in the lower court, his counsel asked him to write down, on a piece of paper,
first, in English, and, then, in <span class="SpellE">Tagalog</span>, the reason
why he wanted to become a Filipino citizen.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner was unable <span style="">to do so,
and stated, by way of explanation, that he had had no practice <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon,
his counsel <u>moved for continuance</u>, alleging that, in his opinion, his
client was "nervous at the moment." When the hearing was resumed, <u>over
a month later</u>, counsel reiterated his aforementioned request.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Forthwith, petitioner wrote on Exhibit T,
with a firm hand, a fairly good and clear penmanship, and a correct spelling:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"I want to become a Filipino citizen because I have resided in
the Philippines for a long time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And I
like to live here permanently.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have my
family in the Philippines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And I like
the customs, traditions and ideals of the Filipinos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I like the form government in the
Philippines."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Gusto <span class="SpellE">kong</span> <span class="SpellE">maging</span>

<span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">bayang</span> Pilipino."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Immediately, thereafter,
counsel for the government asked the petitioner to write, on another piece of
paper, these words: "the sun is shining and the weather is fine," as
well as its translation in <span class="SpellE">Tagalog</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is what petitioner wrote:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Thae</span> sun is <span class="SpellE">sring</span>
and the <span class="SpellE">wht</span> <span class="SpellE">feru</span>"</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"<span class="SpellE">Ang</span>
ardor at <span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">nanara</span> <span class="SpellE">sa</span>.”<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Both are meaningless, and
so the lower court found it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, it
subscribed to the observation made by counsel for the government with respect
to the preparation of Exhibit T. His Honor, the trial Judge said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> It must
equally be admitted, out of candor, that petitioner had difficulty in writing
English when first required to do so by his own counsel, but afforded another
opportunity, he was able to writ in English and <span class="SpellE">Tagalog</span>,
as evidenced by Exhibit T, although, in the words of counsel for the <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span>, ‘it is not a surprise that the petitioner was
able to write down a longer dictation given by his counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He must have been drilled and practiced on
the sample dictated to him and consequently he was able to write them down more
on tote memory rather than an actual appreciation thereof.' This Court is
inclined to subscribe to the observation just quoted, since when petitioner was
asked by counsel for the <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span> to write down the
sentence 'The sun is shining and the weather is fine,' and petitioner's
translation thereof into <span class="SpellE">Tagalog</span>, the result is
something that is not readable and has hardly any meaning (Exhibit 2)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is thus obvious that petitioner does not sufficiently <span style="">know the Filipino language (<span class="SpellE">Tagalog</span>) - the only local dialect he seemingly speaks -
either to write it or make a fairly accurate translation, into said language,
of the simple sentence given by counsel for the government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would appear, also, that neither does he
reasonably speak English - much less write the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In short, he lacks one of the requisite
qualifications to be naturalized as citizen of the Philippines.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

Within the purview of the Naturalization Law, a ‘credible’ person is, to our
mind, not only an individual who has not been previously convicted of a crime;
who is not a police character and has no police record; who has not perjured in
the past; or whose 'affidavit' or testimony is not incredible. What must be
'credible' is not the declaration made, but the <u>person</u> making it. This
implies that such person must have a <u>good standing in the community</u>;
that he is <u>known to be honest and upright</u>; that he is <u>reputed to be
trustworthy and reliable</u>; and that his word may be taken on its face value,
as a good warranty of the worthiness of the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in Cu <i>vs</i>. Republic, G. R. No.
L-3018 (decided on July 18, 1951), we declared that said affiants ‘are in a way
<u>insurers of the character of the candidate concerned</u>.’ Indeed, by their
affidavits, they do not merely make the statements herein contained. They also
vouch for the applicant, attest to the merits of his petition and sort of <u>underwrite</u>
the same."</p>





<p class="FOOTNOTES"><a style="" href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a> Pursuant to Section 2 of
Commonwealth Act No. 473, the applicant for naturalization must, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, "be able to speak <u>and</u> <u>write</u>
English or Spanish and any one of the principal Philippine languages."</p>
