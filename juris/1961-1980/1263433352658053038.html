injunction wherein petitioner prays this Court:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(1) to enjoin respondent Judge from enforcing his order of demolition
dated July 8, 1976 and the respondent City Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span>
City from carrying out his notice of demolition; (2) to annul the said order of
demolition and the Sheriff's notice of demolition; and (3) to issue a writ of <i>mandamus</i>
commanding the respondent Judge to accord due pro­cess of law under the
Constitution to the petitioner and formal hearing under section 14, Rule 39 of
the Revised Rules of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime in 1974, private respondent Jose V. Ochoa instituted an
action for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> against petitioner in the <st1:place><st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placetype>Court</st1:placetype> <st1:placename>of</st1:placename> <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pasay</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
Branch II (Civil Case No. 10977).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner alleged among others, that he is the absolute owner of the
lot having purchased the same from the Estate of Don Mariano San Pedro and has
been in possession thereof for more than thirty (30) years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the said case, the respondent Judge
rendered judgment in favor of respondent Ochoa on <st1:date year="1976" day="5" month="3">March 5, 1976</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment on the pleadings is hereby rendered in
favor of the plaintiff Jose V. Ochoa and against the defendant <span class="SpellE">Fredeswinda</span> R. Casanova ordering her to vacate and
surrender the possession of the premises to the plaintiff or his duly
authorized representative; to pay the accrued back rentals for the premises in
the total amount of P300.00; to pay P60.00 per month as damages for the illegal
<span class="SpellE">detainer</span> of the property until such time as the
defendant actually vacates the premises; and to pay the sum equivalent to 25%
of the amount involved as attorney's fees."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On April 9, 1976, petitioner moved for reconsideration and
suspension of the order of execution dated April 5, 1976 and prayed that the
Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City be ordered to withdraw and
desist from enforcing his notice of collection and <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
dated April 13, 1976, citing as basis for said motion General Order No. 53,
dated August 21, 1975 which provides, among others, that "all orders for
the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> of tenants or the demolition of their
homes are hereby suspended until further orders." Respondent Ochoa opposed
said motion on <st1:date year="1976" day="28" month="4">April 28, 1976</st1:date>,
on the ground that General Order No. 53 had no application in the case because
it was issued for the purpose of forestalling the indiscriminate eviction of <i>bona
fide</i> tenants from agricultural and/or residential lands converted or
proposed to be converted into subdivision or commercial center and
establishment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further, respondent Ochoa
stated that the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case was instituted due to
the failure and/or refusal of petitioner to comply with her obligation as
lessee.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1976" day="6" month="5">May 6, 1976</st1:date>,
private respondent filed an Urgent Ex-<span class="SpellE">Parte</span> Motion
for Issuance of Order of Demolition and an Urgent Ex-<span class="SpellE">Parte</span>
Motion for Issuance of Alias Writ of Execution and Order of Demolition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1976" day="4" month="6">June
 4, 1976</st1:date>, upon the manifestation of private respondent that said
motions were submitted for re­solution without further oral argument, the
respondent Judge issued an order which considered said motions as submitted for
resolution without further oral arguments.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1976" day="14" month="6">June 14, 1976</st1:date>,
petitioner filed an urgent motion for postponement of the hearing scheduled on <st1:date year="1976" day="17" month="6">June 17, 1976</st1:date> at <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9:00 a.m.</st1:time><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Considering that it had already issued on <st1:date year="1976" day="4" month="6">June 4, 1976</st1:date> an order which considered the motions of
private respondent as submitted for resolution without further oral arguments,
respondent court issued an order dated <st1:date year="1976" day="16" month="6">June
 16, 1976</st1:date> reiterating its afore-mentioned order of <st1:date year="1976" day="4" month="6">June 4, 1976</st1:date>, thus for all intents and
purposes denying the motion for postponement.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1976" day="8" month="7">July 8, 1976</st1:date>,
respondent Judge issued an order denying petitioner's motion for reconsideration
and suspension of order of execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the same order, the motions of private respondent were granted and the Sheriff
of <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City was ordered "to demolish the
house/structure of the defendant (petitioner) erected on the plaintiff's property
and to remove the same <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>." On <st1:date year="1976" day="26" month="7">July 26, 1976</st1:date>, the Deputy Sheriff of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pasay</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
in a letter of even date, notified the petitioner as follows:</p>

YOUR HOUSE WILL BE DEMOLISHED BY THIS OFFICE.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Please remove said house outside of the Plaintiff's lot before the
given period."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner in seeking to annul the order of respondent Judge
dated <st1:date year="1976" day="8" month="7">July 8, 1976</st1:date> and to
restrain the Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City from demolishing
her house cites as basis for her petition section 14, Rule 39 of the Revised
Rules of Court which provides:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 14.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i>Removal of
improvements on property subject of execution</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- When the property subject of the execution
contains improvements constructed or planted by the judgment debtor or his
agent, the officer shall not destroy, demolish or remove said improvements
except upon <i>special order of the court,</i> issued upon petition of the
judgment creditor <i>after due hearing</i> and after the former has <i>failed
to remove the same within a reasonable time fixed by the court</i>."
(Italics supplied.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is petitioner's contention that the respondent Judge failed to
observe said provision in not setting for hearing private respondent's motion
for order of demolition and motion for issuance of alias writ and order of
demolition and in the questioned order the court did not fix a definite
reasonable period within which her house should be removed, thus rendering the
order of the court granting said motions null and void.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, private respondents argue that from the
decision of the lower court dated <st1:date year="1976" day="5" month="3">March
 5, 1976</st1:date>, no appeal was taken and the same has become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further,
according to private respondents there was no denial of due process on the part
of the petitioner when the respondent Judge issued the questioned order because
the petitioner was given ample time by both respondent Judge and the Deputy
Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City within which to remove the
construction she erected on pri­vate respondent's premises.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find petitioner's contention meritorious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We agree with private respondents that the
decision in the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case has already become
final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, but what is being questioned in
the present petition is the order of the court ordering the Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City or his deputies and the City Engineer's Office
of <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City or his duly authorized representative
to demolish the house/structure of the petitioner erected on the respon­dents'
property and to remove the same <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The questioned order was issued without due
hearing of the motions of private respondent and without granting petitioner a
reasonable time within which to remove her house from the premises.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE"><i>Folloso</i></span><i> v. Director of
Lands</i>,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court said:</p>

<blockquote>"Under Section 13 (now 14), Rule 39, the officer called upon
to enforce a final judgment involving delivery or restitution of property may
do so by placing the plaintiff in possession of such property, but 'the officer
shall not destroy, demolish or remove the improvements made by the defendant or
his agent on the property, except by special order of the court, which order
may only issue upon petition of the plaintiff after due hearing and upon the
defendant's failure to remove the improvements within a reasonable time to be
fixed by the court.' The safeguard accorded to the defendant by the above
provision has not been followed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While
the motion of the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> for the removal of the
houses was set for hearing after due notice given to the appellants, the court
ordered the sheriff to remove said houses within a period of 30 days but
without giving them a reasonable time within which to do so as required by said
section 13 (now 14).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This requirement is
not an empty gesture.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This safeguard is
necessary to give the defendant an opportunity to protect his interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court erred in issuing the order of
demolition without giving a reasonable time to the appellants."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The same ruling was reiterated in <i>Rom
v. <span class="SpellE">Cobadora</span>,</i><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
where this Court held:</p>

<blockquote>"* * * Under Rule 39, section 14, the appellant's house could
not be removed pending <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> recourse to the
Court for a special order for the demolition and removal of such improvements
constructed by the appellant, which order is to be issued 'upon petition of the
judgment creditor <i>after due hearing</i> and after the former has failed to
remove the same <i>within a reasonable time</i> fixed by the Court.' * *
*."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order of demolition dated <st1:date year="1976" day="8" month="7">July 8, 1976</st1:date>, issued by respondent
Judge, and the Sheriff's Notice of Demolition, are hereby set aside, and
respondent Judge ordered to accord petitioner a reasonable time to remove her
house from the premises after a formal hearing, in accordance with section 14,
Rule 39 of the Revised Rules of Court.</p>
