				<H3>LITTON & CO., INC., PETITIONER, VS. THE
COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS, RESPONDENT.
<br /><br />D E C I S I O N  </H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.P., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Litton &amp; Co., Inc.
applied with the Central Bank to import 18 bales of "cotton textile woven with
dyed yarn" classified under Commodity Category NEP and Code No.
650206.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The application was approved and
the corresponding release certificate was issued by the Central Bank.</p>

<p class="BODY">In August 1956 the shipment applied for arrived in the <st1:place><st1:placetype>port</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Manila</st1:placename></st1:place> on board SS "<span class="SpellE">Koten</span> <span class="SpellE">Maru</span>".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon exa­mination by the Bureau of Customs,
it was however found to consist of 18 bales of "handkerchief cloth without
un­woven spaces" falling under Commodity Category UI and Code No. 650217
which is different from "cotton textile woven with dyed yarn".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Forthwith the goods were placed under seizure
and forfeiture proceedings (Seizure Iden­tification No. 5240) for violation of
Central Bank Cir­cular 44.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile,
the goods were released under a bond posted by Central Surety and Insurance Co.
in the amount of P8,472.36.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said amount
which represents the appraised local market value of the imported articles was
arrived at by adding to the landed cost 30% estima­ted profit following
precedents.</p>

<p class="BODY">After hearing the parties, the Collector of Customs of Manila
found the merchandise liable for forfeiture un­der Sec. 1363(f) of the Revised
Administrative Code for violation of Central Bank Circular 44.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, Litton appealed to the
Commissioner of Customs but the later rendered on <st1:date month="3" day="25" year="1960">March 25, 1960</st1:date> the following orders:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, by authority of Section 1380 of the Revised
Administrative Code in relation to Section 3702 of the Tariff and Customs Code
of the Philippines, the Central Surety &amp; Insurance Co. Bond No. G-21119,
dated September 21, 1956, which was filed for the release of the articles in
question, is hereby confiscated; and the principal, Litton &amp; Co., Inc. as
well as the aforesaid surety are hereby ordered to pay in CASH jointly and
severally, the amount of EIGHT THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY-TWO and 36/100
(P8,472.36), Philippine Currency, to the Bureau of Customs within thirty (30)
days from receipt of a copy of this decision in ac­cordance with the terms of
the said bond."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">On appeal the Court of Tax Appeals
affirmed the abovementioned order.</p>

<p class="BODY">Litton &amp; Co., Inc. elevated the case to Us present­ing the
following propositions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) The repeal
of Cen­tral Bank Circular 44 by Circular 33 abated the liabili­ty of
forfeiture.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(2) The appraised value of
the merchandise should have been determined in the manner provided in Section 2
of Rule 13(a) of the Philippine Tariff Act of 1909, as amended, in relation to
Sec. 1280 of the Re­vised Administrative Code, instead of in accordance with
Section 1377 of the Revised Administrative Code, as was done.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(3) Section 34 of Republic Act 265 should
apply in this case to the exclusion of Section 1363(f) of the Re­vised
Administrative Code, and accordingly the Collector of Customs of Manila should
have certified the case to the City Fiscal of Manila.</p>

<p class="BODY">It has been settled in previous similar cases that Central Bank
Circular 133 did not repeal Circular 44 with respect to the requirement of a
release certificate.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
But assuming <span class="SpellE">arguendo</span> that repeal took place, it did
not have the effect of legalizing an importation which was made illegally prior
to the repeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Collector of Customs used the local <u>market value</u> of
the merchandise in fixing the value appearing in the surety bond in accordance
with Section 1377 of the Re­vised Administrative Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In doing so, he merely added to the landed
cost an estimated profit of 30%.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Litton,
on the other hand, contends that the appraised value should be that obtaining
in the <u>country of origin</u> pursuant to Rule 13(a) of Section 2 of the
Philippine Tariff Act of 1909.</p>

<p class="BODY">Litton's contention has no merit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Rule 13(a), Section 2 of the Philippine Tariff Act of 1909, as amended,
relates to the appraisal of importations for purposes of determining the
customs duties; while Section 1377 of the Revised Administrative Code refers to
appraisal of importations in connection with seizure proceedings, which is the
case here.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant emphatically contends that Section 34 of Republic Act
265 is applicable to this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We quote
Section 34 hereunder:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 34. <u>Proceedings upon violation of laws and
regulations</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Whenever any person
or entity <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span> violates this Act or any order,
instruction, rule or regulations legally is­sued by the Monetary Board, the
person or persons responsible for such violation shall be punished by a fine of
not more than twenty thou­sand pesos and by imprisonment of not more than five
years."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Its applicability however extends to the
criminal liabi­lity of the person or persons violating the regulations issued
by the Monetary Board, <u>in addition</u> to the seizure and forfeiture
proceedings in the Bureau of Customs against the imported merchandise affected
in accordance with provisions of the Revised Administrative Code.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
As suggested by counsel for Litton &amp; Co., Inc., the Collector of Customs of
Manila should apprise the City Fiscal of Manila of this case for appropriate
prosecution of the persons or corporate officers criminally responsible.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the decision appealed from is affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Costs against appellant.</p>
