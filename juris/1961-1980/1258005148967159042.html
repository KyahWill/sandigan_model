				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Original action for certiorari and prohibition.
<p>On April 28, 1959 respondent Jesus J. Betia, an employee of
petitioner San Miguel Brewery, Inc.—a corporation duly organized and
existing under the Philippine laws— filed with respondent Court of
Industrial Relations a complaint for the recovery of compensation for
overtime services allegedly rendered to said petitioner, which owns and
operates the Magnolia Dairy Products Plant, of which the other
petitioner, Jose Cuisia, is the manager. Said petitioners moved to
dismiss the complaint upon the ground of want of jurisdiction over the
subject matter of said pleading. The motion was denied by an order,
dated September 28, 1959, whereupon petitioner moved for a
reconsideration thereof, which was, also, denied on December 9, 1959.
Hence, this petition for certiorari and prohibition, upon the theory
that the respondent court has no jurisdiction over claims for overtime
pay. </p>
<p>The petition is clearly devoid of merit, the issue therein raised
having been definitely settled in Price Stabilization Corporation
(PRISCO) vs. Court of Industrial Relations, et al., (108 Phil., 134),
in which we held:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"* * * that <em>where the employer-employee relationship is still existing</em>
or is sought to be reestablished because of its wrongful severance (as
where the employee seeks reinstatement), the Court of Industrial
Relations <em>has</em> jurisdiction over all claims arising out of, or
in connection with employment, such as those related to the Minimum
Wage Law and the Eight-Hour Labor Law. After the termination of the
relationship and no reinstatement is sought, such claims become mere
money claims, and come within the jurisdiction of the regular courts."
(Italics ours)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This view was adhered to in Manila Port Service, et al. vs. Court of
Industrial Relations, et al., 112 Phil., 673; 58 Off. Gaz., (43) 7042;
Philippine Wood Products, et al., vs. Court of Industrial Relations, et
al., 112 Phil., 640; 61 Off. Gaz., (10) 1345; Pan American World
Airways System (Philippines) vs. Pan American Employees Association,
111 Phil., 126; 59 Off. Gaz., (36) 6046; Ajax International Corporation
vs. Seguritan, et al., 109 Phil., 813; and Sampaguita Pictures, Inc.,
et al. vs. Court of Industrial Relations, et al., 110 Phil., 725; 60
Off. Gaz., (52) 8583, apart from the fact that it had been applied
previously in the Philippine Association of Free Labor Unions (PAFLU),
et al., vs. Tan, et al., 99 Phil., 854; 52 Off. Gaz., [13] 5836;
Detective and Protective Bureau Incorporated vs. Guevarra, et al.,
L-8738 (May 31, 1957); Isaac Peral Bowling Alley vs. United Employees
Welfare Association, et al., 102 Phil., 219; National Shipyards and
Steel Corporation vs. Almin, 104 Phil., 835; 56 Off. Gaz., (9) 1899;
Monares vs. CNS Enterprises, et al., L-11749 (May 29, 1959) and
National Shipyard and Steel Corporation vs. Court of Industrial
Relations, et al., 107 Phil., 1006; 58 Off. Gaz., (36) 5875. </p>
<p>Wherefore, this case is hereby dismissed, and the petition denied,
with costs against petitioner San Miguel Brewery, Inc. It is so ordered.</p>
<p> <em>Bengzon, C. J., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J. B. L., Paredes, Dizon</em> and <em>De Leon, JJ</em>., concur.</p>
