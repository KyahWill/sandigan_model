C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Ever so often, the actuation of a judge would be stigmatized as
violative of a litigant's rights, resulting in an administrative complaint for
abuse of authority and, possibly, to impress this Tribunal with the gravity of
his failing, add, for good measure, ignorance of the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it was alleged in this case by a certain
Maximo Ubas, complainant, with Municipal Judge Benito P. Cinco of Margosatubig,
Zamboanga del Sur, as respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">The matter was referred to Executive Judge Melquiades S.
Sucaldito for investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He set
forth the nature of the case thus: "This is a complaint for abuse of
authority and ignorance of the law filed by complainant Maximo Ubas against
respondent Benito <span style="">P. </span>Cinco, Municipal Judge of Margosatubig, Zamboanga del Sur.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainant alleges that the respondent, with
abuse of authority, terminated a criminal case two days before the day set for
trial and likewise rendered a decision thereon <span style="">in excess </span>of his authority as the offense charged <span style="">is </span>cognizable
by the Court of First Instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That as
an offended party, complainant further alleged that he was deprived of his
right to aid the prosecution by the premature termination of the case by the
respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent in his answer
denied the material allegations of the complaint, alleging among others, that a
case of Double Physical Injuries was filed by the Chief of Police and not that
of Frustrated Homicide, thus his Court has the juris­diction to <span style="">try and </span>decide the same; and that the
accused, while being already detained, asked for immediate trial, and after
arraignment, pleaded guilty to the crime charged and thereafter was sentenced
accordingly."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
According to Judge Sucaldito, the records showed that the complaint against a
certain Benjamin Manginsay was for double physical injuries filed by the Chief
of Police in <span style="">the </span>sala of
respondent Judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the
aforesaid accused appeared before the municipal court demanding immediate trial
of the case, and upon arraignment, pleaded guilty to the crime charged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Judge, thereafter, rendered a
decision sentencing the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
further stated in such report that there was thereafter executed by complainant
an affidavit acknow­ledging that there was justification for the action taken
by respon­dent Judge upon a voluntary plea of guilty being entered by the
accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the administrative case
was called for investigation by Judge Sucaldito, "both complainant and
respondent appeared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent,
under oath in open court, affirmed all the allegations contained in his
affidavit."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">He summarized his findings thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"From the facts and circumstances of the case, the undersigned
finds that the respondent acted within his competence and authority in accept­ing
a complaint, for Double Physical Injuries, and <span style="">in </span>sentencing the accused who entered
a plea of guilty thereon, thereby termi­nating the case."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Necessarily, his recommendation was for "the dismissal of this
administrative case and the exoneration of the respondent."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
The then Acting Judicial Consultant of this Court, retired Justice Manuel P.
Barcelona, endorsed the aforesaid recommendation for exoneration.</p>

<p class="BODY">No other outcome can be justified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complaints submitted to him indicated
that the offenses at the most amounted to physical injuries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A case for frustrated homicide would not
lie.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the accused, therefore,
pleaded guilty upon arraignment, he was within his rights, speedy trial being
one of the prized guarantees under the Constitution.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
There was nothing left for respondent Judge then but to render judgment, which
he did in accordance with the law on the subject.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is understandable likewise for complainant
to feel doubly aggrieved as for him the penalty was disproportionate to the
crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The administrative complaint,
therefore, must have resulted from such disappointment, not to say
frustration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he withdrew his
complaint, it must have been a realization, when he was <span style="">in </span>a less agitated state of mind,
that the Judge had no choice on the matter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He had to follow the law.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, this administrative complaint is
dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let a copy of this resolution
be entered on the record of respondent <span style="">Judge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
