				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Appeal taken by the Republic of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="GramE">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span class="GramE"> from an order issued by the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Samar</span> in Civil Case No.</span> R-25 allowing Chua <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span> <span class="SpellE">Seng</span>, alias Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Simtoco</span>, to take his oath of allegiance as a citizen of the
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>It is the claim of the State in this <span style="">instance </span>that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the trial court did not acquire
jurisdiction over the proceeding because of <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
failure to <span style="">mention </span>in his
petition his other aliases or names by which he was known; (2) <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> did not possess all the qualifications required by
law and has failed to prove compliance with the additional requirements of
Section 1 of Republic Act 530; and (3) <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
oath-taking was premature because it took place before the expiration of thirty
days from notice to appellant of the order allowing <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
oath-taking, within which period an appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
could be taken.</p>

<p class="BODY">Briefly stated, the facts relevant to this appeal are the
following:</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">On </span><st1:date year="1960" day="24" month="12"><span class="GramE">December 24, 1960</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, the Court of First Instance of </span><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Samar</span></span></st1:place><span class="GramE">, in Civil Case No.</span> R-<span class="GramE">25,</span> rendered
a decision granting <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> petition for
naturalization.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No appeal was taken <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1963" day="7" month="1">January 7, 1963</st1:date>, after the lapse of
more than two years, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, invoking Section 1 of
Republic Act No. 530, filed a petition to be allowed to take his oath of
allegiance as <span style="">a
</span>Filipino citizen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After due
hearing, with the Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>, in
represen­tation of the Solicitor General, present, the court, on March 14,
1963, issued the appealed order allowing <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> to
take his oath of allegiance, and he took said oath on the same day, and the
corresponding certificate of natu­ralization was issued to him the following
day.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears from the record that <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
name and alias given in his petition for naturalization - which were the ones <span class="SpellE">setforth</span> in the notice of hearing published in accordance
with law - are Chua <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span> <span class="SpellE">Seng</span>,
alias Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Simtoco</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record also discloses indubitably, that
aside from <span class="GramE">these</span> two names <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
had extensively made use of the following names:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Casing <span class="SpellE">Sim</span>
(Exhibits L, L-1, pp. 21-22, record of Exhibits) and Casing C. <span class="SpellE">Simtoco</span> (Exhibit L-2, p. 23, Idem).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is a, fatal defect, because applicants
for naturalization are required to give their names and all aliases that they
had used prior to the date of filing of the application in order to give the
State and other <span class="GramE">parties</span> ample or reasonable
opportunity to make the necessary in<span style="">vestigations regarding </span>applicant's
qualifications and possible disqualifications.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Evidently, this purpose of the law is frustrated at least in those
places and regions of the country where the applicant was known under a name or
alias not disclosed by him in his petition and not set-forth in the notice of
hearing published.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the evidence also shows that at the time of the
rendition of the decision <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> was an employee of
Lu <span class="SpellE">Tay</span> Company with a yearly salary of P3<span class="GramE">,000</span>, which constituted his only income.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the time of the final hearing, however, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> testified that he had ceased to be working for Lu <span class="SpellE">Tay</span> Company since August 1961; that since then he had been
employed <span style="">as </span>clerk
with the Ramon Lao <span class="SpellE">Hoo</span> Estate at a monthly salary of
P200, excluding bonus, and that for the year 1962 he had received the sum of P1<span class="GramE">,400.00</span> as bonus.</p>

<p class="BODY">In previous decisions <span class="GramE"><span style="">We</span></span><span style=""> </span>have held that a monthly income of
P200 <span style="">is </span>not
sufficient to justify the conclusion that an applicant for naturalization has a
lucrative occupation, especially in a case like that of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
who has a wife and several children to support.</p>

<p class="BODY">The alleged <u>bonus</u> which <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
claims he could earn every year is clearly contingent and speculative in
nature, and can not be considered as part of <span style="">his yearly fixed income.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Having arrived at the foregoing conclusions, <span class="GramE"><span style="">We</span></span><span style=""> deem </span>it
unnecessary to pass upon the other issues raised in appellant's brief.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed order is reversed and set aside
and, as a consequence, the oath of allegiance taken by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
and the <span class="GramE">certificate of naturalization issued <span style="">to him on </span></span><st1:date year="1963" day="15" month="3"><span class="GramE"><span style="">March
 </span>15, 1963</span></st1:date><span class="GramE"> <span style="">are</span></span><span style=""> ordered
cancelled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">With costs.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
