				G.R. No. L-19647, April 29, 1966</h4>
				<H3>IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF BENEDICTO TAN TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. BENEDICTO TAN, PETITIONERAND APPELLEE, VS. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, OPPOSITOR AND APPELLANT.</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Benedicto Tan, 21, single, was granted naturalization by the Quezon
court of first instance, over the objection of the provincial fiscal.
So, this appeal was interposed in due time.<p></p>
<p>And now, the Solicitor-General alleges that said court erred: (a) in
finding it has jurisdiction over the case; (b) in finding that the
petitioner had observed an irreproachable conduct; (c) in not declaring
that petitioner had no lucrative occupation; and (d) in believing the
character witnesses presented in support of the petition.
</p><p>We find it unnecessary to pass on all the assigned errors. We see
that petitioner has no lucrative employment, and therefore, he is
disqualified from becoming a Filipino citizen. It is admitted that his
total income, "including meal allowances and overtime pay, amounts to
more or less P2,500.00 per annum" (p. 15, brief of appellee).</p>
<p>In the light of our recent decisions, such annual income disqualifies the applicant for Filipino citizenship.</p>
<ol><li>Uy <em>vs</em>. Republic, L-20208, June 30, 1965. An
applicant having an income of P3,600 per annum, though unmarried, does
not have a "lucrative" occupation. </li><li>Uy <em>vs</em>. Republic, L-20799, November 29,
1965. Applicant for naturalization earning P250.00 per month, does not
have a "lucrative" income.</li></ol>
<p><strong></strong>Wherefore, the appealed decision is hereby reversed, and this application for naturalization denied, with costs.</p>
<em>Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, Dizon, Regala, Makalintal, Bengzon, J.P.,</em>  and <em>Sanchez, JJ.,</em> concur.</div>
