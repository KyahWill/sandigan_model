				<BR><STRONG>ZALDIVAR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The complaint, in Civil Case No. 56949 of the Court of First
Instance of Manila, dated May 4, 1964, filed by Detective and Protective
Bureau, Inc., therein plaintiff (petitioner herein) against <span class="SpellE">Fausto</span>
S. Alberto, therein defendant (respondent herein), for accounting with
preliminary injunction and receivership, alleged that plaintiff was <span style="">a </span>corporation duly organized and
existing under the laws of the Philippines; that defendant was managing
director of plaintiff corporation from 1952 until January 14, 1964; that in
June 1963, defendant illegally seized and took control of all the assets as
well as the books, records, vouchers and receipts of the corporation from the
accountant-cashier, concealed <span style="">them </span>illegally
and refused to allow any member of <span style="">the
</span>corporation to see and examine the same; that on January 14, 1964, the
stockholders, in a meeting, removed defendant as managing director and elected
Jose de la Rosa in his stead; that defendant not only had refused to vacate his
office and to deliver the assets and books to <span style="">Jose </span>de la Rosa, but also continued to perform unauthorized acts
for and in behalf of plaintiff corporation; that defendant had been required to
submit a financial statement and to render an accounting of his administration
from 1952 but defendant has failed to do so; that defendant, contrary to <span style="">a </span>resolution adopted by the Board of
Directors on November 24, 1963, had been illegally disposing of corporate
funds; that de­fendant, unless immediately restrained <u>ex</u>-<span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>, would continue discharging the functions of
managing director; and that it was necessary to appoint a receiver to take
charge of the assets and receive the income of the corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff prayed that <span style="">a </span>preliminary injunction <u><span style="">ex</span></u><span style="">-<span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> be issued restraining </span>defendant from
exercising the functions of managing director and from disbursing and disposing
of its funds; that Jose M. <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> be appointed
receiver; that, after judgment, the injunction be made <span style="">permanent and defendant </span>be ordered to render an accounting.</p>

<p class="BODY">Herein respondent Judge, the Honorable <span class="SpellE">Gaudencio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cloribel</span>, set for hearing plaintiff's prayer for
ancillary relief and required the parties to submit their respective
memoranda.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1964" day="18" month="6">June 18, 1964</st1:date>, <span style="">respondent Judge granted the writ of </span>preliminary injunction
prayed for, <span style="">conditioned upon
plaintiff's filing a bond of P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Plaintiff filed the bond, but while
the same was pending <span style="">approval defendant
<span class="SpellE">Fausto</span> S. Alberto filed, on </span><st1:date year="1964" day="1" month="7"><span style="">July 1, </span>1964</st1:date>,
a motion to admit a counter-bond for the purpose of lifting the order granting
the writ of preliminary injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
spite of <span style="">the opposition </span>filed by
plaintiff, respondent Judge issued, on <st1:date year="1964" day="5" month="8">August
 5, 1964</st1:date>, an order admitting the counter-bond and setting aside <span style="">the writ of preli­minary injunction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On the belief that the
order approving the counter-bond and lifting the writ of preliminary injunction
was contrary to law and the act of </span>respondent Judge constituted <span style="">a </span>grave abuse of discretion, and that
there was no plain, speedy and adequate remedy available to it, plaintiff filed
with this Court the instant petition for certiorari, praying that a writ of
preliminary injunction enjoining defendant <span class="SpellE">Fausto</span> S.
Alberto from exercising the functions of<span style=""> </span>managing director be issued, <span style="">and </span>that the order dated <span style="">August 5, 1964 of respondent Judge approving </span>the
counter-bond and lifting the writ of preliminary in­junction he had previously
issued be set aside and declared null and void.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This Court gave due course to the petition but did not issue a
preliminary injunction.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his answer, now respondent <span class="SpellE">Fausto</span> S.
Alberto traversed the material allegations of the petition, jus<span style="">tified </span>the order complained of, <span style="">and </span>prayed for the dismissal of the
petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the pleadings, it appears that the only issue to be resolved
is whether the order of respondent Judge dated <st1:date year="1964" day="5" month="8">August 5, 1964</st1:date>, admitting and approving the counter-bond
of P5<span class="GramE">,000</span> and <span style="">setting
</span>aside the writ of preliminary injunction granted in <span style="">his </span>order
dated <st1:date year="1964" day="18" month="6">June 18, 1964</st1:date>, was
issued contrary to <span style="">law </span>and with
grave abuse of discretion.</p>

<p class="BODY">Now petitioner contends that the setting aside of the order
granting the writ was contrary to law and was done with <span style="">a grave abuse of </span>discretion, because:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the motion to admit defendant's
counter-bond was not supported <span style="">by
affidavits showing </span>why the counter-bond should be admitted, as required
by Section 6 of Rule 58; (2) the preliminary injunction was not issued <u>ex-<span class="SpellE">pa<span style="">rte</span></span></u><span style=""> </span>but after hearing, and the admission
of the counter-bond rendered said writ ineffective; (3) the writ was granted in
accordance with Rule 58 of the Rules of Court and established precedents; (4)
public interest required that the <span style="">writ </span>be
not set aside because respondent had arrogated unto himself all the powers of
petitioning corporation, to the irreparable damage of the corporation; and that
(5) the <span style="">counter-</span>bond could not
compensate petitioner's damage.</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first reason
given by petitioner in support of its contention that the dissolution of the
writ of preliminary injunction was contrary to law is that the motion to admit
respondent's counter-bond for the <span style="">dissolution
of </span>the writ <span style="">was </span>not
supported by affidavits as required by section 6 of Rule 58 of the Rules of
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>
motion, however, does not appear <span style="">in the
record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How</span>ever, the record shows
that respondent Alberto had <span style="">filed </span><span style="">a </span>verified answer to the complaint <span style="">and </span><span style="">a </span>verified opposition to the issuance
of the writ of preliminary injunction.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Regarding the necessity of verification of the motion for
dissolution of <span style="">a
</span>writ of preliminary injunc­tion, this Court has ruled that the
requirement of verification <span style="">is </span>not
absolute but is dependent on the circumstances obtaining in <span style="">a </span>particular
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case of <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Sy</span></span><span style=""> Sam </span>Bio,
et al. <span style="">vs. </span>Barrios
and <span class="SpellE">Buyson</span> <span class="SpellE">Lampa</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
the only question raised was whether the respondent Judge exceeded his
jurisdiction and abused <span style="">his discretion
in setting aside an order directing the issuance of a writ of preliminary
injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>In maintaining the
affir<span style="">mative, petitioners in that case alleged
that the questioned order </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">issued
in violation of the provisions </span>of Section 169 of Act 190 (which is one
of the sources of Sec. 6 of Rule 58 of the revised Rules of Court) inasmuch as
the Judge set aside said order and directed the dissolution of the preliminary
injunction without any formal petition of the parties and without having <span style="">followed the procedure prescribed by the
statute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There </span>was, however, a
verbal application for the dissolution of the writ, based upon the ground of
the insufficiency of the complaint which was the basis of the application for
the issuance of said writ of preliminary injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court said:</p>

<blockquote>"Section 169 of Act 190 does not pres­cribe the manner of
filing the application to annul or modify <span style="">a </span>writ of preliminary injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It simply states that if a temporary
injunction be granted without notice, the defendant, at any time before trial,
may apply, upon reasonable notice to the adverse party, to the judge who
granted the injunction, or to the judge of the court of which the action was
brought, to dissolve or modify the same."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the strength of the decision in the above-cited case, this
Court in <span class="SpellE">Caluya</span>, et al. vs. Ramos, et al.,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
said:</p>

<blockquote>"Petitioners' criticism that the motion to dissolve filed by
the defendants in Civil Case No. 4634 was not verified, is also groundless
inasmuch as even an indirect verbal application for the dissolution of an <u>ex</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> order of preliminary injunction has been
held to be <span style="">a
</span>sufficient compliance with the pro­visions of section 6 of Rule 60
(Moran, Comments on the Rules of Court, Second Edition, Vol. II, p. 65, citing
the case of <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> Yam Bio <span style="">v. Barrios, etc. 63 Phil. 206), the obvious reason being that said rule
does not prescribe </span>the form by which an application for the dissolution
or modification of an order of preliminary injunction should be
presented."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">If according to the above rulings, Section 6 of Rule 60 (now sec.
6, Rule 58) of the Rules of Court did not require any form for the application
for the dissolution of the writ of preliminary injunction, then respondent <span class="SpellE">Fausto</span> Alberto's motion to lift the preliminary injunction
in the court below need not be verified, and much less must the motion be
supported by affidavits, as urged by petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, in <span class="SpellE">Canlas</span>, et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, et al.,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>this Court ruled that a motion for
the dissolution of a writ of preliminary injunction should be verified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that case, respondent <span class="SpellE">Tayag</span>
filed an unverified motion for the dissolution of a writ of preliminary
injunction, alleging that the same “would work great damage to the defendant
who had already spent <span style="">a </span>considerable
sum of money" and that petitioners "can be fully compensated for any
damages that they may suffer." The court granted the motion and dissolved
the preliminary injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In an
original action for a writ of certiorari filed with this Court to annul said
order, this Court remarked in part:</p>

<blockquote>"Petitioners herein are entitled to the writ prayed for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion of res­pondent <span class="SpellE">Tayag</span>
for the dissolution of the writ of preliminary injunction issued on <st1:date year="1959" day="22" month="10">October 22, 1959</st1:date>, was unverified x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From the precedents quoted above, as well <span style="">as </span>from the terminology of Section 6 of Rule 58 of the new Rules
of Court, it is evident that whether the application for the dissolution of the
writ of preliminary injunction must be verified or not depends upon the ground
upon which such application is based.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
the application is based on the insufficiency of the complaint, the motion need
not be verified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the motion is based
on the ground that the injunction would cause great damage to defendant while
the plaintiff can be fully compensated for such damages <span style="">as </span>he may suffer, the motion should be verified.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>In the instant case, it is
alleged by petitioner that the motion for the dissolution of the writ of pre­liminary
injunction was not verified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
allegation <span style="">was </span>not denied in the
answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But because said motion does not
appear in the record of the case now before this Court, We cannot determine
what are the grounds for the dissolution that are alleged therein, and so We
cannot rule on whether the motion should have been verified or not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court, therefore, has to rely on the
order of respondent Judge, dated <st1:date year="1964" day="5" month="8">August
 5, 1964</st1:date>, which states that "the filing of the counter-bond is
in accordance with law." Consequently, the first ground alleged by
petitioner must be brushed aside.</p>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second and third
reasons alleged by petitioner in its petition for certiorari assume that <span style="">a </span>preliminary injunction issued after
hearing and in accordance with Rule 58 cannot be set aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This contention is untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The provision of Section 6 of Rule 58 that
"the injunction may be refused, or, if granted <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">parte</span></u></span><span style="">, </span>may be dissolved" cannot be
construed as putting beyond the reach of the court the dissolution of an
injunction which was granted after hearing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The reason is because a writ of preliminary injunction is an
interlocutory order, and as such it <span style="">is
</span>always under the control of the court before final judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in <span class="SpellE">Caluya</span>, et
al. vs. Ramos, et al.,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court said:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The first contention of petitioners is that, as said
injunction was issued after a hearing, the same cannot be dissolved, especially
on the strength of an unverified motion for dissolution and in the absence of
proper evidence to support it. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Reliance
is placed on Section 6 of Rule 60 of the Rules of Court which provides that
‘the injunction may be reduced, or, if granted <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">parte</span></u></span><span style="">, </span>may be dissolved, thereby arguing
that if an injunction is not issued <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>
the same cannot be dissolved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
contention is clearly erron­eous.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Although said section prescribes the grounds for objecting to, or for
moving, the dissolution of, <span style="">a </span>preliminary injunction prior to its issuance or after its
granting <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">parte</span></u></span><span style="">, </span>it does not there­by outlaw <span class="GramE">a dissolution</span> if the injunction has been issued after a
hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is to be so, because a
writ of preliminary injunction is an interlocutory order which <span style="">is </span>always
under the control of the court before final judgment (Manila Electric Company
vs. <span class="SpellE">Artiaga</span> and Green, 50 Phil. 144, 147)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This Court has also ruled that the dissolution of <span style="">a </span>writ of
preliminary injunction issued after hearing, even if the dissolution is ordered
without giving the other party an opportunity to be heard, does not constitute
an abuse of discretion and may be cured not by certiorari but by appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Clarke vs. Philippine Ready Mix Concrete
Co., Inc., et al.,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
one of the issues presented was whether <span style="">a </span>writ of preliminary injunction granted the
plaintiff by <span style="">a
trial </span>court after hearing, might be dissolved upon an <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">parte</span></u></span>
application by the defendant, and this Court ruled that:</p>

<blockquote>"The action of a trial court in dissolving a writ of
preliminary injunction already issued after hearing, without giving petitioner
an opportunity to be heard, does not constitute lack or excess of jurisdiction
or an abuse of discretion, and any irregularity committed by the trial court on
this score may be cured not by certiorari but by appeal."</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The fourth reason
alleged by petitioner in support of its stand is that public interest demanded
that the writ enjoining respondent <span class="SpellE">Fausto</span> Alberto
from exercising the functions of managing director be maintained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner contended that respondent Alberto
had arro­gated to himself the powers of the Board of Directors of the
corporation because he refused to vacate the office and surrender the same to
Jose de la Rosa who had been elected managing director by the Board to succeed
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This assertion, however, was
disputed by respondent Al<span style="">berto who
stated that Jose de la Rosa could not be elect</span>ed managing director
because he <span style="">did not own any stock in </span>the
corporation.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There is in the record no
showing that Jose de la Rosa owned a share of stock in the corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If he did </span>not own any <span style="">share of stock, certainly he could not be a
director pursuant to the mandatory provision of Section 30 of the Corporation
Law, which in part provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Sec. 30.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Every director must own in his own right at
least one share of the capital stock of the stock corporation of which he is a
director, which stock shall stand in his name on the books of the
corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">If he could not be a director, he could
also not be <span style="">a
</span>managing director of the corporation, pursuant to Article V, Section 3
of the By-Laws of the Corporation which provides that:</p>

<blockquote>"The manager shall be elected by the Board of Directors from
among its members.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>" (Record, p. 48)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">If the managing director-elect was not qualified
to become managing director, respondent <span class="SpellE">Fausto</span>
Alberto could not be compelled to vacate his office and cede the same to the
managing director-elect because the by-laws of the corporation provides in
Article IV, Section 1 that "Directors shall serve until the election and
qualification of their duly qualified successor."</p>

<blockquote><span style="">4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The fifth reason alleged by herein petitioner </span>in
support of its contention that respondent Judge gravely abused his discretion
when he lifted the preliminary injunction upon the filing of the counter-bond
was that said counter-bond could not compensate for the irreparable damage that
the corporation would suffer by reason of the continuance of respondent <span class="SpellE">Fausto</span> Alberto as <span style="">managing
</span>director of the corporation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent Alberto, on the contrary, contended that he really was the
owner of the controlling interest in the business carried on in the name of the
petitioner, having invested therein a total of P57<span class="GramE">,727.29</span>
as against the sum of P4,000 only invested by one other director, Jose M. <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find
that there was a question as to who own the controlling interest in the
corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where ownership <span style="">is </span>in dis<span style="">pute, the </span>party in control or
possession of the disputed interest is presumed to have the better <span style="">right un</span>til the contrary <span style="">is </span>adjudged,
and hence that <span style="">party </span>should not
be <span style="">deprived of </span>the control or
possession until the court is prepared to adjudicate the <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>
right in favor of the other party.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Should it be the truth that respondent Alberto <span style="">is </span>the
controlling stockholder, then the damages said respondent would suffer would be
<span style="">the same, if not more, </span>as the
damages that the corporation would suffer if the injunction were
maintained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the bond of P5<span class="GramE">,000</span> filed <span style="">by
petitioner for the injunction would be sufficient to </span>answer for the
damages that would be suffered by res­<span style="">pondent
Alberto by reason of the injunction, there seems to be no reason why the same
amount would not be sufficient to answer for the damages that might be suffered
by the petitioning corporation by reason of the lifting of the injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The following ruling of this Court has a
persuasive application in this case:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The rule that a court should not, by means of <span style="">a </span>preliminary
injunction, transfer property in litigation from the possession of one party to
another is more particularly applicable where the legal title <span style="">is </span>in
dispute and the party having possession asserts ownership in <span class="GramE">himself</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Let it be stated, in
relation to all the reasons given by petitioner, that it </span><span style="">is a </span><span style="">settled rule that the issuance of the writ of
preliminary injunction as an ancillary or preventive remedy to secure the
rights of a party in a pending case is entirely within the discretion of the
court taking cognizance of the case -- the only limitation being that this
discretion should be exercised based upon the grounds and in the manner
provided by law,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> and it is equally well settled </span><span style="">that a wide latitude is </span><span style="">given under Section 7 of Rule </span><span style="">58 of the Rules of Court to the trial court
to modify or dissolve the injunction as justice may require.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court which is to exercise that
discretion is the trial court, not the appellate court.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The exercise of sound judicial discretion by
the lower court in injunctive matters should not be </span><span style="">interfered with except in cases </span><span style="">of manifest abuse.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> In the instant case, <span class="GramE">We</span>
find that petitioner failed to show manifest abuse of dis­cretion by respondent
Judge in setting aside the writ of preliminary injunction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There is, however, one vital reason why the in<span style="">stant petition for certiorari should be denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And it </span><span class="GramE">is,</span>
that from the order dissolving the writ <span style="">of
prelimi</span>nary injunction, the petitioner has gone directly to this Court
without giving the respondent Judge (or trial court) a chance or opportunity to
correct his error, if any, in an appropriate <span style="">motion for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An </span>omission
to comply with this procedural requirement justifies a denial of the writ
applied for.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">The
instant case is not one of the exceptions </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">the application of
this rule, which are:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>where the ques­tion

and decided by the respondent court; where the questioned order is a patent
nullity; and where there is a deprivation of the peti</span><span style="">tioner's </span><span style="">fundamental right to due process.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It being our considered
view that respondent Judge had not committed grave abuse of discretion in
issuing the order dated August 5, 1964 lifting the writ of preliminary
