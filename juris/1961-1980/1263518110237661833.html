				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The antecedent events which gave rise to this appeal are largely
a matter of record and substantially undisputed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The order appealed from was issued by the
Court of First Instance of Manila (Branch XVI) in its Civil Case No. 59754,
finding Raul T. <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> and Reynaldo A. <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, president and general manager of the Republic
Commodities Corporation, respectively, in contempt of court and imposing upon
each of them a fine of P100.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="19" month="3">March 19, 1965</st1:date>
the Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, in compliance with <span style="">a </span>writ of seizure regularly issued by
the aforesaid Court in connection with a <span class="SpellE">replevin</span>
case earlier filed by the Republic Commodities Corporation, seized from
defendant <span class="SpellE">Salustiano</span> <span class="SpellE">Oca</span> 16
of the 19 second­hand "Carrier" air-conditioning units described in
the writ.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These units were the objects
of a conditional sale by the said corporation in favor of defendant, who
allegedly de­faulted in the payment of the installments due.</p>

<p class="BODY">Six <span style="">(6) </span>days after
the articles were seized, or on <st1:date year="1965" day="25" month="3">March
 25, 1965</st1:date> to be exact, the sheriff, not having actually received any
notice that defendant <span class="SpellE">Salustiano</span> <span class="SpellE">Oca</span>
intended to seek their return, delivered them to plaintiff in accordance with
the provisions of section 6, of Rule 60 of the Rules of Court<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It later turned out t<span style="">hat, unknown </span>to the sheriff, defendant <span class="SpellE">Oca</span>
had filed with the lower court the day before, <span style="">March </span>24, 1965, and within the 5-day period fixed in the rule
aforecited, a motion for the immediate recall of the order of seizure and at
the same time offered a counter-<span class="SpellE">replevin</span> bond for the
redelivery of the articles to him pursuant to Section 5 of the same Rule.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But because copies of this motion and of the
counter bond were received by plaintiff's counsel <span style="">only </span>on the 27th of March 1965,
plaintiff resisted defendant's plea for redelivery, pointing out that inasmuch
as copy of the counter bond was not served on plaintiff before it received the
seized articles and within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period of
five days, defendant had already lost his right to demand redelivery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This opposition notwithstanding, the lower
court granted defendant's motion in an order dated <st1:date year="1965" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Plaintiff filed a motion for reconsideration, which <span style="">was </span>denied on <st1:date year="1965" day="24" month="4">April 24, 1965</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiff took no steps to have the order of redelivery and the
denial of their motion for reconsidera­tion reviewed by a higher court; and due
to its <span style="">continuous </span>refusal and/or
failure to comply, defendant moved on June <span style="">29, 1965 that the present appellants</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> be declared in contempt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On July 10, 1965, the Court merely issued a
reminder, directing appellants to comply with the March 31 Order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff moved for a reconsideration of this
reminder, but was turned down in an Order dated July 27, 1965, with a warning
of drastic action against appellant's unless the air-condition­ing units were
redelivered to defendant immediately.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
August 11, 1965 the lower court declared them in contempt and imposed upon each
of them a fine of P100.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence this
appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Appellants' main argument
is that the lower </span>court had no authority to issue the Order of
redelivery because copy of the defendant's <span class="SpellE">counterbond</span>
was served on plaintiff's counsel beyond the period allowed by the Rules and
after the seized articles had been delivered to plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The argument in reality involves the
correctness and propriety of the Order, not the authority or jurisdiction to
issue it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Order may be erroneous,
but not for that reason may appellants unilaterally disregard it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their remedy against such error, or even if
indeed the court's jurisdiction is involved, is to seek a review by proper
petition before a higher tribunal.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The
theory espoused by appellants that a party may, at his own choice, directly
disobey a court order which said party believes to be erroneous or beyond the
court's authority is fraught with serious consequences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court, speaking through Mr. Justice
Enrique Fernando, has had occasion to condemn </span><span style="">a similar </span><span style="">attitude in another
case:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>The failure to abide <span style="">by the orders and processes of judicial x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> agencies x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> gives rise to </span><span style="">a serious </span><span style="">concern.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It engenders at the
very least the well-founded suspicion that such an attitude betrays an absence
of good faith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is indicative of a
belief at war with all that adjudication stands for.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">No one may be permitted to
take </span>the law into his own hands.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No one, much less the party immediately con­cerned, should have the
final say on the validity or lack of it of one's course of conduct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Centuries of re<span style="">liance on the judicial process repel such a notion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">“x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>. Such refusal to accord due respect and yield
obedience to </span>what a court or administrative tribunal ordains is fraught
with much graver consequences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> If such a conduct were not
condemned, some other group or groups emboldened by the absence of any reproof
or disapproval may con­duct themselves similarly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The injury to the rule of law may well-nigh
be irreparable.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Law stands for order, for the peaceful and systematic adjustment of
frictions and conflicts unavoidable in a modern society with its complexi­ties
and clashing interests. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>The
instrumentality for such balancing or harmonization is the judiciary and other
agencies exercising quasi-judicial powers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When <span style="">judicial </span>or
quasi-judicial tribunals speak, what they decree must be obeyed; what they
ordain must be followed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A party dis­satisfied
may ask for reconsideration and, if denied, may go on to a higher
tribunal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As long as the orders stand
unmodified, however, they must, even if susceptible to well-founded doubts on
jurisdictional grounds, be faith­fully complied with." (PAFLU vs. <st1:city><st1:place>Salvador</st1:place></st1:city>,
G.R. Nos. L-29471 and L-29487, <st1:date year="1968" day="28" month="9">Sept­ember
 28, 1968</st1:date>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We deem it unnecessary to pass upon the points raised by
appellants in their brief, which have to do with the correct interpretation of
the Rules applicable to the order of redelivery, not with appellant's liability
for contempt by reason of their continued defiance of court authority.</p>

<p class="BODY">The order appealed from is affirmed, with costs against
appellants.</p>
