				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner Tan Guan seeks
a review on certiorari of a decision of the Court of Tax Appeals upholding two
(2) assessments made by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue - hereinafter re­ferred
to as Commissioner - one for P72, 450 and the other for P128, 800, with costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The first represents
specific taxes allegedly due for the quantity of cigarettes that could have
been produced out of </span>300 bobbins of cigarette paper disposed of by
Imperial Tobacco Company - hereinafter referred to as Imperial - of which Tan
Guan is one of the principal partners, whereas the second constitutes the
specific taxes allegedly due on the cigarettes that could have been
manufactured out of the 800 bobbins of cigarette paper said to have been
purchased by Imperial from the Philippine Cig­arette Manufacturing Co., Inc.,
hereinafter referred to as the Manufacturing Co.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The records show that Tan
Guan and one Gonzalo Padua were cashier and president, respectively, as well as
the main partners of Imperial, a partnership organized in 1950.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The partnership was dissolved in 1951, owing
to failure to secure the requisite municipal </span>license for the manufacture
of cigarettes.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Prior thereto, Imperial
had purchased from the <span class="SpellE">Mabuhay</span> Cigarette Factory and <span class="SpellE">Seng</span> <span class="SpellE">Kee</span> &amp; Co. 860 and 300
bobbins of cigarette paper, respectively.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On </span><st1:date year="1951" day="30" month="7"><span style="">July 30, 1951</span></st1:date><span style="">, Imperial noti­fied the Commissioner that it
had delivered 300 bobbins (6000 meters) to the <span class="SpellE">Marikina</span>
Cigarette Factory - hereinafter referred to as </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Marikina</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> - on </span><st1:date year="1951" day="28" month="7"><span style="">July 28, 1951</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Subsequent investigations by agents of the Commissioner led them
however, to the conclusion that this alleged transaction is fictitious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, on </span><st1:date year="1953" day="21" month="1"><span style="">January 21, 1953</span></st1:date><span style="">, the Commissioner - acting in accordance
with section 150 of the National Internal Revenue Code</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> and section 10 of Revenue Regulations No.
V-7, dated October 31, 1950</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> - demanded from Imperial, through </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Padua</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">, the payment of P72, 450, as specific tax on
the quantity of cigarettes that can be manufactured with said 300 bobbins of
cigarette paper.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1953" day="9" month="2">February 9, 1953</st1:date>,
<st1:city><st1:place>Padua</st1:place></st1:city> conveyed to the Commis­sioner
his (<st1:city><st1:place>Padua</st1:place></st1:city>'s) intention to appeal
to the conference staff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appeal was
given due course on <st1:date year="1953" day="10" month="2">February 10, 1953</st1:date>,
and was set for the hearing before said conference staff on March 3 and 31,
1953.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:city><st1:place>Padua</st1:place></st1:city>
took part at the hearing on March 3, but, nobody appeared on behalf of Imperial
at the hearing on <st1:date year="1953" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1953</st1:date>,
despite the promise made by <st1:city><st1:place>Padua</st1:place></st1:city>
to then produce some documents.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, in a communication dated May 5, 1953, the Commissioner
demanded from Imperial the payment of P71, 450 - the balance of said specific
tax, after deducting P1000 paid on February 20, 1953 - plus P10, 000, as
compromise penalty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The communication
having been returned <span class="SpellE">unserved</span>, a warrant of <span class="SpellE">distraint</span> was issued against <st1:city><st1:place>Padua</st1:place></st1:city>,
on <st1:date year="1953" day="4" month="9">September 4, 1953</st1:date>; but,
to no avail, for no property belonging to him could be found.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A criminal action for violation of the Tax
Code was, on <st1:date year="1957" day="24" month="10">October 24, 1957</st1:date>,
filed against <st1:city><st1:place>Padua</st1:place></st1:city>, in the Court
of First Ins­tance of Manila, to be dismissed later upon the ground of pres­cription
of action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1958" day="20" month="3">March 20, 1958</st1:date>, the Commissioner demanded from
Tan Guan<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a> the payment of said sum of P72, 450 and, in
addition thereto, of P128, 800, as specific taxes on cigarettes.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The factual background of
this additional assessment of P128, 800 is as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1950" day="5" month="12"><span style="">December 5, 1950</span></st1:date><span style="">, the Manufacturing Co.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- a duly registered manufacturer of
cigarettes - asked the Commissioner's permission to sell 800 bobbins of
cigarette paper to Imperial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the foot
of the Manufacturing Co.'s request was a statement, signed by Imperial's
manager, to the effect that Imperial really wanted to buy said 800 bobbins of
cigarette paper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The permit was
forthwith granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1952" day="23" month="7"><span style="">July 23, 1952</span></st1:date><span style="">, in the course of a routine investigation
conducted by the Bureau of Internal Re­venue - hereinafter referred to as the
Bureau - a representative of Imperial denied that the latter had received said
800 bobbins of cigarette paper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
upon, the Commissioner assessed against the Manufacturing Co. the sum of P128,
800 as specific tax due on the cigarettes that could have been manufactured out
of said cigarette paper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Manufacturing Co. sought a recon­sideration of this assessment, and, at the
hearing thereon, be­fore the Conference Staff - notice of which had been served
on Tan Guan, who did not appear, despite the subpoena <span class="SpellE">duces</span>
<span class="SpellE">tecum</span> issued <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> - the
Manufacturing Co. introduced testimonial and documentary evidence of the
delivery of the goods to Imperial.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, on </span><st1:date year="1958" day="20" month="3"><span style="">March 20, 1958</span></st1:date><span style="">, the Commissioner withdrew the as­sessment
against the Manufacturing Co. and, in lieu thereof, assessed said sum of P128,
800, as specific taxes on the cigarettes that Imperial could have manufactured
out of said 800 bobbins of cigarette paper.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Tan Guan could not be located, however, until </span><st1:date year="1958" day="30" month="4"><span style="">April
 30, 1958</span></st1:date><span style="">, when the
corresponding assessment notice was delivered to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1958" day="6" month="5"><span style="">May 6, 1958</span></st1:date><span style="">, the Commissioner issued a warrant of <span class="SpellE">distraint</span> against the properties of Tan Guan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next day, Civil Case No. 4979 of the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> was filed by the
Government to recover from Tan Guan the aforementioned sums of P72, 450 and
P128, 800, as specific taxes on cigarettes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>About a week later, or on </span><st1:date year="1958" day="15" month="5"><span style="">May 15, 1958</span></st1:date><span style="">, Imperial asked the Commissioner a
rehearing, but, before this request could be acted upon, Tan Guan filed a
petition for review with the Court of Tax Appeals which, in due course,
rendered the appealed decision in favor of the Government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The main defense set up by Tan Guan is that of prescription of
action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With respect to the assessment
for P72, 450, he main­tains that the same was made on January 21, 1953,
whereas, the aforementioned civil action for the recovery of said sum and that
of P128, 800 was filed on May 7, 1958, or beyond the prescriptive period of
five (5) years which, Tan Guan maintains, is applicable thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be noted, however, that the running
of said period was interrupted on February 9, 1953, when Padua, acting on
behalf of Imperial, appealed the disputed assessment to the conference staff
and that, on May 8, 1953, the Commissioner re­iterated the demand for the
payment of said sum of P72, 450 (less P1, 000 paid on February 20, 1953) in
addition to P10, 000 as compromise penalty.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, from <st1:date year="1953" day="8" month="5">May 8, 1953</st1:date>
to <st1:date year="1958" day="7" month="5">May 7, 1958</st1:date>, when the
civil action was commenced, <u>less</u> than five (5) years had elapsed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the prescriptive period of five (5) years applies only
when a return is filed.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a> However,</p>

<blockquote>" In the case of a false or fraudulent return with intent to
evade tax or of a failure to file a return, the tax may be assessed, or a
proceeding in court for the collection of such tax may be be­gun without
assessment, at any time within <u>ten</u> years after the discovery of the
falsity, fraud, or omission."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE">Bisaya</span> Land Transportation Co. v.
Collector of Internal Revenue and Collector of Internal Revenue v. <span class="SpellE">Bisaya</span> Land Trans­portation Co.,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a> we held
that this provision applies whenever a return is not filed, whether it is
required or not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since, the civil action
for the recovery of P72, 450 and P128, 800 was commenced on <st1:date year="1959" day="7" month="5">May 7, 1959</st1:date>, or long before the
expiration of the aforementioned period of ten (10) years, it is clear that the
plea of prescription cannot be sustained.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is next urged that the Tax Court erred in holding that the
alleged sale to <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Marikina</span></st1:place></st1:city>
is fictitious, and that, the assessment for P72, 450 should, therefore, be
invalidated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This pretense is manifestly
devoid of merit, for: (1) Imperial's alleged request for permission to sell to <span class="SpellE">Marikina</span> - unlike the request of the Manu­facturing Co. -
was not accompanied by the written confirmation of the supposed buyer or its
representative, contrary to the pro­visions of Section 4 of Revenue Regulations
<span style="">No. </span>V-7;
(2) the signature, purporting to be that of the Commissioner, on the alleged
permit to make the sale in question, is, admittedly, forged; (3) <span class="SpellE">Marikina</span> is not registered in the Bureau of Internal
Revenue and is, evidently, a non-existent entity; and (4) Jose de <span class="SpellE">Dios</span>, who allegedly acknowledged receipt, on behalf of <span class="SpellE">Marikina</span>, of the 300 bobbins involved in this assessment,
is, likewise, a fictitious or non-existent person.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As </span><span style="">regards </span><span style="">the assessment for P128, 800, it is urged that the sale of 800 bobbins
of cigarette paper by the Manufacturing Co. to Imperial has not been duly
established.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this connection, it is
not denied that said Manufacturing Co. asked permission from the Commissioner
to sell said goods to Imperial; that this request was supported by a written
statement of Imperial, attesting to its intent to purchase said goods; that the
<span class="SpellE">consumation</span> of the sale thereof is evidenced by
invoices of the Manufacturing Co.; and that the latter had issued official
receipts for payments made by Imperial.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>More­over, the foregoing documentary evidence were confirmed by
affidavits of those who delivered the goods to Imperial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true that no records of Imperial to
this effect have been presented.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
due, however, to the fact that Imperial had kept no re­cords or books of
accounts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, the findings of
the Commissioner and those of the Court of Tax Appeals are borne out by
substantial evidence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The validity of Section
10 of Revenue Regulations No. V-7; upon which the Commissioner based his
action, is, likewise, as­sailed by Tan Guan; but this issue was not raised in
the Tax Court, and, consequently, cannot be entertained, for the first time, on
appeal.<b><o:p></o:p></b></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE,</span></b><span style=""> the decision appealed from should be, as it
is hereby affirmed, with costs against petitioner-appellant, Tan Guan.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>
