				<BR><BR><div align=""><div><strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"></span></strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><o:p></o:p></span>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On June 21, 1960, <span class="SpellE">Paulita</span> L. Esteban filed a petition for prohibition with 
preliminary injunction before the Court of First Instance of Manila seeking to 
enjoin Antonio V. Cava, together with the city fiscal of Manila and one of his 
assistants, from taking action on a complaint filed by Cava against her before 
said city fiscal charging her with falsification of a public document committed 
in connection with her duties as District Supervisor of <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is alleged that on October 1, 
1959 Cava filed the aforesaid complaint with the city fiscal of Manila which Was 
assigned to his assistant <span class="SpellE">Florontino</span> M. Villanueva for 
action; that the complaint was set for preliminary investigation whom Cava 
profiled his evidence; that June 1, 1960, <span class="SpellE">Paulita</span> L. 
Esteban asked for suspension of the investigation on the ground that Cava had 
already filed on May 5, 1959, a similar complaint against her before the Bureau 
of Civil Service which was still pending investigation and, hence, the same has 
the nature of a prejudicial question that has to be decided before the criminal 
case may be continued; that Esteban's motion was disregarded and Fiscal 
Villanueva set a date for the continuation of the preliminary investigation; and 
that when her motion for reconsideration was denied, she instituted the instant 
petition for prohibition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On June 29, 1960, the city fiscal 
filed a motion to dismiss alleging the following grounds; that the authority of 
the city fiscal to conduct a preliminary investigation of a criminal charge 
filed before him is authorized by Section 38-B of the Charter of the City of 
Manila; that the power of the city fiscal to conduct such investigation cannot 
be restrained or controlled by the court as ruled by the Supreme Court in a long 
line of decision; that in order that there may be a prejudicial question it 
should appear that the jurisdiction to try the same case is lodged before 
another tribunal which situation does not here obtain; and that the motion of 
Esteban is merely an attempt to delay the prosecution of the charge filed 
against her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">After Esteban had filed her 
opposition to the motion to dismiss and the parties had submitted their 
memoranda, the court <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">a quo</span></em> 
denied the motion and ordered respondents to file their answer within 10 days 
from receipt of a copy of the order. Respondents filed their answer in due 
course, and after hearing on the merits the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> rendered decision 
granting the petition. The court ordered respondents to withhold action on the 
complaint filed by Antonio V. Cava against <span class="SpellE">Paulita</span> L. 
Esteban until after the administrative charge filed by the former against the 
latter h have been finally disposed of. Respondents interposed present 
appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In the meantime, or on February 
2, 1965, appellants filed herein a written manifestation stating that the 
administrative case above adverted to has already been finally decided in a 
manner adverse to the herein <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, wherefore they 
pray that the present appeal be decided at the earliest convenience of the 
Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Inasmuch as the petition for 
prohibition which was originally filed by herein <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> before the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> is mainly predicated upon 
the fact that respondent city fiscal should be prevented from taking action on 
the criminal charge filed by Antonio V. Cava against <span class="SpellE">Paulita</span> L. Esteban because of the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the administrative case filed with the Bureau of 
Civil Service 'which she claims it involves a prejudicial question and, hence 
the action on the criminal case should be suspended until the administrative 
case shall have been finally disposed of, we are of the opinion that the instant 
appeal is now moot and academic it appearing that said administrative case has 
already been finally terminated. This appeal, therefore, should be 
dismissed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">WHEREFORE</span></strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the instant appeal is hereby 
dismissed. No costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="SpellE"><em><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Bengzon</span></em></span><em><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, C.
