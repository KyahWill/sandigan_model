				<BR><BR><div align="justify">A petition for certification election was filed before the Court of 
Industrial Relations by the National Mines and Allied Workers Union (NAMAWUMIF), 
alleging that the employer is the Philex Mining Corporation, engaged in Mining 
in Padcal, Tuba, Benguet, Mt. Province. The Philex Miners Association and the 
Philippines Association of Free Labor Unions (PAFLU) intervened. After due 
hearing, the Industrial Court on December 22, 1960, issued the following Order, 
the dispositive portion of which recites—
<blockquote>
<p>"Wherefore, pursuant to the provisions of Section 12 of Republic Act No. 875, 
and the rules of this Court on Certification Election the Department of Labor is 
hereby requested to conduct a certification election among the non-supervisory 
employees of the Philex Mining Corporation in order to determine whether the 
employees and/or workers desire to be represented for collective bargaining 
purposes with employer either by the National Mines and Allied Workers' Union 
(NAMAWUMIF), Philex Miners' Union, the Philippine Association of Free Labor 
Unions (PAFLU) or neither. * * *. Upon conclusion of the election, the result 
thereof shall be submitted to this Court for further 
disposition."</p></blockquote>
<p>The Philex Miners Union, under date of January 2, 1960, filed the 
following:—</p>
<p align="center">"MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION</p>
<blockquote>
<p>COMES now the Philex Miners Union, by its undersigned counsel and to this 
Honorable Court respectfully pray for the reconsideration of the Order dated 
December 22, 1960, and promulgated on the 23rd of December 1960, copy of which 
was received on December 28, 1960, for the reason that it is contrary to law, 
jurisprudence, and not in accord with the evidence adduced during the hearing of 
the case. The right to file an argument in support of this motion for 
reconsideration within the reglementary period is hereby reserved.</p>

Court</i>"</p></blockquote>
<p>The argument in support of the above motion was filed on January 5, 1961. The 
Department of Labor scheduled the certification election on January 20, 1961. On 
January 9, 1961, the Philex Miners Union filed an Urgent Motion to Suspend the 
Certification Election set for January 20, 1961, until after the motion for 
reconsideration shall have been resolved. On January 16, 1961, counsel for 
National Mines Union, presented a petition to dismiss the motion for 
reconsideration. Under date of January 14, 1960, the CIR <i>en banc</i>, in an 
unanimous resolution, dismissed the motion for reconsideration on the ground 
that same was not filed in accordance with sections 15, 16 and 17 of the CIR 
rules, as amended, and as a consequence "the urgent motion to suspend 
certification election filed by the same counsel should be, as it is hereby, 
denied".</p>
<p>On February 6, 1961, the present appeal on certiorari from the order of the 
CIR was filed by the herein petitioner, Philex Mines Union. The petition was 
given due course, and on February 20, 1961, upon the filing of a bond in the sum 
of P200.00 a preliminary injunction was issued by Us restraining the herein 
respondents from enforcing the order to conduct the certification election.</p>
<p>The certification election, was held on January 20, 1961, as scheduled, 
resulting in the defeat of the Philex Miners Union to the National Mines Union, 
by a wide margin of votes.</p>
<p>Petitioner claims that the lower court erred in holding that the motion for 
reconsideration heretofore quoted (Annex C) was not submitted in accordance with 
secs. 15, 16 and 17, CIR Rules and in not suspending the certification election. 
It is argued that inasmuch as the motion for reconsideration was signed by the 
counsel of the petitioner, and was subscribed and sworn to before the Clerk, 
Municipal Court on the 3rd day of January, 1961, there was a substantial 
conformity to the rule requiring "that the motion for reconsideration be duly 
verified under oath."</p>
<p>Section 15 of the CIR Rules, promulgated pursuant to sec. 1, of Commonwealth 
Act No. 559, provides—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The movant shall the motion, in six copies, within five (5) days from the 
date on which he receives notice of the order or decision, object of the motion 
for reconsideration, <i>the same to be verified under oath with respect to the 
correctness of the allegations of fact, and</i> serving a copy thereof 
personally or by registered mail, on the adverse party. The latter may file an 
answer, in six (6) copies, duly verified under oath."</p></blockquote>
<p>In view of the above provisions, the respondents now argue that the motion 
for reconsideration should be filed within 5 days from receipt of copy of the 
decision or order, and said motion should be verified under oath, with respect 
to the correctness of the allegations of fact; that the motion for 
reconsideration contained no such verification either by the union president or 
counsel; that it is merely an oath allegedly "subscribed and sworn to before" 
the municipal clerk, not below the signature of petitioner's counsel, Atty. 
Pablo C. Sanidad, but below the names of the attorneys to whom copies were to be 
furnished, showing that the supposed oath was placed in the motion merely as an 
after-thought; that the usual form of verification which should be familiar to 
legal practitioners, is that the affiant, after having been duly sworn on oath, 
deposes and says that he is the president of legal counsel or representative of 
the party filing the pleading; and that he thereby certifies that the facts and 
allegations contained in the motion, petition or pleading are true and correct, 
which will be followed by the oath signed before the administering officer, and 
that all these are wanting in the present case. Respondents further argue that 
when a pleading is required to be <i>verified</i> under oath, the requirement 
should be enforced, because verification is the exception, not the rule (Hummel 
vs. Wells Petroleum Co., 3 Fed. Rules Service, p. 91, U.S. Circ. Ct. of App, 7th 
Circ. May 3, 1930, 111 F.[d] 883), and that Rule 15, of the Rules of Court, is 
merely suppletory to the rules of the CIR, which provide for a particular 
procedure governing the matter and which should be strictly complied with.</p>
<p>While a ruling on the procedural issue may not altogether be necessary, in 
view of our conclusions with respect to the merits of the case, this Court 
holds, nevertheless, the dismissal of the motion for reconsideration to be 
erroneous. The respondent court dwelt on unwarranted technicalities. The motion 
for reconsideration was signed by the counsel for the movant. The signature of 
counsel amounted to a certification "that he has read the pleading; that to the 
best of his knowledge, information and belief, there is ground to support it; 
and that it is not interposed for delay (sec. 5, Rule 15, Rules of Court). The 
acknowledgment having been couched in the usual form "Subscribed and sworn to 
before me, etc.", the same is a substantial conformance to the rule that the 
motion for reconsideration be "duly verified under oath", as provided for by the 
CIR rules (Arambulo vs. Perez, 78 Phil., 387; 44 Off. Gaz., 3284). Furthermore, 
the verification required in section 15 of CIR rules, is to vouchsafe for the 
"correctness of the allegations of fact, in the motion for reconsideration". A 
cursory reading of the said motion will show that it does not contain an 
allegation of fact which needs verification; it impugns merely conclusions of 
law. A verification under the circumstances obtaining would be both useless and 
superfluous. If the principle enunciated in the Armbulo vs. Perez holds true to 
a pleading like a complaint, it should likewise be true to motions for 
reconsideration.</p>
<p>The above error, notwithstanding, will not justify the granting of the 
present petition. For, it is to be noted that the Department of Labor should 
conduct the certification election thirty (30) days after receipt of the court's 
order (Sec. 12, R.A. No. 875); Rule I, CIR, Sept. 4, 1953; Sec. 2, Subsec. [c]). 
The Department of Labor scheduled the certification election for January 20, 
1961. In the absence of any restraining order, issued by a competent court, the 
filing of the motion for reconsideration with the CIR <i>en banc</i>, did not 
have the effect of suspending <i>ipso facto</i>, the scheduled election. 
Petitioner knew that this is the rule, otherwise its counsel would not have 
presented an urgent motion to suspend the election. The motion for 
reconsideration was finally dismissed and the motion to suspend was denied, and 
the petitioner had not done anything on the matter, except to appeal to this 
Court. Even this appeal, without more, did not suspend the effect of the 
certification election; otherwise a party could arrest, without the necessary 
adequate court action, the movement of the bargaining processes, by the 
interposition of frivolous and useless appeal. It was only on February 20, 1961 
(one month after the certification election was held), that the preliminary 
injunction was issued by this Court. There was no more act to enjoin, there was 
no practical purpose of these proceedings, except perhaps to thwart the right of 
the chosen representatives of the respondent labor unions in that election, to 
enter into a collective bargaining contract, with the respondent 
corporation.</p>
<p>Petition for Certiorari is denied, and the Writ of Preliminary Injunction 
heretofore issued, is dissolved. Costs against herein petitioner.</p> <i>Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., Barrera, 
Dizon, Regala,</i> and <i>Makalintal, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
