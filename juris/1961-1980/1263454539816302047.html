Workmen's Compensation Commission dated <st1:date year="1963" day="6" month="11">November
 6, 1963</st1:date> granting additional compensation to respondent <span class="SpellE">Florenio</span> Diamante in RO5 WC Case No. 140, and the order
dated <st1:date year="1963" day="26" month="11">November 26, 1963</st1:date>
denying petitioner's motion for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent <span class="SpellE">Florenio</span> Diamante,
hereinafter referred to <span style="">as claimant, </span>worked <span style="">as a </span>coconut <span class="SpellE">sheller</span>
with petitioner Franklin Baker Co. of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
hereinafter referred to as company.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While thus work­ing with the company, claimant contracted tuberculosis,
which illness rendered him disabled for work on <st1:date year="1959" day="7" month="9">September 7, 1959</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Claimant filed a claim for disability compensation against the company
before the Regional Office of the Department of Labor at <st1:place><st1:placename>San
  Pablo</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
Laguna.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After due hearing the hearing
officer rendered a decision granting compensation to claimant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">The </span>company
appealed the decision of the hearing officer to the Workmen's Compensation
Commission, and the Commission affirmed the decision of the hearing officer and
ordered the company "to pay the claimant in lump sum the amount of TWO
THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY-ONE and 60/100 (P2,461.60) PESOS as compensation,
and beginning December 13, 1962, a weekly compensation of P14.48 until his
ailment of pulmonary tuberculosis <span style="">is </span>arrested
or cured, but the period of compen<span style="">sation
shall not exceed 208 weeks in all." The</span> <span style="">decision </span><span style="">also </span><span style="">ordered the company "to provide claimant
with such medical, surgical and hospital services and supplies as the nature of
his illness may require until said ailment </span>is <span style="">arrested or cured, pursuant to Section 13 of the </span>Act."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="13" month="9">September 13, 1963</st1:date>,
the company submitted a report to the Workmen's Compensation Commission stating
that it had completed, the payments for the 208 weeks ending on <st1:date year="1963" day="4" month="9">September 4, 1963</st1:date>, in accordance with
the <span style="">dec</span>ision and that the
claimant was still under medical treatment by a physician.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 8, 1963, respondent Diamante filed with the Commission
a petition for extension of the period of compensation beyond the 208 weeks
upon the ground that he "is still suffering from the said illness
(tuberculosis) which is disabling him up to <span style="">this date; and that </span><span style="">as
a matter </span>of fact claimant is still under treatment by the respondent
company physician."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The company opposed the petition, contending that Section 18 of
the Workmen's Compensation Law is not ap­plicable to the case of the
claimant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Despite the opposition of the
petitioner, the respondent Commission <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>, without any formal
hearing, issued an order dated November 6, 1963, extending the period for the
payment of compensation to the claimant beyond the 208 weeks and required the
petitioner corporation to pay further weekly compensation of P14.48 until
claimant's illness of pulmonary tuberculosis is declared arrested <span style="">or cured, but in no case to exceed P4<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, maximum compensation allowed by law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">From this decision,
petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration, but in </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">resolution dated </span><st1:date year="1963" day="26" month="11"><span style="">November 26, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, the Commission <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> denied
petitioner's motion for reconsideration for, lack of merit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Hence the present
petition for review.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The issues raised in this
appeal are:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether the
Commission en banc, as an appellate body, has original jurisdiction to hear and
decide a petition for extension of the period of compensation under Section 18
of the Workmen's Compensation Act;<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether the
Commission en banc in issuing its order dated <st1:date year="1963" day="6" month="11">November 6, 1963</st1:date>, without any formal hearing, acted with
grave abuse of discretion and without due process of law;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Whether an award of compensation which has been
satisfied may still be reopened on <span style="">a
mere </span>petition, and <span style="">a </span>period
for payment of compensation that had already expired be further extended; and<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether compensation
benefits under Section 14 of the Workmen's Compensa<span style="">tion Act covering temporary total </span>disability may be extended
beyond the general limita<span style="">tion of 208
weeks.</span><o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The decision and the
order appealed from must be sustained.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As regards the first </span>issue,
<span style="">it is clear that upon </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">abolition of the "Office of the Workmen's Compensa­tion
Commissioner" by operation of Reorganization Plan 20-A, the powers and
duties of the "Office of the Workmen's Compensation Commissioner" was
taken over by the Workmen's Compensation Commission as it now exists, and that
while the term "Workmen's Compensation Commissio</span>ner" still
appears in the Workmen's Compensation Act, as amended, said term refers to the
position created by Republic Act No. <span style="">772
which, as already stated, was </span><span style="">abolished by Reorganization Plan 20-A.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The term Work</span><span style="">­men's Compensation Commissioner appearing in the </span><span style="">Workmen's Compensation Law now refers to the </span>"Workmen's
<span style="">Compensation Commission" or any
"Commissioner" </span>or Commissioners", and vice versa, as
stated and defined in Section 1, Rule 2 of the Rules of the Workmen's Compensation
<span style="">Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>There is nothing, therefore, that
prevents the Workmen's Compensation Commission convened <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>,
or any one of its Commissioners, or two of its Commissioners, to act on a
petition for extension of the period of compensation, as has happened in the
present case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is noteworthy, <span style="">as </span>shown in the record, that in the
present <span style="">case </span>the Workmen's
Compensation Commission, upon receipt of the petition of claim­ant Diamante for
extension of the period of compensa­tion, assigned the petition to the
Commissioner who had previously, decided the original petition for compensation,
and the <span style="">two other</span> Commissioners
gave their concurrence to the order now sought to <span style="">be </span>reviewed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="">fact </span><span style="">that the two other </span>members of the
Workmen's Compensation <span style="">Co</span><span style="">m</span><span style="">mission
</span>concurred in <span style="">the findings of </span>the
<span style="">Commissioner who </span>was assigned to
act on the petition for extension of the period of compensation is an indication
that the Workmen's Compensation Commission had considered the petition
meritorious, and that the order granting the extension was the collective
ruling of the members of the Commission.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">We </span>cannot see how the
right of <span class="GramE">petitioner company</span> had been prejudiced by
this action of the Commission.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As
</span>regards the second, third and fourth issues, which are interrelated to
each other, the evidence shows that petitioner company submitted a report,
dated September 13, 1963, to the Workmen's Compensation Commission, manifesting
therein that it had complied with <span style="">the
previous decision granting </span>compensation to claimant <span class="SpellE">Florenio</span>
Diamante and that the claimant <span style="">was </span><span style="">still under </span>medical treatment which
was being provided for by the company.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is clear, therefore, by the very report <span style="">of the company that the </span>claimant <span style="">was still incapacitated </span><span style="">for </span><span style="">work,
and </span>consequently <span style="">the Workmen's
Compensation </span>Commission was justified in allowing the extension of the
period of compensation in accordance with Section 18 of the <span style="">Workmen's Compensation Law, as amended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Cer­tainly, </span><span style="">respondent Commission had not <span style="">acted
with grave </span></span><span style="">abuse </span>of
discretion, or in violation of, or without, <span style="">due process of law in granting the extension.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The company itself had supplied the basis for
the order of the Commission granting the extension.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">This Court, <span style="">in a previous
case,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> held </span>that where the employer has paid
compensation in accordance with the decision of the Workmen's Compensation
Commission, the compensability of the case is no longer open to question<span style=""> and there is no more necessity for a formal
hearing </span>with more reason should it be when the employer itself, as in <span style="">the </span>present <span style="">case, </span>has provided claimant with further medical assistance,
incontrovertibly evidencing claimant's further incapacity for work - a
circumstance that certainly justifies an extension of the period of compensation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The law <span style="">is </span>clear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under Section 18 of the Workmen's
Compensation Act, <span style="">as </span>amended,
the Workmen's Compensation Commission is authorized to reopen a case in order
to grant <span style="">an </span>extension of the
period of compensation, provided the total amount awarded as compensatio<span style="">n</span>, does not exceed four thousand
pesos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pertinent portion of Section
18 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, as <span style="">amended, upon which </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">Workmen's Compensation Commission relied in granting </span>the <span style="">extension of the
period </span>of compensation, reads:</p>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <u>Provided</u>,
<u>however</u>, That after, the payment has been made for the period specified
by the Act in each case, the Workmen's Compensation Commissioner may from time
to time cause the examination of the condition of the disabled laborer, with a
view to extending, if necessary, <span style="">the
period of compensation which shall not, however, exceed the said amount of four
thousand pesos."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Therefore, the Commission <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> in issuing its
order dated November 6, 1963, without any formal hearing, could not be
considered as having acted with grave abuse of discretion or without due
process of law.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">An award of compensation
which has been satisfied may still be reopened on petition for extension of the
period of compensation; and, a period for payment of compensation that has
already expired may further be extended, provided the total compensation
awarded does not exceed four thousand pesos as pro­vided for in Section 18 of
the Workmen's Compensation Act, although the extension goes beyond the 208
weeks provided for in Section 14 of the same Act.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the case of <span class="SpellE">Avecilla</span> Building Corporation v. Hon. <span class="SpellE">Cesareo</span>
de Leon, et al., <u>supra</u>, this Court, resolving precisely the question
regarding the extension of the period of compensation, held:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Speaking of this right of the Workmen's Compensation
Commissioner to reopen a case already decided by him, it is an innovation
introduced by Republic Act 772, particularly, Section 13 thereof, amending
Section 18 (last paragraph) of the original Workmen's Compensation Law, namely,
Act No. 3428.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before amendment, the last
paragraph of Section 18 read thus:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'The total comp<span style="">e</span>nsation
prescribed in this and the <span style="">next pre­ceding
section and the total com</span>pensation prescribed in sections fourteen and
fifteen of this Act shall, together, not exceed the sum of three thousand
pesos.’</p>

<blockquote>As amended, the said
last paragraph now reads as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'The total compensation prescribed in this and the next pre­ceding section
and the total compensation prescribed in sections fourteen and fifteen of this
Act shall, together, not exceed the sum of four thousand pesos:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Provided</u>, <u>however</u>, <span style="">That after the payment </span>has been made
for the period specified by the Act in each case, the Workmen's Compensation
Commissioner may from time to time cause the examination of the condition of
the disabled laborer, <span style="">with </span><span style="">a view </span><span style="">to extending, if necessary, the period of compensation
which </span>shall <span style="">not, </span>however,
exceed the said <span class="GramE">amount</span> of four thousand pesos.'</p>

<blockquote><span style="">One
change introduced </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">the increase from </span>P3<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> to P4,000.00
of the total compensation provided <span style="">in </span>the
original provision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The more important
change, however, is <span style="">that </span>contained
in the proviso, which <span style="">is </span>the
last part of the paragraph. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>This <span style="">le</span>gal provision empowering Workmen's
Compensation Boards or Commissioners to reopen a case is contained in the
Workmen's Compensation acts of many of the States of the American union,
including the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Territory</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename>Hawaii</st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"It will be noticed, however, that while in the several states
of the Union, the reopening is intended for the benefit of both employer <span style="">and </span>employee in the sense that, in <span style="">case </span>of
aggravation or deteriora<span style="">tion of the
disability of the employee, the period of compensation should be extended up to
a certain limit, or in case the condition of the employee improves or the
disability disappears altogether, the period of compensation </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">shortened or compensation </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">stopped, our law, under Section 18, is a
little one sided and is all for the benefit of the employee, for the reason
that as may be gathered from the proviso the Commissioner may from time </span>to
time cause examination of the con<span style="">dition
of the disabled laborer, <u>with a view </u></span><u><span style="">to</span></u><u><span style=""> exte</span></u><u><span style="">nding</span></u><span style="">, </span><span style="">if necessary, the period
of compensation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this respect, there
is room for improvement of the law so </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">to make it more equitable to <span class="GramE">both parties</span>,
labor and management.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Furthermore
while in the severe states of the American union, the time within which the
Commissioner or reopen is limited anywhere one year to several years, our law
contained in the proviso in </u></span><u>question, sets no time limit</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* *" (<span style="">Emphasis </span>supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">, the petition for review should be dis­missed,
and the decision</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">and order appealed from should be, as they
are hereby, affirmed, with costs against pe­titioner, Franklin Baker Company of
