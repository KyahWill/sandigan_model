of the Court of First Instance of Manila finding petitioner guilty of slander 
under Article 358 of the Revised Penal Code and sentencing her to pay a fine of 
P100.00 and to indemnify the offended party in the amount of P1<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.
<p>The facts found by the Court of Appeals are as follows:</p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p>“ ... it appears that at about 10:00 a.m. of October 31, 1958, the 
complainant, Lourdes A. <span class="SpellE">Tagle</span>, a job analyst of the 
Philippine National Bank, Manila, received a phone call from <span class="SpellE">Estefania</span> de Guzman, defendant-appellant, section chief of 
the auditing department of the same bank, asking the former to repair to the 
office of the latter at the fourth floor of the said building, <span class="SpellE">Escolta</span>, Manila. The offended party immediately went to the 
office of the accused and there she was asked by the latter to pay the 
indebtedness which she owed her. They later agreed that the complainant would 
deliver to the accused certain pieces of jewelries as security for the payment 
of said loan, after which Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Tagle</span> returned to her 
office at the third floor of said building. At this precise moment, the accused 
noticed that her cash money in the amount of P90.00 was missing from her table 
and suspected that Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Tagle</span> was the one who has 
taken the same as she was the only one who approached her at her table. She 
requested <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> Austria another employee of the same 
office to call again Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Tagle</span>, which was done. Mrs. 
<span class="SpellE">Tagle</span> again went to the office of the accused and upon 
inquiry what she wanted, the latter told her that she lost her money in the 
amount of P90.00. Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Tagle</span> told the accused to look 
and search for it in her drawers to which the latter replied that she did it 
already. At this juncture, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Tagle</span> asked the 
accused if she was suspecting her of getting the money, and the accused replied 
that she was the only one who approached her table, to which Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Tagle</span> remarked that she did not get the money, to which 
appellant said "who knows". The accused continuing said that if the offended 
party did not take the money why was it that when the first came to see her she 
was bringing along her wallet, while at the second time she was no longer with 
the wallet, and then asked Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Tagle</span> to allow herself 
to be searched to which Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Tagle</span> agreed and started 
crying. However the search was not made, and Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Tagle</span> sent <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> Austria to get 
her wallet and when it was shown to the accused, Marina Reyes arrived and heard 
the argument between the complainant and the accused. The wallet was opened in 
the presence of other persons who were attracted by the commotion, but the money 
was not found in the wallet."</p></blockquote>
<p>Petitioner avers that the Court of Appeals erred (1) in holding that her 
utterances were slanderous; (2) in holding that malice in law and/or in fact 
existed; and (3) in sentencing petitioner to a fine of P100.00 and damages in 
the amount of P1,000.00.</p>
<p>In denying the defamatory character of the utterances petitioner maintains 
that she was acting within her rights in confronting the complainant with the 
loss of her money, and that it was a natural impulse for anybody to do what she 
did under the circumstances. Petitioner also points out that she did not call 
the offended party a thief, nor did she directly accuse her of having stolen her 
money.</p>
<p>The contention is without merit. While it is true that the accused did not 
directly call the offended party a thief, yet the implication of her acts and 
statements was clearly to that effect. When she confronted the complainant 
regarding the loss of the money she said that the latter was the only one who 
had approached her table and that as soon as the complainant left the money had 
disappeared. When the complainant denied having taken the money, petitioner 
replied, “who knows?", and then asked why the complainant had her wallet the 
first time she came but was not carrying it anymore on her return. Finally, 
petitioner suggested to the complainant that she should allow herself to be 
searched. All these statements were made in a loud voice in the presence of many 
persons. To be sure, petitioner had the right to make inquiries, but she went 
beyond that and practically accused the offended party of the theft, subjecting 
her to embarrassment and ridicule before other bank employees.</p>
<p>Petitioner also claims that there was no malice in law and/or in fact in the 
utterances in question which would give rise to the crime of slander. It was her 
well-grounded belief, she says, that the offended party was the one who took her 
money and her motive in confronting her with the loss was merely to locate it, a 
motive that was obviously justified. </p>
<p>The circumstances surrounding the case should be taken into consideration to 
determine whether or not malice was present in petitioner's utterances. It is an 
undisputed fact that she was irked when the offended party failed to comply with 
her promises regarding the payment of her indebtedness. Petitioner was insisting 
on such payment, although after realizing that the offended party had no money 
to pay, she agreed to accept the security of the <span class="SpellE">latter’s</span> jewelry in the meantime. It was then that 
petitioner discovered that her money in the amount of P90.00 was missing, and 
forthwith sent for the complainant to ask her about the loss. The ensuing 
remarks of petitioner, particularly the suggestion that the complainant submit 
to a search of her person, show the existence of malice in fact. Otherwise the 
inquiry should have been done discreetly and not in the form of imputations 
within the hearing of other employees.</p>
<p>We are convinced that neither the trial court nor the Court of Appeals 
committed the errors assigned in petitioner's brief. We believe, however, that 
the amount of indemnity adjudged in favor of the complainant should be reduced 
to P500.00. With this sole modification the judgment of the Court of Appeals is 
affirmed, with costs against petitioner.</p>
