3, Vicente Leogardo, Jr., Chief Workmen's Compensation Section and
Atanacio A. Mardo, Hearing Officer of the Workmen's Compensation
Commission, from proceeding with the determination of the claim for
compensation filed by Cesar M. Pablico against the Century Insurance
Company, Inc.<p></p>
<p> The record shows that Cesar M. Pablico was employed as accountant
of the Century Insurance Company, Inc., from June 1, 1950 to December
6, 1958, at a salary of P500 per month. On July 1, 1957 he wrote his
employer that he was ill, and asked that he be laid off. He expressed
the hope that upon his recovery he would be reinstated, (pp. 9-10, of
complaint in C.F.I.). On December 22, 1958, Pablico gave written notice
to his employer that he contracted pulmonary tuberculosis, while
employed. In this written notice Pablico states that he gave verbal
notice of his illness to his employer on July 1, 1957. Photostatic copy
of the notice of injury or sickness and claim for compensation was
presented as Exhibit "A". On December 23, 1958, having received copy of
the formal claim in due form, the Workmen's Compensation Section
notified the manager of the Century Insurance Co., Inc. of the claim of
Cesar M. Pablico for compensation (Exhibit "B"). This notice was
received by the Century insurance Co., Inc. on January 2, 1959. Upon
receiving such notice attorney for respondent informed the regional
office taking cognizance of the claim (Regional Office No. 3) that the
employer would controvert the claim because the claimant failed to
comply with the conditions precedent provided for by law and because
the claim for compensation is already barred by the Statute of
Limitations. Subsequently, on January 10, 1959, said attorney presented
a motion to dismiss with said Regional Office No. 3, arguing in support
of the claims for dismissal that since claimant presented his claim on
December 23, 1958, 17 days after December 6, 1958, the presentation of
the claim is belated because Pablico was no longer an employee of the
Century Insurance Company. It is also argued that the claimant gave
notice of his desire to be separated on July 1, 1957, but did not file
his claim for compensation until December 23, 1958, so that the claim
was presented only after one year, 5 months and 22 days from the date
he had knowledge of his injury (he gave notice of his illness on July
1, 1957 but did not file his claim until December 23, 1958).</p>
<p> The hearing officer denied the motion to dismiss on May 11, 1959,
as well as a motion to reconsider said denial on May 26, 1959,
whereupon Century Insurance Co., Inc. instituted this action for
certiorari and prohibition with the Court of First Instance of Manila,
alleging the following facts: That on December 6, 1958, Pablico
terminated his services with the Century Insurance Company; that on
December 23, 1958, he presented a claim for compensation with the
Regional Office No. 3 of the Department of Labor under the jurisdiction
of the defendants; that the petitioner presented a motion to dismiss on
the ground that the claim of Pablico with the Workmen's Compensation
Commission, Regional Office No. 3, was filed only on December 23, 1958,
that is, 17 days after his separation from the Century Insurance
Company Inc. and one year, five months and 22 days from the time that
he notified said company of his illness on July 1, 1957; that under the
provisions of Section 24 of Act No. 3428 as amended, the claim for
compensation must be presented not later than two months after the date
of injury or sickness; that the making of the claim within the period
stipulated above is jurisdictional and is a condition precedent to
maintain a proceeding for compensation under the provisions of the
Workmen's Compensation Act. On the basis of this allegation, the
petitioner prayed that the defendants be prohibited and enjoined from
entertaining, giving due course, hearing and deciding the claim for
compensation of respondent Cesar M. Pablico.</p>
<p> Respondent filed an answer claiming that the errors in the
application of the evidence or errors of judgment in the exercise of
jurisdiction are not matters that may be determined in a certiorari
proceeding; that the late filing of a claim for compensation is not a
jurisdictional matter that may be the subject of a proceeding by
certiorari, and that the petitioner has another plain, speedy and
adequate remedy, because it could elevate the case to the Workmen's
Compensation Commission and from there to the Supreme Court. The
defendants, therefore, prayed that the petition be dismissed and that
the preliminary injunction should be dissolved.</p>
<p>Respondent Cesar Pablico filed an answer claiming as special
defenses: (1) That the grounds alleged in petitioner's motion to
dismiss filed with the regional offices are matters which cannot be
resolved until after the hearing on the claim for compensation; (2)
that the facts alleged do not show that the respondent officers have
acted without or in excess of jurisdiction; (3) that the remedy of the
petitioner is to have the order of the regional offices reviewed in the
Supreme Court when the proper time comes.</p>
<p> In passing upon the merit of the petition for certiorari, the court below reasoned:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, the court hereby
renders judgment holding that respondent Cesar M. Pablico failed to
comply with the jurisdictional and conditions precedent provided for in
Section 24, Act No. 3428, as amended, known as the Workmen's
Compensation Act, in presenting his claim for compensation after (1)
year, five (5) months and twenty-two (22) days from and after the date
of his alleged sickness, July 1, 1957, and his cause of action, if any,
has prescribed. The claim of respondent Pablico for compensation is
hereby ordered dismissed and respondent officers, F. A. Fuentes,
Vicente Leogardo, Jr., and Atanacio A. Mardo, are hereby adjudged to
have acted not only in excess but without jurisdiction and with grave
abuse of discretion in entertaining, giving due course and attempting
to hear and decide the claim for compensation filed by said respondent
Cesar M. Pablico against the petitioner. The preliminary injunction
previously issued in this case by this Court is hereby made permanent,
with costs against the respondents." (pp. 10-11, Decision)</p>
</blockquote>
<p> The ground of the court below in granting the order prohibiting the
officers of the regional office from hearing the claim for compensation
of Cesar M. Pablico, is the failure to present said claim within the
period of two months from the date of injury, as prescribe in section
24 of Act No. 3428. The court reasons that since the right of action of
Pablico has prescribed, the officers hearing his claim have acted not
only in excess but without jurisdiction and with grave abuse of
discretion. The import of the ruling is that the officers authorized to
hear the claim for compensation would have jurisdiction to proceed to
hear and determine said claim, if the same was presented within the
time limited, but no such jurisdiction if the claim is presented beyond
the period prescribed; and that in the latter case, they may be
enjoined or prohibited from hearing the claim. In short, the
jurisdiction of the hearing officers is made to depend upon the timely
presentation of the claim.</p>
<p> We have carefully examined the two decisions cited by the court below, namely, that of Lewis <em>vs</em>. Industrial Commission, 357 III. 309, 192 N. E. 213, and Burke <em>vs</em>.
Industrial Commission 368 I. 554, 119 A. L. R. 1152. The basis of these
decisions is Section 24, Compensation Act, Illinois, Revised Statute
1937, which provides that "no proceeding for compensation shall be
maintained unless notice of the accident * * *", is given and unless
the claim has been made within six months after the accident or injury.
In the first case, the court did not hold that the Industrial
Commission, which had jurisdiction of the claim, had no power or
jurisdiction to consider and pass upon the validity of the claim. The
commission found that no complaint for compensation was made in time.
The circuit court confirmed this decision of the Industrial Commission
and on appeal the Supreme court of Illinois held that as the claimant
had failed to establish that a claim for compensation was made within
the period prescribed by Section 24 of the Workmen's Compensation Act,
the judgment of the circuit court (affirming the denial of claim, for
compensation) should be affirmed.</p>
<p> In the second case (Burke vs. Industrial Commission) the Industrial
Commission had denied compensation on the ground that it is without
jurisdiction because claimant did not file her application within one
year after the date of the injury. The superior court affirmed this
decision. Upon appeal to the Supreme Court of Illinois, the latter held
that the plaintiff filed an application within one year and complied
with the other statutory conditions precedent, so the order of the
superior court dismissing or affirming the denial of the petition for
confirmation, was reversed with direction that an award for the
claimant for compensation be made. In this case statement is made that
the Industrial Commission was without jurisdiction, what the Industrial
Commission wanted to say when it declared that it had no power to grant
compensation is not that it has no power to grant compensation in case
at bar but that such power would not be exercised because the claim was
presented beyond the period prescribed. The term jurisdiction in the
cases considered above is used in a loose sense, to mean the power of
the court to grant the remedy in the case, not the power to hear
compensation cases generally.</p>
<p> The above considerations pose this question: Is the jurisdiction or
power of the Workmen's Compensation Commission to hear, consider and
make an award, dependent upon the existence of the grounds for granting
the award as provided by law, or the timeliness of the filing of the
claim? The Workmen's Compensation Act (Act No. 3428) grants to the
Commission the full authority "to hear and determine all claims for
compensation under this Act in the manner herein provided; * * * to <em>excuse failure to give notice either of injury, sickness or death of an employee</em> * * * (<em>Sec. 47, Ibid</em>.) On the other hand, Section 24 of the Act provides as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "No compensation proceeding under this Act shall
prosper unless the employer has been given notice of the injury or
sickness as soon as possible after the same was received or contracted,
and unless a claim for compensation was made not later than two months
after the date of the injury or sickness, or in case of death, not
later than three months, after death, regardless of whether or not
compensation was claimed by the employee himself."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> The above provisions clearly indicate that the timeliness of the
notice is not determinative of the power of the Commission to hear and
determine the claim. Furthermore, on general principles, the presence
or absence of a right to compensation is the very subject of inquiry in
the proceeding conducted before the Commission. If according to the
Commission the claimant is not entitled to compensation because his
claim was not presented on time, such belated presentation may not be
considered as depriving <em>ipso facto</em> the Workmen's Compensation
Commission of its jurisdiction to determine the validity of the claim.
If, on the other hand, the Commission finds that the claim was
presented within the statutory period, it is not deprived thereby of
the power to hear the claim and to grant an award. This principle has
been explained by this Court in the very early cases of Herrera <em>vs</em>. Barreto and Joaquin, 25 Phil., 245 and Napa <em>vs</em>. Weissenhagen, 29 Phil., 180. In these cases we held:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"> "* * * It may be stated as a general
rule that the decision by a court of one of the fundamental questions
before it does not, except perhaps in cases involving a constitutional
question, deprive it of jurisdiction which ever way it may decide.
Jurisdiction is the authority to hear and determine a cause, the right
to act in a case. Since it is the power to hear and determine, it does
not depend either upon the regularity of the exercise of that power or
upon the rightfulness of the decision made. Jurisdiction should be
distinguished from the exercise of jurisdiction. The authority to
decide a case at all and not the decision rendered therein is what
makes up jurisdiction. Where there is jurisdiction of the person and
the subject matter, the decision of all other questions arising in the
case is but an exercise of that jurisdiction. (Herrera <em>vs</em>. Barretto, 25 Phil., Rep., 245 Gala <em>vs</em>. Cui, 25 Phil., 522; De Fiesta <em>vs</em>. Llorente, 25 Phil., 554.)</p>
  <p align="left">
"The writ of certiorari in so far as it was a method by which mere
errors of an inferior court should be corrected no longer exists. Its
place is now taken by the appeal. So long as the inferior court
maintains jurisdiction, its errors can be corrected only by that
method. The writ in this country has been confined to the correction of
defects of jurisdiction solely and cannot be legally used for any other
purpose."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> From the foregoing considerations, we hold that the mere fact that
a claim was presented before the Workmen's Compensation Commission or
its hearing officer beyond the period prescribed by the statute, is no
ground or reason for holding that the said Commission has no
jurisdiction to hear and determine the claim, for the question of
timely presentation is one of the facts or issues to be determined by
the Commission itself at the hearing. If the Commission makes an error
in its finding, holding that the claim was presented within the time
prescribed by the statute, when as a matter of fact, it was presented
beyond such time, such fact will not deprive said Commission of
jurisdiction to consider and pass upon the claim. If any such error is
committed, the error will be considered an error committed in the
exercise of jurisdiction, reviewable by appeal, but it cannot become a
ground for the granting of a writ of prohibition in the Court of First
Instance, enjoining the Commission from hearing and deciding the said
claim.</p>
<p> The petition for certiorari is hereby granted and the decision of
the Court of First Instance sought to be reviewed is hereby set aside
with costs against the petitioner Century Insurance Company, Inc.</p>
