				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><h3></h3><p>In a complaint for damages filed in the Court of First Instance of Bohol by 
appellants, the spouses Nicasio Bernaldes, Sr. and Perpetua Besas and their 
minor son, Jovito, against appellee, the Bohol Land Transportation Co., a 
domestic corporation engaged in business as a common carrier in said province, 
they alleged, in substance, that, in the afternoon of November 27, 1958, Jovito Bernaldes and his brother, Nicasio, boarded one of appellee's passenger trucks 
(B.L.T. Co. No. 322 with plate No. 1470) in the town of Guindulman, Bohol, bound 
for Tagbilaran of the same province; that on the way the bus fell off a deep 
precipice in bario Balitbiton, municipality of Garcia-Hernandez, of the said 
province, resulting in the death of Nicasio and in serious physical injuries to 
Jovito.</p>
<p>Defendant moved for the dismissal of the complaint on two grounds, namely, 
that the cause of action alleged therein was barred by a prior judgment, and 
that it did not state a cause of action.</p>
<p>At the hearing on the motion to dismiss, it was established that in Criminal 
Case No. 2775 of the same court, Leonardo Balabag, driver of the bus involved in 
the accident, was charged with double homicide thru reckless imprudence but was 
acquitted on the ground that his guilt had not been established beyond 
reasonable doubt, and that appellees, through Attys. Amora and Tirol, 
intervened in the prosecution of said case and did not reserve the right to 
file a separate action for damages.</p>
<p>Relying on the case of Maria C. Roa, <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Segunda de la Cruz, et. al., 107 
Phil., 8, promulgated February 13, 1960, the lower court sustained the motion 
on the ground of bar by prior judgment, and dismissed the case. Hence, this 
appeal.</p>
<p>The issues in this appeal are first, whether a civil action for damages 
against the owner of a public vehicle, based on broach of contract of carriage, 
may be filed after the criminal action instituted against the driver has been 
disposed of, if the aggrieved party did not reserve his right to enforce civil 
liability in a separate action, and second whether the intervention of the 
aggrieved party, through private prosecutors, in the prosecution of the criminal 
case against the driver—who was acquitted on the ground of insufficiency of 
evidence—will bar him from suing the latter's employer for damages for breach of 
contract, in an independent and separate action. </p>
<p>Article 31 of the New Civil Code expressly provides that when the civil 
action is based upon an obligation not arising from the act or omission 
complained of as a felony, such civil action may proceed independently of the 
criminal proceedings and regardless of the result of the latter. This provision 
evidently refers to a civil action based, mot on the act or omission charged as 
a felony in a criminal case, but to one based on an obligation arising from 
other sources, such as law or contract. Upon the other hand it is clear that a 
civil action based on the contractual liability of a common carrier is distinct 
from the criminal action instituted against the carrier or its employee based on 
the latter's criminal negligence. The first is governed by the provisions of 
the Civil Code, and not by those of the Revised Penal Code, and it being 
entirely separate and distinct from the criminal action, the same may be ins 
stituted and prosecuted independently of, and regardless of the result of the 
latter. (Visayan Land Transportation Co. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Mejia, et al., 99 Phil., 50 ; 52 
Off. Gaz. p. 4241). <br></p><p>The civil action instituted against appellee in this case is 
based on alleged <span style="font-style: italic;">culpa contractual</span> incurred by it due to its failure to carry 
safely the late Nicasio Bernaldes and his brother Jovito to their place of 
destination, whereas the criminal action instituted against appellee's driver 
involved exclusively the criminal and civil liability of the latter arising from 
his criminal negligence. In other words, appellant's action concerned the civil 
liability of appellee as a common carrier, regardless of the liabilities of its 
driver who was charged in the criminal case. Therefore, as held in Parker, et 
al. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Panlilio, et al., (91 Phil., 1), the failure, on the part of the 
appellants, to reserve their right to recover civil indemnity against the 
carrier can not in any way be deemed as a waiver, on their part, to institute a 
separate action against the latter based on its contractual liability, or on 
culpa aquiliana, under Articles 1902-1910 of the Civil Code. As a matter of 
fact, such reservation is already implied in the law which declares such action 
to be independent and separate from the criminal action. Moreover, it has been 
held that the duty of the offended party to mate such reservation applies only 
to the defendant in the criminal action, not to persons secondarily liable 
(Chaves et al. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Manila Electric 31:47).</p>
<p>True, appellants, through private prosecutors, were allowed to 
intervene—whether properly or improperly we do not here decide—in the criminal 
action against appellee's driver, but if that amounted inferentially to 
submitting in said case their claim for civil indemnity, the claims could have 
teen only against the driver but not against appellee who was not a party 
therein. As a matter of fact, however, inspite of appellee's statements to the 
contrary in its brief, there is no showing in the record before Us that 
appellants made of record their claim for damages against the driver or his 
employer; much less does it appear that they had attempted to prove such 
damages. The failure of the court to make any pronouncement in its decision 
concerning the civil liability of the driver and/or of his employer must 
therefore be due to the fact that the criminal action did not involve at all any 
claim for civil indemnity.</p>
<p>Lastly, as appellee's driver was acquitted only on reasonable doubt a civil 
action for damages against him may be instituted for the same act or omission 
(Rule 107, par. (d) ; Art. 29 New Civil Code). If such is the rule as against 
him, a fortiori it must in the case of his employer.</p>
<p>In view of all the foregoing, we find the appeal interposed by appellants to 
be meritorious. As a result, the order of dismissal appealed from is hereby set 
aside and the case is remanded to the lower court for further proceedings.</p>
