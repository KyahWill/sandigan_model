				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The crucial question presented in this <i>certiorari</i> and
prohibition proceeding, petitioners being the then Com­missioner of Customs,
the Honorable Juan Ponce <span class="SpellE">Enrile</span> as well as the
Chairman of the Anti-Smuggling Action Center (ASAC), General <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span> A. Cruz, is whether Judge <span class="SpellE">Walfrido</span>
de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Angeles is vested with jurisdiction to
entertain a complaint for <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> filed by the other
respondent, Andres M. <span class="SpellE">Vinuya</span>, for the recovery of a
Cadillac car, subject of a seizure and forfeiture proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ever since <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> v.
<span class="SpellE">Averia</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
the answer has not been in doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
matter of seizure and forfeiture is the exclusive concern of the Collector of
Customs, a court of first instance lacking power in the premises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, the plea that in this particular
case respondent Judge acted within the limits of his authority is predicated on
the alleged illegality of the seizure which, in the opinion of respondents, did
not confer jurisdiction on the Collector of Customs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a contention which loses sight of the
vital distinction between the existence of authority and the mode of its
exercise does not suffice to call for a different ruling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We reiterate the principle of the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Collector of Customs in seizure and forfeiture
proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We grant the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the petition filed on May 28, 1968, it would appear that
upon the application of the ASAC on February 9, 1968, the then Collector of
Customs of the Port of Manila issued a warrant of seizure and detention against
the Cadillac car involved in this case, the owner-claimant being a certain
Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Ceñadoza</span>, as the taxes and duties had not
been paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The warrant was served and
enforced on <st1:date year="1968" day="2" month="4">April 2, 1968</st1:date>
prior to the filing of a complaint for <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> with
respondent Judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The circumstances
indicative of the alleged failure to pay such taxes and duties on the Cadillac
car are set forth in the petition thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"(a) In securing the registration of said car, Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Ceñadoza</span> predecessor-in-interest of respondent Andres M. <span class="SpellE">Vinuya</span>, used Informal Entry No. 1563652 dated May 9, 1967
and Certificate of Payment No. 10868 in the amount of P1,305.00, both of the
Bureau of Customs, but upon checking the records of the Land Transportation
Commission, it was found that said informal entry and certificate of payment
corresponded to <u>a 1961 Fiat 600, and not to the Cadillac car in dispute</u>;
(b) The person who paid the said taxes and duties is one Pablo Cruz, Jr., who
does not appear to be one of the predecessor-in-interest of respondent <span class="SpellE">Vinuya</span>; (c) As shown by Annex B hereof, when the Cadillac
car was seized and detained by ASAC agents, its plate license was No. H-37264
(67) <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, and not Plate No. 35905 (67) <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, which was its plate number when it was allegedly
regis­tered; (d) On February 14, 1968, a certain Jess O. <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span>,
General Manager of the Le <span class="SpellE">Sabre</span> Car Exchange, Manila,
executed an affidavit * *, to the effect that Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Ceñadoza</span>
had left the said car in his possession for the purpose of selling the same and
that the affiant had obligated himself to 'waive my (his) rights to sell the
above-mentioned car not until the proper taxes due to the government has been
satisfactorily paid'; (e) On February 15, 1968, said Jess <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span>,
who then had possession of the said Cadillac car, through his lawyer, Thomas S.
Cortez, executed a promissory note * * *, obligating himself to pay the
corresponding taxes and duties."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It was moreover shown in the petition that the owner, Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Ceñadoza</span>, had sold such car to one Francisco Dee from whom
respondent <span class="SpellE">Vinuya</span> acquired the same.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Under claim that he was aggrieved by such seizure and detention of the car in
question, respondent <span class="SpellE">Vinuya</span> filed a complaint for <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> in the <span class="SpellE">sala</span> of
respondent Judge.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
After filing a bond of P60<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> an ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> order was issued on <st1:date year="1967" day="19" month="4">April 19, 1967</st1:date> by respondent Judge directing a special
sheriff to take possession of the Cadillac car in question.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
On the very same day respondent Judge likewise gave due course to the complaint
for <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> and required petitioners to file their
answer.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There was, on the part of petitioners, a motion to dismiss as
well as to lift the ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In seeking such dismissal, the attention of
respondent Judge was invited to the fact that forfeiture proceedings had
already been instituted before the Collector of Customs who has the sole
jurisdiction to determine questions affecting the disposition of property under
seizure as well as the absence of a cause of action.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
There was an opposition by respondent <span class="SpellE">Vinuya</span> filed on
<st1:date year="1968" day="7" month="5">May 7, 1968</st1:date> and a denial
thereof in an order of respondent Judge on the ground that such motion to
dismiss "is without merit".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The matter was thus taken to this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">In our resolution of <st1:date year="1968" day="4" month="6">June
 4, 1968</st1:date>, respondents were required to answer; at the same time a
preliminary injunction was issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the answer filed on July 11, 1968, there was an admission that on February 9,
1968, the Collector of Customs of the Port of Manila issued a warrant of
seizure and detention against the Cadillac car, but there was a denial that the
registration covering the car was illegally secured as respondent <span class="SpellE">Vinuya</span> relied on what appeared to be a public document
valid and regular on its face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They base
their defense in the illegality of the seizure as the warrant on which it is
based is invalid and the seizing officer was devoid of authority; respondents'
principal contention thus is the assertion that an illegal seizure cannot
confer jurisdiction on the Collector of Customs.</p>

<p class="BODY">From a study of the records of the case as well as the applicable
law, the conclusion reached by us, as mentioned at the outset, is that the
petition should be granted.</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The prevailing doctrine
is that the exclusive jurisdiction in seizure and forfeiture cases vested in
the Collector of Customs precludes a court of first instance from assuming
cognizance over such a matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This has
been so, as noted, since <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Averia</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
In an opinion penned by Justice J. P. <span class="SpellE">Bengzon</span>, there
was a statement of the legal provisions that call for application.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"The Tariff and Customs Code, in Section 2530 thereof, lists the
kinds of property subject to forfeiture.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At the same time, in Part 2 of Title VI thereof, it provides for the
procedure in seizure and forfeiture cases and vests in the Collector of Customs
the authority to hear and decide said cases.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Collector's decision is <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> to the
Commissioner of Customs whose decision is in turn <span class="SpellE">appealable</span>
to the Court of Tax Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An
aggrieved party may appeal from a judgment of the Court of Tax Appeals directly
to this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand,
Section 44 (c) of the Judiciary Act of 1948 lodges in the Court of First Instance
original jurisdiction in all cases in which the value of the property in
controversy amounts to more than ten thousand pesos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This original jurisdiction of the Court of
First Instance, when exercised in an action for recovery of personal property which
is a subject of a forfeiture proceeding in the Bureau of Customs, tends to
encroach upon, and to render futile, the jurisdiction of the Collector of
Customs in seizure and forfeiture proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is precisely what took place in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The seizure and forfeiture proceedings
against the M/B '<span class="SpellE">Bukang</span> <span class="SpellE">Liwayway</span>'
before the Collector of Customs of Manila, was stifled by the issuance of a
writ of <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> by the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The crucial question whether Section 44(c) of the Judiciary Act
should give way to the provisions of the Tariff and Customs Code was answered
in the affirmative, the opinion clearly stating that "the Court of First
Instance should yield to the jurisdiction of the Collector of Customs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The jurisdiction of the Collector of Customs
is provided for in Republic Act 1937 which took effect on <st1:date year="1957" day="1" month="7">July 1, 1957</st1:date>, much later than the Judiciary Act of
1948.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is axiomatic that a later law
prevails over a prior statute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
on grounds of public policy, it is more reasonable to conclude that the
legislators intended to divest the Court of First Instance of the prerogative
to <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> a property which is a subject of a
seizure and forfeiture proceedings for violation of the Tariff and Customs
Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, actions for forfeiture
of property for violation of Customs laws could easily be undermined by the
simple device of <span class="SpellE">replevin</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
This excerpt from the opinion is likewise relevant:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Furthermore, Section 2303 of the Tariff
and Customs Code requires the Collector of Customs to give to the owner of the
property sought to be forfeited written notice of the seizure and to give him
the opportunity to be heard in his defense.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This provision clearly indicates the intention of the law to confine in
the Bureau of Customs the determination of all questions affecting the disposal
of property proceeded against in a seizure and forfeiture case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judicial recourse of the property owner
is not in the Court of First Instance but in the Court of Tax Appeals, and only
after exhausting administrative remedies in the Bureau of Customs."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The principle was reiterated in an opinion of the present Chief
Justice in De <span class="SpellE">Joya</span> v. David.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"As regards the merits of
this case, it is obvious that the Court of First Instance of Manila had no
jurisdiction over the subject-matter of Civil Case No. 56533 thereof, and that
neither had the Court of Appeals jurisdiction over the appeal taken from the
decision of said trial Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, in
said Case No. 56533 David sought to obtain possession of the goods which were
the object of seizure proceed­ings before the Collector of Customs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have already held that such action is
beyond the jurisdiction of courts of first instance."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Papa v. <span class="SpellE">Mago</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
likewise deserves to be cited.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
opinion of Justice <span class="SpellE">Zaldivar</span> for the Court
emphatically asserted the doctrine anew in the following language:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It is the settled rule, therefore, that
the Bureau of Customs acquires exclusive jurisdiction over imported goods, for
the purposes of enforce­ment of the customs laws, from the moment the goods are
actually in its possession or control, even if no warrant of seizure or
detention had previously been issued by the Collector of Customs in connection
with seizure and forfeiture proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the present case, the Bureau of Customs actually seized the goods in
question on <st1:date year="1966" day="4" month="11">November 4, 1966</st1:date>,
and so from that date the Bureau of Customs acquired jurisdiction over the
goods for the purposes of the enforcement of the tariff and customs laws, to
the exclusion of the regular courts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Much less then would the Court of First Instance of Manila have
jurisdiction over the goods in question after the Collector of Customs had
issued the warrant of seizure and detention on <st1:date year="1967" day="12" month="1">January 12, <span class="GramE">1967</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>And so, it cannot
be said, as respondents contend, that the issuance of said warrant was only an
attempt to divest the respondent Judge of jurisdiction over the subject matter
of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court presided by
respondent Judge did not acquire jurisdiction over the goods in question when
the petition for <i>mandamus</i> was filed before it, and so there was no need
of divesting it of jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not
having acquired jurisdiction over the goods, it follows that the Court of First
Instance of Manila had no jurisdiction to issue the questioned order of <st1:date year="1967" day="7" month="3">March 7, 1967</st1:date> releasing said
goods."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondents, however,
notwithstanding the compelling force of the above doctrines, would assert that
respondent Judge could entertain the <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> suit as
the seizure is illegal, allegedly because the warrant issued is invalid and the
seizing officer likewise was devoid of authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is to lose sight of the distinction, as
earlier made mention of, between the existence of the power and the regularity
of the proceeding taken under it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
governmental agency concerned, the Bureau of Customs, is vested with exclusive
authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even if it be assumed that in
the exercise of such exclusive competence a taint of illegality may be
correctly imputed, the most that can be said is that under certain
circumstances the grave abuse of discretion conferred may oust it of such
jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not mean however
that correspondingly a court of first instance is vested with competence when
clearly in the light of the above decisions the law has not seen fit to do
so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The proceeding before the Collector
of Customs is not final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An appeal lies
to the Com­missioner of Customs and thereafter to the Court of Tax
Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may even reach this Court
through the appropriate petition for review.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The proper ventilation of the legal issues raised is thus
indicated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly a court of first
instance is not therein included.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
devoid of jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the writ of <i>certiorari</i> prayed for is
granted, respondent Judge being clearly without jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a result whereof, the orders complained of
are set aside and declared to be without any force or effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The writ of prohibition is likewise granted
restraining respondent Judge from otherwise proceeding and continuing in any
manner whatsoever in said Civil Case No. Q-12025 pending in his <span class="SpellE">sala</span> which he is required to dismiss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The writ of preliminary injunction issued by
this Court is made permanent.</p>
