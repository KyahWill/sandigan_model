<p class="BODY"><span style="">The facts found by the
Court of Appeals - which must be deemed conclusive for the purpose of this
appeal - are as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The deceased, Roberto Pimentel, was confined on <st1:date year="1960" day="4" month="6">June 4, 1960</st1:date> in the municipal jail of <span class="SpellE">Maramag</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bukidnon</span>, as a detention
prisoner to answer a charge of stealing a chicken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="13">1:00
 p.m.</st1:time> when appellant was the police guard on duty, Roberto Pi­mentel
escaped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The following day a police
patrol team composed of Police Sgt. Federico <span class="SpellE">Daiton</span>
and Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Melquiades</span> <span class="SpellE">Cañas</span>,
Pablo <span class="SpellE">Lubido</span> and the appellant himself went to a
place called Poultry Area in barrio <span class="SpellE">Cuya</span>, <span class="SpellE">Maramag</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bukidnon</span>, where the
accused had been reported to be hiding, for the purpose of bringing him back to
jail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their efforts to locate and
apprehend Roberto Pimentel having been fruitless, they decided to pass the
night in the house of one <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span> <span class="SpellE">Tirayosa</span>,
intending to return to town the following morning.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="17">five o'clock</st1:time>
in the morning of the next day, <st1:date year="1960" day="6" month="6"><span style="">June </span>6, 1960</st1:date>, Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Daiton</span> went down from the house of <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tirayosa</span> to answer a call of nature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He went to a nearby bridge and squatted
thereon to defecate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While he was in
that position, he saw a person approaching slowly and he ordered him to
halt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter, instead of doing so,
jumped down into the creek spanned by the bridge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He yelled for his companions, saying that the
person who jumped into the creek could be their quarry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Cañas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lubido</span> and the appellant rushed out of the house of <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span> <span class="SpellE">Tirayosa</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cañas</span> and appellant going to the place at the creek where
the person had jumped down.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Daiton</span> stationed himself near
the bridge and Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Lubido</span> went to the other
side of the creek.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant and <span class="SpellE">Cañas</span> followed the course of the creek and after covering a
dis­tance of 100 meters they came across footprints which they examined
separate­ly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While they were doing so,
Roberto Pimentel emerged suddenly from the bushes and lunged at the appellant,
hitting him with a stone at the right cheek and causing him to fall to the
ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When appellant <span class="SpellE">Valcorza</span> was on the ground, Roberto Pimentel again struck
him with a stone on the right arm.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Fearing that Pimentel might grab his service revolver, appellant <span class="SpellE">Valcorza</span> summoned Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Cañas</span>
who dashed to­wards the place but Pimentel ran away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant <span class="SpellE">Valcorza</span>
regained his composure and immediately chased the deceased, fir­ing a shot into
the air and ordering him to stop.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the
deceased did not heed his order, appellant fired four times into the air, at
the same time pursuing the prisoner for a distance of about 100 meters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that point, fearing that the patrol team
might fall in apprehending the deceased, appellant <span class="SpellE">Valcorza</span>
fired a fifth shot at Pimentel as the latter was in an act of again jumping
down into another part of the creek and when the distance between the two was
only three meters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Cañas</span> could not be of much help in the chase because his
revolver got entangled with some vines and he dropped it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After recovering his re­volver he joined <span class="SpellE">Valcorza</span> but Pimentel had already jumped down into the
water of the creek.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The members of the patrol team went down into the water to
locate Pimentel and they <span style="">saw </span>him
floating, with a wound on his back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
Pimentel was still alive, he was placed in the police jeep and taken to the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span> of <span class="SpellE">Maramag</span> for
treatment, but he died a few minutes after arrival in the municipal building.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The physician who examined the cadaver of the victim gave the
opinion that the missile from the gun fired against the victim entered at the
right side of the back but the slug was lodged inside the body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The gray discoloration at the edge or rim of
the wound of entry showed the presence of powder burns which, in the opinion of
the physician, indicates that the gun was fired at close range.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Elias <span class="SpellE">Valcorza</span> surrendered himself
and his firearm to the Chief of Police upon arrival in the municipal building
of <span class="SpellE">Mara­mag</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Appellant seeks to justify his firing the shot against the
deceased by stating that he tried to hit him only at the leg, after he had
disregarded his several warning shots and orders to stop running away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He claims that he did so at the spur of the
moment probably because he feared that his patrol team might not succeed in
apprehending the deceased and bringing him back to jail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, he also claims that he only
fired at the deceased when the latter was in the act of jumping down into the
creek which had water of 8 feet deep, and if the deceased succeeding in
crossing the creek the patrol team might not be able to apprehend him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In brief the appel­lant conveys idea that he
had to fire at the deceased in order that he may not continue es­caping.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The above version of the appellant was given in open court
when he testified on <st1:date year="1962" day="4" month="10">Octo­ber 4, 1962</st1:date>
(<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>. -- pp. 9, 76).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However his claim that he aimed only at the
leg of the deceased is not consistent with what he said in his sworn statement,
Exhibit A. 'Question and Answer No. <span style="">7' </span>(p.
1, Criminal Case Record), given to the Constabulary soldiers on the after­noon
of the day of the incident, or at 3:15 p.m. of June 6, 1960.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In narrating how the deceased was shot,
appellant <span class="SpellE">Valcorza</span> stated in part as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="text-indent: 0in;">'But said Roberto Pimentel tried his very
best to make another escape then he ran away 'cause I was fell down on the
ground during the time I wrestled him, Roberto Pimentel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then I still follow him and fire my revolver
four (4) times up in the sky to stop him but still <span style="">he </span>continue running, so what I did I fired him one direct hit
shot on his back then he tried dive escape into the water, and because he could
not do anything 'cause he was already suffering from a gunshot wound we pick
him up and bring him to our headquarters in the Office of the Chief of Police
of <span class="SpellE">Maramag</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bukidnon</span>, for
the necessary treatment of the gunshot wound on his right side back....'</p>

<blockquote>"What the appellant said on June 6, 1960 in his statement,
Exhibit A, which he subscribed and sworn to before <span style="">the Justice </span>of the <span style="">Peace
</span>of <span class="SpellE">Maramag</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bukidnon</span>,
on June 7, 1960, is an un­adulterated narration of what happened on the day of
the incident more than two years before he took the witness stand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This first narration is more reliable because
it was made when there was yet no time for reflection so as to make his story
fit into the facts of the incident.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After the lapse of two years during which he could de­liberate and <span class="SpellE">analyse</span> the occurrence and prepare his defense, his
testimony in court no longer jibed with what he said shortly after the
event.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This inconsistency affects his
credibility and wrecks his theory that he had no intention to kill the deceased
but only meant to disable him from further escaping.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It also seriously impairs his defense as it
shows that there was no reasonable necessity for appellant to shoot the
deceased at the time when he was running away with no weapon in his hands which
he could use for aggression against the appellant in case he desired to turn
back and face the latter." (pp. 3-7, Annex "A", Petitioners
brief.).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There is no question, therefore, that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>on June 4, 1960, the deceased Roberto Pimentel
was a detention pri­soner confined in the municipal jail of <span class="SpellE">Maramag</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Bukidnon</span>, from which he escaped at about one <span style="">o</span>'clock p.m. that day when petitioner
was on guard duty; the following day four members of the police force of the
municipality, petitioner included, went after him to a place called Poultry
Area in barrio <span class="SpellE">Cuya</span>, their first efforts to locate
him there being unsuccessful; early the following morning, while Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Daiton</span>, who led the patrol, was squatting on a bridge to
answer a call of nature, he saw a man approaching slowly and he ordered him to
stop; the latter, who happened to be the escaped de­tainee, instead of doing
so, jumped into the creek spanned by the bridge, whereupon Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Daiton</span> summoned his three companions who all rushed out of
the house where they had spent the night, and went after the escaping prisoner;
petitioner and policeman <span class="SpellE">Cañas</span>, while following the
course of the creek and examining certain footprints they had found, saw their
quarry suddenly emerging from nearby bushes; the latter lunged at petitioner
hitting him with a stone on the right cheek, as a consequence of which he fell
down, and while in that position on the ground he was struck again with a stone
by the escaping detainee; thereafter the latter ran away pursued by petitioner
and his companion; in the course of the pursuit the former fired a warning shot
into the air, and as the escaping detainee paid no heed to this, petitioner
fired into the air four times more and kept on pursuing him; as the latter was
apparently widening the distance between them, and fearing that he might
finally be able to elude arrest, petitioner fired directly at him while he was
in the act of jumping again into another part of the creek, the shot having hit
him on the back; as a result of the wound thus inflicted upon him, Pimentel
died a few minutes after arrival at the municipal building to which he was
taken.</p>

<p class="BODY">While We have not lost sight of the fact that the deceased
Pimentel was charged with a relatively minor offense, namely, stealing a
chicken; and while We do not in any way wish to encourage law enforcing
officers to be trigger-happy nor to employ force and violence upon persons
under their custody, We can not, in the consideration of this case, disregard
the following facts:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the said deceased,
in violation of the law, had escaped from detention; when ordered to stop by
Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Daiton</span> - whom he must have recognized as a peace
officer in his pursuit - he ran away and then threw himself into a creek to
elude his pursuer; after sometime he suddenly emerged from bushes near which
petitioner and a fellow policeman were and as­saulted the former twice with a
stone and then ran away again pursued by petitioner and his companion; that peti­tioner
does not appear to be a trigger-happy policeman <span style="">as shown by the fact that he had fired five cautionary shots into the
air and decided to aim directly at the </span>escaping detainee only when he
had already reasons to fear that the latter would be able to elude him and his
companions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These facts and circumstances
<span style="">constrain <span class="GramE">Us</span>
to hold that the </span>act thus performed by petitioner - <span style="">and which unfortunately resulted in the death
of the </span>escaping detainee - was committed in the performance of his
official duty and was <span style="">more or less
necessary </span>to prevent the escaping prisoner from successfully eluding the
officers of the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To hold him guilty
of homicide may have <span style="">the effect of </span>demoralizing
police officers discharging official functions identical or similar to those <span style="">in the </span>performance of which petitioner
was engaged at the time he fired at the deceased Pimentel, with the result that
thereafter <span class="GramE">We</span> would have half-hearted and dispirited <span style="">efforts on their part to comply with such
official duty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>This, of course,
would be to the great detriment of public interest.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>CONSEQUENTLY</b>, in the spirit of our decision in People vs. <span class="SpellE">Delima</span>, 46 Phil. 738, the decision appealed from is hereby
reversed and, as <span style="">a consequence, </span>petitioner
is <span style="">acquitted, with costs de <span class="SpellE">oficio</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
