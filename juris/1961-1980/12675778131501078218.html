				<BR><BR><div align=""><div class="Section1"><b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"></span></b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><o:p></o:p></span>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Eusebio</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> <span class="SpellE">Daplas</span> 
filed before the Public Service Commission an application for a certificate of 
public convenience to operate a bus service for the transportation of passengers 
and freight on the line comprising <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span> Subdivision 
in <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> City to <span class="SpellE">Divisoria</span> <span class="GramE">( Manila</span>) and vice-versa 
employing 20 buses for that purpose. To the application <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> F. <span class="SpellE">Halili</span> filed an 
opposition alleging, among others, that the service he is rendering on the line 
covered by the application is more than sufficient to meet the demands of the 
traveling public.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Both parties presented 
testimonial as well as documentary evidence, and after carefully considering the 
same, the Public Service Commission decided to authorize the applicant to 
operate at least 12 of the 20 units applied for believing it to be sufficient to 
serve the needs of the traveling public along the line covered by the 
application subject to certain conditions therein specified. The <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span> interposed the present 
appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The evidence submitted by the 
applicant tends to show that in <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span> Subdivision 
there are many people living most of whom are employees working in the City of 
Manila and students attending classes in the different colleges and universities 
established in Manila; that these employees and students leave in the morning 
and come back at noon and in the afternoon; that along the way from <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span> Subdivision to <span class="SpellE">Divisoria</span> 
there are many passengers bringing their agricultural products to <span class="SpellE">Divisoria</span> and some to <span class="SpellE">Blumentritt</span> 
who later return along the same line with whatever purchases they had made; that 
the buses or trucks of the <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span> make irregular 
trips most of which are already full to capacity upon passing <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span> Subdivision, so that the residents in the area are 
having difficulty in securing means of transportation; and that this difficulty 
is also being experienced by the passengers waiting along the way from <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span> Subdivision to Manila.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On the other hand, the evidence 
of the <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span> tends to show that his service along 
the <span class="SpellE">Ipo-Divisoria</span> line is sufficient to take care of 
the passengers traveling on said line, and that he has buses entering <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span> Subdivision to serve the people residing therein who 
were relatively few. He submitted the reports of the checkers who were posted in 
two different checking points to observe the flow of the passengers along the 
line applied for which point out that there is no public necessity for the 
additional bus service desired by the applicant. On this point, applicant also 
presented as rebuttal evidence the report made by another inspector on the 
checking he underwent at barrio <span class="SpellE">Baesa</span> wherein it is 
shown that <span class="SpellE">oppositor's</span> buses, whether coming or going 
to Manila, were loaded to capacity with instances of 
overloading.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We note that the applicant has 
submitted quite <span class="GramE">a substantial</span> evidence in support of 
his application. Thus, the testimonial evidence consisted in the testimonies of 
applicant himself, of Benjamin Salazar, a resident of <span class="SpellE">Novaliches</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, <span class="SpellE">Leopoldo</span> Garcia, another resident of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, and Corona B. Venal, a <span class="SpellE">practising</span> lawyer and a resident of <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span> Subdivision. In addition, applicant also submitted 
documentary evidence consisting of a petition submitted by the people affected 
in the line applied for and the reports of two checkers prepared by duly 
authorized agents of the Public Service Commission. Of course, <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span> likewise presented testimonial and documentary 
evidence to show that there was no public necessity for the approval of the 
instant application, among which we notice two employees of <span class="SpellE">Halili</span> Transit which is by <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span>, like Antonio Santiago, as inspector, and Alfredo 
<span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz, its operation manager. He also submitted 
the reports of two checkers who made a similar observation regarding the flow of 
passengers on the line applied for.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The Public Service Commission, 
after weighing carefully the evidence of both petitioner and <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span>, reached the conclusion that there is still room 
for an increase in the bus service that was then in operation on the line 
applied for, for which reason it authorized the applicant to operate at least 12 
of the 20 units applied for. In reaching this conclusion, the Commission made 
the following comment:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">“* * * Even the testimony of 
Inspector Antonio Santiago of <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span>, reveals that 
<span class="SpellE">oppositor</span> is operating only three buses making only 
nine round trips during the day which is clearly inadequate for the residents of 
<span class="SpellE">Amparo</span> Subdivision. And even Isabel <span class="SpellE">Dikit</span>, another witness for <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span>, testified that buses of the <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span> coming from the direction of <span class="SpellE">Ipo</span>, upon passing the <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span> 
Subdivision Gate, have already seating capacity resulting in the difficulty of 
residents of the Subdivision who have to wait at the Gate to secure 
accommodation in said buses. This clearly corroborate the testimonies of the 
witnesses of applicant to the effect that people residing in the <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span> Subdivision arc having difficulty in riding in the 
buses of <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span> passing in the national read in 
front of <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span> Subdivision. There being evidence that 
applicant is a Filipino citizen and financially qualified to maintain and 
operate the proposed service, the opposition filed herein is hereby overruled, * 
* *.”<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It appearing that the Commission 
has found enough substantial evidence to support its conclusion that then is 
further room for authorizing the operation of additional bus service on the line 
applied for, which evidence is not only testimonial but documentary, we have no 
other alternative than to affirm the same since we are not authorized to 
substitute our conclusion for that of the commission. The rule is that the 
Commission's findings of fact, if supported by substantial evidence, are 
conclusive upon this Court. We are only authorized to modify or ignore them when 
it clearly appears that there is no evidence to support <i>reasonably</i> such 
<span class="GramE">conclusion<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style11"><sup>[</sup></span></span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style11"><sup>1]</sup></span>. More specifically, this Court said: "Whether 
public necessity and convenience warrant the putting up of additional service on 
the part of the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, is a question of fact which 
the Public Service Commission has found in the affirmative. This finding, being 
supported by sufficient evidence, should not be disturbed" (<span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> Transportation Company <i>vs</i>. <span class="SpellE">Cervo</span>, 91 Phil. 313).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">With regard to the claim that the 
service proposed by applicant, far from promoting public interest, would only 
result in ruinous competition with the established transportation service of 
<span class="SpellE">oppositor</span>, suffice it to quote what we said in a 
similar case:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"* * * In order 
that the opposition based on ruinous competition may prosper, it must be shown 
that the opponent 'would be deprived of fair profits on the capital invested in 
its business.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
The mere possibility of reduction in the earnings of a business is not 
sufficient to prove ruinous competition. It must be shown that the business 
would not have sufficient gains to pay a fair rate of interest on its capital 
investment.' (Manila Electric Co. vs. <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> 
Transportation Co., 66 Phil. 36, <span class="GramE">6 L.J. 1117</span>). Mere 
allegations by the <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span> that its business would 
be ruined by the establishment of the ice plants proposed by the applicants 'are 
not sufficient to warrant this court to revoke the order of the Public Service 
Commission.' (<span class="SpellE">Teodora</span> Santos <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Pilares</span> vs. Consuelo <span class="SpellE">Arranz</span>, G. R. No. 45462, July 28, 1938." <span class="GramE">(Ice &amp; Cold Storage Industries of the Philippines Inc. 
<i>vs</i>. Valero, 85 Phil., 7).</span><o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; text-transform: uppercase; font-family: Verdana;">Wherefore</span></b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the decision appealed from is 
affirmed. No costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
