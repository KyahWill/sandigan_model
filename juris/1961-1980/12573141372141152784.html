				<H3>JULIANA ZAPATA, APPLICANT AND APPELLEE, VS. DIRECTOR OF LANDS, OPPONENT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PADILLA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>It appears that Juliana Zapata owns two parcels of land situated in
the municipality of Santo Tomas, province of Pampanga, adjoining a
non-navigable and non-floatable river called the Candalaga Creek. The
two parcels are designated as Lot No. 25 and the northern part of Lot
No. 16 of the Cadastral Survey of San Fernando, Pampanga.<span class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> The
first lot contains a superficial area of 6,592 square meters and is
registered in her name, as shown by transfer certificate of title No.
12907 issued by the Registrar of Deeds in and for the province of
Pampanga (Exhibit A). Her ownership or title to a part of Lot No. 16
was confirmed by a decree entered on 21 November 1955 by the Court of
First Instance of Pampanga ordering that the "remaining portion of Lot
No. 16 with an area of 474 square meters" be registered "in the name of
Juliana Zapata" (Exhibit A-1); Cad. case No. 1, G.L.R.O. Cad. Record
No. 137).</p>
<p>In 1915, when the cadastral survey of San Fernando was begun, the
width of the Candalaga Creek adjoining the two parcels of land owned by
Juliana Zapata was about 90 or 100 meters. At present, the width is 15
meters, because soil had been accumulated by the water current of the
river on the banks of Lot No. 25 and of that part of Lot No. 16 owned
by Juliana Zapata. The accreted land is delimited in plan Psu-140515
and designated as Lots 1, 2 and 3, the first containing an area of
6,260 square meters, the second, 449 and the third, 2,238 (Exhibit B)
and described in the technical descriptions (Exhibit C). </p>
<p>In a verified petition filed on 16 June 1956 in the Court of First
Instance of Pampanga, Juliana Zapata claims that the aforesaid three
lots belong to her by accretion, as provided for in article 457 of the
Civil Code, and prays that the same be registered in her name under the
Land Registration Act (Land Reg. Case No. N-273, L.R.C. rec. No. 1167).
On 19 October 1956 on her motion the court entered an order of general
default against all persons except the Director of Lands. On 24 October
1956 the Director of Lands objected to the petition and prayed that the
registration of the three lots in the name of Juliana Zapata be denied
and that they be declared to form part of the public domain.</p>
<p>After trial, on 26 December 1956 the court rendered judgment, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>WHEREFORE, the Court, overrulling the opposition of
the Director of Lands; and confirming the order of general default
herein entered, and the applicant's title to the aforesaid Lots Nos. 1,
2 and 3, referred to plan Psu-140515, aforecited, hereby orders that
the same be registered in the name of Juliana Zapata, the herein
applicant * * *. Once this decision becomes final, let the
corresponding decree issue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Court of Appeals certified to this Court the appeal taken by the
Director of Lands because only questions of law are involved.</p>
<p>The appellant contends that article 457 of the Civil Code providing thatâ€”</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>To the owners of lands adjoining the banks of river
belong the accretion which they gradually receive from the effects of
the current of the waters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> cannot apply and does not support the appellee's claim that the
accretion or deposit of alluvial soil, which is delimited in plan
Psu-140515 and designated as Lots 1, 2 and 3, belongs to her as
riparian owner, because such accretion "was not due to the natural
effect of the current but was artificially induced on account of the
erection of the fish traps on the creek." The contention cannot be
sustained. The appellant does not dispute that the accreted land
delimited in plan Psu-140515 and designated as Lots 1, 2 and 3
adjoining Lot No. 25 and that part of Lot No. 16, both owned by the
appellee, had been formed gradually due to the effect of the water
current of the Candalaga Creek, but claims that the accretion was
artificially brought about by the setting up of fish traps, such as <em>salag</em> net, <em>bunuan</em> (bamboo trap),<em> sabat</em>
(cutting of channels) and fencing that the fishermen had built in the
stream. True, those fish traps might have slowed down the current of
the Candalaga Creek and might have brought about or caused the
accretion, but as there is no evidence to show that the setting up or
erection of the fish traps was expressly intended or designed to cause
or bring about the accretion, the appellee may still invoke the benefit
of the provisions of article 457 of the Civil Code to support her claim
of title thereto. Moreover, the fishermen who since 1894 used to set up
fish traps in the creek (p. 7, t.s.n.), later on secured permit from
the Government that auctioned off the right or license to set up fish
traps in the creek (p. 6, t.s.n.), and the setting up of such fish
traps stopped or was discontinued even before 1926 (p. 7, t.s.n.), all
go to show that the alluvial accretion was not entirely due to the
setting up of such fish traps.</p>
<p>The decree appealed from is affirmed, without pronouncement as to costs.</p>
<p><em>Bengzon, C. J., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Paredes, Dizon, Regala</em> and <em>Makalintal, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
