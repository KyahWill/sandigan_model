<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="26" month="5">May 26, 1964</st1:date>,
Lourdes <span class="SpellE">Arcuino</span>, <span class="SpellE">Eleuteria</span>
Laude, <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Patombon</span>,
and <span class="SpellE">Angelita</span> <span class="SpellE">Patombon</span> -
hereinafter referred to as plaintiffs - commenced the present action in said
court, for the "recovery of possession, damages and legal
redemption." In their complaint, filed by Attorneys Bruno A. <span class="SpellE">Villamor</span> and Vicente Rodriguez, plaintiffs alleged that
they are co-owners <u>pro</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>indiviso</u></span> of
shares aggregating about 13/24<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
of a residential land of about 332 square meters, known as Lot No. 355 of the
Cadastral Survey of <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> City, which lot is covered
by original Certificate of Title No. 13672 of the Province of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>; that in 1946, defendant spouses, <span class="SpellE">Casiano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Puray</span> and <span class="SpellE">Rufina</span> <span class="SpellE">Aparis</span> - hereinafter referred to as the <span class="SpellE">Purays</span>
- took possession of said lot, "thereby unlawfully and illegally excluding
the plaintiffs from their lawful possession of their respective shires,"
which the <span class="SpellE">Purays</span> refused to return to the plaintiffs,
despite repeated demands by them made "for several years;" that on
April 29, 1964, plaintiffs learned that some of the co-owners had sold their
respective shares in said lot to the <span class="SpellE">Purays</span>, in view
of which they (plaintiffs) offered, shortly thereafter, to redeem said shares,
but the <span class="SpellE">Purays</span> rejected the offer; and that,
consequently, plain­tiffs suffered damages.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Plaintiffs prayed, therefore, that judgment be rendered ordering the <span class="SpellE">Purays</span> to deliver to them (plaintiffs) their respective
shares and sentencing the <span class="SpellE">Purays</span> to permit them
(plaintiffs) to redeem the shares sold to them (<span class="SpellE">Purays</span>),
as well as to pay damages, in addition to attorney's fees and costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">In their answer to the complaint, the <span class="SpellE">Purays</span>
denied the alleged share of the plaintiffs in said Lot No. 355, and averred
that the same belongs to them (the <span class="SpellE">Purays</span>), having
acquired it in good faith, for value, in 1946, from <span class="SpellE">Marciano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Melgar</span> and <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span> <span class="SpellE">Melgar</span>, his (<span class="SpellE">Marciano’s</span>) daughter
by his deceased wife, <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span> Laude, pursuant to a deed
of conveyance, copy of which is appended to said answer, as Annex 1 thereof;
that <span class="SpellE">Marciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Melgar</span> and <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span> Laude had, in turn, purchased it on May 16, 1938,
from the registered owners of said lot, as attested to by a deed of absolute
sale attached to the answer, as Annex 2 thereof, executed by <span class="SpellE">Gaudioso</span> <span class="SpellE">Arcuino</span> and Teresa and <span class="SpellE">Diosdado</span> <span class="SpellE">Pa­tombon</span>; that
plaintiffs' right of action, if any, is barred by the statute of limitation;
and that plaintiffs are guilty of <span class="SpellE">laches</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Purays</span>,
likewise, set up a counterclaim for damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the filing of plaintiffs' answer to the counterclaim, the
lower court ordered the case set for pre-trial on <st1:date year="1964" day="17" month="6">June 17, 1964</st1:date>; but neither the plaintiffs nor their
counsel appeared on that date.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereupon, on motion of <span class="SpellE">Purays</span>' counsel, said
court issued an order dismissing the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">It would seem that, immediately thereafter, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Villamor</span> informed the Court that Atty. Rodriguez, who, he (<span class="SpellE">Villamor</span>) intimated, was handling the case for the
plaintiffs, could not be present because he was then in Mindanao.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Villamor</span>
asked that the pre-trial be postponed, but the Court did not grant such
request.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Villa­mor</span> filed a motion for reconsideration, alleging
that, while he was in the courthouse, in <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> City,
on June 10, 1964, as counsel for one of the parties in Civil Case No. 633-0 of
said court, notice of the pre-trial in the case at bar was served upon him;
that he placed said notice inside his en­velope of the aforementioned Case No.
633-0; that, after the hearing thereof, he went to his office, and, after
placing the aforementioned envelope inside a drawer, he returned home; that, it
being late in the afternoon, he forgot to advise Atty. Rodriguez of said
pre-trial; that Atty. Rodriguez left <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> City the
next day and proceeded to <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span> City via <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City, leaving on his office calendar a note to the
effect that the pre-trial in the present case would be held on June 19, 1964;
that Atty. Rodriguez was evidently under the honest belief that the date set
for the pre-trial was June 19, not June 17, 1964; that when Atty. <span class="SpellE">Villamor</span> heard, on June 17, 1964, that the pre-trial would
then be held, he remem­bered that notice thereof had been served upon him while
he was attending the hearing of said case No. 633-0; that, there­upon, he
examined his envelope of that case and found there­in said notice; and that the
failure of Atty. Rodriguez to ap­pear at the pre-trial was due, therefore, to
excusable mistake.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon denial of this motion for reconsideration, plain­tiffs
interposed the present appeal, directly to the Supreme Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not disputed that, owing to the failure of plaintiffs and
their counsel to appear at the pre-trial of this case, notice of which had been
duly served upon the parties, the lower court had the authority to dismiss the
case.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
It is, likewise, settled that the determination of whether or not an order of
dismissal issued under such conditions should be maintained or reconsidered,
rests upon the sound discretion of His Honor, the Trial Judge.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
The issue, in this appeal, hinges on whether or not such discretion has been so
abused as to warrant a reversal of said order.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon a review of the records, we are fully satisfied that the
answer must be in the negative, for:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">1)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The explanation given in plaintiffs' motion
for reconsideration is far from satisfactory.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Atty. <span class="SpellE">Villamor</span> would have us believe that he had
been unable to transmit to Atty. Rodriguez the notice of pre-trial served upon
the former.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet there was, on the office
calendar of Atty. Rodriguez, a note - seemingly written by him - to the effect
that said pre-trial would take place on <st1:date year="1964" day="19" month="6">June
 19, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Atty. Rodriguez
knew, therefore, that there would be such pre-trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the notice thereof must have
reached him, although his associate, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Villamor</span>,
believes that he (Rodriguez) must have committed an honest mistake regarding
the date of the pre-trial.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">2)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both lawyers were counsel for plaintiffs
herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the absence of his associate,
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Villamor</span> could have and should have appeared,
therefore, on behalf of the plaintiffs, at the pre-trial.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">3)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The very complaint of plaintiffs herein shows
that the <span class="SpellE">Purays</span> had been in adverse possession of Lot
No. 355 continuously since 1946, and that plaintiffs were aware of such
fact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the present action was filed
on <st1:date year="1964" day="26" month="5">May 26, 1964</st1:date>, plaintiffs
had been, therefore, in such possession, adversely for about eighteen (18)
years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the <span class="SpellE">Purays</span>
had acquired the land from <span class="SpellE">Marciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Melgar</span> and his daughter <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span> <span class="SpellE">Melgar</span>, as heir to the interest therein of her deceased
mother, <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span> Laude, who, together with Mariano <span class="SpellE">Melgar</span>, had bought it, on <st1:date year="1938" day="16" month="5">May 16, 1938</st1:date>, from <span class="SpellE">Gaudioso</span> <span class="SpellE">Arcuino</span> and Teresa and <span class="SpellE">Diosdado</span> <span class="SpellE">Patombon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence,
together with the possession of their predecessors in interest, the <span class="SpellE">Purays</span> had altogether 26 years of adverse possession in
their favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true that lands
registered under the <st1:place>Torrens</st1:place> system may not be acquired
by prescription; but, plaintiffs herein are not the registered owners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They merely claim to have re­quired, by
succession, their alleged title or interest in Lot No. 355.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, plaintiffs herein are guilty <span class="SpellE">oflaches</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In fact, the order complained of, denying the motion for
reconsideration above referred to, was predicated, mainly, upon the futility of
<span class="GramE">reinstating</span> the case owing to the insurmountable
obstacles facing plaintiffs herein.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order appealed from is hereby affirmed,
with costs against the plaintiffs.</p>
