<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This is a special civil action 
for certiorari and prohibition with preliminary injunction filed before Us by 
the Commissioner of Immigration to review and set aside the preliminary 
injunction issued on September 18, 1962 by the respondent Judge of the Court of 
First Instance of Manila in Civil Case No. 51626, as well as the latter’s order 
dated March 30, 1964, refusing to dissolve said injunction. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The facts are as follows: 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On January 9, 1961 <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> King Fong<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1"><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;">[1]</span></sup></span> and her minor <span class="SpellE">chil</span> <span class="SpellE">dren</span> Co Belo, Co E. <span class="SpellE">Khon</span> and Co Shan <span class="SpellE">Shan</span> (hereinafter 
also referred to as respondents visitors) applied for and were granted a 
passport visa to the Philippines at the Philippine Consulate General in <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span>, for the purpose of visiting <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> King <span class="SpellE">Pong's</span> husband and the 
children's father, respondent Co Chin, a Chinese resident in the Philippines. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In connection with the said 
application, Co Chin posted with the Bureau of Immigration a bond of P28,000.00 
undertaking that his wife and children will depart from the 
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> on or before the date specified, 
and will continue to maintain the status under which they are admitted and will 
not violate any limitation or condition of their admission. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Said wife and children of Co Chin 
arrived here as such temporary visitors on </span><st1:date month="1" day="17" year="1961"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">January 17, 
1961</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> for 
an authorized stay of three (3) months, or up to </span><st1:date month="4" day="17" year="1961"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">April 
17, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
, while Co Chin's application for naturalization was pending. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date month="2" day="3" year="1961"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">February 3, 
1961</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> the 
Commissioner of Immigration was informed, by letter from the Office of the 
President, that His Excellency had authorized the extension of respondents 
visitors' stay for another three (3) months from the expiry date of 
</span><st1:date month="4" day="17" year="1961"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">April 17, 
1961</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> or 
up to </span><st1:date month="7" day="17" year="1961"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">July 17, 
1961</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> . 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date month="6" day="24" year="1961"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 
24, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
respondent Co Chin's petition for naturalization was granted by the Court of 
First Instance of Manila, and the judgment was not appealed. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On July 3, 1961 respondents 
visitors filed with the Commissioner of Immigration a request for another 
extension of stay for three (3) months from July 17, 1961, or up to October 17, 
1961, on the ground that they desired to stay with Co Chin and other relatives 
and friends whom they had not seen for several years, and to visit the different 
tourist attractions in this country. This request was likewise granted. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On August 17, 1961 respondents 
visitors wrote the Secretary of Justice, through the Secretary of Foreign 
Affairs, requesting for the extension of their temporary stay for two (2) years 
from June 24, 1961 pursuant to the Cabinet Resolution of February 29, 1956, 
revealing for the first time that respondent Co Chin's petition for 
naturalization was granted by the Court of First Instance of Manila on June 24, 
1961, and there was no appeal. Acting on this request the Secretary of Foreign 
Affairs in his 1st <span class="SpellE">Indorsement</span>, dated August 17, 1961, 
approved respondents visitors' change in category from temporary visitors to 
special non-immigrants under Section 47(a)(2) of the Philippine Immigration Act 
of 1940, as amended, and extended their temporary stay for a period the expiry 
date of which was June 24, 1963, "it appearing that the petition for 
naturalization as Philippine citizen of their husband/father, Co Chin, has been 
granted by the Court of First Instance of Manila in its decision dated June 24, 
1961, which has not been appealed." <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On August 24, 1961 the Secretary 
of Justice in his 2nd <span class="SpellE">Indorsement</span> approved the 
extension up to June 24, 1963 in favor of respondents visitors, stating that 
they “.... will become citizens by operation of law, if otherwise qualified, 
when the decision of the court becomes <span class="SpellE">executory</span> 
'after two years from its promulgation’, pursuant to Republic Act No. 530," but 
subject to the condition that they shall secure reentry permits to <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> valid at least two months over and beyond their 
extended stay and that they shall maintain their cash bonds filed with the 
Bureau of Immigration and pay the corresponding fees. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date month="8" day="28" year="1961"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">August 
28, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
the Secretary of Foreign Affairs in his 3rd <span class="SpellE">Indorsement</span> referred the matter to the Commissioner of 
Immigration who, however, extended respondents visitors' stay only up to 
</span><st1:date month="10" day="17" year="1962"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">October 17, 
1962</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> . 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date month="10" day="2" year="1961"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">October 
2, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
respondents visitors wrote the Commissioner of Immigration, requesting that they 
be granted an extension of stay up to </span><st1:date month="6" day="24" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 24, 
1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> per 
approval of the Secretaries of Foreign Affairs and of Justice, but no action had 
been taken thereon by the latter. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">After the 1961 national elections 
there was a change of administration. The new Secretaries of Foreign Affairs and 
of Justice maintained that the power to extend the stay of aliens was vested by 
law in the Commissioner of Immigration, not in them. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date month="8" day="29" year="1962"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">August 
29, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
the Commissioner of Immigration, with the approval of the new Secretary of 
Justice, issued Immigration Circular No. V-101 which abrogated all extensions of 
stay of temporary visitors who arrived in the 
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> in 1961 and prior years. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date month="8" day="31" year="1962"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">August 
31, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
the Commissioner of Immigration sent a letter to respondent Co Chin, enclosing a 
copy of the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> circular, and requiring 
respondents visitors to leave the country on </span><st1:date month="9" day="18" year="1962"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">September 18, 
1962</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> . 
This was not complied with. Instead, on September 17, 1962 respondent Co Chin, 
in behalf of his wife and children (respondents visitors), filed a petition for 
prohibition with preliminary injunction with the Court of First Instance of 
Manila docketed as Civil Case No. 51626 and assigned to Branch VI under 
respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Gaudencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cloribel</span>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On September 18, 1962 the 
respondent Judge issued an order requiring the Commissioner of Immigration 
(respondent below) to file an answer to the petition within ten (10) days from 
notice and, pending the consideration of the petition, granting the issuance of 
a writ of preliminary injunction upon the filing of a bond of P4,000.00, 
enjoining therein respondent (petitioner here) to desist from arresting and/or 
requiring <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> King Pong, Co Belo, Co E. <span class="SpellE">Khon</span> and Co Shan <span class="SpellE">Shan</span> to leave the 
country and from confiscating the cash bond posted in their behalf until further 
orders. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On October 16, 1962 the 
Commissioner of Immigration filed his answer to the petition below, alleging 
that petitioners therein are not entitled to stay beyond the authorized period 
which had already been terminated in accordance with law; that, consequently, 
they are liable to arrest, confiscation of their bond, and subsequent 
deportation in accordance with Section 37(a) of the Immigration Act of 1940, as 
amended; that the Secretaries of Foreign Affairs and of Justice are not 
authorized to admit into the Philippines aliens for temporary stay, or extend 
the period authorized by the Commissioner of Immigration; and that the petition 
does not state a cause of action. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date month="1" day="7" year="1964"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">January 
7, 1964</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
the respondent below filed a motion to dissolve the writ of preliminary 
injunction, on the ground that assuming the validity of the extension granted by 
the former Secretaries of Foreign Affairs and of Justice, the authorized period 
of stay, up to </span><st1:date month="6" day="24" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 24, 
1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> , 
had already expired. To this motion petitioners below filed on </span><st1:date month="1" day="22" year="1964"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">January 22, 
1964</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> an 
opposition. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date month="3" day="30" year="1964"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">March 
30, 1964</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
respondent Judge denied the motion to dissolve the writ of preliminary 
injunction, stating only that it was "not well-taken." <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Thus, the filing of this action 
herein on </span><st1:date month="7" day="25" year="1964"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">July 25, 
1964</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> . 
Respondents visitors were required to answer, but We issued no preliminary 
injunction. Subsequently, the parties submitted the case for decision upon the 
filing of memoranda in lieu of oral argument. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petitioner herein contends that 
the respondent Judge acted in excess of jurisdiction and with grave abuse of 
discretion in issuing the writ of preliminary injunction and in refusing to 
dissolve the same. On their part, respondents traverse the Commissioner's 
contention and insist that appeal is an adequate remedy for the Commissioner; 
that the latter should have filed a motion for reconsideration to enable the 
respondent Judge to reexamine the legal aspect of the case, and that the case 
below has not become moot and academic. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This Court in Vivo v. Area, et 
al.,<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1"><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;">[2]</span></sup></span> also a petition for 
certiorari involving facts alike in all respects to those in the instant case, 
thru Mr. Justice J. B.L. Reyes, held: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"It is argued for these visitors 
that the <span class="SpellE">indorsements</span> of the Secretaries of Justice 
and Foreign Affairs ... effected a change in their status from temporary 
visitors to special non-immigrants, entitled to residence until the 
naturalization case of the husband .... is finally decided. We find this 
proposition untenable, because both <span class="SpellE">indorsements</span> 
clearly specify that they were only granted ‘a period of stay up to 
</span><st1:date month="6" day="9" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 9, 
1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> ,' a 
fixed date that can not imply an indefinite .stay. It is to be presumed that 
both Secretaries knew that the final acquisition of Filipino citizenship by the 
husband Lim <span class="SpellE">Chiao</span> <span class="SpellE">Cun</span> cannot 
be set, under the existing law, at any definite date after a Judgment declaring 
him qualified for naturalization, since later on he may be found unfit to take 
the oath of allegiance; and that a definite terminus for the stay of his wife 
and children is incompatible with an intent to let them stay until the end of 
the naturalization proceedings. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Another circumstance indicating 
that the terminal date, June 9, 1963 was wholly unconnected with Lim <span class="SpellE">Chiao</span> <span class="SpellE">Cun's</span> naturalization case is 
the requirement of the Secretary of Justice that the visiting wife and children 
'shall secure reentry permits to <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> valid at 
least two months over and beyond their extended stay’ for this condition 
connotes the idea that the , visitors must leave within 2 months from the expiry 
date of the extension, without regard to the result of the naturalization case. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Finally, an extension of an 
alien's period of stay being a matter of grace, and not of right, should be 
strictly interpreted. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"As it is not disputed that 
further staying here of these visitors has not been authorized, the refusal of 
the court to dissolve its preliminary injunction after June 9, 1963, as prayed 
for by the petitioning Commissioner, insofar as the stay of these visitors are 
concerned, was against the law, and, therefore, in abuse of discretion and 
excess of jurisdiction." <o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In the case under consideration, 
the <span class="SpellE">indorsements</span> of the Secretaries of Foreign Affairs 
and of Justice likewise specified a definite period of stay up to 
</span><st1:date month="6" day="24" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 24, 
1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> , 
which has long expired. Respondents visitors were also required by the Secretary 
of Justice to secure reentry permits to <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> valid 
at least two months over and beyond their extended stay. Similarly, the 
respondent Judge refused after </span><st1:date month="6" day="24" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 24, 
1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> , to 
dissolve the preliminary injunction he ordered issued, that is, even after the 
terminus of the longest extension of respondents visitors' stay in the 
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> . <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is to be noted that the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> case was promulgated by the Supreme Court on 
</span><st1:date month="12" day="27" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 27, 
1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> , 
whereas the order of the respondent Judge denying the Commissioner's motion to 
lift the injunction was issued on </span><st1:date month="3" day="30" year="1964"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">March 30, 
1964</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> . It 
is surprising why the respondent Judge took no heed of said precedent-setting 
decision, handed down three months before he issued his questioned order. 
Neither should Ignorance be his reason, for Judges are supposed to keep track of 
current jurisprudence in order that they be guided accordingly. Thus it is 
unfortunate that the grant of the writ below was precipitate. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The Cabinet Resolution of 
February 29, 1956 upon which the Secretaries of Foreign Affairs and of Justice 
based their action of changing the status of respondents visitors from temporary 
visitors to special non-immigrants, and of prolonging their stay up to June 24, 
1963 - and which apparently guided the actions of respondent Judge below - does 
not find support in law. As enunciated by this Court thru Mr. Justice J.G. 
Barrera in Lim <span class="SpellE">Chiok</span>, et al. v. Vivo, L-20513, 
December 26, 1963: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">“[T]he administration and 
enforcement of our immigration laws lie with the Bureau of Immigration. The 
so-called Cabinet Resolution of </span><st1:date month="2" day="29" year="1956"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">February 29, 
1956</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> did 
not specifically authorize the Secretaries of Foreign Affairs and of Justice to 
extend the stay of temporary visitors. It could not legally do so because under 
the express provisions of the Immigration Law, it is the Commissioner of 
Immigration who is vested with the power and authority to grant such extensions. 
And, the Cabinet has no power to amend or modify the law. We so declared in 
<span class="SpellE">Ang</span> <span class="SpellE">Liong</span> vs. Commissioner 
of Immigration (51 O.G. 2893) when we said: 'The Secretary of Foreign Affairs is 
not authorized to admit into the Philippines aliens for temporary stay, or 
extend the period authorized by the Commissioner of Immigration for their stay 
in the Philippines.’ <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Neither can the two Secretaries 
authorize the change of status from temporary visitors to special 
non-immigrants. The law and our decisions on the matter are clear on this point: 
temporary visitors can not have their status changed to special non-immigrants 
without first departing from the country." <o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is, however, contended that 
respondents visitors claim the right to stay in the Philippines not only by 
reason of the date extended but of the approval of the petition for 
naturalization of respondent Co Chin by which, allegedly, they (wife and 
children) shall acquire the right to become Filipino citizens by operation of 
law when the decision in the naturalization case becomes <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, unless disqualified to become Filipino citizens 
under the naturalization law. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The record does not show whether 
or not Co Chin has already taken his oath of citizenship. Assuming even <span class="SpellE">arguendo</span> that he is now a naturalized Filipino, still the 
decisions are in unison that: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

citizen does not automatically make her a Philippine citizen entitled to enjoy 
all the rights and privileges of citizenship. She must, as a pre-requisite, 
establish satisfactorily in appropriate proceedings, that she has all the 
qualifications and none of the disqualifications required by law. The privilege 
of citizenship is granted only to those found worthy of it and not 
indiscriminately to anybody at all solely on the ground of marriage to a man who 
is or has already become a citizen of the Philippines, irrespective of moral 
character, ideological beliefs and identification with Filipino ideals, customs 
and traditions."<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1"><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;">[3]</span></sup></span> 
<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">As to foreign-born minor 
children, they are extended citizenship "if dwelling in the 
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> at the time of the 
naturalization of the parent." "Dwelling" means lawful residence. Since prior to 
the time the father of respondents visitors was supposed to have taken his oath 
of citizenship (June 24, 1963) their lawful period of stay had already expired 
and they had already been required to leave, they were no longer lawfully 
residing here (<span class="SpellE">Kua</span> <span class="SpellE">Suy</span>, et 
al. v. The Commissioner of Immigration, L-13790, </span><st1:date month="10" day="31" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">October 31, 
1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> ). 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Respondent Co Chin's argument 
that he will not be able to comply with his obligation to send his children of 
school age to Philippine public schools or private schools where Philippine 
history, government and civics are taught, during the probationary period, if 
the latter would be sent back to <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span>, is not in 
point. This is a requirement which he must comply with "during the entire period 
of the residence in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> required of him prior to the 
hearing of his petition for naturalization as Philippine citizen." (See. 2, 
.Com. Act No. 473) <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">At any rate, respondents visitors 
are duty bound to comply with the last paragraph of Section 9 of the Philippine 
Immigration Act of 1940, which provides that: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"An alien who is admitted as a 
non-immigrant, cannot remain in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> permanently. To obtain permanent 
admission, a nonimmigrant alien must depart voluntarily to some foreign country 
and procure from the appropriate Philippine Consul the proper visa and 
thereafter undergo examination by the officers of the Bureau of Immigration at a 
Philippine port of entry for determination of his admissibility in accordance 
with the requirements of this Act." <o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">For as this Court, again thru Mr. 
Justice J.B.L. Reyes, has observed in <span class="SpellE">Chiong</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiao</span> Bing v. Commissioner of Immigration, 52 O.G. 6551, 
6552-6553: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> 
<span class="SpellE">x</span> It is clear that if an alien gains admission to the 
Islands on the strength of a deliberate and voluntary representation that he 
will enter only for a limited time, and thereby secures the benefit of a 
temporary visa, the law will not allow him subsequently to go back on his 
representation and stay permanently, without first departing from the 
Philippines as he had promised, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>. Any other ruling would as stated in our previous 
decision, encourage aliens to enter the Islands on false pretenses; every alien, 
so permitted to enter for a limited time, might then claim a right to permanent 
admission, however flimsy such claim should be, and thereby compel our 
government to spend time, money and effort in examining and verifying whether or 
not every such alien really has a right to take up permanent residence here. In 
the meanwhile, the alien would be able to prolong his stay and evade his return 
to the port whence he came, contrary to what he promised to do when he entered. 
The dangers inherent in such a ruling are self-evident." 
<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Contrary to respondents’ stand, 
appeal is not the adequate remedy here. The respondent court seems to be 
dragging its feet in the disposition of this case. Although Civil Case No. 51626 
was instituted on September 17, 1962 and issues were joined by the filing of the 
answer on September 27, 1962, and although as a suit for prohibition it was 
entitled to preferential attention, no action was taken on the case until after 
petitioner (respondent below) filed his motion to dissolve the writ of 
preliminary injunction on January 7, 1964. And although the longest extension 
(assuming that it was valid) had already expired on </span><st1:date month="6" day="24" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 
24, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
, still the respondent court refused to dissolve the writ of preliminary 
injunction. In these circumstances the Commissioner of Immigration is not 
required to wait for the rendition of final judgment and take; an appeal from a 
patently illegal order of denial. Appeal, unlike a writ of certiorari, cannot 
promptly relieve the aggrieved party from the injurious effect of the order 
(Silvestre vs. Torres, 57 Phil. 885). And even if the error is subsequently 
corrected on appeal, such aliens are meanwhile able to unduly prolong their 
illegal stay in violation of our country's immigration laws and policies (<span class="SpellE">Kua</span> <span class="SpellE">Suy</span>, et al. vs. The 
Commissioner of Immigration, supra.). <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">A motion for reconsideration 
likewise would not have availed the Commissioner. The respondent court took 
almost three months to resolve the motion for dissolution of the writ of 
preliminary injunction. This was despite the fact that even the petitioners 
below themselves admitted that the longest extension of their stay was only up 
to </span><st1:date month="6" day="24" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 24 
1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> , 
and this fact was brought to respondent Judge's attention. Any further delay 
would have prejudiced the interest of the Government because of the undue 
continuation of respondents visitors' unauthorized stay. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Furthermore, the Solicitor 
General is correct in observing that the suit below is already moot and 
academic. It is premised on the extension granted by the Secretaries of Foreign 
Affairs and of Justice for therein petitioners' stay up to June 24, 1963, which 
has already expired. And, as observed, the acquisition of Philippine citizenship 
by respondent Co Chin will not improve the position of his wife and children who 
have already stayed here illegally and too long.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1"><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;">[4]</span></sup></span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">From the facts and circumstances 
of record, this Court is convinced that even before the respondents aliens left 
<span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> for the 
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> they had a well-planned move to 
stay here permanently contrary to what they stated in their application before 
the Philippine Consulate in <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span>, which the lower 
court failed to detect. Thus, soon after their arrival, representations were 
made to the Office of the President culminating in a letter sent by said office, 
dated February 3, 1961, to the Commissioner of Immigration informing the latter 
that the President had already authorized the extension of their stay for 
another period of three months so that instead of their stay expiring on April 
17, 1961 as originally provided for in their visas they could stay up to July 
17, 1961. Fourteen (14) days before the expiration of the period extended, again 
another petition for extension of three months was filed with the Commissioner 
of Immigration which, having been granted, brought their permitted stay up to 
</span><st1:date month="10" day="17" year="1961"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">October 17, 
1961</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> . 
Two months before the date of expiration or on </span><st1:date month="8" day="17" year="1961"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">August 
17, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
respondents aliens again wrote the Secretary of Justice through the Secretary of 
Foreign Affairs requesting an extraordinary period of extension of two years 
from </span><st1:date month="6" day="24" year="1961"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 24, 
1961</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> . 
When the Commissioner of Immigration in the exercise of his discretion pursuant 
to law did not extend the period as desired, they resorted to this case. And 
unluckily for the Government respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Gaudencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cloribel</span> took cognizance 
of the same and immediately issued a preliminary injunction, and what is worse, 
later on, despite clear provisions of the law and the Jurisprudence, stubbornly 
persisted without cause in refusing to dissolve the injunction even after the 
expiration of the extended period of stay as granted by administrative 
officials, thereby further prolonging the aliens' stay for almost 2-1/2 years up 
to the present time. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The situation here again brings 
to mind the apt observation of the now Chief Justice Roberto <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, speaking for this Court in The Chief of the 
Philippine Constabulary v. The Judge of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>:<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1"><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;">[5]</span></sup></span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Thus, several parties had, 
through the action and the omissions of the judicial branch of the government, 
succeeded, not only in evading the law, but, also, in preventing the executive 
department from executing and enforcing the same, for over two (2) years. 
Surely, more caution should be exercised to avoid such occurrence, if we hope to 
keep the faith of the people in the courts of justice." 
<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Perceptible, indeed, from the 
drift of several cases that reached this Court is a disquieting possible effect 
of weakening the people's faith in the Judicial Department of our Republic, 
sometimes through acts of inadvertence by some members of our Judiciary. As 
early as 1958, in the case of People v. <span class="SpellE">Santas</span>, 56 
O.G. 3546, this Court stressed the need for trial Judges to take cognizance of 
the settled pronouncements and rulings of the Supreme Court. Speaking through 
Mr. Justice Alfonso Felix, this Court therein said (supra, 3552-3553): 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Now, if a Judge of a lower Court 
feels, in the fulfillment of his mission of deciding cases, that the application 
of a doctrine promulgated by this Superiority Is against his way of reasoning, 
or against his conscience, he may state his opinion on the matter, but rather 
than disposing of the case in accordance with his personal views he must first 
think that it is his duty to apply the law as interpreted by the Highest Court 
of the Land, and that any deviation from a principle laid down by the latter 
would unavoidably cause, as a sequel, unnecessary inconveniences, delays and 
expenses to the litigants. And if despite of what is here said, a Judge, by 
delicate or acute qualms of conscience, still believes that he cannot follow Our 
rulings, then he has no other alternative than to place himself in the position 
that he could properly avoid the duty of having to render Judgment on the case 
concerned (Art. 9, C.C.), and he has only one legal way to do that." 
<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The issuance of preliminary 
injunction, it is true, rests upon the sound discretion of the court or its 
Presiding Judge. Sound judicial discretion, however, is no license to undo the 
law by defeating its objectives. Perhaps only too often, as this Court's records 
will bear out, has respondent Judge herein been stopped by this Court, through 
preliminary injunction or restraining order, from carrying out a preliminary 
injunction or order issued by him at his discretion.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1"><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;">[6]</span></sup></span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We remember that earlier in 
another case, Commissioner of Immigration v. Hon. <span class="SpellE">Gaudencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cloribel</span>, et al., 
L-23838, </span><st1:date month="12" day="28" year="1964"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 28, 
1964</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> , 
respondent Judge's attention was called by this Court, with caution and 
prudence, thus: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Petitioners also state that the 
Presiding Judge of Branch VI has shown bias against them and, in support of 
this, mention previous decisions of said Judge reversed by this Court. We trust, 
however, that respondent Presiding Judge will follow the rulings of this Court, 
not insist upon his own, in the instances where his decisions had been 
reversed.”<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is the impression of this 
Court In this case, that the interests of the Government have been plainly 
disregarded. We moreover express our displeasure and dissatisfaction with the 
actuations of Judge <span class="SpellE">Cloribel</span> which have been unfair to 
the Government and to the people. And if this statement is made it is in the 
spirit and purpose of preserving the faith of the people in the judiciary of 
which every member should, by diligence and study, prove that the people's and 
the Government's interest are taken into consideration and the laws and 
jurisprudence involved are seriously taken into account, something which 
regrettably had been forsaken or at least neglected in this particular case 
below. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">And to forestall any doubt 
thereon, nothing herein shall preclude the Commissioner of Immigration from 
exercising his functions and duties under the law by confiscating the P28,000.00 
bond aforementioned and proceeding accordingly at the appropriate time. Finally, 
may this case also serve to alert and warn Government officials concerned of 
similar plans by prospective alien visitors who may entertain the same wishes as 
those of the respondents visitors herein or what is worse if their purpose is to 
spy in our midst for other nations. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
