<span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte, seeking the reversal of the decision of
the Public Service Commission, herein referred to as PSC, rendered in Cases
Nos. 66497 and 66-4893, dated April 17, 1968, authorizing the <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte Electric Company, Inc. (INELCO for short) to
charge its authorized rates as reduced by 5% effective January 1, 1960 in
accordance with the order of January 1, 1960, plus the voluntary reduction of
3% made by applicant INELCO, effective January 1, 1963, or a total reduction of
8%, aside from reductions in the municipal and street lighting presently
enjoyed by the local governments of <span class="SpellE">Laoag</span> City and
San Nicolas municipality.</p>

<p class="BODY">INELCO has for several years maintained and operated the electric

 1, 1960</st1:date>, the consuming public and the petitioners had been
protesting against <span class="SpellE">INELCO's</span> alleged inefficient
management and inadequate supply of electric power in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Laoag</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
and San Nicolas, <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte specially the low
voltage and constant brown-outs, coupled with the high and exorbitant prices
and rates being charged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of
these protests, and after exchanges of opinions in public hearings held by the
Municipal Council of <span class="SpellE">Laoag</span>, wherein all parties
interested were present, INELCO reduced its rates to the extent of 5% effective
<st1:date year="1960" day="1" month="1">January 1, 1960</st1:date> except
street lightings of petitioners which enjoyed 20% reduction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This reduction was approved by the PSC in an
order dated <st1:date year="1960" day="21" month="1">January 21, 1960</st1:date>
but upon the instance of the Municipal Council of <span class="SpellE">Laoag</span>,
the reduction of 5% was made to retroact since August 1959 as embodied in the
order of the PSC dated <st1:date year="1960" day="23" month="6">June 23, 1960</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>INELCO asked for a reconsideration of this
order so that the 5% reduction <span class="GramE">be</span> made effective only
as of <st1:date year="1960" day="1" month="1">January 1, 1960</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The request for reconsideration was pending
when the PSC, during the hearing held on <st1:date year="1962" day="7" month="12">December 7, 1962</st1:date>, directed the parties to meet and agree
among <span class="GramE">themselves</span> and to submit an amicable settlement
if possible.</p>

the Municipal Council of <span class="SpellE">Laoag</span> filed with the PSC
their Resolution No. 476 wherein after hearing, the opinions and manifestations

adopted, and that a committee was constituted so that these proposed rates <span class="GramE">be</span> accepted by INELCO and submitted for approval by the

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="5" month="6">June 5, 1963</st1:date>,
when the case was called for hearing, the matter as to whether or not an
amicable settlement between the petitioners and the respondent INELCO was arrived
<span class="GramE">at,</span> was raised by the PSC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>INELCO alleged that there was an agreement
entered into by it and the respective Mayors of <span class="SpellE">Laoag</span>
City and San Nicolas, <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte, whereby the rates
charged by the INELCO be reduced to a total of eight (8%) per cent, but the
validity of said agreement was questioned by the petitioners on the ground that
said contract was never approved by their respective Councils.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its order dated <st1:date year="1963" day="5" month="6">June
 5, 1963</st1:date>, the Public Service Commission set the case for
hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the case was heard on
March 17, 1964, the PSC gave the petitioners an opportunity to file, as they
did file, an opposition dated May 25, 1964 alleging specific affirmative
matters in support of their prayer that the rates and charges collected by,
INELCO be reduced to the proposed rates contained in the above mentioned
Resolution No. 476 of the Municipal Council of <span class="SpellE">Laoag</span>
City, and that INELCO be required to render a more efficient and satisfactory
service to consumers in accordance with rules and regulations of the PSC.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="3" month="2">February 3, 1965</st1:date>,
the petitioners filed a Motion for Authority to examine Books of Accounts of
Applicant, INELCO.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such motion was
granted by the PSC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>INELCO then filed a
motion for reconsideration from <span class="SpellE">PSC's</span> order granting
the motion to examine books of accounts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>PSC issued an order dated June 9, 1965 directing that the examination of
books of accounts of INELCO be conducted by a committee of three (3),
consisting of a representative from GAO as chairman, one representative from
INELCO and the other one from the opposition as members, to be designated by
said parties respectively.</p>

the report dated <st1:date year="1966" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1966</st1:date>
of the Audit and Examination Committee.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="17" month="4">April 17, 1968</st1:date>,
the Public Service Commission rendered its decision stating:</p>

<blockquote>"The records and evidence show that applicant has implemented
the 5% reduction of its rates effective January 1, 1960 in accordance with the
order of Commission dated January 1, 1960; that in no alternative to the motion
of <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> that the effective date of the 5%
reduction be made retroactive to August 1, 1959, INELCO voluntarily reduced its
rates by 3% effective January 1, 1963 as agreed upon with the Municipal Mayors of
<span class="SpellE">Laoag</span> and San Nicolas, <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span>
Norte; that to make the reduction retroactive to August 1, 1959, INELCO will
suffer serious dislocation in its finances which may impair the operation of
the electric service and be detrimental to the public interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>INELCO further states that subsequent to the
audit of its accounts, due to the implementation of the minimum wage law which
will entail an additional outlay in salaries of P25,620.00, the increase cost
of fuel which will raise its fuel and oil expense by about P3,000.00 yearly,
and the increasing cost of materials, supplies and various spare parts
necessary to keep the power plants in satisfactory and efficient conditions;
that the company has not been reached by the lines of the National Power
Corporation; that as per audit report, INELCO made a net profit of only
P4,952.88 on an invested capital of P189,423.71; and that the excess in power
losses suffered by the company which theoretically reduced its operating
expenses in the projected improvement in its distribution and transmission
lines to be financed from its increased capitalization and from bank
borrowings."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="30" month="5">May 30, 1968</st1:date>
counsel for the petitioners got a <span class="SpellE">xerox</span> copy of said
decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, on <st1:date year="1968" day="18" month="6">June 18, 1968</st1:date>, petitioners filed motion for
reconsideration with the PSC which was denied on <st1:date year="1970" day="21" month="5">May 21, 1970</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, the petitioners filed a petition for review with this Court on <st1:date year="1970" day="18" month="6">June 18, 1970</st1:date>, making the following
assignments of error:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style=""> </span>RESPONDENT PUBLIC
SERVICE COMMISSION ERRED IN SUSTAINING THE EXORBITANT RATES CHARGED BY
RESPONDENT PUBLIC UTILITY DESPITE THE LATTER'S DEFICIENT, POOR AND
UNSATISFACTORY SERVICE AND IN DISREGARDING THE REDUCED RATES PROPOSED BY
PETITIONERS.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style=""> </span>RESPONDENT PUBLIC
SERVICE COMMISSION ERRED IN HOLDING THAT RESPONDENT INELCO IS RENDERING
EFFICIENT AND SATISFACTORY SERVICE NOTWITHSTANDING FACTS AND PROOFS TO THE
CONTRARY.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The above assignments of error raise purely questions of fact and
call for a review of the evidence considered by the PSC in arriving at its
decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court has consistently
ruled that "where the petition for review disputes merely the sufficiency
of the evidence the findings cannot be disturbed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not for this Court to determine
credibility and preponderance of proof nor to examine the proof <u>de novo</u>
and determine for itself whether or not the preponderance of evidence really
justifies the decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not to
substitute its discretion for that of the PSC on questions of fact." <span class="GramE">(City of <span class="SpellE">Tagbilaran</span> vs. Lim, L-30323,
August 31, 1973, 52 SCRA 381; <span class="SpellE">Ledesma</span> vs. PSC, et.
al., L-26900, February 27, 1970, 31 SCRA 805, 809-810).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the light of the above ruling, this Court
has found no reason to disturb the findings of fact made by PSC.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue of whether or not the respondent PSC erred in sustaining
the exorbitant rates charged by INELCO despite the latter's deficient, poor and
unsatisfactory service and in disregarding the reduced rates proposed by
petitioners, has already been rendered moot and academic by the incidents which
transpired subsequent to the filing of this petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears that during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the present petition for review, the City of <span class="SpellE">Laoag</span>, the Province of <span class="SpellE">llocos</span>
Norte (which includes the Municipality of San Nicolas) and Engineer <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Siazon</span>, essentially the
same parties as in the present petition for review, filed with the PSC on April
1, 1971 under case No. 71-2390 a petition for reduction of the respondent
company's electrical rates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Over <span class="SpellE">INELCO's</span> objection involving the present petition for
review, the PSC gave due course to the petition in PSC case No. 71-2390 for
reduction of rates in accordance with the ruling of the Supreme Court in the
case of <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> Transportation Co. V. <span class="SpellE">Tanay</span> Transit Co., 63 Phil. 1064, that the commission is
not a judicial body and its findings and orders are not <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span>

proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(p. 174, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The proceedings in PSC Case No. 71-2390 included:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) a series of hearings by the commission;
(b) two GAO rate audits:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>one covering
the period January 1 to December 31, 1970, and the other a <span class="SpellE">recomputation</span>
of the audit for the same year on the assumption that the respondent company
would be totally purchasing its power requirement from the National Power
Corporation; and (c) two compromise agreements between the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(p. 174, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</span></p>

and Province of <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte (including San Nicolas)
and INELCO entered into a compromise agreement in accordance with which PSC in
its decision dated December 1, 1971 revised the rates, and directed INELCO to
file an application for approval of commercial and industrial rates within 30
days from receipt thereof since the compromise agreement did not provide for
rate schedules specifically for commercial and industrial users.</p>

<p class="BODY">INELCO moved to reconsider the portion of the decision that
directed it to file an application for approval of commercial and industrial
rates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the course of the
reconsideration, however, the parties submitted their second compromise
agreement which was approved by the Commission <u>en banc</u> in its order of
April 24, 1972 in PSC case No. 71-2390.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This <u>en banc</u> order of April 24, 1972 adjudicated with finality
the petition for rate reduction in PSC case No. 71-2390, superseding the rate
decision of December 1, 1971 in the same case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The schedule of rates subject of the Compromise Agreement entered
into by the parties as approved by the Commission in its order dated <st1:date year="1972" day="24" month="4">April 24, 1972</st1:date> is as follows:</p>

within 10 days from notice, on the order <u>en banc</u> of the Public Service
Commission dated April 24, 1972 unanimously approving a compromise agreement
entered into between the City of <span class="SpellE">Laoag</span> and <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte Electric Co. Inc.; and (b) to require the
parties to STATE within the same period of time, whether this case has been
rendered moot and academic by the aforesaid order of the Public Service
Commission." <span class="GramE">(p.166, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">On August 4, 1972, petitioner's counsel, pursuant to the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> resolution filed a Manifestation and Motion
with this Court whereby he manifested that he was not aware of the compromise
agreement entered into between the City of <span class="SpellE">Laoag</span> and
INELCO; that he did not intervene in any proceeding before the PSC on account
of which said compromise agreement was reached; that he was not in a position
to comment on the compromise agreement, nor in a position to express any
opinion as to whether or not the present case has been rendered moot and
academic by the aforesaid order of the PSC; and that he requested that he be
furnished a copy of the said compromise agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(pp. 169-170, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Public Service Commission, on the other hand, filed its COMMENT

stating:</p>

<blockquote>"(6) <span class="GramE">xxx</span> the rates as finally
approved in the <span class="SpellE">PSC's</span> order of <st1:date year="1972" day="24" month="4">April 24, 1972</st1:date> <u>are actually lower than the

in the present petition for review</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The petitioners themselves by their own act of proposing the approval of
these rates in their last compromise agreement with the respondent, INELCO had
in effect acknowledged that these rates so approved by the Commission are just
and reasonable.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Respondent INELCO, in its manifestation dated <st1:date year="1972" day="20" month="9">September 20, 1972</st1:date> filed with this
Court, manifested that it concurred with the observations and conclusions set
forth in the comment submitted by PSC, and that it adopted the said comment as
its own." (<span class="GramE">p</span>, 190, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">After a careful review of the records of this case, there is no
showing that petitioners herein were able to give comment as to the order <u>en
banc</u> of the PSC dated <st1:date year="1972" day="24" month="4">April 24,
 1972</st1:date>, unanimously approving a compromise agreement entered into by <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Laoag</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
and INELCO.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners, however,
neither deny nor question the said compromise agreement which fixed the new
electric rates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such inaction of the
petitioner constitutes an implicit acceptance that they are bound by it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where the petitioners have not raised any
complaint or question against the terms set forth in the compromise agreement,
they should be deemed to be satisfied with, and that they find no legal or
equitable objection to the said agreement.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Compromise Agreement answers the issues presented in this
petition for review.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It provides for the
electric rates which should .be deemed reasonable because otherwise,
petitioners would not have entered into said agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The nature of the compromise agreement is
such that, "it supersedes all agreements and proceedings that had
previously taken place and constitutes a final and definite settlement of the
controversies by and between the parties.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">xxx</span> The purpose of a compromise agreement is
precisely to replace and terminate <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>
claims." <span class="GramE">(Article 2028, Civil Code).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case of Socorro vs. Ortiz (L-23608, December 24, 1964, 12
SCRA 641), this Court had the occasion to rule that petition for <i>certiorari</i>
may be dismissed in view of the compromise agreement entered into by the
parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in the case at bar, the <u>en
banc</u> order of the PSC in case no. 71-2390 approving the compromise
agreement entered into by essentially the same parties as in the present
petition for review, validly rendered moot and academic this petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even in the absence of the aforementioned incident, the present
petition shall, nevertheless, have to be dismissed on the ground that it was
filed out of time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records show that
the decision in question was served upon the petitioners through counsel by
registered mail on <st1:date year="1968" day="25" month="4">April 25, 1968</st1:date>,
duly addressed to the said counsel's address of record - <st1:place><st1:placename>Jai-Alai</st1:placename>

  Avenue</st1:street>, <st1:city>Manila</st1:city></st1:address>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The registered mail matter aforementioned was
returned to the PSC unclaimed because, as per the manifestation of said counsel
in the course of the oral examination held before the PSC <u>en banc</u> on
November 28, 1968, he had moved to another office address - Suite 12-B, G. E. <span class="SpellE">Antonino</span> Building, T. M. <span class="SpellE">Kalaw</span>
Street, <span class="SpellE">Ermita</span>, Manila, without filing with the PSC a
timely notice of change of address.</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 30, 1968, however, the said counsel for the petitioners,
per his own admission given in the course of the oral arguments before the PSC <u>en
banc</u>, actually obtained a copy of the decision from the secretary of the
PSC, and on the basis of the said copy, he was able to prepare the motion for
reconsideration which was filed on June 18, 1968.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case of De <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes vs. <span class="SpellE">Ugarte</span>, (L-82, December 1, 1945, 75 Phil. 505), this Court
held that" x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
Requirement as to notice of judgment was however, substantially complied with
when petitioner acquired knowledge of the writ of execution conÂ­taining a
literal copy of the judgment, so much so that he filed later a motion to quash
and a motion for relief." By analogy, having this case in mind, the copy
of the decision obtained by the petitioners' counsel serves as a substantial
compliance with the requirement of notice of the judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 34 of the Public Service Act (CA No. 146, as amended)
provides that a motion for reconsideration of any order, ruling or decision of
he Public Service Commission must be filed not later than fifteen (15) days
after the date of notice of such order, ruling or decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And Section 36 thereof also provides that any
order, ruling or decision of the said Commission may be appealed by way of a
petition for review filed with the Supreme Court within a period of thirty (30)
days from notification of such order, ruling or decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, when on June 18, 1968 the petitioners filed
with the PSC their motion for reconsideration of its decision, a full nineteen
(19) days had elapsed since May 30, 1968 when they received notice
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said motion for
reconsideration was, therefore, clearly filed out of time, and the PSC should
have denied the said motion on that ground.</p>

<p class="BODY">The aforementioned motion for reconsideration having been filed
out of the 15-day <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period, and no appeal
by way of a petition for review pursuant to Section 36 of the Public Service
Act having been filed with this Court within thirty (30) days from May 30,
1968, the decision now appealed from already had became final on June 29,
1968.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It became final by operation of
law since the perfection of appeal within the period prescribed by law is
jurisdictional.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Reyes
