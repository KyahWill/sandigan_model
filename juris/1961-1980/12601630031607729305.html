				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Called to trial for grave oral defamation by the Municipal Court [now City Court] <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
of Cebu City, petitioner was found guilty thereof and sentenced to 4
months and 1 day of arresto mayor, to indemnify Delfin Mercader in the
sum of P5,000.00, with the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment, and
to pay the costs. On appeal, the Court of Appeals <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> voted to modify the judgment by elevating the corporal penalty to one ranging from 4 months and 1 day of <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor</span>, as minimum, to 1 year and 8 months of <span style="font-style: italic;">prisión correccional</span>, as maximum, also with costs.
<p>The case is now before us on review by certiorari.</p>
<p>The facts are not disputed. They are:</p>
<p>In December, 1958, the Democratic Labor Association declared a
strike against the Cebu Stevedoring Company. Delfin Mercader, union
president, was offered by Richard Corominas &amp; Co., a copra exporter
affected by the strike, P10,000.00 as aid to the union and presumably
to pave the way for the amicable settlement of the labor dispute.
Petitioner was with Mercader when that offer was made. The disposition
of this sum and the pleasure of the union in the premises were referred
to the union officers and members, including the strikers. At a meeting
called for the purpose, it was decided that the amount be accepted and
spread amongst all the members. <span style="font-style: italic;">However</span>, at a subsequent meeting
attended by Mercader and petitioner, the latter proposed that the
amount thus offered be given solely to the officers of the union,
leaving out the members thereof. Petitioner's proposal met with
vigorous opposition. Passions seemed to have run so high that
petitioner walked out of the meeting, threatened to destroy the union
and to expose president Mercader. Petitioner then pursued a smear
campaign against Mercader. Petitioner's activities caught the attention
of the union board of directors. A general meeting was called also in
December, 1958. It was then that a resolution was unanimously adopted
expelling petitioner from the union.</p>
<p>Came May 21, 1959. Petitioner met at the Cebu City waterfront
members of the Marine Officers Guild, namely, Marine Officer Quintin
Canlas, Captain Ramirez, First Mates Filemon Go and Alipio Paderanga,
Nahum Rada, a certain Banaag, Second Mate Pablito Dael, Fourth Engineer
Vivencio Casal, Carlos Cantanas, and Third Mate Divino de la Cruz. The
group was on its way to the guild's office. Petitioner then engaged
Canlas in conversation whilst the latter's companions gathered around
and within hearing distance of the two. Petitioner then uttered the
following words in the Cebu Visayan dialect, which, translated into
English, means: "Mr. Mercader sold the Union … the money of the Union
was swindled in the strike staged by the Democratic Labor Association
against the Cebu Stevedoring Company. Atty. Mercader received bribe
money in the sum of P10,000.00 from the copra exporter Richard
Corominas &amp; Co. and another P6,000.00 from the Cebu Stevedoring
Company ... Atty. Mercader is engaged in racketeering and that he is
enriching himself with the capitalists. The money of the Union was
spent by him to his own personal benefit".</p>
<p>At the time of the incident just related, Delfin Mercader was legal
counsel of the Marine Officers Guild. The quoted imputation apparently
affected the guild's feeling and attitude towards Atty. Mercader. For,
subsequently, he was eased out as the guild's legal counsel.</p>
<p>Offshoot is the criminal complaint for grave oral defamation lodged
by Mercader with the City Fiscal's Office. In pursuance thereof, the
City Fiscal's Office filed in the City Court a formal criminal
complaint. This complaint - the recital of the factual averments
omitted - winds up with the following:</p>
<blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>THIS IS TO CERTIFY that I have conducted a
preliminary investigation of the above-entitled case, [and there,]
having taken the testimonies of the witnesses under oath, and there is
ground to believe that the crime of grave oral defamation has been
committed and that the herein accused is probably guilty thereof.</p>
  <p>City of Cebu, Philippines, August 28, 1859.</p>
</blockquote>

<p align="right">(Sgd.) CIPRIANO VILLORDON<br>Asst. Fiscal, Cebu City"</p>
<p>1. Petitioner challenges the Cebu City court's jurisdiction to hear
the case. His reasoning runs thus: The defamation imputes upon Mercader
the crime of estafa; estafa can only be prosecuted <span style="font-style: italic;">de oficio</span>; therefore, the criminal prosecution may only be started upon an information lodged in court by the fiscal.</p>
<p>Now, to the law. Criminal actions, the general rule states, must be commenced either by complaint or information. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>
But petitioner thrusts upon us the view that his case is to be taken
out of the operation of this precept. He props up his argument with a
citation of the last paragraph of Article 360, Revised Penal Code, viz:
"No criminal action for defamation which consists in the imputation of
a crime which cannot be prosecuted <span style="font-style: italic;">de oficio</span> shall be brought except at the instance of and upon complaint expressly filed by the offended party." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></p>
<p>Read as it should be, the plain import of the statute just
reproduced is that where defamation imputes a crime which cannot be
prosecuted <span style="font-style: italic;">de oficio</span>, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> the general rule must give way; the criminal action must have to be brought <span style="font-style: italic;">solely</span>
"at the instance of and upon complaint expressly filed by the offended
party". The converse proposition, however, cannot be true. Reasonable
construction will not permit a deduction which would constrict criminal
prosecution - of defamation which <span style="font-style: italic;">can</span> be prosecuted <span style="font-style: italic;">de</span><u> </u><span style="font-style: italic;">oficio
</span>-by means of information. We do not propose to undertake the
impermissible task of writing into the statute an alien concept: that
which would exclude criminal action started by complaint. Nor should we
attribute to the law an occult content.</p>
<p>As unavailing to petitioner is his reliance on the Cebu City Charter
which provides that the city prosecuting attorney "shall also have
charge of the prosecution of all crimes, misdemeanors, and violations
of city ordinances, in the Court of First Instance of Cebu and the
Municipal Court of the city, and shall discharge all the duties in
respect to criminal prosecutions enjoined by law upon provincial
fiscals." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Because, this
citation is incomplete. Petitioner only quotes the second part of the
first paragraph of Section 37 of the Cebu City Charter. He omits the
first part of the second paragraph thereof which reads: "The fiscal of
the city shall cause to be investigated all charges of crimes,
misdemeanors and violations of ordinances, and have the necessary
informations or <span style="font-style: italic;">complaints</span> prepared or made against the person accused."</p>
<p>Taken in context, an unembroidered version of the Cebu City Charter
on this point simply is this: A criminal charge is first to be lodged
with the fiscal who shall investigate the same; if warranted, he shall
have the necessary information or <span style="font-style: italic;">complaint</span> prepared or made against the accused; thereafter, he shall have charge of the prosecution of the crime in court.</p>
<p>Here, the complaint was first lodged with the fiscal. He conducted a
preliminary investigation. He found probable cause. He attested to the
complaint verified by the complainant. He recommended bail. He caused
the complaint to be filed in the city court. In short, he adopted the
complaint as his own. These actuations of the fiscal in the case under
review pass the statutory requirement. And, in a literal sense.
Because, with the verified complaint, he instituted the criminal
proceeding.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></p>
<p>Persuasive is the pronouncement of this Court in a 1918 case. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>
There, the complaint for libel was signed by the offended party but was
presented in court by the prosecuting attorney. This court was called
upon to construe Section 14 of Act 277 (the Libel Law) which contains
the mandate that all criminal actions for the crime of libel "shall be <span style="font-style: italic;">begun</span>
and prosecuted under the sole direction and control of the ordinary
prosecuting officers, anything in the existing laws to the contrary
notwithstanding." The language we there employed is: The prosecuting
officers "may begin such action by the <span style="font-style: italic;">presentation of either a complaint or information</span>";
and, "if the complaint or information is presented by the ordinary
prosecuting officers, even though the complaint is signed by a private
person, we are of the opinion that the 'criminal action for libel' is
'begun' in conformity with the requirements of section 14 (Act No.
277)". The evident purpose of the law, this Court there said, "is that
no person shall be annoyed with a prosecution for libel without the
consent and intervention of the ordinary prosecuting officers". We do
not intend to retreat from this wise pronouncement. For, it should be
as valid in oral defamation as it is in libel.</p>
<p>The criminal proceeding herein was properly commenced. The trial court acquired jurisdiction.</p>
<p>2. Petitioner's next line of defense is that the city court of Cebu
has no jurisdiction over the crime of serious oral defamation. Again,
he falls back on the Cebu City Charter. Section 40 thereof gives the
city court authority to try criminal cases where the maximum punishment
is by imprisonment for not more than 6 months or a fine of not more
than P200.00 or both. Grave oral defamation is penalized with arresto
mayor in its maximum period to <span style="font-style: italic;">prisión correccional</span> in its minimum period. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>
Converted into time, this means a prison term from 4 months and 1 day
to 2 years and 4 months. Of course, if gauged merely by the charter
limitation, the city court would not have jurisdiction.</p>
<p>But the city charter is not controlling. The criminal complaint here
was not registered until August 29, 1959. On August 1, 1959, Congress
expanded the jurisdictional boundaries of city courts, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>
this time in concurrence with the courts of first instance. By the
applicable statute on August 29, 1959, city courts were already
empowered to hear and determine criminal offenses where the penalty
involved did not exceed six years imprisonment or three thousand pesos
fine or both such imprisonment and fine.</p>
<p>The jurisdictional question is therefore resolved in the affirmative.</p>
<p>3. Petitioner pleads prescription. The complaint, he insists, is merely one for slight oral defamation punishable by <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto menor</span> or a fine not exceeding P200.00. This offense lapses in two months. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>
The incident took place on May 21, 1959; the complaint was filed on
August 29, 1959. Three months and eight days having elapsed, petitioner
submits that the crime is time-barred.</p>
<p>But is there substance to the pose that the oral defamation here is
slight? Article 358, Revised Penal Code, spells out the demarcation
line between serious and slight oral defamations in this wise: "Oral
defamation shall be punished by <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor</span> in its maximum period to <span style="font-style: italic;">prision correccional</span> in its minimum period if it is of a serious and insulting nature; otherwise the penalty shall be <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto men<span style="font-style: italic;">o</span></span><span style="font-style: italic;">r </span>or a fine not exceeding 200 pesos".</p>
<p>A rule which has long since ripened into dogma is that the averments
in the complaint or information characterize the crime to be prosecuted
and the court before which it must be tried. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></p>
<p>To differentiate between grave and light slander, we are to be
guided by a doctrine of ancient respectability that defamatory words
will fall under one or the other, depending upon, as Viada puts it, "x
x x no solo al sentido o significacion gramatical de las palabras
pronunciadas, juzgándolas aisladamente, sino a las circunstancias
especiales del caso, antecedentes y relación que medie entre las
personas del injuriante e injuriado, particulares todos que contribuyen
eficazmente a demostrar la intención del culpable en el momento de
delinquir: x x x" <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></p>
<p>With these lampposts to guide us, we proceed to analyze the factual
recitals in the complaint. The scurrilous words impute to the offended
party the crime of estafa. The language of the indictment strikes deep
into the character of the victim: He "has sold the union"; he "has
swindled the money of the members"; he "received bribe-money in the
amount of P10,000.00 x x x and another P6,000.00"; he "is engaged in
racketeering and enriching himself with the capitalists"; he "has spent
the funds of the union for his own personal use".</p>
<p>No amount of sophistry will take these statements out of the compass
of grave oral defamation. They are serious and insulting. No
circumstances need be shown to upgrade the slander. And, no
circumstances were alleged in the complaint. Of course, petitioner's
disclaimer is that his words were intended "to correct a procedure
which was degrading to the affairs of the union". <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Both of the lower courts rejected his explanation. And, appreciation of testimony is beyond our zone of action.</p>
<p>If more were needed, let us dig deep into the backdrop. Petitioner
wanted the union officers to pocket the sum of P10,000.00 offered to
them by Richard Corominas &amp; Co. He eschewed the idea of spreading
the benefits to all the union members. He was frustrated in his wish.
Then he conducted a smear campaign against the union president. For
these, he was expelled from the union. Long after, came the meeting
with the officers of the Marine Officers Guild. There, in cool and
forceful deliberation, he let go the slanderous statements here charged
- in the absence of Mercader. This time, he had his way, Mercader was
eased out as legal counsel of the Marine Officers Guild. The People has
thus clinched a case for grave oral defamation.</p>
<p>4. On March 24, 1966, after the briefs have been filed and this case
submitted for decision, the offended party, Delfin Mercader, submitted
to this Court an affidavit dated March 22, 1966. He there stated that
the prosecution of petitioner, his former classmate and former
co-worker in the Cebu labor movement, "was brought about by a
misunderstanding in good faith among friends;" that petitioner's
remarks "were provoked" by Quintin Canlas and were uttered "out of heat
and passion engendered by a heated interchange" between the two; that
he and petitioner had "made up and reconciled". He swore therein to the
following: "That in conscience I hereby withdraw, condone, dismiss and
waive any and all claims, civil, criminal or administrative, that I may
have against Amancio Balite due to or by reason of the misunderstanding
which brought about the filing of the said criminal case,"</p>
<p>At this stage of the action, this change of heart erects no shield
against punishment; it will not insulate petitioner from the effects of
his criminal act. And this, notwithstanding the stultified apostasy of
the victim.</p>
<p>Temporizing with crime, courts of justice are not to countenance.
Because, pardon by the offended party - except as provided in Article
344 of the Revised Penal Code - does not extinguish the criminal act. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> And even in the excepted cases, pardon must come before the institution of the criminal proceedings. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></p>
<p>However, express condonation by the offended party has the effect of
waiving civil liability with regard to the interest of the injured
party. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> For, civil
liability arising from an offense is extinguished in the same manner as
other obligations, in accordance with the provisions of the civil law. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Mercader's affidavit necessarily wipes out the civil indemnity of P5,000.00 granted by the lower courts.</p>
<p>5. For a slight correction of the penalty imposed by the Court of
Appeals. The sentence there is for an indeterminate period ranging from
4 months and 1 day of <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor</span>, as minimum, to 1 year and
8 months of prisión correccional, as maximum. The penalty for grave
oral defamation is arresto mayor, maximum, to <span style="font-style: italic;">prisión correccional</span>, minimum. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>
No modifying circumstance is attendant. The minimum of the penalty
under the indeterminate sentence law must be within the range next
lower in degree, that is,<span style="font-style: italic;"> arresto mayor</span> in its minimum and medium periods. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></p>
<p>Conformably to the foregoing, the judgment under review is hereby
modified. Petitioner, guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of
grave oral defamation, is hereby sentenced to serve a prison term
ranging from 4 months of <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor</span>, as minimum, to 1 year and 8 months of <span style="font-style: italic;">prisión</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><span style="font-style: italic;">correccional</span>, as maximum. The civil indemnity of P5,000.00 is deleted from the judgment under review. Costs against petitioner.</p>
