				<H3>SEVERINO SAMSON, PETITIONER VS. HON. GREGORIO D. MONTEJO AND GREGORIO DINGLASA, RESPONDENTS. <BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PAREDES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Before December 13, 1947, respondent Dionisio Dinglasa, was the
registered owner of a parcel of land with an approximate area of seven
(7) hectares, which he acquired under the Homestead Law. Said property
was registered with the Register of Deeds of Basilan City, under
Original Certificate of Title No. 389(0-747). On December 13, 1947,
while Dinglasa was an inmate of San Ramon Prison and Farm in Zamboanga
City, he sold said property to petitioner Severino Samson for P2,000.00
(Exhibit A). On December 22, 1950, within the five (5) year period
provided for the redemption of properties acquired under the Homestead
Act, respondent Dinglasa wanted to repurchase the same, but petitioner
refused to resell. Respondent's lawyer wrote Samson of the desire of
his client (Dinglasa), to exercise his right to repurchase (Exh. B).
For the continued refusal of Samson to permit the repurchase,
respondent Dinglasa instituted on February 3, 1951, before the CFI of
Basilan City an action for Redemption with Damages (Civil Case No. 22
[273-2.C.]). When the case was first heard, counsel for defendant
Samson manifested that he had no defense, but asked the court to order
Dinglasa to reimburse him (defendant), the value of the improvements
introduced on the land. On subsequent hearings, defendant and/or
counsel were not present, whereupon the Judge authorized the Deputy
Clerk of Court to receive evidence of plaintiff. Plaintiff proved that
the land was planted to coconuts and the quarterly harvest was not less
than 4,000 nuts, with an approximate value of P150.00; that from the
date he made known his desire to repurchase the property, defendant
Samson had gathered coconuts which he sold for not less than P3,300.00.
He also claimed P500.00 for attorney's fees. The lower court, on
November 15, 1956, rendered judgment:— 
<blockquote>
  <p>"(1) ordering the defendant herein to execute the
corresponding deed of resale of the property in question, to the
plaintiff immediately after the decision herein has become final,
without the necessity of returning the consideration of P2,000.00 which
was compensated by the income of the property for the period of five
(5) years and eight (8) months enjoyed by the defendant which should
have been enjoyed by the plaintiff if the defendant had complied with
the law; </p>
  <p>(2)  ordering the defendant to reimburse plaintiff the balance  of
            
P1,300.00; and</p>
  <p> (3)  ordering the defendant to pay the attorney's fees in the sum
            
of P500.00 and to pay the costs of this proceedings."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above judgment was brought to this Court on Certiorari (L-13203),  which was dismissed, for lack of merit.
          
A petition for Relief  from  Judgment with Writ of Preliminary   Injunction  was  presented.   The  lower  court
          
granted the  writ,  but later dismissed  the  petition, for
          
having been  filed outside  the reglementary  period.  The
          
Order of dismissal was again  elevated  to this Court  (L– 15326) on appeal,  which  was  also dismissed.</p>
<p>On May 15, 1958, a  writ of  execution was issued.  The
            
record does not show whether the writ was issued before
            
the proceeding was instituted with this  Court.  However,
            
after the appeal in  L-15326 was resolved, respondent Dinglasa,  on April 17, 1961, presented with the CFI  of Basilan
            
City  a Motion to Modify  Writ  of Execution, alleging in
            
the main that  during the  pendency of  all  the  above proceedings, petitioner had been in possession of the property
            
and enjoyed  the fruits thereof.  On  April 27, 1961, respondent Judge, promulgated an Order, to wit— </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Finding  the Motion to Modify Writ  of Execution, dated  April
                  
17, 1961 filed by counsel for the plaintiff in so far as the P3.000.00
                  
and costs are concerned, to be  well  founded and in accordance with
                  
law, as well as with the facts adduced  during  the hearing of this
                  
case on the merits, it is the order of this Court to amend and modify
                  
the  Writ of Execution so as  to  include therein the amount  of
                  
P3,000.00, <em>representing the income of the property in question enjoyed
                  
by the defendant for  a period of five (5) years or from the date
                  
of the decision of this Court to date of writ of execution thereby,
                  
making a total sum of P8,843.20 of  the writ,</em> without any stipulation
                  
of interest,  this not being  mentioned in  the decision of this Court."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alleging that respondent  Judge  in  issuing  the above
              
Order, acted without, or in excess of jurisdiction and with
              
grave  abuse  of  discretion, for which there is  no appeal
              
nor any plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary
              
course of law, the instant petition for Certiorari was presented.   Petitioner anchored his cause of action mainly on
              
the fact  that the judgment,  having become final and for
              
which a writ of execution had been correspondingly issued,
              
the respondent Judge cannot order a modification thereof.
              
It would, therefore, appear that  the only issue which  requires  determination is—whether under the facts of the
              
case, the respondent Judge may lawfully order the modification of the writ execution.</p>
<p> The  circumstance that petitioner remained in possession
                
of the premises and  enjoyed the  fruits thereof, does not<i> ipso facto </i>make him answerable  to respondent Dinglasa
                
for the  value of said  fruits,  after  the  rendition of the
                
decision.  For  one thing,  petitioner may have  valid  defenses to counteract respondents' new claim.  For instance,
                
he might be entitled to  a share in the produce of the land,
                
having been  the one who performed all the work before
                
they could  be harvested; or the land might  not have produced  at all  or might  have had  reduced production and
                
other defenses.  These matters require a proceeding, where
                
the parties could prove  their respective claims.  Moreover,
                
once a decision  becomes final, even the court which rendered  it cannot lawfully alter or modify the same  (Rili,
                
et al. <i>vs. </i>Chunaco,
et al., 98 Phil., 505), especially, considering the fact that, as in
the instant case, the alteration or modification is material and
substantial (Ablaza <i>vs. </i>Sycip, et  al., 110  Phil. 4.  In  the case Behn, Meyer &amp;
                
Co., <i>vs. </i>J.  McMicking,  et  al., 11  Phil. 276, (cited by  respondents) , it was held that "where a final judgment  of an
                
executory character had been rendered in a suit, <i>the
mission of the court is limited to the execution and enforcement of the
said final judgment in all of its parts and in accordance with its
express orders."</i>   The  judgment  in
                  
question is clear, and with the amended writ of execution,
                  
the liability  of petitioner is  greatly augmented, without
                  
the benefit of proper proceeding.</p>
<p>Conformably with all the foregoing, the Order complained
                    
of is  hereby  declared without force and effect.   The  writ
                    
is granted, with costs against  respondent  Dionisio Dinglasa.</p>
