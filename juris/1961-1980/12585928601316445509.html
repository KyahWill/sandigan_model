Court of Appeals by the defendant from the orders of the Court of First Instance 
of Manila (Branch XIII) denying his motion for extension of time within which to 
file his answer to the complaint; refusing to set aside the order of default and 
admit the answer filed before the hearing of the case; and denying the petition 
for relief and to set aside the judgment of default. Inasmuch as only a question 
of law is involved, the appeal was certified to this 
Court.<o:p></o:p></span>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The facts which gave rise to this 
appeal, as found by the Court of Appeals, follow: In the Civil Case No. 37784 of 
the Court of First Instance of Manila, entitled "<span class="SpellE">Gelacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tumambing</span>, plaintiff, v. 
<span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> Rub, <span class="SpellE">Filomeno</span> <span class="SpellE">Niza</span> and Mauro B. <span class="SpellE">Ganzon</span>, 
defendants," summons was served on defendant <span class="SpellE">Ganzon</span> on 
</span><st1:date year="1959" day="30" month="1"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">January 30, 
1959</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. On 
February 12, 1959, <span class="SpellE">Ganzon</span> filed an urgent ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span> motion for an extension of ten days within which to 
file a responsive pleading on the ground that his counsel has just been retained 
and needed a few days more to study the case and prepare such responsive 
pleadings as might be necessary, It should be noted that the original period for 
answering was to expire on February 14, 1959.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date year="1959" day="21" month="2"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">February 
21, 1959</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
the lower court denied the urgent <i>ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span></i> 
motions for extension of time to file responsive pleading filed individually by 
defendants Mauro <span class="SpellE">Ganzon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Filomeno</span> <span class="SpellE">Niza</span> and at the same time 
declared them in default. This order of denial and declaring them in default was 
received by <span class="SpellE">Ganzon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Niza</span> 
on </span><st1:date year="1959" day="25" month="2"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">February 25, 
1959</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> and 
on the same day a verified motion to set aside the order of default was filed 
together with their answers, but said motion was again denied by the trial court 
on </span><st1:date year="1959" day="28" month="2"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">February 28, 
1959</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On March 4, 1959, <span class="SpellE">Ganzon</span> filed a motion for reconsideration of the order of 
February 28, 1959 and for the suspension of the trial scheduled for March 5, 
1959 in order to be able to file a petition for certiorari; yet, on March 5, 
1959 the trial court rendered a decision, based on the findings of a 
commissioner appointed by it, imposing upon the herein appellant a total 
liability of more than P47<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date year="1959" day="17" month="3"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">March 
17, 1959</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
defendant <span class="SpellE">Ganzon</span>, having been notified of the 
decision, filed his verified petition for reconsideration or relief, with the 
corresponding affidavit of merits. A portion of the petition reads: 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"That the herein <span class="SpellE">movant</span> prays for reconsideration of or relief from the 
decision of </span><st1:date year="1959" day="5" month="3"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">March 5, 
1959</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, on 
the ground of accident, mistake or excusable negligence;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"That the undersigned counsel was 
retained by the defendant Mauro B. <span class="SpellE">Ganzon</span> only on 
</span><st1:date year="1959" day="12" month="2"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">February 12, 
1959</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
because he was attending to his cattle ranch in <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span> from January 27 to </span><st1:date year="1959" day="11" month="2"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">February 
11, 1959</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
inclusive. He received news by letter from his daughter about the filing of the 
case on February 10, as he was in the mountains of <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>, and came home immediately thereafter to attend to 
it;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"The undersigned counsel 
instructed the defendant Mauro B. <span class="SpellE">Ganzon</span> to gather 
together all papers relating to the case and he came back with all papers ready 
on the afternoon on </span><st1:date year="1959" day="16" month="2"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">February 16, 
1959</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"That the <span class="SpellE">movant</span> herein and his counsel never intended to delay the 
disposition of this case, otherwise they would have filed dilatory motions, such 
as a motion for particulars or a motion to dismiss;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"That the extensions sought to 
file an answer were dictated by the circumstances above mentioned, the need for 
time for counsel to study the case and the professional engagements of the 
undersigned counsel;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"That the herein <span class="SpellE">movant</span> has good and indubitable defenses, supported by 
documentary evidence, as shown by the attached affidavit of merits of the <span class="SpellE">movant</span> incorporating <span class="SpellE">photostatic</span> 
copies of various documents, including a promissory note of December 2, 1956, of 
the plaintiff himself;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"That this Honorable Court 
imposed excessive damages upon the <span class="SpellE">movant</span>, when, 
taking into account the <span class="SpellE">movant's</span> affidavit of merits, 
the plaintiff should be the one to pay damages to the <span class="SpellE">movant</span> herein;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"That justice and equity, the 
answer having filed already before trial was held and in view of the <span class="SpellE">movant's</span> valid and indubitable defenses, demand that the 
<span class="SpellE">movant</span> be heard in his 
defense."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date year="1959" day="21" month="3"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">March 
21, 1959</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
the trial court issued an order denying <span class="SpellE">Ganzon's</span> 
motion for reconsideration or relief. <span class="GramE">Hence this 
appeal.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is contended that the trial 
court erred in exercising its discretion to deprive the defendant-appellant of 
his day in court and in <span class="SpellE"><em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">motu</span></em></span><em><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> <span class="SpellE">proprio</span></span></em> 
ordering trial before a commissioner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It appears that the motion to set 
aside the default order was filed, without delay, on </span><st1:date year="1959" day="25" month="2"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">February 25, 
1959</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
before trial, and on the same day the said order was received. When a motion to 
set aside the order of default is made without any loss of time and before a 
date is set for the hearing of the case on its merits, and is accompanied by a 
sworn statement of merits and copies of the documents which constitute <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">prima facie </span></em>a just and valid defense, 
the refusal to set aside the order of default constitutes an abuse of 
discretion<span class="GramE">.(</span><span class="SpellE">Bañares</span> <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">v</span></em>. <span class="SpellE">Flordeliza</span>, 51 Phil. 786)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In the leading case of Coombs v. 
</span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Santos</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 24 Phil. 446, where a motion to 
set aside the order of default was denied by the trial court but reversed by 
this Court, it was held: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"A default judgment does not 
pretend to be based upon the merits of the controversy. Its existence is 
justified on the ground that it is the one final expedient to induce the 
defendant to join issue upon the allegations tendered by the plaintiff, and to 
do so without unnecessary delay. A judgment by default may amount to a positive 
and considerable injustice to the defendant; and the possibility of such serious 
consequences necessitates a careful examination of the grounds upon which the 
defendant asks that it be set aside.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"In Watson v. R.R. Co. (41 Cal., 
17, 20), the court said: 'Applications of this character are addressed to the 
discretion - the legal discretion - of the court in which the default has 
occurred, and should be disposed of by it as substantial justice may seem to 
require. Each case must be determined upon its own peculiar facts, for perhaps 
no two cases will be found to present the same circumstances for consideration. 
As a general rule, however, in cases where, as here, the application is made so 
immediately after default entered as that no considerable delay to the plaintiff 
is to be occasioned by permitting a defense on the merits, the court ought to 
incline to relieve. The exercise of the mere discretion of the court ought to 
tend in a reasonable degree, at least, to bring about a judgment on the very 
merits of the case; and when the circumstances are such as to lead the court to 
hesitate upon the motion to open the default, it is better, as a general rule, 
that the doubt should be resolved in favor of the 
application.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"It might be added that if 
plaintiff relies upon his judgment obtained by default and directs the attention 
of the court to no real injury which would result to his interests by the 
reopening of the case, his objection too such action assumes, to say the least, 
the appearance of a technicality, which, in this liberal age, is not looked upon 
with favor. An examination of the <span class="GramE">authorities</span> shows 
that were the application to set aside a default judgment is made immediately 
following its entry, it will receive much greater consideration than were a 
delay of months or even weeks has occurred."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">And in the case 
of <span class="SpellE">Macaraig</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Dy</span> Sun, G. R. 
No.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> L-12497, 
</span><st1:date year="1959" day="23" month="3"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">March 23, 
1959</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, in 
following the ruling of the Coombs case, this Court held: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"The granting of a motion to set 
aside an order of default rests in the discretion of the court, but 'It must be 
remembered that the only discretion conferred upon officers is a legal 
discretion, and when anything is left to any officer to be done according to his 
discretion the law intends it to be done with a sound discretion and according 
to law; and if a given case falls within both the letter and spirit of Section 
113, <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">supra</span></em> (Rule 38, Rules of 
Court) a denial of the relief sought will amount to an abuse of such discretion* 
(Coombs v. Santos, 24 Phil. 446)xx"<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Further, Section 7, Rule 11 of 
the Rules of Court, which gives the court the discretion to allow the filing of 
an answer even after the expiration of time to do so 
provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"<em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Extension of time to 
plead.</span></em></span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> - Upon motion and on such terms 
as may be just the court may extend the time to plead provided in these 
rules.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"The court may also, upon like 
terms, allow an answer or other pleading to be filed after the time fixed by 
these rules."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">and</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> the discretion of the court in 
allowing an extension of time should be exercised to <span class="SpellE">subserve</span> the ends of justice, and its proper exercise tends 
toward giving defendant his day in court. Where a defendant's default appears to 
have resulted from no neglect or fault on his part, the court will exercise its 
discretion in relieving against it. (<span class="SpellE">Unson</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Abera</span>, 14 Phil. 146; <span class="SpellE">Mapua</span> v. 
Mendoza, 45 Phil. 424; <span class="SpellE">Maralit</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Lardizabal</span>, 54 Phil. 252)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Considering that the granting of 
the motion in this case would in no way prejudice the plaintiff (<span class="SpellE">Bañares</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Flordeliza</span>, supra) and 
deprive him of any substantial right, nor is there evidence of intent to unduly 
delay the case (<span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Pestano</span>, G.R. No. L-7623, </span><st1:date year="1955" day="29" month="4"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">April 
29, 1955</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">), and the amount involved being 
P47<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, it is believed that the lower court should 
have set aside its order of default and, in not doing so, it gravely abused its 
discretion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">WHEREFORE,</span></strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> the orders appealed from are

defendant to answer the complaint and present evidence in support of his
