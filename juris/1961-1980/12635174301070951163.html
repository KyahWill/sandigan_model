				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On October 19, 1966 the Commissioner of Customs, acting under the
authority of section 1213 of the Tariff and Customs Code<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">+</span></span></a> and in representation of the Bureau
of Customs (hereinafter referred to as the Bureau), entered into a Management
Contract with the <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Port Terminal, Inc.
(hereinafter referred to as CPTI), whereby the latter corporation was
designated as sole manager of the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> service at
the port of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> for a period of five (5) years
unless sooner terminated in accordance with the contract.</p>

<p class="BODY">Time came when the Bureau, through the <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
Collector of Customs and the Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span>
Supervisor, called the attention of CPTI to its numerous violations of the con­tract,
ranging from failure to provide the necessary pier facilities to avoid
congestion of cargoes to non-submission of the required monthly reports of operations<i>.</i><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Attention was likewise directed to complaints
aired by several <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>-based merchants, decrying the
inefficiency of CPTI in the handling and delivery of imported articles<i>.</i><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Specific demands were formally made by the
Bureau for immediate compliance in order to attain a more satisfactory and
efficient service<i>.</i><span style="">&nbsp; </span>To these
demands, according to petitioners, no answer or explanation was received by the
Bureau.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="10" month="2">February 10, 1967</st1:date>
the Commissioner of Customs formally notified CPTI, by letter addressed to its
president and general manager, that the Bureau was taking over the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operations at the <st1:place><st1:placetype>port</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename></st1:place>
pursuant to paragraph 32 of the Management Contract, which provides:</p>

<blockquote>"32.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is understood
and expressly agreed that violation of any of the terms and conditions of this
Contract shall be sufficient ground for revocation and can­cellation of this
Contract<i>.</i><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Bureau upon
discovery of the violation, shall inform the CONTRACTOR in writing of such
violation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>If within one (1) week
from such notice, the CONTRACTOR shall fail to satisfy the BUREAU that such
violation has not been committed or does not exist, it is expressly agreed that
the BUREAU shall take over the management and operations of the whole <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> service</u>." (under­lining supplied.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the same date the Commissioner also issued Customs
Administrative Order (CAO) No. 1-67, directing the Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span>
Service (created under unnumbered Customs Adminis­trative Order dated June 23,
1966) to take over the manage­ment and operation of the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
service at the port of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1967" day="7" month="3">March
 7, 1967</st1:date> the Commissioner wrote another letter to CPTI, reiterating
the Bureau's cancellation and termina­tion on the management contract effective
as of the date of actual take-over, i.e., <st1:date year="1967" day="13" month="2">February 13, 1967</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In February 1967 CPTI filed a complaint (Civil Case No. 9846)
against herein petitioners in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> (Branch VI), with an "application for temporary
restraining order and/or temporary injunction," alleging, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span> that the management contract had been
terminated by the Commissioner in violation of paragraph 32 thereof; that since
said contract was bilateral the act of the Commissioner in terminating it was
without due pro­cess of law, arbitrary and unlawful; and that the Bureau should
have filed an action for rescission instead.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The <span class="SpellE">reliefs</span> prayed for were preliminary
injunction pending trial, and, after trial, final injunction, damages and
attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 16, 1967 the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> issued ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> a writ of preliminary injunction, "enjoining the
defendants and their representatives and workers from performing the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> services in the piers, wharves and ports of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> and from preventing them to enter said areas in order
to carry oat their <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> functions, upon
plaintiff's filing a bond in the amount of P20,000.00 to answer for whatever
damages defendants may suffer by reason thereof." On February 17, 1967 the
same court suspended the effect of the writ of preliminary injunction issued
the day before by ordering a <u>status</u> <u>quo</u> in the sense that the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> services, which had been taken over by herein
petitioners, were temporarily allowed to remain under the Bureau's super­vision
pending final resolution as to whether to dissolve the writ or to maintain it.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 27, 1967 herein petitioners moved to dismiss the
complaint and "to dissolve or maintain dissolu­tion of the ancillary
writ," alleging among other things that the Court had no jurisdiction to
review the actuation of the Commissioner in taking over the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
service pursuant to Sec. 1213 of the Tariff and Customs Code, for the reason
that such jurisdiction pertained to the Court of Tax Appeals; that respondent
Court had no jurisdiction to enforce a writ of injunction, whether permanent or
temporary, outside its territorial jurisdiction, in accordance with section
44(h) of Republic Act 296 and the decisions of the Supreme Court on the matter;
that as herein petitioners were being sued for damages arising from acts
committed in their official capacities and in the performance of their official
duties, the action was in reality a suit against the State, which had not given
its consent to be sued; and that the complaint states no cause of action
because paragraph 32 of the management contract authorizes the Commissioner to
revoke the contract and/or take over the operation and management of the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> service.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="28" month="2">February 28, 1967</st1:date>,
upon motion of CPTI, respondent Court granted the parties five (5) days within
which to submit their respective memoranda.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1967" day="8" month="3">March 8, 1967</st1:date>,
after ruling that it had jurisdiction to grant the questioned writ, the Court
issued the following order:</p>

<blockquote>"Considering all the foregoing, this Court hereby maintains
the writ of pre­liminary injunction authorized by its order dated February 16,
1967 and enjoins all of the defendants and their represent­atives from
preventing the plaintiff, its representatives, personnel, laborers, and workers
from performing the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> ser­vices in all the
piers, wharves, and ports of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City, and from preventing
them to enter all of the said areas together with all of their equipments,
vehicles, and any other properties in order to carry out their <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> functions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the interest of the public this order of injunction shall be
effective immediately upon service upon the defendant Collector of Customs of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City, <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> A. <span class="SpellE">Agbayani</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners thereupon filed a petition for prohibition and
certiorari, with preliminary injunction, in the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pending final resolution of the issues presented,
said Court issued on March 13, 1967 a writ of preliminary injunction
temporarily restraining respondent Court of First Instance from executing,
enforcing and/or implementing its orders dated February 16 and March 8, 1967.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After hearing, however, the appellate Court
ruled in favor of respondents, dismissed the petition and dissolved the
injunction it had previously issued.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case is now before us on review by certiorari.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On June 5, 1967 we issued a temporary
restraining order directed to the Presiding Judge of the Court of First Ins­tance
of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> (Branch VI) restraining him, his agents,
repre­sentatives and/or any person acting in his behalf from "exe­cuting,
enforcing and/or implementing (his) orders of February 16 and March 9 (should
be the 8th), 1967, and the writ of preliminary injunction issued pursuant
thereto; and from otherwise proceeding in any manner whatsoever with the hear­ings
in Civil Case No. R-9846, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
until further orders from this Court."</p>

<p class="BODY">In assailing the validity of the writ of preliminary injunction
issued by the Court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, petitioners maintain that it has no
jurisdiction over the subject-matter and that such jurisdiction pertains to the
Court of Tax Appeals, pur­suant to Section 7 of Republic Act 1125, which
provides:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jurisdiction.-
The Court of Tax Appeals shall exercise exclusive appellate jurisdiction to
review by appeal, as herein provided –</blockquote>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"(2) Decisions of the Commissioner of Customs in cases
involving liability for customs duties, fees or other money charges; seizure,
detention or release of property affected; fines, forfeitures or other
penalties imposed in relation thereto; or other matters arising under the
Customs Law or other law or part of law administered by the Bureau of Customs;</blockquote>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
“</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners contend that inasmuch as the Commissioner awarded the
<span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> management contract by virtue of his
authority under Section 1213 of the Tariff and Customs Code, said contract is
covered by the phrase "other matters arising under the Customs Law or other
law or part of law adminis­tered by the Bureau of Customs."</p>

<p class="BODY">We see no merit in the contention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case at bar is not one involving
liability for customs duties, fees or other money charges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not involve seizure, detention or release
of property affected, nor fines, forfeitures or other penalties imposed in
relation thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It arose from a
contract of services or, more specifically, from an al­leged violation
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the authority of the Com­missioner
to enter into such contract emanates from the Tariff and Customs Code, the
controversy itself concerns rights and obligations which proceed from the
contract, not from the Commissioner's administration of the customs laws.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The following statement of this Court in a
previous case is apropos:</p>

<blockquote>"Note that the law gives to the Court of Tax Appeals exclusive
appellate jurisdiction to review the decision of the x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> Commissioner of Customs, x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Note also
that in defining the cases that may be reviewed, the law begins by enumerating
them and then adds a general clause per­taining to other matters that may arise
under the x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> Customs law
x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This shows that the 'other matters' that may
come under the general clause should be of the same nature as those that have <span class="SpellE">preceeded</span> them applying the rule of construction known as <span class="SpellE"><u>ejusdem</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>generis</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, in order that a matter may
come under the general clause, it is necessary that it belongs to the same kind
or class therein specifically en­umerated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Otherwise, it should be deemed foreign or extraneous and is not
included." (011ada vs. Court of Tax Appeals, 99 Phil. 604)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners plead non-suability of the State alleging that
because they are sued in their official capacities, any judgment for damages
against them would in effect result in loss of money by the government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Syquia</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Almeda</span> Lopez (47 O.G. 665) is cited, particularly the
following statement of this Court therein:</p>

<blockquote>"Where the judgment (in a suit by a private citizen against
officers of the government) would result not only in the recovery of the
possession of property in favor of said citizen but also in a charge against or
financial liability to the government, then the suit should be regarded as one
against the government itself, and consequently it cannot prosper or be entertained
by courts except with the consent of said government."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is not necessary to consider the issue of State non-suability
here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That issue may be raised at the
proper time in the answer to the complaint, as a defense to the claim for
damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The question before us relates
to the propriety of the writ of preliminary injunction issued by the Court
below, and it is not pretended that acts of government officers, even if
illegal, oppressive, or <span class="SpellE">viola­tive</span> of contracts with
private citizens, are beyond the power of the courts to enjoin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the context of this case, that question,
stated otherwise, is whether or not, on the basis of the pleadings and of the
evidence so far before the said Court, the unilateral termination of the
management contract by the Bureau, followed by its take­over of the operation
of the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> service, was justi­fied.</p>

<p class="BODY">CPTI first contends that a judicial action for rescission of said
contract should have been filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this
connection it should be noted that under paragraph 32 of the management
contract the same may be revoked and can­celled for violation of any of its
terms and conditions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All that is
required before cancellation is (a) that the Bureau inform the contractor
(respondent CPTI) in writing of such violation, and (b) that the contractor
fail within one week to satisfy the Bureau that such violation has not been
committed or does not exist, whereupon the Bureau may take over the management
and operation of the whole <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Resort to judicial action for rescission is
obviously not contemplated under the circumstances just mentioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The validity of the stipulation cannot be
seriously disputed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is in the nature
of a facultative <span class="SpellE">resolutory</span> condition, which in many
cases has been upheld by this Court.</p>

<blockquote>"Judicial permission to cancel the agreement is not necessary
because of the agreement that NDC may cancel the contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judicial action is proper only where there is
absence of a special provision granting the power of cancel­lation." (De
La <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> Steamship Co., Inc. vs. Tan, et al., L-8784,
May 21, 1956)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"There is nothing in the law that prohibits the parties from
entering into agreement that violation of the terms of the contract would cause
can­cellation thereof, even without court intervention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, it is not always necessary
for the injured party to resort to court for rescission of the contract."
(<span class="SpellE">Froilan</span> vs. Pan Oriental Ship­ping Company, L-11897,
October 31, 1964)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"ART. 1256 of the Civil Code (now Art. 1308) x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> creates no impediment to the
insertion in a contract for personal service of a <span class="SpellE">resolutory</span>
condition permitting the cancellation of the contract by one of the
parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a stipulation x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> does not make either the validity
or the fulfillment of the contract dependent upon the will of the party to whom
is conceded the privilege of cancellation; for where the contracting parties
have agreed that such option shall exist, the exercise of the option is as much
in the fulfillment of the contract as any other act which may have been the
subject of agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In­deed, the
cancellation of a contract in accordance with conditions agreed upon beforehand
is fulfillment." (Taylor vs. <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> <span class="SpellE">Tieng</span> <span class="SpellE">Piao</span>, 43 Phil. 873.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is pertinent to bear in mind that what we are asked to review
here is not only the issuance of the writ of injunc­tion by the Court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
but also the decision of the Court of Appeals dismissing the petition for
certiorari and prohibi­tion filed before it by herein petitioners, and
dissolving the writ of preliminary injunction it had theretofore issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Insofar as the prayer for prohibition is
concerned, based as it is on the ground of the trial court is lack of
jurisdiction over the subject-matter of the action, we are of the opinion that
the dismissal was proper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As has been
pointed out, the case below is one cognizable by the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
and not by the Court of Tax Appeals under Section 7 of Republic Act No. 1125.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the certiorari aspect of the petition in the Court of Appeals,
which had to do primarily with the writ of preliminary injunction issued by the
Court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> on February 16, 1967, and with its order of March 8,
1967, maintaining the said writ and directing its implementation, the question
is <span class="SpellE">wether</span> or not the said Court thereby exceeded its
jurisdic­tion or committed a grave abuse of discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To resolve the question, the writ must be
viewed in its setting when issued.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before the trial Court, first of all, was the com­plaint of
respondent CPTI.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only allegations
therein ad­vanced to support the prayer for preliminary injunction aside from
the recital of the acts sought to be enjoined, were "that without due
process or hearing to the plaintiff corporation and without any opportunity at
all to it to present formally the true facts concerning its operations,"
and without having been given the one-week notice required in paragraph 32 of
the management contract, it was served with the Commissioner's letter of
termination dated February 10, 1967.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
But before the Court likewise was the herein petitioner's motion to dis­miss
the complaint and "to dissolve or maintain dissolution of ancillary
writ" dated <st1:date year="1967" day="27" month="2">February 27,1967</st1:date>,
containing, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, the following
allegations:</p>

<blockquote>"During the progress of plaintiff's operations under the said
Management Contract, defendants Collector of Customs and Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> Supervisor notified plaintiff of several
violations of the Management Contract, notices of which violations are hereto
attached as Annexes "1", "1-A", "2",
"3", "4" and "5", all of which are made integral
parts hereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Despite the lapse of more
than the required period of one week under Paragraph 32 of the Management
Contract, plaintiff failed to answer them in a manner satisfactory to the
Bureau of Customs represented by defendants.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This forced defendant Commissioner of Customs to write a letter to the
President and General Manager, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Port Terminal,
Inc., dated February 10, 1967, copy attached as Annex "6" hereof,
informing him of the immediate taking over by the Bureau of Customs of the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operations at the Port of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said letter was duly served on plaintiff on
or about the afternoon of <st1:date year="1967" day="13" month="2">February 13,
 1967</st1:date>, immediately after which the Bureau of Customs entered into
the management of the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operations up to the
present, without any untoward incident."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It bears emphasis that the foregoing allegations were accompanied
by undisputed documentary evidence to substantiate them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Annex 1 is a letter dated <st1:date year="1966" day="2" month="12">December 2, 1966</st1:date>, signed by the
Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> Supervisor and addressed to Rolando <span class="SpellE">Veloso</span>, Board Chairman of CPTI, enclosing copy of a
memorandum of the Collector of Customs dated <st1:date year="1966" day="1" month="12">December 1, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The said memoran­dum, Annex 1-A, called attention to specific instances
of in­efficient handling of imported cargoes by CPTI and ordering specific
methods to be followed to remedy the situation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Annex 2, dated <st1:date year="1966" day="5" month="12">December 5, 1966</st1:date>,
is another letter to <span class="SpellE">Veloso</span>, signed by the Acting
Collector of Customs himself, making reference to numerous complaints from
importers concerning deficiencies in the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
service, particularly the insufficient number and capacity of the forklifts in
operation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Annex 3, dated <st1:date year="1967" day="9" month="1">January 9, 1967</st1:date>, called attention to
the great delay in the deliveries of imported cargoes to the consignees due to
lack of sufficient laborers employed in the piers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Annex 4, dated <st1:date year="1967" day="24" month="1">January 24, 1967</st1:date>, signed by the Acting Collector of
Customs, refers to the failure of CPTI to submit to him the monthly reports of
operation for November and December 1966, in spite of a previous directive that
such monthly report must be submitted within the first five days of every
succeeding month.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Annex 5, dated <st1:date year="1967" day="6" month="2">February 6, 1967</st1:date>, reiterated the
demand made in Annex 4.</p>

<p class="BODY">Significantly, the Court of Appeals, in its decision, took note
of the foregoing factual background, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"During the progress of the operation of respondent CPTI under
the said Management Contract, petitioning Commissioner and Supervisor notified
the CPTI of several violations of the Management Contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> Several merchants in <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place>,
so petitioners alleged, also formally complained to the Collector for the
inefficient handling of the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operations in <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Customs Lawyers and investigators were dispatched by the Commissioner to
<span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City to look into the complaint and alleged
violations of the contract, and after hearing all the parties, including the
officers of the respondent CPTI, they found that said respondent violated
paragraphs 3,8,9,11,12,15,17,18,19,20,21,25 and 26 of the Management Contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Despite the lapse of more than the required
period of one (1) week under said paragraph 32 of the Management Contract,
respondent CPTI failed to explain the violations in a manner satisfactory to
the Bureau of Cus­toms</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1967" day="10" month="2">February 10, 1967</st1:date>,
the Commissioner wrote a letter to the President and Gen­eral Manager of the
CPTI informing him of the taking over by the Bureau of Customs of the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operations at the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Port</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, on the same date, the Commissioner
issued Customs Administrative Order (CAO) No. 1-67, directing the Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> Service, created under CAO dated <st1:date year="1966" day="23" month="6">June 23, 1966</st1:date> to take over the
management and operation of the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> service in
the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Port</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename></st1:place>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It was therefore a fact sufficiently demonstrated <u>at that
stage of the case before the trial Court</u>, albeit sub­ject to the outcome of
the trial on the merits upon due presentation of evidence by both parties, that
numerous violations of the management contract had been committed by CPTI; that
CPTI had been duly informed thereof in writing; and that not only had CPTI
failed to satisfy the Bureau that such violations had been committed or did not
exist, but had failed utterly to give any explanation despite the lapse of the
period of one week stipulated for that purpose.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><u>Prima facie at least, at that stage of the case before the trial
court</u>, the take-over by the Bureau of the operation of the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> service at the port of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
was clearly justified under the terms of the said management contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the take-over was a compelling
necessity under the circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
an overriding consideration, which the said Court overlooked when it issued the
injunction, is that the case involves not merely the private rights of the con­tracting
parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Over and above such rights is the
para­mount public interest, both in respect of the receiving, handling, custody
and delivery of all cargoes imported and exported, or in transit, through the
port of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> and in respect of the income that the
government derives from the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> service, which
under the contract is 46.1% of the total gross receipts of the contractor from
all sources, whether actually collected or not, "payable monthly within
the first five (5) days of the succeeding month." This public interest, in
the light of the facts then before the trial Court, stood in serious jeopardy
in the hands of CPTI as <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The burden was squarely and plainly upon it
to show otherwise, and pending satisfactory showing to that effect the issuance
of a preliminary injunction against herein petitioners was an improvident act,
amount­ing to grave abuse of discretion correctible by certiorari.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b> the decision of the Court of Appeals is
reversed; the writ of preliminary injunction issued by the Court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
is set aside; the case is remanded for continua­tion of the proceedings; and
the restraining order issued by this Court against such continuation is <u>pro</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>tanto</u></span> dissolved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With costs.</p>

"The Bureau of Customs shall have ex­clusive supervision and control over
the receiving, handling, custody and delivery of articles on the wharves and
piers at all ports of entry and in the exercise of its functions it is hereby
authorized to acquire, take over, operate and superintend such plants and
facilities as may be necessary for the receiving, handling, custody and
delivery of articles, and the convenience and comfort of passengers and the
handling of baggage, as well as to acquire fire protection equipment for use in
the piers:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Provided, that whenever in
his judgment the receiving, handling custody and delivery of articles can be
carried on by private parties with greater efficiency, the Commissioner may,
after public bidding and subject to the approval of the department head,
contract with any private party for the service of receiving, handling, custody
and delivery of articles, and in such event, the contract may include the sale
or lease of government owned equip­ment al d facilities used in such
service."</p>

There was also, of course, the other allegation, already disposed of earlier in
this decision, that the Commissioner should have filed an action for rescission
of the contract instead of <span class="SpellE">cancelling</span> it <span class="SpellE">extrajudicially</span>.</p>
