for conveyance of inheritance and accounting, before the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental (Civil Case No. <span style="">6314), </span>alleging among others that:</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Cuaycong</span> had on several occasions, made known to <span style="">his </span>brothers
and sisters that he and his wife <span class="SpellE">Clotilde</span> de Leon
(died in <span style="">1940) </span>had an
understanding and made arrangements with Luis <span class="SpellE">Cuaycong</span>
and his father <span class="SpellE">Justo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cuaycong</span>,
that it was their desire to divide Haciendas Sta. Cruz and <span class="SpellE">Pusod</span>
among his brothers and sister and his wife <span class="SpellE">Clotilde</span>.</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the consent of his
wife, Eduardo had asked his brothers and sister to pay his wife P75,000 (the ha­ciendas
were worth P150,000) and then divide equally the remaining one-half share of
Eduardo.</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The brothers and sister
failed to pay the 1/2 share of <span class="SpellE">Clotilde</span> over the two
haciendas which were later acquired by <span style="">Luis </span><span class="SpellE">Cuaycong</span> thru
clever strategy, fraud, misrepresentation and in disregard of Eduardo's wishes
by causing the issuance in his name of certificates of title covering said
properties.</p>

<p class="NUM">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the two haciendas were
the subject of transactions between the spouses and <span class="SpellE">Justo</span>
and Luis <span class="SpellE">Cuaycong</span>, Eduardo told <span class="SpellE">Justo</span>
and Luis, and the two agreed, to hold in trust what might belong to his
brothers and sister as a result of the arrangements and deliver to them their
share when the proper time comes.</p>

<p class="NUM">5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That as far back as 1936 <span class="SpellE">Lino</span> demanded from <span class="SpellE">Justo</span> and Luis
his share and especially after Eduardo's and <span class="SpellE">Clotilde's</span>
death, the plaintiffs demanded their shares.</p>

<p class="NUM">6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That their demands had
been refused and in 1960 during the estate proceedings of <span class="SpellE">Praxedes</span>
Escalon, deceased wife of Luis D. <span class="SpellE">Cuaycong</span>, the
latter fraudulently made it appear that the plaintiffs had nothing to do with
the land; that Luis <span class="SpellE">Cuaycong</span> had possessed the lands
since June 21, 1936 from which time he should be made to account for the
plaintiffs' share; and that P1,500 attorney's fees should be paid in their
favor.</p>

<p class="BODY">Luis D. <span class="SpellE">Cuaycong</span> on October 20, 1961
moved to dismiss the complaint on the grounds of unenforceability of the claim
under the statute of frauds, no cause of ac­tion<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Rule <span style="">8,
</span>Sec. 1[f] of the Rules of Court), and bar of causes of action by the
statute of limitations (Rule <span style="">8, </span>Sec.
1[e]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, opposition thereto,
answer and reply were filed; the plaintiffs also sought to have Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Cuaycong</span> declared in default for his failure to answer.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1961" day="16" month="12">December 16, 1961</st1:date>,
the Court of First Instance ruled that the trust alleged, particularly in
paragraph <span style="">8 </span>of the complaint,
refers to an immovable which under Article <span style="">1443 </span>of the Civil Code may not be proved by parole
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs were given 10 days
to file an amended complaint mentioning or alleging therein the written
evidence of the alleged trust, otherwise the case would be dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Later, on <st1:date year="1961" day="23" month="12">December <span style="">23, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>the court decreed that since there
was no amended complaint filed, thus, no enforceable claim, it was useless to
declare Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Cuaycong</span> in default.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiff thereafter manifested that the claim is based on an
implied trust as shown by paragraph <span style="">8 </span>of
the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They added that there
being no written instrument of trust, they could not amend the complaint to
include such instrument.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="13" month="1">January <span style="">13, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>the court dismissed the case for
failure to amend the complaint; it further refused to reconsider its order
denying the motion to declare Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Cuaycong</span> in
default, stating that such a default declaration would be of no purpose.</p>

<p class="BODY">Failing in their efforts to have the dismissal reconsidered,
plaintiffs appealed to Us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
resolution of the appeal hinges on whether the trust is express or implied.</p>

<p class="BODY">Paragraph <span style="">8 </span>of the
complaint states:</p>

<blockquote>"That as the said two haciendas were then the subject of
certain transactions between the spouses Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Cuaycong</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Clotilde</span> de Leon on one hand, and <span class="SpellE">Justo</span> and Luis D. <span class="SpellE">Cuay­cong</span> on
the other, Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Cuaycong</span> told his brother <span class="SpellE">Justo</span> and his nephew, defendant Luis D. <span class="SpellE">Cuaycong</span>,
to hold in trust what might belong to <span style="">his
</span>brothers and sister as a result of the arrangements and to deliver to
them their shares when the proper time comes, to which <span class="SpellE">Justo</span>
and Luis D. <span class="SpellE">Cuaycong</span> agreed."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The plaintiffs claim that an implied trust is referred to in the
complaint which, under Article 1457 of the Civil Code, may be proved by parole
evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span>Our Civil Code defines an express trust
as one created by the intention of the trust or of the parties, and an implied
trust as one <span style="">that </span>comes into
being by operation of law.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Express trusts are those created by the direct and positive acts of the
parties, by some writing or deed or will or by words evidencing an intention to
create a trust.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand,
implied trusts are those which, without being expressed, are deducible from the
nature of the transaction by operation of law as matters of equity,
independently of the particular intention of the parties.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">Thus, </span>if the intention to
establish a trust is clear, the trust is express; if <span style="">the intent to </span>establish a trust is to
be taken from circumstances or other matters indicative of <span style="">such </span>intent, then the trust is
implied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From these and from the
provisions of paragraph <span style="">8 </span>of the
complaint itself, We find it clear that the plaintiffs alleged an express trust
over an immovable, especially since it is alleged that the <span class="SpellE"><u>trustor</u></span><u>
expressly</u> <span style="">told the defendants of </span>his
intention to establish the trust.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a
situation definitely falls under Article 1443 of the Civil Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants point out that not only paragraph <span style="">8 </span>should be considered but the whole
complaint, in which case they argue that an implied trust should be construed
to exist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article 1453, one of the cases
of implied trust, is also cited:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"When property is conveyed to a person in reliance upon his
declared intentions to hold it for or transfer it to another or the grantor,
there is an implied trust in favor of the person whose benefit is
contemplated." Said arguments are untenable, even considering the whole
complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The intention of the <span class="SpellE">trustor</span> to establish the alleged trust may be seen in
paragraphs <span style="">5 </span>and <span style="">6.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>Article <span style="">1453 </span>would apply if the person conveying the property did not
expressly state that he was establishing the trust, unlike the case at bar
where he was alleged to have expressed such intent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the lower court did not err in
dismissing the complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, even assuming the alleged trust to be an implied one,
the right alleged by plaintiffs would have already prescribed since starting <span style="">in </span><span style="">1936 </span>when the <span class="SpellE">trustor</span> died, plaintiffs
had already been allegedly refused by the aforesaid defendants in their demands
over the land, and the complaint was filed only <span style="">in </span>1961 - more than the 10-year period of prescription for the
enforcement of such rights under the trust.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is settled that the right to enforce an implied trust in one's favor
prescribes in ten (10) years.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
And even under the Code of Civil Procedure, action to recover real property
such as lands prescribe <span style="">in </span>ten
years (Sec. 40, Act <span style="">190).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">And for the above reasons, We agree that it was pointless to
declare Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Cuaycong</span> in default, considering
that without a written instrument as evidence of the alleged trust, the case
for the plaintiffs must be dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order of dismissal of the lower court
appealed from is hereby affirmed, without costs.</p>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>
