<p class="BODY"><span style="">Upon consideration of the
points raised and discussed by appellant, <span class="GramE">We</span> find the
appeal to be well taken.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The main basis of the
trial court's decision is that appellant did not observe the extraordinary or
utmost dili­gence of a very cautious person required by the following articles
of the Civil Code:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"ART. 1733.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Common
carriers, from the nature of their business and for reasons of public policy,
are bound to observe extraordinary diligence in <span style="">the vigilance over </span>the goods and for the safety of the
passengers trans­ported by them, according to all the circumstances of each
case.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Such extraordinary diligence in the vigilance over the goods
is fur­ther expressed in articles 1734, 1735, and 1745, Nos. 5, 6, and 7, while
the extraordinary diligence for the safety of the passengers is further set
forth <span style="">in articles 1755 and 1756.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"ART. 1755.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A common
carrier is bound to carry the passengers safely <span style="">as far as </span>human care and foresight can provide, using the utmost
dili­gence of very cautious persons, with a due regard for all the
circumstances.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"ART.
1756.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In case of death of or injuries to
passengers, common carriers are presumed to have been at fault or to have acted
negligently, unless they prove that they observed extraordinary diligence as
prescribed in articles 1733 and 1755."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Analyzing
the evidence presented by the </span><span style="">parties,
His </span><span style="">Honor
found:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"According to <span class="SpellE">Severino</span> <span class="SpellE">Andaya</span>, a witness for the plaintiff, <span style="">a man </span>with a box went up the baggage
compartment of the bus where he already was and said box was placed under the
seat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They left <span class="SpellE">Azcarraga</span>
at about <st1:time minute="30" hour="11">11:30</st1:time> in the morning and
when the explosion <span class="SpellE">occured</span>, he was thrown out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>PC investigation report states that thirty
seven (37) passengers were injured (Exhibit 'O’ and '2').</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"The bus conductor, <span class="SpellE">Sancho</span> Mendoza, </span>testified that the box belonged to a
passenger whose name he does not know and who told him that it contained
miscellaneous items and clothes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He <span style="">helped the owner in loading the bag­gage
which weighed about twelve (12) </span>kilos and because of company <span class="GramE">regula­tion,</span> he charged him for it twenty-five centavos
(P0.25).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From its <span style="">appearance there was no </span>indication at
all that the contents were explosives or firecrackers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither did he open the box because he just
relied on the <span style="">word of the owner.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"Dispatcher Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Cornista</span>
of <span class="GramE">defendant company</span> corroborated the testimony of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Mendoza</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> and he said, </span>among other things, that
he was present when the box was loaded in the truck and the owner agreed to pay
its fare.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He added that they were not
authorized to open the <span class="SpellE">baggages</span> of passengers because
instruction from the management was to call the police if there were packages
containing articles which were against regulations.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"There <span style="">is </span>no question that Bus No. 120 was road worthy when it left its
Manila Terminal for <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span> that morning of <st1:date year="1960" day="5" month="12">December 5, 1960</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The injuries suf­fered by the plaintiff were
not due to mechanical defects but to the explosion of firecrackers inside the
bus which was loaded by <span style="">a </span>co-passenger.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> Turning
to the present case, it is quite clear that extraordi­nary or utmost diligence
of a very cautious person was not observed by the de­fendant company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The service manual, Exhibits '3' and '3-A',
prohibits the employees to allow explosives, such as dynamite and firecrackers
to be trans­ported on its buses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
implement this particular rule for the safety of pass­engers, it was therefore
incumbent upon the employees of the company to make the proper inspection of
all the <span class="SpellE">bag­gages</span> which are carried by the passen­gers.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"But then, can it not be <span style="">said that </span>the breach of the contract was due
to fortuitous event? The Supreme Court in the case of <span class="SpellE">Lasam</span>
vs. Smith, 45 Phil. 657, quoted <span class="SpellE">Escriche's</span> definition
of <span class="SpellE"><u>caso</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">fortuito</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>as ‘an unexpected event or act of God
which could neither be foreseen nor resisted, such as floods, torrents,
shipwrecks, conflagrations, lightning, compulsions, insurrections, destructions
of buildings by unforeseen accidents and other occurrences of <span style="">a </span>similar
nature.' In other words, the cause of the unexpected event must be independent
of the will of man or some­thing which cannot be avoided.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This cannot be said of instant case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If <span style="">proper
and rigid inspection were observed by the defendant, the contents of the box
could have been discovered and the accident avoided.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Refusal by the passenger to have the package
opened was no excuse be­cause, as stated by Dispatcher <span class="SpellE">Cornista</span>,
employees should call the </span><span style="">police
if there were </span><span style="">package containing
articles against company regulations.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Neither was failure by employees of <span class="GramE">defendant company</span>
to detect the contents of the packages of passengers because like the rationale
in the <span class="SpellE">Necesito</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Paras</span>
case (supra), a passenger has neither choice nor control in the exercise of
their discretion in determining what are inside the package of co-passengers
which may eventually prove fatal."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We cannot agree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No doubt, the views of His Honor do seem to
be in line with the </span><span style="">reasons that the Code Commission </span><span style="">had for incorporating the above-quoted provisions in its </span>draft of
the Civil Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, in approving the
said draft, Congress must have concurred with the Commission that by re­quiring
the highest degree of diligence from common carriers in the safe transport of
their passengers and by creating a presumption of negligence against them, the <span style="">recklessness of their drivers which <span style="">is </span></span>a common sight even in
crowded areas and, particularly, on the highways throughout the country may,
somehow, if not in <span style="">a </span>large
measure, be curbed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are not convinced,
however, that the exacting criterion of said provisions has not been met by
appellant in the circumstances of this particular case.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is undisputed that
before the box containing the firecrackers were allowed to be loaded in the bus
by the <span class="GramE">conductor,</span> inquiry was made with the passenger
carrying the same </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">to what was in it, since its "opening
….. <span class="GramE">was</span> folded and tied with abaca." <span class="GramE">(Decision p. 16, Record <span style="">on Appeal.)</span></span></span><span style=""> According to His Honor, "if proper and
rigid inspection were observed </span><span style="">by
the defendant, the contents of the box could have been discovered and the
accident avoided.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Refusal by the
passenger to have the package opened was no excuse because, as stated by
Dispatcher <span class="SpellE">Cornista</span>, employees should call the police
if there were packages containing articles against company regulations."
That may be true, but </span><span style="">it <span style="">is </span><span class="GramE">Our</span> </span><span style="">considered opinion that </span>the law does
not require as much.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article 1733 <span style="">is </span>not as unbending as His Honor has
held, for it reasonably qualifies the extraordinary diligence required of
common car­riers for the safety of the passengers transported by them to be
"according to all the circumstances of each case." <span style="">In fact, Article 1755 repeats this same
qualification: "A common carrier </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">bound to carry the passengers safely as far
as human care and foresight can provide, using the ut­most diligence of very
cautious persons, <u>with due regard for all the circumstances</u>."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In this particular case
before Us, it must be consi­dered that while it </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">true the passengers of appellant's bus should
not be made to suffer for something over which they had no control, as
enunciated in the decision of this Court cited by His Honor,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> fairness demands that in meas­uring a common
carrier's duty towards its passengers, allow­ance must be given to the reliance
that should be reposed on the sense of responsibility of all the passengers in
re­gard to their common safety.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is to
be presumed that a passenger will not take with him anything dangerous to the
lives and limbs of his co-passengers, not to speak of his own.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not to be lightly considered must be the
right to pri­vacy to which each passenger </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">entitled.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He cannot be subjected to any unusual search, when he protests the in­nocuousness
of his baggage and nothing appears to indicate the contrary, as in the case at
bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, in­quiry may be
verbally made as to the nature of </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">passenger's baggage when such is not
outwardly perceptible, but beyond this, constitutional boundaries are already
in danger of being transgressed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Calling
a policeman to his aid, as suggested by the service manual invoked by the trial
judge, in compelling the passenger to submit to more rigid inspect­ion, after
the passenger had already declared that the box contained mere clothes and
other miscellanies, could not have justified invasion of </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">constitutionally
protected domain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Police officers acting
without judicial authority secured in the manner provided by law are not beyond
the pale of constitutional inhibitions designed to protect in­dividual human
rights and liberties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Withal, what must
be importantly considered here is not so much the infringement of the
fundamental sacred rights of the particular passenger herein involved, but the
constant threat any contrary ruling would pose on the right of privacy of all
passengers of all common carriers, considering how easily the duty to inspect
can be made an excuse for mischief and abuse.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Of course, when there are sufficient indications that the representa­tions
of the passenger regarding the nature of his baggage may not be true, in the
interest of the common safety of all, the assistance of the police authorities
may be solicited, not necessarily to force the passenger to open his baggage,
but to conduct the needed investigation consistent with the rules of propriety
and, above all, the constitutional rights of the passenger.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is in this sense that the mentioned
service manual issued by appellant to its conductors must be understood.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Decisions in other jurisdictions cited by appellant <span style="">in its </span><span style="">brief, evidently because of the paucity of local prece­dents squarely
in point, emphasize that </span><span style="">there
is </span><span style="">need, as We hold here, for
evidence of circumstances indicating cause or causes for apprehension that the
passenger's baggage is dangerous and that it is failure of the common carrier's
employee to act in the face of such evidence that constitutes the cornerstone
of the common carrier's liability in cases similar to the present one.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The principle that must control the servants of the carrier
in a case like the one before <span style="">us is </span>correctly stated in the opinion in the
case of Clarke v. Louisville &amp; N.R. Co. 20 Ky. L. Rep. 839, 49 S. W.
1120.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that case Clarke was a
passenger on the defendant's train.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another
passenger took <u>a qua</u><u><span style="">ntity </span></u><u><span style="">of </span>gasoline</u> into the same coach in
which Clarke was riding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It ignited and
exploded, by reason of which he was severely injured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court peremptorily instructed the
jury to find for the defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
opinion, affirming the judgment, it is said: 'It may be stated briefly, in
assuming the liability of a railroad to its passengers for injury done by
another passenger, only where the conduct of this passenger had been such before
the injury as to induce a reasonably prudent and vigilant conductor to believe
that there was reasonable ground to apprehend violence and danger to the other
passengers, and in that case asserting it to be the duty of the conductor of
the railroad train to use all reasonable means to prevent such injury, and if
he neglects this reasonable duty, and injury is done, that then the company is
responsible; that otherwise the railroad is not responsible.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The opinion quotes with approval from the case of Gulf, C.
&amp; S. F. R. Co. vs. Shields, 9 Tex. <span class="SpellE">Civ</span>. App. 652,
29 S. <span style="">W. </span>652, in which case the
plaintiff was injured by <u>alcohol</u> which had been carried upon the train
by another passenger.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the opinion in
that case it is said: 'It was but a short period of time after the alcohol was
spilt when <span style="">it was set on fire and the
accident occurred, and it was not shown that appel­lant's employees knew that
the jug contained alcohol.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, it
is not shown that the conductor or any other employee knew that Harris had a
jug with him until it fell out of the sack, though the conductor had collected
… (his) fare, and doubtless knew that he had the sack on the seat with him
...<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be successfully denied
that Harris had the right as </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">passenger to carry baggage on the train, and
that he had </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">right to carry it in a sack if he chose to do
so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We </span><span style="">think it is equally </span><span style="">clear
that, in the absence of some intimation or circumstance indicating that the
sack contained something dangerous to other passengers, it was not the duty of
appellant's conductor or any other employee to open the sack and examine its
contents.' </span><span style="">Quinn v. Louisville </span><span style="">&amp; N. R. Co. 98 Ky. 231, 32 S. </span><span style="">W. </span><span style="">742; Wood v. Louisville &amp; N. R.
