judgment below sentenced appellant to life imprisonment, to indemnify the heirs
of the deceased in the sum of P6,000.00, and to pay the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">Following are the facts:</p>

<p class="BODY">In the morning of <st1:date year="1949" day="14" month="11">November
 14, 1949</st1:date>, two bloody incidents occurred in the town of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Sinacaban</span></st1:place></st1:city>, <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span>
Occidental.</p>

<p class="BODY">About <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9:00 o'clock</st1:time> in
the morning of that day, <span class="SpellE">Victoriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Simbajon</span>, defeated candidate for Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Sinacaban</span>, approached incumbent Mayor <span class="SpellE">Sofronio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Avanceña</span>, his opponent and the victor, near the
municipal building.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Victoriano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Simbajon</span> - who was then accompanied by his son, <span class="SpellE">Panfilo</span>, and his son-in-law, Arturo Yap - while still at a
distance, raised his hands apparently to signify that he accepted defeat,
invited the Mayor to ride with him in his jeep in going to a wedding party to
which both were invited.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mayor <span class="SpellE">Avanceña</span> politely declined.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Simbajon</span> and his party left, went down the
slope leading to the national highway.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime later, <span class="SpellE">Avanceña</span>, followed by
the Chief of Police, herein appellant <span class="SpellE">Isaias</span> <span class="SpellE">Macalisang</span> and Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Liborio</span>
Dominguez left on foot, followed the same route.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As they approached the highway, <span class="SpellE">Simbajon</span> - then standing near the house of one <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Isabelo</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Plaza</st1:placetype></st1:place>
- again offered his jeep to <span class="SpellE">Avanceña</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter again declined, stated that he
would take the jeep of the municipal health officer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Immediately thereafter, there was a burst of
gunfire in rapid succession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mayor <span class="SpellE">Avanceña</span> was mortally wounded; his two companions
critically wounded.</p>

<p class="BODY">Parenthetically, for these crimes, <span class="SpellE">Victoriano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Simbajon</span>, Feliciano <span class="SpellE">Simbajon</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Panfilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Simbajon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Simbajon</span>, in separate
cases jointly tried, were prosecuted for (1) the murder of Mayor <span class="SpellE">Avanceña</span>, the frustrated murder of herein appellant <span class="SpellE">Isaias</span> <span class="SpellE">Macalisang</span>, and (3) the
frustrated murder of Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Liborio</span>
Dominguez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were all convicted
below.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the crime of murder, they
were all sentenced to <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>,
and for the other two crimes, they were separately given prison terms by the
trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Simbajon</span> did not appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judgment as to the rest was affirmed by
this Court on <st1:date year="1965" day="30" month="9">September 30, 1965</st1:date>
(G. R. No. L-18073-75), with a slight modification as to the penalty for the
frustrated murders.</p>

<p class="BODY">Minutes after the incident heretofore described, Fr. William
Bourke, the town parish priest, who heard the shots, came upon the scene of the
crime together with his houseboy, Benjamin Lopez, in the <span class="SpellE">former's</span>
jeep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He administered the last
sacraments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant <span class="SpellE">Isaias</span> <span class="SpellE">Macalisang</span> was lifted by
Benjamin Lopez and placed in the front seat of the jeep between him and Fr.
Bourke, who was at the wheel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
proceeded to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Ozamis</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the jeep was negotiating a curve in
Barrio <span class="SpellE">Casoy</span> of <span class="SpellE">Sinacaban</span>,
appellant <span class="SpellE">Macalisang</span> pointed his gun at Francisco <span class="SpellE">Dano</span>, who was at the curb of the road by the mountainside,
and fired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Francisco <span class="SpellE">Dano</span>
was hit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bullet entered his back at
the right of the mid-spinal line; it came out thru the right chest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He shouted to his wife:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Help <span class="SpellE">help</span>,
Day, I am hit by the gun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Help, I will
die." Francisco <span class="SpellE">Dano's</span> wife, Perfecta, rushed to
his side and found that he was bleeding in front and in the back of his
body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She asked <span class="SpellE">Dano</span>
who shot him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Dano's</span>
reply:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Chief <span class="SpellE">Isaias</span>
<span class="SpellE">Macalisang</span>." Brought to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Ozamis</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
<span class="SpellE">Dano</span> expired on the same day.</p>

<p class="BODY">Came the present prosecution for murder with the result noted at
the start of this opinion.</p>

<p class="NUM" style=""><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">1.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">That it was appellant <span class="SpellE">Macalisang</span> who fired
the shot which killed <span class="SpellE">Dano</span>, we do not doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon hearing the shot, Fr. Bourke saw the gun
held by appellant still pointed at the side of the road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Benjamin Lopez testified that he first
noticed the deceased <span class="SpellE">Dano</span> some forty meters away;
that as they were getting closer to <span class="SpellE">Dano</span>, appellant
took his gun from his lap, pointed it at the former, fired once; that he
grabbed the gun from <span class="SpellE">Macalisang</span>; that thereafter,
they proceeded to <span class="SpellE">Ozamis</span> City; and that there, Fr.
Bourke took the gun from him and surrendered it to the Philippine
Constabulary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And then, there is the
testimony of Perfecta <span class="SpellE">vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Dano</span>
that when she approached her husband, the latter told her that it was Chief <span class="SpellE">Macalisang</span> who shot him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is in the nature of a dying declaration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that time, <span class="SpellE">Dano</span>
felt that he was at the point of death.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, he was in a very serious condition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, he died on the same day.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM" style=""><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">2.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">But appellant pleads that he was unconscious or under shock at the time
the act was committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The factual
support for this is that in the earlier incident, he received gunshot wounds
"from the point of my penis hitting my x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> (gonads) to my lap"; that his left leg was broken;
that he fell into the canal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He further
relates that from then on, he lost consciousness until he was already treated
at the </span><st1:place><st1:placename>Medina</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>
in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Ozamis</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As prop for his testimony, he presented Dr.
Rico Medina his attending physician.</p>

<p class="BODY">The doctor's version is that appellant was in a very serious
condition when brought to the hospital because of the bullet wound he suffered
at the tip of the penis that pierced the right lateral portion of the scrotum,
the bullet wound on the lower, right extremity, and loss of blood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to the doctor, these injuries would
cause momentary unconsciousness for a length of time depending upon the
resistance of the patient.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant is
robust.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this case, the doctor opines
that "there is very big proba­bility" that <span class="SpellE">Macalisang</span>
"during the time of the accident was unconscious.” He stressed, however,
that it was possible that <span class="SpellE">Macalisang</span> could
"recover consciousness after 10 minutes," could have recognized
persons, and could have been in full control of the upper extremities which
were not affected at all by the wounds.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's testimony falls far short of convincing us, as it did
not convince the lower court, that he did not deliberately fire at <span class="SpellE">Dano</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was,
indeed, conscious at that time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
placed on the jeep, he took the precaution of placing his service revolver on
his lap.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lopez saw him take that gun and
fire at <span class="SpellE">Dano</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The priest, upon hearing the shot, saw appellant with the gun still
pointed at the side of the road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
version of Captain Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Rafols</span>, who interviewed
appellant in the hospital, furnishes the clincher.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant admitted to the captain, "I
was the one who shot Mr. <span class="SpellE">Dano</span>." This statement
is definite, although the captain stated that <span class="SpellE">Macalisang</span>
was confused as to the shooting incident that occurred earlier in the morning.</p>

<p class="BODY">And then, the doctor affirmed that it was possible that appellant
could have regained consciousness after 10 minutes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Between the time appellant was hit by gunfire
to the time the priest in his jeep came by, the evidence is that about 10 to 15
minutes transpired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A criminal act is
presumed to be voluntary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We cannot
seize upon speculation or guesswork to overturn this presumption.</p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, between the self-serving version of appellant and
the indecisive testimony of his doctor, on the one hand, and the positive
assertion of Fr. Bourke, witness Lopez and Capt. <span class="SpellE">Rafols</span>,
on the, other, the choice is clear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fact
prevails over assumption.</p>

<p class="BODY">Absent an aboveboard explanation, the shooting must be declared
voluntary and punishable.</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Treachery, according to
the decision below, qualifies the crime as murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant's assertion to the contrary is not
to be slightly taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It deserves
serious consideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">Jurisprudence has it that the mere location of the bullet wound
at the back - as is the case here - by itself, does not prove treachery.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Neither will suddenness of the attack alone.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Even if the purpose was to kill, so long as the decision was sudden and the
victim's position accidental, no treachery attaches to the killing.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The question of treachery perhaps may not be thoroughly under­stood
except in the peculiar setting of this case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant knew that <span class="SpellE">Dano</span> was the chief adviser
of the defeated candidate for Mayor, <span class="SpellE">Victoriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Simbajon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Dano</span> delivered speeches against Mayor <span class="SpellE">Sofronio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Avanceña</span> and wrote leaflets attacking the
latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Chief of Police <span class="SpellE">Macalisang</span>, in turn, was a supporter of the deceased Mayor <span class="SpellE">Avanceña</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After <span class="SpellE">Macalisang</span> was wounded, he did not go in search of <span class="SpellE">Dano</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It just so
happened that on his way to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Ozamis</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, he saw <span class="SpellE">Dano</span>
on the road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant was in a <u>running</u>
jeep; the victim standing at the side of the road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was an impulse of the moment that led to
the attack which caused death.</p>

<p class="BODY">The resulting crime is not murder qualified by treachery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because, it does not appear that "the
method of assault adopted by the aggressor <u>was</u> <u>deliberately</u> <u>chosen</u>
with a special view to the accomplishment of the act without risk to the
assailant from any defense that the party assailed may make."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">With treachery eliminated, the crime thus committed is
homicide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The amended information
charged that appellant is a recidivist.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was really convicted of serious physical injuries and less serious
physical injuries on <st1:date year="1941" day="4" month="9">September 4, 1941</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Therefore, the homicide herein committed is attended by one aggravating
circumstance, with none in mitigation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The penalty should be <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u> in the maximum
period.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>We, accordingly</b>, modify the judgment appealed from,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
and sentence defendant for the crime of homicide to suffer imprisonment for an
indeterminate period ranging from eight (8) years and one (1) day of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <u>mayor</u>, as minimum, to seventeen (17)
years, four (4) months and one (1) day of <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u>, as
maximum, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased Francisco <span class="SpellE">Dano</span>
in the sum of P6,000.00, without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency,
but with the accessories of the law, and to pay the costs.</p>
