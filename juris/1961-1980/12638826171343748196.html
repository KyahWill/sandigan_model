				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="18" month="12">December 18, 1962</st1:date>,
Tomas <span class="SpellE">Navasca</span>, <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Geraldes</span>, Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Soberano</span> and
Manuel Marquez were charged with the crime of robbery with homicide committed
by a band before the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>,
Branch III (Criminal Case 7712), the information reading as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about March 17, 1959, in the Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Bansalan</span>, Province of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>,
Philippines, and within the juris­diction of this Court, the above-mentioned
accused, all armed with deadly weapons, conspiring, <span style="">confederating together and helping one another, and with intent to gain
and by means of force upon things and violence against persons, did then </span><span style="">and </span><span style="">there <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>, unlaw­fully and </span><span style="">Criminally </span><span style="">take, steal and carry away </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">sum of One Thousand Eight Hundred (P1,800.00) </span><span style="">Pesos </span><span style="">belonging to </span><span style="">Go </span><span style="">So alias OWA, to the damage and prejudice of
the latter ,in the aforesaid amount, </span><span style="">and on </span><span style="">the same occasion
thereof, and in pursuance of said conspiracy the abovementioned accused; with
intent to kill, did then and there, <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>, unlaw­fully
</span><span style="">and </span><span style="">criminally attack, assault </span><span style="">and </span><span style="">shoot said GO SO alias OWA, thereby inflicting upon him injuries which
caused his death."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Before arraignment, the commitment of the accused Tomas <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Navasca</span></span><span style=""> </span>to the National Mental Hos<span style="">pital was ordered and proceedings against him
suspended after the court had adjudged him as suffering from mental disorder,
on the strength of the report and recommendation of a court-appointed doctor
(Exhibit "A"), and after the court had satisfied itself "that he
cannot under, stand the nature of the proceedings to be conducted against him."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Due trial proceeded
against the remaining accused, and on </span><st1:date year="1966" day="7" month="1"><span style="">January 7, 1966</span></st1:date><span style="">, the court rendered its decision, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in conformity to Art. 294, paragraph 1 in relation
to Art. 296 of the Revised Penal Code, the accused FLORENCIO GERALDES and
MANUEL MARQUEZ are hereby sentenced each of them to the supreme and extreme
penalty of death.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">“The </span>Court holds the
view that (<span style="">e</span>ach of) the <span style="">accused:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q"><span style="">'<span style="">xxx </span></span>has proven himself to be a dangerous <span style="">enemy </span><span style="">of society.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter must protect
itself </span><span style="">from </span><span style="">such enemy by taking his life</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">in retribution for his offense as an example
and warning to </span><span style="">others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">In
these days of rampant criminality it should have a salutary effect to the
criminally-minded to know that the </span><span style="">Courts
</span><span style="">do not shirk their disagreeable
duty to impose the death penalty in cases where the law so requires.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>People v. <span class="SpellE">Carillo</span>,
No. L-2043, </span><st1:date year="1950" day="28" month="2"><span style="">Feb. 28, 1950</span></st1:date><span style="">; 85 Phil 611.’</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Relative to accused <span class="SpellE">Soberano</span>,
although he was not actually present at the time of the killing of the deceased
<span class="SpellE">Owa</span>, for he was then acting as guard, yet, he is as <span style="">much </span>liable as his other co-accused,
considering the following authorities:</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Considering however, accused Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Soberano's</span>
act of testifying for the prosecution and revealing voluntarily in Open Court,
the sordid details of this crime, the Court considers this a mitigating
circumstance in his favor similar to a plea of guilty, that is a mitigating
circumstance of 'similar analogous nature', and, hence, he is hereby sentenced
to suffer the<span style=""> </span>penalty of <u>RECLUSION</u>
<u>PERPETUA.<o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>"All the accused are like­wise ordered to indemnify jointly
and severally the offended parties in the sum of P1,800.00 and to indemnify
jointly and severally the heirs of the deceased GO SO alias OWA in the amount
of P6,000.00, without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency by reason
of the penalty imposed, with the accessory penalties of<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the law, and to pay the costs
proportionately.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Considering further that the accused <span class="SpellE">Navasca</span>
is presently mentally ill and uncertain as to when he shall regain his sanity
the case against him is ordered archived to be retrieved immediately as soon as
the <span style="">accused regained his sanity and in
a position to stand trial for this crime."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">By reason of the penalty imposed, this case is now before us on
automatic appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the extra-judicial admission (Exhibit "B") and
testimony of Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Soberano</span>, the following facts
can be gathered.</p>

<p class="BODY">At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="17">5:00 o'clock</st1:time>
in the afternoon of <st1:date year="1959" day="17" month="3">March 17, 1959</st1:date>
on his way home after buying DDT for his corn, he saw his co-accused sitting on
the road by the river <span style="">at </span>Bo. <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Manuel
Marquez holding a <span class="SpellE">thompson</span>, Tomas <span class="SpellE">Navasca</span>
armed with a pistol and <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Geraldes</span>
carrying a carbine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He bought tuba as
requested by <span class="SpellE">Navasca</span> and after the same was consumed
by <span class="SpellE">Navasca</span> and <span class="SpellE">Geraldes</span>, he
was invited to go with the group to serenade.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On their way, as they passed the house of a certain Primo, the latter
was slapped by <span class="SpellE">Navasca</span> and threatened with a .45 cal.
pistol should he not consent to go with the <span style="">group </span>to rob.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Out of
fear, he did not refuse and <span style="">as </span>they
reached the house of their intended victim, he was given a hunting knife by <span class="SpellE">Navasca</span> and told to stand guard outside the house.</p>

<p class="BODY">From where he stood, he heard gunshots coming from the house,
after which his companions went out of the same and they altogether fled.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the account of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Josefa</span> <span class="SpellE">Delejeros</span>, widow of Go So, the following transpired inside
their house which led to the robbery and death of her husband.</p>

<p class="BODY">At about 6:00 o'clock in the evening of March 17, 1959, she was
having dinner with her husband Go So at their house in <span class="SpellE">Curbada</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Bansalan</span>, when three persons armed with
"short" and "long" "articles" entered their
house, ordered them to go upstairs and directed her husband to open a trunk
where their money was kept.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Go So gave
the money amounting to P1,800.00 to the men, after which the man with the
"short article" fired at Go So many times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The "long articles" were not
used.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After shooting the victim, the men
fled, and her husband was brought to the <span class="SpellE">Brokenshire</span>
Memorial Hospital where he died as a result of "gunshot wound through and
through, with involvement of abdominal organs" and severe, secondary
hemorrhage (Exhibit "C").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
witness further testified that because of fear, she could neither identify the
armed men who shot and robbed her husband, nor remember their size and height (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>. <st1:date year="1965" day="13" month="1">January 13,
 1965</st1:date>, p. 85).</p>

<p class="BODY">From the records of the case, the vital link between the accused
and the crime consists in the extra-judicial confession of <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Geraldes</span> (Exhibit "A") and the
extra-judicial admission (Exhibits "B" &amp; "B-1") and
testimony of Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Soberano</span> in court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Notably, both <span class="SpellE">Geraldes</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Soberano</span> repudiated their respective statements,
claiming that their so-called statements were pre­pared by the police and that
they were compelled to affix their signatures thereto after they had been
maltreated, and, in the case of <span class="SpellE">Soberano</span>, after he
had, in addition, been promised freedom.</p>

<p class="BODY">After a meticulous study of the records and mature deliberation,
it is unnecessary for us to discuss the question squarely raised by <span class="SpellE">Geraldes</span> <span style="">regarding
the <span class="SpellE">voluntariness</span> and truth of his statement (Exhibit
"A"), for it is our view that even without the extra-judicial
statement of <span class="SpellE">Geraldes</span>, the extrajudicial statement
and testimony of Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Soberano</span> in open court,
corroborated by the other evidence for the prosecution, suffice to justify the <span class="SpellE">affirm­ance</span> of the conviction of all the accused by the
trial court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We cannot sustain the argument of Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Soberano</span>
that his statement was prepared by the Chief of Police and that he affixed his <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span> thereto after he had been maltreated and promised
freedom because there are certain characteristic features in his statement that
refute his claim of involuntariness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
cite a few:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it be true that the
police prepared his statement, <span style="">it </span>would
not contain details which are inconsistent with the details mentioned in the
extra-judicial confession of <span class="SpellE">Geraldes</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But inconsistencies do exist between the
statements of <span class="SpellE">Geraldes</span> and <span class="SpellE">Soberano</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, said <span class="SpellE">Geraldes</span>:</p>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where
and when the robbery was planned?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(sic)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
do not know sir.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But when they were on
their way to the house of GO SO ALIAS OWA, they passed in my house and invited
me to join them." (Exhibit: "A")</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">On the other hand, <span class="SpellE">Soberano</span>
stated that even before he knew of the plan to rob <span style="">and </span>even before they started on their way, <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Geraldes</span> was already with the group <span style="">of <span class="SpellE">Navasca</span>, Marquez
</span>and another <span style="">person whom he did
not know.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Would you </span>please relate to the
investigator the circumstances surrounding the commission of the crime?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">Yes, </span>sir.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="15">3:00
 o'clock</st1:time> in <span style="">the </span>afternoon
of <st1:date year="1959" day="17" month="3"><span style="">March 17, 1959</span></st1:date><span style="">,
I went to the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span> of <span class="SpellE">Bansalan</span>
to buy DDT.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On my way home, I s</span><span style="">aw <span class="SpellE">Maning</span> Marquez,
Tomas <span class="SpellE">Navasca</span> and <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Geraldes</span> sitting </span>on <span style="">the side of the creek </span>in <span style="">barrio
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>." (Exhibit "B")</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Another reason which argues against the involuntariness of <span class="SpellE">Soberano's</span> statement <span style="">'is </span>that it contains details which only he
could distinctly know such as his previous conviction for the theft of a plow
and the number of years of his sentence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Besides, <span class="SpellE">Soberano</span> complained of the
maltreatment and the alleged inducement only after he had pre­viously testified
and had been convicted by the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Heretofore, this Court has held that these features in an extra-judicial
admission are proofs not of involuntariness and falsity but rather of <span class="SpellE">voluntariness</span> and truth.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The paramount
consideration, however, which, to our mind, weighs heavily in favor of the <span class="SpellE">volun­tariness</span> and truth of <span class="SpellE">Soberano's</span>
admission, and testimony in court is the significant fact that he took the
witness stand as witness </span><span style="">for </span><span style="">the prosecu­tion notwithstanding the severe
admonition by the trial judge of the consequences of his testimony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Verily, the trial judge had painstakingly
advised and informed the accused </span><span style="">of
</span><span style="">his rights </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">an accused and could not be indicted for dereliction of his duties as
judge, as shown by the following portion of the transcript:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"<u>QUESTIONS BY THE COURT</u>:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"COURT:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You
are one of the accused in this case?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
an accused in this case, under the constitution, you cannot be compelled to tes­tify
for the prosecution.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Do
you understand that?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
your Honor.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Do you </span>also understand that under the
Constitution if you remained silent and do not testify, your silence <span style="">will </span>not be taken in any way against
you?</blockquote>

<blockquote>“A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">Yes, your Honor.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now, </span>the Fiscal desires to present you
as one of the witnesses for the prosecu­tion against you and your other
co-accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Do you <span class="SpellE">kow</span>
that?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, your Honor.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
you know you have every right under our law to refuse?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
cannot refuse, your Honor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What I will
do is to tell the truth.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Do
you understand that ... do you know that anything you say during this time maybe
taken against you?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Never
mind, if it will be taken against me, but I will do so to tell the truth.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Does
the Court understand that you waived the right granted to you by our
constitution under our <span style="">law </span>and
not incrimi­nating yourself?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(sic)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
I will do, sir, is only to tell the truth.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now,
were you promised any reward or money by the Fiscal for the act which you are
about to do?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No,
your Honor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So,
you are aware of the consequences of what will happen to you if you testify and
notwithstanding that you assure this Court that you are waiving your right not
to testify against yourself?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
will just tell the truth, sir." (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>. January
13, 1965, pp. 96-98)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">No more express waiver of the right of not testifying against
oneself can be had than what <span class="SpellE">Soberano</span> had done in the
trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His statements clearly,
indicate an awareness and understanding <span style="">of
</span>the consequences of his testimony, yet, notwith­standing, he insisted as
in fact he did testify against himself and his co-accused. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Nor can it be suspected that his act of
testifying was prompted by his belief that in doing so, he would be released,
for, in his own words:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now,
when you affix your <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span> on Exhibit 1, thereof,
you understand the impression that you would be discharge from this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is that correct?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(sic)</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"COURT:</blockquote>

<blockquote>The import of the
question Mr. Fiscal is the answer of the witness that he was not promised any
reward by the Fiscal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, by this
question he want to show that he was testifying now for the pro­secution
precisely of the promise that he <span style="">will </span>be
released in this case <span style="">if you </span>file
the Motion to Dismiss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is the
point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let the witness answer. (sic)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
did not <span style="">believe </span>that I will be
discharged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, what I did was to tell
the truth." (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., January 14, 1965, p. 138)<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The subsequent retraction by <span class="SpellE">Soberano</span>
of his extra-judicial statement and his testimony in court regarding the same
cannot detract from <span style="">its </span>truth and <span class="SpellE">voluntariness</span>, considering
that <span style="">his </span>retraction came, not at
the trial -- for he affirmed the truth of the contents of his statement at the
trial but only <u>after</u> he had been convicted and sentenced, together with
some of his co-accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor was the
denial of the motion for new trial which was filed by his counsel on the ground
of the retraction by <span class="SpellE">Soberano</span> of his testimony in
court, an improvident act by the trial judge, for, time and again, it has been
held <span style="">by </span>this Court that
retraction of previous testimony is not a ground for new trial.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The testimonies of two witnesses for the prosecution fortify the
finding that the extra-judicial statement of <span class="SpellE">Soberano</span>
was voluntarily made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, Chief of
Police Alfonso Gomez testi­fied that the questions therein were asked and
answered in the <span class="SpellE">Visayan</span> dialect which <span class="SpellE">Soberano</span> speaks and understands and later on translated
into English Municipal J<span style="">u</span>dge <span class="SpellE">Hermenegildo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabreros</span> testified
that when <span class="SpellE">Soberano</span> was brought before him to
subscribe to his statement, he asked the said accused if he understood English
and upon receiving a negative reply, he read the document <span style="">in </span>the <span class="SpellE">Cebu-Visayan</span>
dialect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, he asked the
accused if he understood what were read to him and if they were correct, to
which the accused gave his affirmation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In addition, the finding of the trial court as to the earnestness and
fidelity of the prosecuting fiscal as against the accusation of the accused
that he was promised freedom by the same fiscal -- a finding which will not
ordinarily be disturbed by the appellate courts in the <span style="">absence of clear evidence to the contrary -- is determinative of the
unreliability and incredi­bility of the grounds relied upon in the motion for
new trial and retraction of his testimony by <span class="SpellE">Soberano</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Having allayed all fears as to the invo­luntariness and falsity
of <span class="SpellE">Soberano's</span> t<span style="">e</span>stimony,
we now proceed to correlate the same with the other evidence for the
prosecution.</p>

<p class="BODY">The testimony of <span class="SpellE">Soberano</span> that <span class="SpellE">Navasca</span> Marquez and <span class="SpellE">Geraldes</span> and
another person whom he could not identify were armed with a .45 cal. pistol, a <span class="SpellE">thompson</span>, a carbine and a bolo, respectively, when they
went up <span style="">into </span>the house of the
victim is corroborated by the testimony of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Josefa</span>
<span class="SpellE">Delejeros</span>, the wife of the victim and only eyewitness
to the commission of the crime, when she testified that three men armed with
"short and long articles" entered their house at about 6:00 o'clock
in the evening (exactly the same time that <span class="SpellE">Soberano</span>
said they reached the house of their intended victim) and proceeded to
accomplish their criminal scheme.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From
the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Soberano</span> and Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Delejeros</span>, the identities of the three men with "short
and long articles" have <span style="">thus been
established (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>. January 13, 1965, pp. 79-80;
110-114).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The testimony of <span class="SpellE">Soberano</span> that the
fatal weapon was a .45 cal. pistol is corroborated by Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Delejeros</span>
when she stated that the man with the "short article" fired at her
husband but the "long articles" were not used (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.
January 13, 1965, p. 112; p. 84).</p>

<p class="BODY">The ensnaring net of collective responsibi­lity was cast with the
admission of <span class="SpellE">Soberano</span> that he was armed with a
hunting knife as he stood guard outside the house of Go So while his com­panions
perpetrated the crime inside the house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Take <span style="">this together with the
testimony of the lone eyewitness -- Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Delejeros</span> --
that the three men who entered their house were armed with "short and long
articles" which <span class="SpellE">Soberano</span> himself described as a
.45 cal. pistol, a <span class="SpellE">thompson</span> and a carbine, and there
converges into sharp focus the responsibility appertaining to a band without
having to consider the statement of <span class="SpellE">Soberano</span> that one
of the men was armed with a bolo, for it suffices to establish the existence of
a band that more than three armed men take part in the commission of a crime.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence for the prosecution clearly established that the
members of the band committed the crime <span style="">of
</span>robbery on the occasion of which a homicide was committed, thus
classifying the crime as one of robbery with homicide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has also been established <span style="">that </span>the aggravating circumstance of <span style="">band attended the commission of the crime and
none of </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">members thereof attempted to prevent the
same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The state of the evidence for the
prosecu­tion being such, we now assay the defense of the accused.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The defense of all the accused is anchored <span style="">on </span><span style="">the </span>inadmissibility of the extra-judicial con­fession of <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Geraldes</span> (Exhibit
"A") and the extra-judicial admission of Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Soberano</span>
(<span class="SpellE">Exhibits"B</span>" &amp; "B-1") on the
ground that these were obtained by force and promise of freedom and hence,
involuntary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we have mentioned
earlier, it does not behoove this Court to determine the <span class="SpellE">voluntariness</span>
or involuntariness of <u><span style="">both</span></u><span style=""> </span>extra­judicial statements, it being
enough that other evidence adduced at the trial fulfill the required quantum of
evidence to convict the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Like­wise,
we have found that the extra-judicial statement of <span class="SpellE">Soberano</span>
contains the indicia of <span class="SpellE">voluntariness</span> and his
testimony in the court as prosecution witness negates the suspicion of a
promise of freedom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Woven together with
the other evidence of the prosecution, the pattern for the crime has thus been
formed, and the claim of <span class="SpellE">Soberano</span> as to the
involuntariness of his admission as well as that of his testimony must fall.</p>

<p class="BODY">The crime established by the evidence for the prosecution is
robbery with homicide attended by the aggravating circumstance of band.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case of <u>People vs. <span class="SpellE">Apduhan</span></u><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>,
we held that if the crime of <span style="">robbery
with </span>homicide is committed by a band, the indictable offense would still
be robbery with homicide with the aggravating circums­tance of band and not
robbery in band with homicide.</p>

<p class="BODY">The penalty for the crime of robbery with homicide is <u><span style="">reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span></span></u><span style=""> </span>to death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The crime having been committed by a band,
all the members thereof are liable for each of the assaults committed,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
unless any one of them attempted to prevent their commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No evidence was adduced by any of the accused
that he had attempted to prevent the commission of the crime, hence all must be
held liable for the crime of robbery with homicide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There being one aggravating circumstance and
no mitigating circumstance to offset the same in the case of <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Geraldes</span> and Manuel
Marquez, the penalty of death was correctly imposed on them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The act of testifying for the prosecution,
without previous discharge, by Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Soberano</span>
should be considered in his favor as a mitigating circumstance analogous to a
plea of guilty, hence there exist, in the case of Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Soberano</span>,
one mitigating circumstance and one aggravating circumstance which offset each
other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Soberano</span> was properly sentenced to <u><span style="">reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></u></p>

<p class="BODY">Considering the length of time that has elapsed from the time the
accused Tomas <span class="SpellE">Navasca</span> was committed to the National
Mental Hospital, the Director of the said hospital should now conduct a
full-blown examination of the mental state of the said accused for the purpose
of determining his mental capacity to stand trial, and thereafter submit the
proper report and recommendations to this Court.</p>
