Compensation Commission in RO9-WC Case No. 172-75 entitled "<span class="SpellE">Amparo</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Jacoba</span>, Claimant,
versus, Republic of the Philippines (Bureau of Public Schools),
Respondent" reducing the award for reimbursement of medical expenses from
P1,999.66 to only P596.30.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner is a public school teacher stationed at <span class="SpellE">Siasi</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sulu</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the course of her employment, she contracted
an illness allegedly caused by her work as teacher.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By reason of her illness, petitioner was
confined in the hospital during vacation time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, there was no interruption in her actual teaching job during the
regular school year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was able to
continue teaching.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to the report of the Division Committee on Workmen's
Compensation cases of the Bureau of Public Schools, Division of <span class="SpellE">Sulu</span>, dated <st1:date year="1975" day="20" month="2">February
 20, 1975</st1:date>, the petitioner was afflicted with a work-connected
illness.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner filed a claim with the Regional Office No. 10 at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
for reimbursement of medical expenses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After hearing, said unit rendered an award dated <st1:date year="1975" day="9" month="12">December 9, 1975</st1:date> ordering the respondent, Bureau
of Public Schools, to reimburse the petitioner the amount of P1,999.66.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent appealed to the Workmen's Compensation Commission
which reduced the award to P596.30.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention of the petitioner that the decision of the Hearing
Unit of Regional Office No. 10 of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> has become final, has no
merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record shows that the
respondent, Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
(Bureau of Public Schools), seasonably filed a motion for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A copy of said motion for reconsideration was
sent by registered mail on <st1:date year="1976" day="21" month="1">January 21,
 1976</st1:date> to the petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Workmen's Compensation Commission reduced the award on the basis
of the findings of the Chief of the Evaluation Commission of said
Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no explanation,
however, why the award was reduced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is not disputed that the illness of the petitioner is compensable and she is entitled
to the reimbursement of her medical expenses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus the Workmen's Compensation Commission said:</p>

<blockquote>"We find no merit in respondent's contention because, in the
instant case, the claimant was afflicted with a work-connected illness, per
Report of the Division Committee on Workmen's Compensation cases of the Bureau
of Public Schools, Division of <span class="SpellE">Sulu</span>, dated February
20, 1975, attached to the records, and that, by virtue of her illness, she was
confined in the hospital, but only that it was during vacation time, as found
by the hearing unit, hence, there was no interruption in her actual teaching
job during the regular school year and she was able to continue teaching; thus
the finding of the hearing unit which awarded her no disability benefit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the fact remains that she incurred
medical expenses for her illness, which was medically evaluated as
afore-stated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We see, therefore, no
incompatibility to the unit's awarding her reimbursement of medical expenses
for if such expenses are incurred that becomes a reimbursable amount under the
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case of <span class="SpellE">Alatco</span>
vs. WCC, et. al., and other pertinent decisions of the Supreme Court give
support to the stand of this Commission that reimbursement of medical expenses
is allowable despite the fact that no disability compensation benefit is
granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> "<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There is a showing that the Hearing Unit of Regional Office No.
10 at <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> City awarded the amount of P1,999.66
on the basis of the evaluation of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> P. <span class="SpellE">Montecillo</span>, the Compensation Rating Officer of the herein
Unit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is also a showing that the
award was based on proper receipts presented by the petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">The award of P1,999.66 appears to be reasonable.</p>
