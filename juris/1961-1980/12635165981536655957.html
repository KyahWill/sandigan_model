				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On certiorari against the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, seeking to set aside the order of the respondent <span style="">Judge decreeing </span>the immediate arrest
of herein peti­<span style="">tioner, <span class="SpellE">Isidoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Geverola</span>, </span>and the
confiscation of the bail posted by him, for his failure to appear at the trial
of the criminal case for <span class="SpellE">Malversation</span> through <span style="">Fal</span>sification of Public Documents
filed against the <span style="">said </span>petitioner,
before the Court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Herein petitioner, <span class="SpellE">Isidoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Geverola</span>, is accused of <span class="SpellE">Malversation</span>
<span style="">through Falsification </span>of Public
Documents, in criminal case <span style="">No. 8219, </span>before
the Court of <span style="">First Instance of </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Davao</span></span><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
was </span><span style="">previously released
provisionally upon a bail of P32<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon arraignment, he interposed the plea of
not guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial of the case was
set for the first time on August 23, 24 and 25, 1965.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On the morning of August
23, 1965, the first day of the scheduled date of hearing of the case, Atty.
Primo L. <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> appeared before the court in
representation of the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In open
court, said counsel orally moved for postponement of the hearing of the case,
on the ground that the accused w</span><span style="">as
</span><span style="">ill on influenza with chronic
cough, and was physically incapable of appearing at the trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A medical certificate issued by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cla­veria</span>, municipal
health officer of the town, duly sworn to before Enrique de <span class="SpellE">los</span>
Santos, municipal judge of <span class="SpellE">Ma­lita</span>, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, was submitted in support of the motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The medical certificate states that <span class="SpellE">Isidoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Geverola</span> was under </span><span style="">his </span><span style="">treatment since </span><st1:date year="1965" day="20" month="8"><span style="">August 20, 1965</span></st1:date><span style="">, of Influenza, with Chronic Cough, and the
patient is a </span><span style="">resi­</span><span style="">dent of <span class="SpellE">Liquiab</span>, <span class="SpellE">Malita</span>, </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE"><span style="">Davao</span></span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Annex A - motion.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Respondents do not
dispute the allegations in the petition that the distance between <span class="SpellE">Malita</span> (where peti­tioner resides) and <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
City (where the court holds its session) is 125 kilometers of rough road.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Acting upon but without
resolving the defense motion for postponement, without objection on the part of
the fiscal, an order was dictated in open court, as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"We will order the arrest of the accused and forfeiture of the
bond and we will have a hearing of your motion with the doctor
testifying." <span class="GramE">(T.S.N. p. 3, Exhibit A, petition.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">No hearing of the case </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">held that morning, neither on the merits nor to receive the testimony
of the doctor, for the reason that neither the accused nor the doctor was
present in court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Thereafter, a written
order was issued, dated </span><st1:date year="1965" day="23" month="8"><span style="">August 23, 1965</span></st1:date><span style="">, which was served on counsel of the accused
the next day, </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"For failure of the defendant <span class="SpellE">Isidoro</span>
<span class="SpellE">Geverola</span> to appear this morning for trial despite
notice to bondsmen, the bond filed herein for his temporary liberty is hereby
declared forfeited and the said bondsmen are given thirty (30) days from today
within which to produce the body of the accused and to explain why final
judgment should not be rendered against the bond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Moreover, the immediate arrest of the
accused is hereby directed.</u>" (Annex B, petition.) [Underscoring
supplied.]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1965" day="25" month="8"><span style="">August
 25, 1965</span></st1:date><span style="">, the
accused, through counsel, filed </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">motion
for reconsideration of the order, alleging among other matters:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> if
the motion for postponement, supported as it is by a medical certificate duly
sworn to before a municipal judge, the truth, of which was not traversed by the
fiscal, <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">had
been found spurious or that the illness of the accused is determined to be of
such a nature as not to prevent him from <span class="SpellE">travelling</span>
over 125 kilometers of rough roads in order to attend trial -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">“x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>and the court had passed upon the motion,
and denied <span style="">it, </span>x <span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="GramE"><span style="">the</span></span><span style=""> order of </span><st1:date year="1965" day="25" month="8"><span style="">August
 25, 1965</span></st1:date><span style="">, would have
been beyond question.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The motion for
reconsideration was denied in an or­der dated </span><st1:date year="1965" day="28" month="8"><span style="">August 28, 1965</span></st1:date><span style="">, as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Since no action on the oral motion for postponement has been
taken because the Court will hear the same or the oral testimony of the doctor
and since the accused failed to appear on the day set <span style="">for <span style="">trial, </span>the order of
forfeiture, and his arrest was well taken.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Had the counsel for the accused press­ed the court to resolve his
motion, the same would have been denied be­cause the medical certificate which is
the basis thereof does not com</span>ply with the requirements prescribed by
the Rules of Court."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Hence, the instant
petition for certiorari.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In retrospect, upon the
foregoing facts which are not disputed, it is evident that without passing on
the merits of the motion for postponement, the respondent judge ordered the
arrest of the accused, and the con­fiscation of the bail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Significantly, however, having realized the
necessity of a prior resolution of the mo­tion for postponement, the respondent
judge tried to justify the order of immediate arrest of the accused and the
confiscation of the bail by declaring in his be­lated order of August 28 -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
</span><span class="SpellE">x</span><span style=""> </span><span class="GramE">Had</span> the counsel for the accused pressed the Court to resolve
his motion, the same would have been denied x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Be that as it may, however, the last order could hardly <span style="">be a </span>justification for the improvident
issuance of the order of arrest and confiscation of the bail, be­cause the
transfer of the hearing of the motion for postponement and consequent deferment
of a resolution thereon should preclude and legally bar any further pro<span style="">ceedings, especially when the order of arrest
and forfeiture of the bail was premised on the inability of the accused to
appear at the trial.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Section 2, Rule 119 of </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">R</span><span style="">ules of Court</span><span style=""> provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The court on<span style=""> </span>the
application of either party or on<span style=""> its
own motion may </span><span style="">in its discretion
for good cause postpone one the trial of the </span><span style="">case </span><span style="">for such</span><span style=""> period</span><span style=""> of </span><span style="">time as the ends of justice </span><span style="">and the </span><span style="">rig</span><span style="">h</span><span style="">t of the defendant to a
speedy trial require."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is a settled principle
that the granting or denial of </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">motion
for postponement rests, as </span><span style="">a general rule, </span><span style="">upon the discretion of the court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But this doctrine should not b taken to mean absolute authority, it
being qualified in </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">sense that the discretion to be </span><span style="">exercised </span><span style="">must be sound end reasonable, not arbitrary
or capricious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the trial of cases
with reasonable dispatch is as much the concern of the judges as of the
parties, for that is conducive to the attainment of justice, </span><span style="">however, consid</span><span style="">ering that in the present case, the
postponement sought was the first to be asked by the accused; </span><span style="">the illness of the
accused was seemingly serious, requiring rest </span><span style="">on the part of the patient; the distance from <span class="SpellE">Malita</span>,
where the accused was confined, to <span class="SpellE">D<span style="">avao</span></span></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">City is more </span><span style="">than 125 kilometers; there was no objection
to the postponement on the part of </span><span style="">the
fiscal; the medical certificate was sworn to before a municipal judge and the
truth of the </span><span style="">certifica­</span><span style="">tion </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">not </span><span style="">traversed </span><span style="">by the fiscal, under these circumstances</span><span style="">, </span><span style="">it would have been the better course of </span><span style="">prud­ence to give</span><span style=""> the defense a reasonable opportunity to </span><span style="">present the </span><span style="">doctor </span><span style="">to testify on his </span><span style="">medical certificate, even if that course of
action would involve a delay of </span><span style="">the trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">For the court which is the </span><span style="">guardian of the
rights </span><span style="">of the accused as well as
those of the people </span><span style="">at </span><span style="">large </span><span style="">should not, </span><span style="">for light-cause, jeopardize the rights or interest of </span><span style="">both the accused and the <span class="SpellE">jural</span>
society.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The fact </span><span style="">that the notice for
</span><span style="">postponement was made orally in
open court on the morning of the scheduled date of trial, without previous </span><span style="">notice </span><span style="">to the fiscal, is not </span><span style="">inexcusable
negligence, considering the peculiar circumstance obtaining in the case, that
the accused appears to have been stricken with "influenza with chronic </span><span style="">cough", on </span><span style="">August 20, a
contingency or accident which </span><span style="">could
</span><span style="">not be
anticipated or foreseen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As counsel for
petitioner states </span><span style="">in his
memorandum -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"August 21 and 22 was a Saturday and Sunday, respectively, and
it was only on August 22 when he was informed of the sickness of client.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even if he had wanted to, he could not have
filed an oppor­tune motion before August 23, be­cause the preceding day was a
Sun­day."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">What <span style="">has </span>rendered
less excusable the issuance of the orders complained <span class="GramE">of,</span>
is the fact that without ruling on the motion for postponement, the accused was
<span style="">immediately </span>ordered
<span style="">arrested </span>and
his bail confiscated.</p>

<blockquote>"In perusing the records of this case, we noted that the
attorney de officio in the court <span class="GramE">below,</span> prayed and
insisted for the postponement of the trial which was scheduled to take place on
the very morning in which he was notified of his appoint­ment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>WITHOUT RULING ON THE <span style="">PETI</span>TION FOR POSTPONEMENT, <span style="">WHICH WAS </span><span style="">ITS DUTY TO DO, THE </span><st1:street><st1:address><span style="">LOWER COURT</span></st1:address></st1:street><span style=""> PRO</span><span style="">CEEDED WITH THE TRIAL." (People </span><span style="">vs. <span class="SpellE">Labra</span>, </span><span style="">81 Phil. 394.)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The evident philosophy
underlying the necessity of a prior resolution of the motion for postponement
is to afford the <span class="SpellE">movant</span> ample opportunity to seek and
avail of such r</span><span style="">emedies as </span><span style="">may be proper
under the </span><span style="">premises, </span><span style="">for, </span><span style="">it </span><span style="">cannot be disputed that there </span><span style="">are legal remedies un­</span><span style="">der the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such an opportunity is an integral part of
the due process and </span><span style="">its </span><span style="">denial constitutes </span>a
<span style="">violation of a constitutional </span><span style="">right of the accused.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"Although litigants
are not justif</span>ied in taking for granted that their motions would be
granted, THE COURTS ARE BOUND TO ACT - in proper cases - <span style="">ON ALL MOTIONS WITH SUFFICIENT DIS­PATCH
NECESSARY TO ALLOW THE PARTIES </span>TO AVAIL THEMSELVES OF PROPER
REMEDIES.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>THIS IS IMPLIED IN THE MANDATE
THAT 'JUSTICE SHALL BE IMPARTIALLY ADMINISTERED WITHOUT UNNECESSARY
DELAY.'" (<span class="SpellE">Semira</span> vs. Enriquez, <span style="">88 Phil. 228.)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Upon the foregoing
considerations, <span class="GramE">We</span> are of the opinion, and so hold,
that the respondent judge acted with gross abuse of discretion in issuing the
orders complained of.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">, </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">writ is granted, and
the orders com­plained of are set aside.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">Without costs.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
