<p class="BODY">The claimant, Leonora H. <span class="SpellE">Latuño</span>,
private respondent herein, entered the government service on July 1, 1946 as a
classroom teacher of the Bureau of Public Schools with station in <span class="SpellE">Bulan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sorsogon</span>, where she
continuously served as such until February 28, 1959; that on March 3, 1969, the
claimant was employed by the Social Security System as Clerk I; that she was subsequently
promoted to the position of supervising clerk, then to senior clerk and finally
to the position of supervisor <span style="">of the </span>Outgoing
Mails Unit of the Administrative Department of the System with a salary of
P5,540.00 per annum; that in 1967, she suffered from arthritis which became
worse in 1969; that for this reason, on June 18, 1969, the claimant wrote a
letter to the Administrator of the Social Security System asking that she be <span style="">retired due to her ailment; and that on June
1, 1969, she stopped working on account thereof.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1972" day="31" month="12">December 31, 1972</st1:date>,
Leonora H. <span class="SpellE">Latuño</span> filed a claim for disability
compensation with Regional Office No. 4 of the Department of Labor at <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Social Security System submitted on <st1:date year="1973" day="24" month="1">January 24, 1973</st1:date> its employer's
report and filed a motion for reinstatement of its right to controvert the
claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Acting Referee set the case
for hearing on the merits, and thereafter rendered a decision ordering the
Social Security System to pay the claimant the sum of P6,000.00 as disability
compensation benefits and to pay the Regional Office No. 4 the sum of P61.00 as
administrative and decision fees.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Social Security System appealed to the Workmen's Compensation
Commission which rendered its decision dated January 16, 1974 affirming the
decision of the Acting Referee and ordering the Social Security System to pay
the claimant the amount of P6,000.00 as compensation pursuant to Sections 14
and 18 of the Workmen's Compensation Act and to pay to the Workmen's Compensation
Fund the amount <span style="">of P66.00 as

<p class="BODY">The main issue is whether or not the claimant was afflicted with <span class="SpellE">Osteo</span>-Arthritis in the course of her employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is a factual issue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The finding of the Acting Referee and of the
Workmen's Compensation Commission is <span style="">that
the ailment of the private respondent supervened during her employment with the
Social Security System.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The facts, as found by
the Acting Referee, are:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"As gleaned from the evidence there is apparently no dispute
that the claimant was really afflicted with <span class="SpellE">Osteo</span>-Arthritis
in the course of her employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The medical
evidence on record sufficiently bear out the fact that on account of her
illness she has been on sick leaves many times and that she made consultations
with the GSIS General Hospital where she was diagnosed to be suffering from
Arthritis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequent examinations by
Dr. Arturo <span class="SpellE">Fajardo</span>, Resident Physician of the <st1:place><st1:placename>GSIS
  General</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>
confirmed previous diagnosis and he found the claimant to be suffering from <span class="SpellE">Osteo</span>-Arthritis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was precisely this ailment which rendered the claimant physically incapable of
performing her duties and as a result of which she applied to be retired from
the service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was the basic reason
invoked by the claimant when she wrote the administrator on <st1:date year="1969" day="28" month="5">May 28, 1969</st1:date> which was received by
the respondent on <st1:date year="1969" day="18" month="6">June 18, 1969</st1:date>
(Exhibit 'B' and 'B-1'.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We take notice of the fact that the claimant was only 45
years old when she retired from the service, at the time when she was on the
way up, as she was already a Unit Supervisor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She was compelled to leave a good paying job and she was left no choice
as her physical condition prevented her from further working with the respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The swelling and the pains of her joints were
just too much for her and the recurrent attacks caused her to be absent very
often.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be conceded that the
claimant would not have stopped working from an institution like the Social
Security System were at a time when employment was a national problem were she
not compelled by physical disability.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"There is ample evidence showing that the claimant's ailment
was causally and proximately linked to her employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dr. Arturo <span class="SpellE">Fajardo</span>,
Resident Physician of the <st1:place><st1:placename>GSIS General</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place> who has attended to the
claimant in his physician's report stated that the claimant's ailment was
aggravated by the employment (Exhibit 'C').<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He also testified that physical stress is an aggravating factor and that
the claimant was exposed to air conditioned rooms which contributed to the
pains of her arthritis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the law,
in the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary, the statements of Dr.
Arturo <span class="SpellE">Fajardo</span> in his Physician's Report are presumed
to be true and correct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dr. Arturo <span class="SpellE">Fajardo</span> strengthened this statement with his
testimony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing from the
evidence which shows that Leonora H. <span class="SpellE">Latuño</span> was
suffering from any illness particularly <span class="SpellE">Osteo</span>-Arthritis
when she entered employment with the Social Security System in 1959.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no doubt that the claimant
contracted the ailment while he was already in the active employ with the
Social Security System.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be
conceded that the claimant's duties subjected her to constant pressure, thus
subjecting to physical and mental stress.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Her duties therefore definitely contributed greatly to the acceleration
and aggravation of her ailment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact
that the claimant was afflicted with <span class="SpellE">Osteo</span>-Arthritis
in the course of her employment, the law presumes that such ailment arose out
of her employment or was at least aggravated by the nature of her duties
(Delgado Brothers, Inc., versus WCC, L-31579, November 29, 1972; Agustin vs.
WCC, L-19957, September 29, 1964).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus,
the claimant is even relieved from the burden of proving causation (<span class="SpellE">Justiniano</span> vs. WCC, L-22774, November 21, 1966)."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing findings are supported by the evidence of record.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court will not review the evidence to determine the
credibility of the witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is
no showing that the Workmen's Compensation Commission committed a grave abuse
of discretion in appreciating the evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">It has been established that the illness of Leonora H. <span class="SpellE">Latuño</span> which made her retire from the service supervened
during her employment with the Social Security System.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence there is a disputable presumption that
the claim is compensable.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
The claimant is relieved of the duty to prove causation as it is then legally
presumed that the illness arose out of the employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The burden of proof is shifte<span style="">d</span> to the employer to show that the
sickness is not compensable.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
The private respondent adduced evidence that her illness was at least
aggravated by her employment with the Social Security System.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The private respondent's duties subjected her
to constant pressure and to physical and mental stress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her employment contributed to the
acceleration and aggravation of her ailment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner has not adduced sufficient evidence to overcome
the compensability of the private respondent's illness.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention of the petitioner that the claim was filed beyond
the period prescribed by Section 24 of the Workmen's Compensation Act has no
merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is settled that the claimant's
failure to comply with Section 24 is non-jurisdictional and does not constitute
a bar to the proceedings.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Moreover, this Court has held in a number of cases that pursuant to Article
1144 (2) of the Civil Code of the Philippines, "The compensation under the
Workmen's Compensation Act is a liability vested by statute which prescribes in
ten (10) years."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision sought to be reviewed is hereby
AFFIRMED with the modification that the petitioner, Social Security System,
should pay the private respondent the amount of Six Hundred Pesos (P600.00) as
attorney's fees in addition to the disability compensation benefits of P6,000.00.</p>
