				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal from a decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, dismissing this case, with costs against the
petitioner, and lifting the writ of preliminary injunction herein issued.</p>

<p class="BODY">Acting upon a claim for compensation, under Act No. 3428, filed
by <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Abuyen</span>, on <st1:date year="1956" day="18" month="6">June 18, 1956</st1:date>, for a disease
allegedly contracted in the course of his employment, as foreman of the <span class="SpellE">Samar</span> Mining Co., Inc. - hereinafter referred to as the
petitioner -and docketed as WC Case No. R-VI-217, decision was rendered, on <st1:date year="1958" day="14" month="10">October 14, 1958</st1:date>; by <span class="SpellE">Pompeyo</span> V. Tan - an officer of Regional Office No. VI of
the Department of Labor - sentencing petitioner herein:</p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To provide
continued medical treatment and hospitalization to the claimant in accordance
with Sec­tion 13 of the Act until his tuberculosis is cured or arrested;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To pay to the
claimant a lump sum of TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE (P2, 523. 00)
PESOS and a weekly compensation of P17.40 from date hereof until he is cured or
his pulmonary tuberculosis is arrested as certified by a competent physician
but the total compensation should not exceed P4, 000.00; Payment to be made,
thru the Regional Office No. VI of the Department of Labor;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To pay to the
workmen compensation fund the amount of P26.00 as administrative costs pursuant
to Section 55 of Act 3428, as amended.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A reconsideration of said
decision having been denied, on March 24, 1960, petitioner commenced Civil Case
No. 42836 of the Court of First Instance of Manila, for a writ of certiorari
and prohibition, with preliminary injunction, against Francisco P. <span class="SpellE">Arnado</span>, as Regional Administrator of said office, <span class="SpellE">Pompeyo</span> V. Tan, as the writer, of said decision, and
claimant <span class="SpellE">Abuyen</span>, upon the ground that Tan had acted
without jurisdiction in hearing said claim and rendering deci­sion thereon, and
that <span class="SpellE">Arnado</span> had committed a grave abuse of dis­cretion
in sustaining and upholding said acts of Tan.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Sustaining respondents' objection, upon the ground of wrong venue, the
case was, however, dismissed by said court, the decision of which was, on Jun
3O, 1961, affirmed by Us.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1961" day="21" month="7">July 21, 1961</st1:date>,
petitioner commenced, against the same res­pondents in said Case No. 42836, the
present action, for certiorari and prohibition, with preliminary injunction, in
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the filing of the case, said court
issued a restraining order, which was, later, followed by a writ of prelimi­nary
injunction, upon the filing and approval of the requisite bond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After appropriate proceedings, said court
subsequently rendered the decision mentioned in the opening paragraph hereof,
dismissing the petition, upon the ground that respondent Tan had authority to
hear and pass upon the aforementioned claim of <span class="SpellE">Abuyen</span>,
and dissolving the writ of preliminary injunction issued meanwhile.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this appeal by petitioner herein, who
insists; 1) that, being merely a labor attorney, respondent Tan had no
authority to make the award complained of; 2) that as Regional Administrator,
respondent <span class="SpellE">Arnado</span> could not delegate said authority
to respondent Tan; and 3) that no such delegation of authority to him has been
made.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not disputed that respondent Tan is a labor attorney,
assigned to Regional Office No. VI of the Department of Labor, and that, as
such, he has no authority to hear claims for compensation under Act No. 3428
and to render decisions thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Based,
however, upon Plan No. 20-A, submitted to the President of the Philippines by
the Government Survey and Reorganization Commission, and Executive Order No.
218, dated December 10, 1956, particularly section 32 thereof,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
as well as on Rule 21, section 1, of the Rules of Proce­dure promulgated by the
Workmen's Compensation Commission,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
pursuant to section 12, of Article III of said Plan No. 20-A, and section 45 of
Act No. 3428, as amended by Republic Act No. 772<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
we have held, as early as August 21, 1961 -</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
that a regional office of the Department of Labor has original jurisdiction to
hear and determine claims for compensation under the Workmen's Compensation
Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If a claim is <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>,
it shall be heard and decided only by a regularly appointed hearing officer <u>or
any other employee duly designated by the Regional Administrator to act as
hearing officer</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But when the claim
is <span class="SpellE">uncontroverted</span> and there is no necessity of re­quiring
the claimant to present further evidence, 4 the Regional Administrator may
enter an award or deny the claim.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, an employer is duty bound to controvert a claim within 14
days from the date of the accident or illness of the laborer or within 10 days
after he or his-representative first acquired know­ledge of the said accident
or sickness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Failure to do so within the
period provided will result in the renun­ciation of his right to controvert the
claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But an employer may reinstate his
right to controvert the claim by filing a petition under oath specifying the
reasons for his failure to do so.“<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We have repeatedly reiterated this view,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
which is now well set­tled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case
at bar, respondents-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> contend and have
introduced evidence to the effect that Regional Administrator <span class="SpellE">Arnado</span> had by virtue of an office order, dated November 29,
1957, and marked as Exhibit 1 - designated respondent Tan - who is a duly qua­lified
Member of the Philippine Bar - "as Hearing Officer in the case of <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Abuyen</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Samar</span> Mining Co., WCC Case No. 44238 (R-V1-217)." As a
consequence, the only issue for determination is whether or not there has been
such designation in his favor.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner assails the evidence thereon upon the theory; 1) that
the lower court erred in reopening the case, after its submission for decision,
for the reception of said evidence; and 2) that the same is insufficient to
establish the designation aforementioned.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>As regards the first
alleged error, it appears that petitioners <span style="">&nbsp;</span>had asked the lower court to render judgment
on the pleadings; that, thereafter, both parties submitted their respective
memoranda; their in order to bolster up their contention, respondents attached
to their Memorandum, as Annex I, the alleged designation of respondent Tan by
Regional Administrator <span class="SpellE">Arnado</span>; that petitioner,
however, objected to the consideration of said Annex I; that, accordingly, the
lower court deemed it best to reopen the case for the introduction of
additional evidence and the determination of the admissibility in evidence of
said Annex I; and that the same was identified, marked and admit­ted as Exhibit
1 at the rehearing.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this connection, it should be noted that trial courts have
discretionary power to reopen a case either before or after rendi­tion of
judgment, for the introduction of additional evidence, so as to dispel doubts
on material points.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such power is
controlled by no other rule than that of the paramount interest of justice, and
its exercise will not be reviewed on appeal in the absence of clear abuse
thereof.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
No such abuse has been committed in the case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, the exercise of said power
by his Honor, the trial Judge, served to promote the interest of justice, by
clarifying the question whether or not respondent Tan had been given the
aforementioned designation.</p>

<p class="BODY">As a matter of fact, said Exhibit 1 merely confirmed the
allegation in respondents’ answer to the effect that respondent Tan had acted
"not as Labor Attorney but as Hearing Officer designate <u>pursuant to the
authority granted him by the previous Regional Labor Administrator to try and
hear the merits of the compensation case x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> WCC Case No. R-VI-217, <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Abuyen</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Samar</span> Mining Co., Inc.</u>"
Moreover, pursuant to the very cases cited by petitioner,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
the truth of this allegation had been deemed impliedly <u>admitted by the pe­titioner</u>,
when it submitted the case for judgment on the plea on the pleadings.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Independently of the foregoing, the second alleged error is
obviously devoid of merit, the signature of Regional Administrator <span class="SpellE">Arnado</span> on said Exhibit 1 having been identified by one of
his subordinates, who, as such, was familiar therewith.</p>

<p class="BODY">One other point must be stressed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The illness on which <span class="SpellE">Abuyen's</span> claim is based
took place in 1956.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet, - through the
present case, and Civil Case No. 42836 of the Court of First Instance of Manila
- petitioner has succeeded in prolonging the litigation, for the compen­sation
involved therein, for twelve (12) years.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What is more, peti­tioner's contention was based upon a theory that had
been rejected by this Court as early as August, 1961.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then again, the compensability of <span class="SpellE">Abuyen's</span> disability had <u>never</u> been questioned by
petitioner herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, it is manifest
that the purpose of this case, like the previous one, has been merely to delay,
a policy "often resorted to" - in the language of Mr. Justice Reyes
(J.B.L.) - "as a means of draining the resources of the poorer party"
- in this case a tuberculosis pa­tient - "and of compelling it to submit
out of sheer exhaustion."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, the conduct of petitioner's counsel is hardly compatible with the duty of
the Bar to <u>assist</u> in the Administration of Justice, not to obstruct or
defeat the same.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed,
with <span class="SpellE">trebel</span> costs, jointly and severally, against the
petitioner and its counsel, Attorney Benedict G. <span class="SpellE">Arcinas</span>,
and let certified copy of this decision be attached to the personal record of
the latter, as a Member of the Bar.</p>

the claimant, name of the employer, date of the acci­dent and the reason why
compensation is not being paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Failure
on the part of the employer or the insurance carrier to comply with this
