				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">In criminal case No.</span> Q-8711, Court of
First In­stance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City Branch, the information charged the defendants, Mario Henson, Rafael
Gonzales, Angel Mendoza, Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> <span class="SpellE">Wijangco</span>, as
principals of the murder of Jesus <span class="SpellE">Lapid</span> with the
qualifying circumstances of treachery, evident preme­ditation, and abuse of
superior strength and with the aggravating circumstances of <span class="SpellE">nocturnity</span>,
aid of armed men and craft or fraud.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
prosecution and the defense agreed that the motions for bail of the defendants
would be considered in the course of the regular trial instead of in a summary
proceeding. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>In the course of the regular
trial, after the prosecution had presented eight witnesses, the trial court
resolved the motions for bail granting the same despite the objection of the
prosecution on the ground that it still had ma­terial witnesses to present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The orders granting bail in the amount of
P50,000.00 for each defendant on the ground that the evidence of guilt was not
strong must have made Fiscal Oscar <span class="SpellE">Inocentes</span> very
angry because in his motion for reconsideration of the orders granting bail he
used contumacious language for which he was forthwith cited for contempt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Fortunately,
after the Fiscal had submitted his answer and explanation, the trial judge, in </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">forgiving mood, did not punish him for contempt on condition that the
contumacious words <span class="GramE">be</span> deleted from his motion for
reconsideration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The question presented before us <span style="">is, </span>whether the prosecution was deprived of procedural due
process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The answer is in the
affirmative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We <span style="">are </span>of the considered opinion that whether the motion for bail
of <span style="">a </span>defendant who <span style="">is in </span>custody for <span style="">a capital </span>offense be resolved in a
summary proceeding <span style="">or in </span>the
course of a regular trial, the prosecution must be given an op­portunity to
present, within a reasonable time, all the evidence that it may desire to
introduce before the court should resolve the motion for bail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If, as in the criminal case involved in the
instant special civil action, the prosecution should be denied such an
opportunity, there would be a violation of proce­dural due process, and the
order of the court granting bail should be considered void on that ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The orders complained of dated October 7, <span style="">9 </span>and 12, 1968, having been issued in
violation of procedural due pro­cess, must be considered null and void.</p>

<p class="BODY">The court's discretion to grant bail in capital offenses must be
exercised in the light of a summary of the evidence presented by the <span style="">prosecution; other­wise, it </span>would be
uncontrolled and might be capricious or whimsical.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the court's order granting or refusing
bail must contain a summary of the evidence for the prosecution followed by its
conclusion whether or not the evidence <span style="">of
</span>guilt is strong.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The orders of
October 7, <span style="">9 </span>and 12, <span style="">1968, </span>granting bail to the five
defendants are defective in form and substance because they do not contain a summary
of the evidence presented by the prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They only contain the court's conclusion that the evidence of guilt is
not strong.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Being thus defective in form
and substance, the orders complained of cannot, also on this ground, be allowed
to stand.</p>

costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
