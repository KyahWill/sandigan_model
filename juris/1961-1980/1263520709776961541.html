VS. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, RESPONDENT.
<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>DIZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal taken by the spouses Carlos Moran <span class="SpellE">Sison</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Priscila</span> F. <span class="SpellE">Sison</span> from
the resolution dated January 13, 1964 issued by the Court of Tax Appeals in its
Case No. 337, (a) granting <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> motion for
execution of the judgment rendered by this Court in G.R. L-13739, entitled
"The Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Carlos Moran <span class="SpellE">Sison</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Priscila</span> F. <span class="SpellE">Sison</span>",
and (b) denying their petition for the rendition of a decision "on the
merits" in the case first mentioned.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that on <st1:date year="1949" day="28" month="2">February
 28, 1949</st1:date>, appellants made a written assignment in favor of a
corporation named <span class="SpellE">Priscila</span> Estate, Inc. of several
real properties which Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Priscila</span> F. <span class="SpellE">Sison</span> had previously acquired by donation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The consideration therefore were 672 shares
of the capital stock of the assignee corporation, the deed of assignment
further stating that the realties were transferred at their assessed value and
that the shares of stock received by the assignors as consideration were of an
equal value.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reporting such assignment,
appellants subsequently claimed deductible losses in their Income Tax Return
for 1949.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to a Bureau of Internal Revenue rule governing transfers
of property to a corporation in exchange for shares of its capital stock,
internal revenue agents took the assignment under study and, as a result
thereof, on June 23, 1952, the Collector imposed on appellants a deficiency
income tax for 1949 in the amount of P41<span class="GramE">,101.53</span>,
holding the view that, as a result of the assignment, appellants had made a
profit of P257,380.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Contesting the
assessment, appel­lants asked for a re-investigation of the matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was granted with the result that, on <st1:date year="1956" day="13" month="10">October 13, 1956</st1:date>, an amended
assessment was issued against them only for the amount of P5<span class="GramE">,535.02</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellants not only pro­tested against this
amended assessment but they also denied the Collector's authority to make it on
the ground that the five-year period of prescription had elapsed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their protest having been overruled, appellants
took the matter to the Court of Tax Appeals where, later on, a decision was
rendered upholding their plea of prescription.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In due time the Commissioner of Internal Revenue elevated the case on
appeal to Us (G.R. L-13739).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1963</st1:date>,
<span class="GramE">We</span> reversed the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals
by holding that the right of the government to assess and collect the deficiency
income tax in question had not yet prescribed.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the record of the case had been returned below, appellants
filed a petition praying that a decision "on the merits" be rendered
in the case (C.T.A. Case No. 337).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Five
days later <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, in turn, filed a motion for the
execution of our judgment in G.R. L-13739 based on the claim that said decision
had already become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1964" day="13" month="1">January
 13, 1964</st1:date>, the Court of Tax Appeals issued a resolution denying
appellants' petition for the rendition of a deci­sion on the merits, and
granting <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> motion for execution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant’s lone assignment of error is discussed in their brief
under the following propositions:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) <span style="">that </span>our decision in G.R. L-13739
cannot be executed because it is interlocutory in nature; (b) that since the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of our decision specifies no collectible
amount, it cannot be executed; (c) that the Tax Court never lost jurisdiction
to decide the case on the merits.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants' other contention that our decision in G.R. L-13739
cannot be executed because it is interlocutory in nature and its <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part specifies no collectible amount, is
without merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Insofar as the decision referred to disposed of the issue of
prescription by reversing the order of dismissal issued by the Court of Tax
Appeals, it was obviously final in character.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It left no other substantial matter unresolved.</p>

<p class="BODY">But appellants argue that upon the remanding of the case below,
the Court of Tax Appeals was bound to set the case anew for hearing, relying
upon the fact that said court did not pass upon the question of correctness of
the deficiency tax assessment in question when it issued the order of dismissal
subsequently reversed by this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
also find this to be without merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not denied that in the Court of Tax Appeals appellants
questioned the validity of the deficiency tax imposed upon them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the hearing of the case the court
informed the parties that "the whole case on the question of prescription
and on the merits" was the subject of said hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The government submitted evidence to sustain
the validity of the questioned deficiency tax, while appellants refrained from
doing the same "in the meantime while waiting for the resolution" <span style="">of the court - presumably on the question of
prescription.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon one of the
judges <span class="GramE">presiding</span> the court gave ap­pellants' counsel
this warning:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It is up to you if
you want to take that chance." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
p. 9; C.T.A. Record p. 115).</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, the court dismissed the claim of </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">government on the ground that it had already pre­scribed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is clear from the foregoing that the
"chance" that appellants took was this:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that if, on appeal, the decision of the Court
of Tax Appeals was reversed - as it was in fact reversed - they would be deemed
to have waived their right to present additional evidence on the question of
the correctness of the deficiency tax.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Stated otherwise, upon reversal, they would not be entitled to have the
case set for hearing all over again in the Court of Tax Appeals in relation to
the question aforesaid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This, indeed,
must be the necessary consequence of their refusal or failure to present
additional evidence during the original hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The practice of the courts is to try a case
as a whole and not piece by piece, in order to avoid unnecessary delays.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In relation to the claim that the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
part of our decision in G.R. L-13739 specifies no collectible amount, the
following are pertinent considerations.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 14 of Rep. Act 1125 which speaks of the "Effect of
decision that tax is barred by Statute of Limitations," provides that <u><span style="">if</span></u><span style=""> </span>the decision of the court is that the tax <u>is barred</u> said
decision "shall be considered as its decision that there is no deficiency
in respect of such tax." Such being <span style="">the
</span>rule the contrary must likewise be true, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that if the decision of the court is that the
tax <u>is not barred</u>, such decision must be understood in the sense that
there is deficiency in respect of such tax.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In line with this, when in G.R. L-13739 We overruled therein <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> claim for damages, <span class="GramE">We</span>
did so "not only because they took no appeal from the decision presently
under review, <u>but also because </u><u><span style="">the
</span>collectors' actuation is herein sustained</u>." Underlines
supplied; Commissioner <span class="GramE">etc</span>. vs. <span class="SpellE">Sison</span>,
7 SCRA pp. 884, 886).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The collectors'
contention involved in that case was precisely that herein petitioners were
liable for a deficiency tax in the amount of P5<span class="GramE">,535.02</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>PREMISES CONSIDERED</b>, the resolution appealed from is
affirmed, with costs.</p>
