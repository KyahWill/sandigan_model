review on certiorari of a decision of the Court of Appeals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">Petitioner Leonardo C. Gutierrez
is the provincial treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His co-petitioners are the provincial
governor, the provincial board and the provincial government of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Up to the
end of February, 1960, respondent, Silvestre D. <span class="SpellE">Florindo</span>,
was a regular and permanent market administrator and deputy in the office of said
provincial treasurer, with a compensation of P3<span class="GramE">,300</span>
per annum.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; letter-spacing: 0pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;"> On the 25th of said month, the provincial board
passed Resolution No. 545 creating, in the office of the provincial governor, a
finance division under a "budget officer and fiscal analyst", with a
compensation of P7,200 per annum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Florindo</span> was appointed to <span class="GramE">said</span>
position and assumed office, on </span><st1:date year="1960" day="1" month="3"><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">March 1, 1960</span></st1:date><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Subsequently, or on </span><st1:date year="1960" day="28" month="6"><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">June 28, 1960</span></st1:date><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">, the board approved Resolution No. 1785, chang­ing
the name of said position from "budget officer and fiscal analyst" to
"budget and fiscal officer", and prescribing the duties thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1960" day="6" month="12"><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">December 6, 1960</span></st1:date><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">, the provincial governor issued, in favor of <span class="SpellE">Florindo</span>, an appointment as such budget and fiscal officer,
with a compensation of P6<span class="GramE">,000</span> per annum, effective </span><st1:date year="1960" day="1" month="3"><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">March 1, 1960</span></st1:date><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This last
appointment superseded his immediately preceding appointment</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; letter-spacing: 0pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;"> and was approved by the Commissioner of the Civil
Service, subject to availability of funds.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">Despite the higher compensation
attached to said position as created and under the aforementioned appointment,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; letter-spacing: 0pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;"> <span class="SpellE">Florindo</span> received, from </span><st1:date year="1960" day="1" month="3"><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">March 1,</span><b><span style="font-size: 23pt; letter-spacing: 0pt;"> </span></b><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">1960</span></st1:date><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;"> to </span><st1:date year="1962" day="30" month="4"><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">April 30, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">, the salary of P275 a month, corresponding to his
former position as market administrator and deputy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">It appears that, prior to the
date last mentioned, or on Aug­ust 21, 1961, <span class="SpellE">Florindo</span>
filed, with the provincial treasurer, a formal claim for his salary
differential, which was denied by the later, upon the ground that "there
was no fund available for that pur­pose" and that there was "no valid
appropriation" <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Florindo</span> appealed
from this ruling to the Office of the President, but nothing came out of it, in
view of which, on April 16, 1962, <span class="SpellE">Florindo</span> commenced,
in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, the
present action, against the provincial treasurer, to compel him by mandamus to
certify and make available the funds necessary to cover <span class="SpellE">Florindo's</span>
salary differential, as well as to recover damages.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">Presently, or on April 25, 1962,
the provincial board adopted Resolution No. 872, abolishing the position of
"budget and fiscal officer" and reassigning <span class="SpellE">Florindo</span>
to his former position as market administrator and deputy, for which reason <span class="SpellE">Florindo</span> amended his petition-complaint in the case at bar,
by including therein, as respondents, the provincial governor, the provincial
board and the provincial government of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">After appropriate proceedings,
said court rendered a deci­sion dismissing the petition for mandamus, upon the
ground of failure to exhaust all administrative remedies, but nullifying said
Resolution No. 872 and declaring it without force and effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Florindo's</span> motion
for reconsideration of said decision having been denied, he appealed to the
Court of Appeals, which, in due course, rendered a decision promulgated on
January 22, 1966 - affirming the nullification of said Resolution No. 872, but
reversing the decision appealed from insofar as it dismissed the petition for
mandamus, and ordering Leonardo C. Gutierrez, in his official capacity as
provincial treasurer, to cause <span class="SpellE">Florindo’s</span> differential
salary to be paid, at the rate of P6,000 a year, effective March 1, 1960, as
well as sentencing Gutierrez, in his private Capacity, to indemnify <span class="SpellE">Florindo</span> in the sums of P3,000, by way of moral damages,
and P2,000, as attorney's fees, costs and other expenses of litigation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">Respondents in the lower court,
petitioners herein, filed a motion for reconsideration, and soon later, a
supplemental motion for reconsideration, both of which were denied by the Court
of Appeals, on </span><st1:date year="1966" day="22" month="3"><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">March 22, 1966</span></st1:date><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon a second
motion for reconsideration, filed by Gutierrez, in his private capacity, on </span><st1:date year="1966" day="23" month="4"><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">April 23, 1966</span></st1:date><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">, said Court modified its decision of </span><st1:date year="1966" day="22" month="1"><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">January 22,
 1966</span></st1:date><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">, by eliminating <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> the awards for damages and attorney's fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon thereafter, or on </span><st1:date year="1966" day="29" month="4"><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">April 29, 1966</span></st1:date><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">, the Solicitor General filed the present petition
for review of said decision of the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Florindo</span> maintains,
however, that said petition should be dismissed because it had been filed out
of time, apart from being without merit and merely dilatory in character.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">The record shows that notice of
the decision of the Court of Appeals, dated January 22, 1966, was received by
petitioners here­in on February 1, 1966; that on February 15, they moved to
reconsider said decision; that notice of the resolution of said Court denying
the motion for reconsideration was served upon them on March 24, 1966; that
petitioners had fifteen (15) days from this date, or up to April 8, 1966,
inclusive, to file with this Court their petition for review of said decision;
and that they did not do so until April 29, 1966.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Florindo</span> concludes,
therefore, that said petition was 21 days <u>late</u>.</span><span style="font-size: 5pt; letter-spacing: 0pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">Upon the other hand, petitioners
herein allege that, on March 25, 1966,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; letter-spacing: 0pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;"> Gutierrez had filed a motion for extension of time
and for leave to file a second motion for reconsideration, which was granted;
that, thereupon, Gutierrez filed said second motion for reconsideration, which
was likewise, granted on April 23, 1966; that the <span class="SpellE">regIementary</span>
period to petition the Supreme Court for a review on certiorari of the decision
of the Court of Appeals, should begin to run from notice of the resolution of
said Court of April 23,1966</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; letter-spacing: 0pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and that
the petition filed with the Supreme Court, on April 29, 1966, was well within
said period.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">The <span class="SpellE">reliefs</span>
granted to <span class="SpellE">Florindo</span> in the original decision of the
Court of Appeals, promulgated on </span><st1:date year="1966" day="22" month="1"><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">January 22, 1966</span></st1:date><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">, were: (1) the annulment of Resolution No. 872; (2)
the payment of salary differential; and (3) moral damages and attorney's
fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the amended petition and
complaint filed by <span class="SpellE">Florindo</span> with the trial court, the
first remedy was the object of his third cause of action against the provincial
governor, the provincial board and the provincial government of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>; the second was prayed for under his first cause
of action against Gutierrez, in his <u>official</u> capacity as provincial
treasurer; and the third was sought, under <span class="SpellE">Florindo's</span>
second cause of action, against Gutierrez, in his <u>private</u> capacity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">It should be noted, also, that
the first and second remedies are <u>not</u> dependent upon the third; that the
motion of Gutierrez for extension of time and for leave to file a second motion
for reconsideration explicitly alleged that the same would "<u>only</u>
touch on the portion of the judgment which makes him <u>personally</u> liable
for moral damages and attorney's fees, in his <u>private</u> capacity;"
and that said second motion for reconsideration, likewise, stated that he filed
it "in his <u>private</u> capacity" and limited itself to urging the
elimination of said personal liability for "moral damages" and
"attorney's fees".<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">Inasmuch as the <u>official</u>
liability of petitioners herein for the first two (2) remedies aforementioned
does not spring or arise from and is <u>not</u> dependent upon the <u>personal</u>
liability of Gutierrez, for moral damages and attorney's fees, under the
original decision of the Court of Appeals, and the second motion for
reconsideration of Gutierrez was filed by him <u>alone</u> and in his <u>private</u>
capacity, it follows that said motion did <u>not</u> inure to <u>his</u>
benefit, in his <u>official</u> capacity, let alone to that of his
co-respondents in the lower court and co-petitioners herein, in their official
capacity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither did it have the effect
of suspending the running of the <span class="SpellE">regIementary</span> period
to seek a review on certiorari of the decision of the Court of Appeals, insofar
as the pronouncements therein made other than said moral damages and attorney's
fees are concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in <span class="SpellE">Facundo</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Pabalan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Ulep</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Carbonnel</span></span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; letter-spacing: 0pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">, we held that where "the decision x <span class="SpellE">x</span> although only one, contains separate and independent
findings for each of the parties and makes distinct and independent rulings for
each of them," the appeal by one of such parties "cannot be an
obstacle to the execution of the decision" insofar as the other party is
concerned.</span><span style="font-size: 7pt; letter-spacing: 0pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">Considering, moreover, that
Gutierrez, in his <u>official</u> capacity, and his co-petitioners herein, had
not moved to suspend the running of said period, pending resolution of the
second motion for reconsideration filed by him, in, his <u>private</u>
capacity, it is clear that the decision of the Court of Appeals, as regards the
annulment of Resolution No. 872 and <span class="SpellE">Florindo's</span> right
to collect his differential pay, became final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
on April 9, 1966, and that the pe­tition for review herein was filed too late.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">Petitioners herein allege that
they had to wait for the resolu­tion of the aforementioned second motion for
reconsideration of Gutierrez, in his private capacity, before filing their
petition for review on certiorari, because, if the same were granted, it would
be "necessary for this Court to order the Court of Appeals to certify x <span class="SpellE">x</span> to this (Supreme) Court the entire record of the
case." This argument is based upon an erroneous premise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In petitions for review on certiorari, like
the one under consideration, the records of the lower court are <u>not</u>
certified to the Supreme Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact,
the records of the Court of Appeals, in connection with the case at bar, have
not been forwarded to us.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">It may not be amiss to point out
that "a party may" - in the language of Section 1 of Rule 45 of the
Rules of Court - "appeal by certiorari, from a judgment of the Court of
Appeals," by filing with the Supreme Court a petition for certiorari,
"within fifteen (15) days from notice of judgment or of the <u>denial</u>
of <u>his</u> motion for reconsideration filed in due time x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>." The motion for
reconsideration of <u>petitioners herein</u> - including Gutierrez in his <u>official</u>
capacity - was <u>denied</u> on </span><st1:date year="1966" day="22" month="3"><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">March 22, 1966</span></st1:date><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">, and notice thereof was received by them on </span><st1:date year="1966" day="24" month="3"><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">March 24, 1966</span></st1:date><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their
fifteen (15) days to appeal by cer­tiorari began to run, therefore, from <u>this</u>
date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should not be computed from
April 23, 1966, when the Court of Appeals acted on the <u>second</u> motion for
reconsideration: (a) because the same was filed, <u>not</u> by petitioners
herein, but, by Gutierrez, in his <u>private</u> capacity, who <u>as such</u>,
is <u>not</u> of petitioner herein; and (b) because the resolution of the Court
of Appeals of April 23, 1966, did <u>not deny</u> any motion for
reconsideration, but, instead <u>granted</u> the second motion for
reconsideration of Gutierrez, in his <u>private</u> capacity.</span><span style="font-size: 7pt; letter-spacing: 0pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">We have repeatedly held that the
provisions of the law and the rules concerning the manner and period of appeal
are mandatory and jurisdictional requirements essential to enable the appellate</span><span style="font-size: 5pt; letter-spacing: 0pt;"> </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: 0pt;">court to take cognizance of the appeal.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; letter-spacing: 0pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: 0pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">At any rate, the present appeal
is devoid of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, petitioners
insist that <span class="SpellE">Florindo</span> has no cause of action, he
having failed to appeal from the decision of the provincial board to the
Secretary of Finance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Florindo</span>, however, <u>did</u> appeal to the President, who
referred the matter to the Secretary of finance, but the latter did not act
thereon, despite <span class="SpellE">Florindo's</span> follow-up letters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, the issues posed in this case are
purely</span><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: 0pt;"> legal in nature</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; letter-spacing: 0pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: 0pt;">, </span><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">and the action complained of by <span class="SpellE">Florindo</span> - his
removal by Resolution No. 872 as budget and fiscal officer - is patently
illegal, arbitrary and oppressive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
well-settled that, under such conditions exhaustion of administrative remedies
is not indispensable</span><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: 0pt;">.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; letter-spacing: 0pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: 0pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">It is next urged that the
creation, by the provincial board, of the position of budget and fiscal officer
was <u>ultra</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>vires</u></span> and illegal, because
the functions of said officer conflict with those of the pro­vincial
treasurer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This argument has no factual
basis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 2089 of the Revised
Administrative Code provides that the provincial treasurer shall:</span><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: 0pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>(a) "<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Advice the provincial
board, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> the provincial x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
officers, and the national officers concerned x <span class="SpellE">x</span> on
all matters relative to the public finance and the acquisition and alienation
of property of the Government."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>(b) "Collect the taxes x <span class="SpellE">x</span> and other
revenues authorized by law."</blockquote>

<blockquote>(c) "Have the custody and supervision of all provincial funds
and property, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> and, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> assign rooms to provincial
officers and other public officials x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> entitled to office space in the provincial build­ing."</blockquote>

<blockquote>(d) "Have charge of the disbursement of all provincial funds
and other funds the custody of which may be entrusted to him x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</blockquote>

<blockquote>(e) "Acquire for the provincial government all necessary
supplies, material, and office equipment x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</blockquote>

<blockquote>(f) "Act as chief internal-revenue officer in the province x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</blockquote>

<blockquote>(g) "Act as public land officer x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</blockquote>

<blockquote>(h) "Act x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
as agent of the Philippine National Bank x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span class="GramE">.“</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>(<span class="SpellE">i</span>) "Inspect x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> the operation of public utilities belonging to,
leased, or operated by the provincial government or other local governments x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">Upon the other hand, as set
forth in the resolution creating the position of budget and fiscal officer, the
same shall: (1) "serve as chief fiscal adviser of the provincial
governor"; (2) "advise and consult with members of the provincial
board on budgetary, accounting and fiscal programs of the provincial
government, to promote maximum social services and economic development";
(3) "prepare estimates of revenue x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> and maintain up to date control devices of revenue and
expenditure trends"; and (4) "prepare and review provincial annual
budget, supplemental budgets and special and other budgets".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find in these duties nothing inconsistent
with those of the provincial treasurer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">Besides, not having been raised
in the trial court, the issue on the alleged illegality of the creation of the
position in question could not be taken up, for the first time, either in the
Court of Appeals or in this Court, consistently with the appellate nature of
the jurisdiction of both over the present case</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; letter-spacing: 0pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">, apart from the change of theory that such new
issue would entail</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; letter-spacing: 0pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">Petitioners argue that, having
created the position of budget and fiscal officer, the provincial board may
abolish the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The avowed abolition
of said office by the provincial board was, however, a mere subterfuge to
remove <span class="SpellE">Florindo</span> <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>,
without due process of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As stated in
Resolution No. 872, the reason <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> was that
"the position of budget and fiscal officer x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> was primarily created x <span class="SpellE">x</span> to
locate funds which are being allegedly hidden by the provincial treasurer from
the (provincial) governor and the members of the (provincial) board x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>" and that "from the
time of the creation of his position he has failed to do his job." In
fact, one of the members of the board objected to the resolution, upon the
ground that "<span class="SpellE">Florindo</span> should be heard before he
