The motion alleged that Simeon Chongco had been an employee of the former Metropolitan Water District in January 1955, occupying the position of administrative assistant with quarters at Balara, Quezon City, at a salary of P3,120.00 per annum, and continued in the employ of the National Waterworks and Sewerage Authority when he latter took over the function of the Metropolitan Water District in July 1955, until that time under the category of Chief Section of Recreation, with quarters, at P4,860.00 per annum in June 1965; that from January 1955 up to June 1965, Simeon Chongco rendered overtime, night time, Sundays and holidays and basic time services, but was not paid in full by the NWSA for such services, despite the decision of the Supreme Court in G.R.

They have been employees of the NWSA since before 1955 as evidenced by their service records (Exhs. 'B', 'D', 'F', 'H', 'J and 'I',); have worked seven (7) days a week from April 1 to June 30, 1957 as shown by their time cards (Exhs. 'A', 'C, 'F', T, and 'K 'K-l', 'K-2'); and have been continuously receiving 25% Sunday differential for more than three months prior to July 1, 1957 (tsn. pp. 15,43 &amp; 44, May 26, 1969; pp. 6-8, June 4, 1969; pp. 11 &amp; 31, June 6, 1969; p. 40, June 6, 1969; p. 10, July 25, 1969; and p. 18, September 23, 1969). It is to be noted that the petitioners exhibits proving said facts were not objected to by the NWSA as it neither refuted the testimonies of the petitioners. Under the premises, the Court holds that the petitioners are entitled to said salary adjustment."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></blockquote>The submission of the petitioner NWSA that the individual claimants in both cases are not entitled to salary increases and/or adjustments under Republic Act No. 1880 has no merit. This Court has held that:<br><blockquote>"It is evident that Republic Act 1880 does not intend to raise the wages of the employees over what they are actually receiving. Rather, its purpose is to limit the working days in a week to five days, or to 40 hours without however permitting any reduction in the weekly or daily wage of the compensation which was previously received. The question then to be determined is: what is meant by weekly or daily wage? Does the regular wage include differential payments for work on Sundays or at nights, or it the total amount received by the laborer for whatever nature or concept?<br><br>It has been held that for purposes of computing overtime compensation a regular wage includes all payments which the parties have agreed shall be received during the work week, including piece work wages, differential payments for working at undesirable times, such as at night or on Sundays and holidays, and the cost of board and lodging customarily furnished the employee (<i>Walling v. Yangermah-Reynolds Hardwook Co.,</i> 325 U. S. 419;<i> Walling v. Harischfeger Corp.,</i> 325 U. S. 427. The 'regular rate' of pay also ordinarily includes incentive bonus or profit-sharing payments made in addition to the normal basic pay (56 C. J. S., pp. 704-705), and it was also held that the higher rate for night, Sunday and holiday work is just as much a regular rate as the lower rate for daytime work. The higher rate is merely an inducement to accept employment at times which are not as desirable from a workman's standpoint (<i>International L. Ass'n v. National Terminals Corp. C. C. Wise, </i>50 F. Supp. 26, affirmed <i>CCA. Carbunao v. National Terminals Corp.,</i> 139F.2d 853).</blockquote>Respondent court, therefore, correctly included such differential pay in computing the weekly wages of those employees and laborers who worked seven days a week and were continuously receiving 25% Sunday differential for a period of three months immediately preceding the implementation of Republic Act 1880."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>As correctly stated by the Court of Industrial Relations, "the Supreme Court did not specify in its decision that only weekly salaried employees should get salary adjustments to the exclusion of monthly salaried employees for it is apparent in the decision that the 'week' was adopted by the High Court only as a convenient method of computing the salaries of the NWSA employees."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Moreover, "In case of doubt, all labor legislation x x x shall be construed in favor of the safety and decent living for the laborer."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>In L-32715, the Court of Industrial Relations did not commit a reversible error in ruling that the <i>pro forma</i> motion for reconsideration of the petitioner NWSA was filed out of time. The NWSA received a copy of the basic order in Case No. 19-IPA (6) on August 13, 1970 but filed its motion for reconsideration five days later on August 18, 1970 and its argument only on August 27, 1970. It appears that the uniform rule adhered to in IPA cases is that motions for reconsideration together with supporting arguments should be filed within four (4) days from a party's receipt of the basic order or decision.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>The petitioner NWSA was not prejudiced because its petition to review on <i>certiorari</i> the order of the Court of Industrial Relations granting the petition to extend benefit was given due course by this Court.<br><br>The assertion of the petitioner NWSA in L-32715 that, "There is no evidence in the record and neither was there evidence presented during the hearing of the case as to how the amount of P34,581.56 was arrived at as the total amount due claimants who are individual respondents herein x x x"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> is not correct. The Court of Industrial Relations explained in detail how the amount of P34,581.56 was arrived at. The pertinent portion of the basic order reads:<br><blockquote>"The next thing to consider is the amount of the claims. From the nature of the award it is obvious that the controlling factor in the determination of the amounts involved in the salary adjustment the salaries received by the petitioners in June 1957.<br><br>In the aforestated report of the Court Examiner dated March 20, 1970, it is attested that aside from their basic salaries, the petitioners were receiving temporary salary increases immediately prior to July 1, 1957, and that the said temporary increases are not included in their basic salaries appearing in their service records.<br><br>The petitioners alleged that in June 1957, the rank and file of the NWSA workers, including the petitioners herein were receiving temporary salary increases in the aggregate sum of P49.00 per month. In support thereof, the claimants point out the Court Examiner's report of March 17, 1968, in Case No. 19-IPA(4), which refers to Mr. Simeon Chongco's claim. The petitioners aver that on page 2 of said report the temporary increases of Mr. Simeon Chongco are indicated as follows: P15.00 — 1949; P20.00— 1954; P14.00 — 1956. 'Or a total of P49.00/month. The petitioners note that in the case above adverted to the existence of said temporary increases and its total amount of P49.00 were never disputed. Besides, the petitioners further alleged that the above-mentioned report of the Court Examiner was approved by this Court in its Order of February 25, 3970.<br><br>After scrutinizing the appendices of the Court Examiner's report of March 20, 1970, we are satisfied that the allegations of the petitioners, regarding their temporary increases, are substantially correct.<br><br>Appendix ' 1' is a certified true copy of Resolution No. 163, series 1949, of the M WD Board of Directors, passed on October 31, 1949, confirming payments of P1 5.00 per month temporary increase to the laborers and employees of the Metropolitan Water District, predecessor of the NWSA.<br><br>Appendix '2' is also a certified true copy of Resolution 167, series 1954, of the MWD Board of Directors adopted on October 20, 3954, authorizing among others payment of a P20.00 per month temporary increase to the monthly salaried employees of the MWD receiving below P6,000 per annum.<br><br>Appendix '3' is also a certified true copy of Resolution No. 130, series 1957, approved by the NWSA Board of Directors on February 7, 1957, authorizing among others immediate payment of a general salary and wage increases to the employees and laborers of Manila and Suburbs (MWD), at such rates as may be considered equitable.<br><br>Taking into account all documents and evidence submitted, this Court is convinced that the petitioners were receiving the amount of P49.00 as temporary increases immediately prior to July 1, 1957.<br><br>Consequently, the said amount of P49.00 plus the basic salaries of the claimants appearing in their service records should be the basis in computing their salary adjustment differentials.<br><br>Attached to the memorandum of the petitioners and marked as Annex 'A' is the mathematical computation of the claims aggregating P34,581.56. This Court is impressed with the logic and clarity of the computation; hence, the sum of P34,581.56 representing the claims of the petitioners is hereby approved."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></blockquote>It does not appear that the petitioner NWSA had pointed to any error in the computation of the private respondents employees.<br><br>The claim of movant Simeon Chongco that the cost of board and lodging should he added to the adjusted salary is supported by the decision of this Court in <i>National Waterworks and Sewerage Authority versus NWSA Consolidated Union, et al, </i>G.R. No. L-18938, August 31, 1964, the pertinent portion of which read:<br><blockquote>"It has been held that for purposes of computing overtime compensation a regular wage includes all payments which the parties have agreed shall be received during the work week, including piece work wages, differential payments for working undesirable times, such as at night or on Sundays and holidays, and the cost of board and lodging customarily furnished the employee."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></blockquote>It is clear from the foregoing that the cost of lodging or quarters should be added to the regular wage of the employee for purposes of computing his overtime compensation.<br><br>The Court of Industrial Relations filed the reasonable cost of Chongco's rental at P150.00 a month because:<br><blockquote>"The only point to be considered on the matter of correct overtime computation is the determination of the reasonable amount of the rental of the quarters furnished by NWSA to the claimant. The Auditing Examiner who was directed to compute the added overtime differential of the claimant taking into account the rental in question tentatively appraised it at P100.00 per month and in his Report correspondingly credited the movant with an additional differential of P4,015.02. Claimant Chongco opposed the Report contending that the just and reasonable cost of his quarters is no less than P150.00 per month.<br><br>On October 1, 1968 the Court made an ocular inspection of Chongco's quarters and found that the living area was 360 square meters, with one bedroom, one living room, a dining room, a kitchen and a storage area in the first floor; three bedrooms, one hall, a kitchen and a toilet-bath room in the second floor. The Court also noted its spaciousness and pleasant environment located as it was inside the compound of the Balara Filtration Plant of the NWSA surrounded by fruit bearing trees. The neighborhood was quiet and peaceful and the atmosphere clean and refreshing. Considering these factors plus the accessibility and nearness of the place to downtown Manila and the safe neighborhood was quiet and peaceful and the atmosphere clean and refreshing. Considering these factors plus the accessibility and nearness of the place to downtown Manila and the safe neighborhood, we are of the opinion that the amount of P150.00 per month would be a reasonable appraisal of the rent during the entire period of the claim, which amount should be taken into account in computing the overtime and other fringe benefits of the claimant. Consequently, the rental of P100.00 per month, tentatively adopted by this Court in its Order of February 25, 1970 to provide a convenient and easy basis of computing the additional overtime differential, is hereby set aside and the Court hereby permanently fixes the just and reasonable cost of Chongco's rental at P150.00 a month. It is significant that during the trial, respondent never made its own appraisal of the reasonable rental of the said quarters."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></blockquote>Hence, the Court of Industrial Relations fixed the amount of P6,022.53 as the added differential due Simeon Chongco.<br><br>In overruling the opposition of the National Waterworks and Sewerage Authority to the report of the examiner, the Court of Industrial Relations explained that:<br><blockquote>"In the first place, NWSA has never pointed out where the inaccuracy of the Report lies. By virtue of the Order of October 5, 1964, in the main case, both parties were given twenty (20) days to go over the Court Examiner's Report and verify its legal basis and mathematical accuracy. In the absence of any showing by an opposing party that the Report is erroneous, the same will be considered correct by this Court.<br><br>In the second place, on page 2 of the Report it is stated that the original computation of Chongco's claim, covering overtime, Saturdays, Sundays and holidays and basic time differentials, was P20,039.20. The Report also states that, of the said him, P6,022.54 corresponds to the item for 'quarters' on the basis of P150.00 rental per month. On the witness stand, Mr. Aurelio Cruz, the Court Examiner who prepared the Report, testified that the verified and check the computation of the amount of P20,039.20 and found it to be correct (tsn., pp. 6 and 18, July 3, 1970). The testimony was never discredited.<br><br>In the light of the context of the Report and the testimony of the Court Examiner, it is safe to conclude that the amount of P20,039.20 is mathematically correct. Indeed, it would be erroneous to assume that because the mathematical operation of how the sum of P20,039.20 was arrived at was not shown or embodied in the Report, the said amount is not mathematically correct.
