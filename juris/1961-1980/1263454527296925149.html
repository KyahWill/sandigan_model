				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This petition for the review of a decision of the Court of Tax
Appeals poses the legal question of whether or not a person <span style="">who </span>enters into a contract with a
sugar <span style="">cane </span>plantation to
recruit cane cutters and supervise their work <span style="">during the </span>harvest season, the contract expressly referring to
him <span style="">as a </span>"contractor"
is taxable under the National Internal Revenue <span class="GramE">Code,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">as an </span>independent contractor.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">As noted in the decision sought to be reviewed, petitioners <span class="SpellE">Balbas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Abitong</span> and <st1:city><st1:place>Valdez</st1:place></st1:city>,
on <st1:date year="1956" day="10" month="8">August 10, 1956</st1:date>,
"individually executed contracts with the <span class="SpellE">Canlubang</span>
Sugar Estate" (hereinafter referred to <span style="">as </span><span class="SpellE">Canlubang</span>), <span style="">designated </span>as Harvest Contracts, from which they earned gross
receipts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were classified as
independent contractors by the then <span style="">Commissioner
of Internal Revenue, </span>respondent Domingo, who "assessed against and
demanded from them the payment <span style="">of </span><span style="">the </span>respective sums of P5,722.95,
P4,715.90 and P6,818.70, <span style="">as </span>fixed
and percentage taxes, surcharge and compromise penalties."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Petitioners questioned the validity of such <span style="">assessments before the Court of Tax Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Commissioner was sustained,
petitioners being ordered to pay him the fixed and percentage taxes including
25% surcharges, but not the compromise penalties, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Balbas</span>, in the amount of P5,522.95, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Abitong</span>, P4,515.90 and petitioner Valdez, P6,618.70.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The decisive issue was briefly set forth in the decision of the
Court of Tax Appeals thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The
resolution of this case hinges upon the question whether petitioners are
independent contractors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If <span style="">in </span>the affirmative, as contended by
respondent, they are subject to the payment of fixed and percentage taxes in
pursuance of Sections 182 and 191 of the Tax Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, or if they are merely employees,
as is urged upon us, they are not thusly liable."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">What <span class="GramE">are
the facts</span> as found by the Court of Tax Appeals?<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Under the contracts <span style="">entered into </span>between petitioners and <span class="SpellE">Canlubang</span>, "the former are obliged to recruit <span style="">men, preferably </span>natives of the <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> provinces, to harvest the cane of<span style=""> [</span><span class="SpellE">Canlubang</span>] in accordance with the harvest schedule to be
provided by the latter which reserves the right to change the same at any
time."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
The Court then noted that the fact that a person is empowered to hire the men
who will assist him in the performance of his work "affirms his
independent status.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reference is then
made to that stipulation in the contracts that petitioners "will pay for [<span style="">their] </span><span style="">own account </span>all recruiting expenses, actual cost of
transportation of recruits and their subsistence allowance while en route <span style="">to <span class="SpellE">Canlubang</span>."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>That is another indication of the
absence of the employer-employee relationship in the opinion of the tax Court,
the reason being that it is "unusual for an employer or servant to defray
like expenses incurred by <span style="">persons he </span>hired
to assist him, in the work."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Nor did it consider <span style="">as </span>detracting
from the attribute of independence possessed by petitioners, <span style="">the contractual </span>limitation limiting
recruitment to natives of specifically named provinces and imposing the <span style="">condition "that the work </span>be done
in accordance with a harvest schedule."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
The <span style="">Circumstance that </span>the <span style="">next provision of </span>the harvest
contracts dealt with the payment of <span class="SpellE">Canlubang</span> of
services of petitioners at rates fixed per ten from which sum<span style=""> </span>the men hired would be remunerated
was for the Court <span style="">further </span>proof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It reached the same conclusion in view of the
preparation of the payrolls by petitioners to be thereafter submitted to <span class="SpellE">Canlubang</span> for verification, with payments being made by
petitioners or their duly authorized representatives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its thinking <span style="">was </span>that if the petitioners were mere employees of <span class="SpellE">Canlubang</span>, this matter would be attended to by its
accounting or clerical department.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
provisions of the harvest contracts with <span class="SpellE">Canlubang</span>
furnishing the tools, implements and other equipment for which petitioners were
named responsible and any damage thereto due to lack of proper care and
precaution being repaired or replaced at their expense, was likewise viewed by
the Court in the same light.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The obligation
incumbent on petitioners according to the harvest contracts to furnish at their
expense the necessary loading boards and the requirement that they execute
security for the performance of their undertaking and for full payment of all
advances made to them, were seized upon by the Court as reinforcing conclusion
it reached as to their status.</p>

<p class="BODY">The harvest contracts regulated the daily tonnage of the
harvested steel cane that petitioners could deliver to <span class="SpellE">Canlubang</span>,
specifying the cutting of cane in accordance with rules and instructions laid
down, violation of which would empower <span class="SpellE">Canlubang</span> to
employ other laborers to do the cutting for the account of petitioners plus 50%
penalty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They also provided for the
gathering of cane found on the ground and left unloaded within two (2) <span style="">days after </span>cutting for the account of
petitioners plus the same amount of penalty, the <span class="SpellE">nonloading</span>
by them of rotten, deceased or <span style="">decayed
cane </span>with either deduction from the amount due them based on its weight
or the obligation to sort them out at their expense, and their abiding by the
rules, regulations, orders or instructions furnished by <span class="SpellE">Canlubang</span>
for the proper harvesting of all cane.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such provisions were not considered as impairing their independent
character, the Court citing a principle in American law that stipulations that
work is to be done with instructions from the employer or as the employer may
direct do not militate against such status.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What strengthened the <span style="">tax </span>Court
further in its <span style="">firm </span>adherence to
such a conclusion were the "provisions for defraying by the contractor of
expenses and damages for violations of such rules, regulations or instructions
* * *."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Tax Appeals took into account the testimonial
evidence showing the presence of <span class="SpellE">Canlubang</span> personnel
supervising the work of petitioners and seeing to it "that the work is
done according to the rules, regulations or instructions." It did not
consider such circumstance as lessening their independent status.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor it did ignore the fact that medical
treatment was provided cane cutters by <span class="SpellE">Canlubang's</span>
own physicians in its own hospital, some of them having been paid compensation
under the Workmen’s Compensation Act.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This was not deemed conclusive "of the subservient status of
petitioners because the probative significance of these circumstances is not
sufficient to change the status of petitioners which <span style="">is </span>shown by the remainder of the evidence to be an independent
one."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><b><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></b></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, the Court of Tax Appeals held, as above referred to,
that petitioners were independent contractors taxable under the National
Internal Revenue Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From such <span style="">a </span>judgment, there was an appeal to
this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We affirm the decision of
the Court of Tax Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">No other conclusion is possible in view of the well settled
principle that this Court is bound by the finding of facts of the Court of Tax
Appeals, only questions of <span style="">law </span>being
open to it for determination.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">As </span>stated in another, decision,
"only errors of law, and not rulings on the weight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of evidence, are <span class="SpellE">reviewable</span>
by this court."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
<span class="GramE">The facts then <span style="">as
above </span>ascertained cannot be disturbed.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
In our latest decision, there <span style="">is a </span>categorical assertion that where the
question is one of fact, it <span style="">is </span>no longer <span class="SpellE">reviewable</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">With petitioners-appellants assigning <span style="">as </span>errors, the holding that they were considered independent
contractors taxable under Section 191, the Court of Tax Appeals failing to
consider the extent of the control and supervision over the plan, manner,
means, method and progress of cane harvesting and over their conduct and that of
cane cutters <span style="">as </span>well as
invoking in support of this decision only the provisions of these contracts
relative to their onerous undertaking but failing to discuss the main issue as
to who was in control and supervision of the plan, manner, means, method and progress
of cane harvesting, resulting in the <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> of
the assessments imposed on them, errors which they discussed jointly, the
emphasis being on the alleged control of <span class="SpellE">Canlubang</span>
and the extent to which petitioners could be considered independent, the
reversal of the Court of Tax Appeals is out of the <span style="">question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In </span>essence,
what petitioners seek is to have us review <span style="">factual </span>matters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As has
just been noted, the determination made by the Court of Tax Appeals on those
points should remain undisturbed.</p>

<p class="BODY">It <span style="">is </span>true as
held in one of our decisions that to determine the nature of the contract
"courts do not have or are not bound to rely upon the name or title given
it by the contracting parties, should there be a controversy as to <span style="">what </span>they really had intended to enter
into, but the way the contracting parties do or perform their respective
obligations stipulated or agreed upon may be shown and inquired into, and
should such performance conflict with the name or title given <span style="">the </span>contract <span style="">by </span>the parties, the former must prevail over the latter."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
Based on the above test, the harvest contracts entered into by petitioners as
contractors, as analyzed by the Court of Tax Appeals, <span style="">r</span><span style="">eveal </span>clearly
the extent of their independence and the <span style="">correctness
</span>of the conclusion reached.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioners were correctly <span style="">adjudged
</span>to be independent contractors.</p>
