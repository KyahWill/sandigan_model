				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Challenged in this appeal is the lower court's order dismissing
petitioners' mandamus suit to compel respondent Justice of the Peace (now
Municipal Judge) to hear and determine their complaint for unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> which said respondent refused to take cognizance
of for lack of court jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">The background facts are these:</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1960" day="5" month="2">February 5, 1960</st1:date>,
petitioners lodged with the Justice of the Peace (now Municipal) Court of <span class="SpellE">Tiaong</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>, a suit labeled
"Unlawful <span class="SpellE">Detainer</span>" against private
respondent <span class="SpellE">Paterno</span> <span class="SpellE">Chumacera</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The complaint avers that petitioners are owners of a parcel of rice-land
situate at San Isidro (<span class="SpellE">Bana</span>), <span class="SpellE">Tiaong</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>, with an area of 57,418 square meters, more or
less, evidenced by Transfer Certificate of Title 4467 of the Land Records of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> Province; that respondent, upon the other hand, is
the owner of a piece of land, described in Plan Psu-87360, which adjoins the
northwest portion of petitioners' land; that on or about June 16, 1959, in the
course of a relocation survey on petitioners’ behalf by a duly licensed private
surveyor, it was "discovered and definitely established" that <span class="SpellE">Chumacera</span> had been occupying, knowingly or unknowingly,
about 3, 000 square meters of the northwest portion of petitioners' land; that
petitioners then informed <span class="SpellE">Chumacera</span> of his unlawful
possession, asked him to vacate and turn over said portion to petitioners; that
<span class="SpellE">Chumacera</span> refused.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The prayer of the complaint was for respondent to vacate and turn over
pos­session to petitioners and pay them P1,000 a year as reasonable
compensation for the use and occupation thereof, plus attorneys' fees, expenses
of litigation, and the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1960" day="3" month="3">March 3, 1960</st1:date>,
respondent <span class="SpellE">Paterno</span> <span class="SpellE">Chumacera</span>
moved to dismiss, upon the ground that respondent court had no juris­diction to
hear the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He alleged that he
"had been in the peaceful, public, notorious occupation and possession and
in the concept of owner, either through himself or through his prede­cessor-in-interests
for a period of sixty (60) years, more or less, on the land in dispute and had
been paying the corresponding taxes <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>."
He also alleged that the land he owned, surveyed in accordance with Plan
Psu-87360, was the subject of an application for land registration under LRC
Record 574 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1960" day="21" month="3">March 21, 1960</st1:date>,
respondent Judge Juan B. <span class="SpellE">Montecillo</span>, after hearing
the parties on oral arguments on the motion to dis­miss and before trial on the
merits, dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He perfunctorily denied the motion for recon­sideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1960" day="5" month="5">May 5, 1960</st1:date>,
petitioners commenced the present petition for mandamus in the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
to compel respondent judge to hear and decide, on the merits, the case for the
possession of the disputed land of 3,000 square meters, more or less.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 2, 1964, following a pre-trial, the lower court found
that respondent judge "acted properly" and, consequently, dismissed
the mandamus petition, with costs against petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners appealed direct to this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case calls for the application of Section 1, Rule 70 of the
Rules of Court,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
which in part reads:</p>

<blockquote>"SECTION 1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Who</u> <u>may</u>
<u>institute</u> <u>proceedings</u>, <u>and</u> <u>when</u>.- Subject to the
provisions of the next succeeding section, a person deprived of the pos­session
of any land or building by force, intimida­tion, threat, strategy, or stealth,
or a landlord, vendor, vendee, or other person against whom the possession of
any land or building is unlawfully withheld after the expiration or termination
of the right to hold possession, by virtue of any contract, express or implied,
or the legal representatives or assigns of any such landlord, vendor, vendee,
or other person, may, at any time within one (1) year after such unlawful
deprivation or withholding of possession, bring an action in the proper
inferior court against the person or persons unlawfully withholding or
depriving of possession, or any person or persons claiming under them, for the
restitution of such possession, together with damages and costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Since jurisdiction of courts of limited jurisdiction - and
municipal courts are amongst them - is to be interpreted <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>strictissimi</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>Luria</u></span><u>,
</u>ours is the duty to examine whether petitioners' case fits into the legal
precept just transcribed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>First</u>. Averment there is none in the complaint that peti­tioners
were deprived of possession of the disputed land "by force, intimidation,
threat, strategy, or stealth", which would bring their case within the
definition of forcible entry.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Nor is there an allegation that respondent withholds possession of the land
"after the expiration or termination of the right to hold possession, by
virtue of any <u>contract</u>, express or implied." In fact, the complaint
itself states that <span class="SpellE">Chumacera</span> "has, <u>knowingly</u>
or <u>unknowingly</u>, been occupying and in possession of" the <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> portion of land.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is thus no way of knowing, upon the averments of the
complaint, how defendant's (respondent <span class="SpellE">Chumacera's</span>)
pos­session started or continued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
complaint, accordingly, does not show facts which would give the municipal
court of <span class="SpellE">Tiaong</span> jurisdiction to entertain this case,
either as forcible entry or unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Second</u>. Section 1 of Rule 70 aforesaid specifies a time
limit - "within one (1) year after such unlawful deprivation or withholding
of possession" - within which an action may be brought in the inferior
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The one-year period is thus to be
counted from illegality of possession.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If any meaning is to be given to the complaint, it is this: the illegal
nature of the possession in question coincided with the start of the
possession.</p>

<p class="BODY">The complaint is conspicuously silent as to the time when
defendant entered into or took possession of the land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs contented themselves by stating in
their complaint that on or about June 16, 1959, upon a relocation survey,
"it was <u>discovered</u> and definitely established that defendant has,
knowingly or unknow­ingly, been occupying and in possession of about three
thousand (3,000) square meters of the northwestern portion of plaintiffs' afore
-said parcel of land."</p>

<p class="BODY">Implicit in this averment is that defendant's occupancy in
possession dates back to a time prior to <st1:date year="1959" day="16" month="6">June 16, 1959</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Definitely when, the complaint does not tell us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That possession could well have started more
than one year before <st1:date year="1959" day="16" month="6">June 16, 1959</st1:date>,
or, for that matter, before the complaint here was filed on <st1:date year="1960" day="5" month="2">February 5, 1960</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Or, as private respondent alleged, he and his
predecessor were in possession for some 60 years prior to the time the com­plaint
was filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, respondent <span class="SpellE">Chumacera</span>, on page 11 of his brief, made a categorical
statement that in the course of oral arguments, on the motion to dismiss in the
justice of the peace court, petitioners made an <u>admission</u> that said
respondent had been in possession for more than one year prior to the
institution of the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
statement is but a repetition of paragraph 11 of respondent's answer to the
petition for mandamus in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
This in turn was a substantial reproduction of paragraph 2 of respondent's
opposition to petitioners' motion to reconsider the dismissal order of the
justice of the peace court.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Petitioners did not controvert said averment of fact.</p>

<p class="BODY">Because jurisdiction hinges on the one year period "after
such unlawful deprivation or withholding of possession" and the period of
such unlawful deprivation or withholding of possession <u>does</u> <u>not</u> <u>clearly</u>
<u>appear</u> on the face of the complaint, and, for the reason that
petitioners have admitted that private respondent was in the land for more than
one year prior to the time the com­plaint was lodged in court, this case should
be dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Third</u>. Proceedings under Rule 70 are essentially summary
in nature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are intended to provide
an expeditious means of protecting actual possession or right to possession of
property.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The present case does not fit into the summary nature of the
remedies envisioned in Rule 70.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioners and their pre­decessors have held <st1:place>Torrens</st1:place>
title to this property - since 1914.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Yet, the complaint <u>does</u> <u>not</u> <u>as</u> <u>much</u> <u>as</u>
<u>intimate</u> that plaintiffs <u>had</u> <u>ever</u> <u>been</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u>
<u>possession</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>disputed property</u>, or that
plaintiffs <u>knew</u> of the illegality of defendant's possession but merely
tolerated the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only in the
relocation survey in 1959 that they allegedly "discovered" that
defendant was - <u>knowingly</u> <u>or</u> <u>unknowingly</u> - in possession
of an alleged portion of that titled property.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Easily to be inferred from the averments of the com­plaint is that if
defendant is in possession of the portion of land in question, it is because he
either claims ownership thereof or has been usurping the land for quite
sometime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These facts, if anything,
underscore the remedy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It certainly is
not a summary action to vindicate a wrong - disturbance of possession - of
recent origin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rather, it would seem to
us that in the situation here pre­sented, a full-blown inquiry to determine who
has the better right to possession or ownership is in order.</p>

<p class="BODY">A choice of remedies is thus afforded petitioners: either <span class="SpellE"><u>accion</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>publiciana</u></span> <u>or</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>accion</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>reivindicatoria</u></span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Or, should it so happen that the property is included in respondent's Plan
Psu-87360, an opposition to the land registration proceeding.</p>

<p class="BODY">As we recently declared in one case,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
an inferior court should reject a complaint for forcible entry and <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> "right at the outset", if it is already
clear that that court has no juris­diction thereon.</p>

<p class="BODY">For the reasons given, the appealed order of the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> of <st1:date year="1964" day="2" month="10">October 2, 1964</st1:date> dismissing the petition for mandamus is
hereby affirmed.</p>
