<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date year="1961" day="29" month="8"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">August 
29, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
Saw <span class="SpellE">Cen</span>, a citizen of the Republic of China, who had 
been in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> since 1932, presented with the 
CFI of Manila, a petition for admission as Filipino citizen. The petition which 
contained the requisite jurisdictional facts and enumeration of his 
qualifications, upon which he based his application, was accompanied by the 
Joint Affidavit of Jose S. <span class="SpellE">Tanchoco</span>, Jose S. <span class="SpellE">Zuñiga</span> and Gregorio R. <span class="SpellE">Viar</span>, who 
claimed to have personal knowledge of petitioner's having resided continuously 
in the Philippines, prior to the filing of the petition; that petitioner was of 
good moral character and repute and morally irreproachable, during his stay in 
the islands, although they contend that they have known him since 1949 and 1946, 
respectively, and that he is not in any way disqualified under Sec. 4 of 
Commonwealth Act No. 473, as amended. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Under date of </span><st1:date year="1961" day="31" month="8"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">August 31, 
1961</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the 
lower Court issued an order for the publication of the petition in the Official 
Gazette and the Daily Mirror, for three consecutive weeks. After the publication 
of the petition, it appears that an opposition was presented by the office of 
the Solicitor General, although the records do not show on what grounds the 
opposition was based. After trial, or on August 2, 1962, less than a year from 
the presentation of the petition, the court <i>a quo</i> rendered judgment, the 
pertinent portions of which recite: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"* * * that before, so me of his 
children bore the family name "Tan," but during the last ten years they are 
using the family name "SAW" because previously petitioner had an <i>alias</i> 
"TAN HU CHI” and his wife gave this <i>alias</i> name when she gave birth; that 
petitioner has not been using the paid name for more than ten years because he 
knows that it is prohibited by law; that now he has boon only the name Saw <span class="SpellE">Cen</span> even in his business dealings; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">* * *. * * * * * * 
*<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">“* * *, this Court finds that 
petitioner has nil the qualifications required by, and none of the 
disqualifications specified in, Commonwealth Act No. 473, as amended by 
Commonwealth Act No. 535, and has complied with all the requisites established 
therein.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"WHEREFORE, the <i>said 
petition</i> of SAW CEN to be admitted a citizen of the 
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> is hereby granted, and let the 
proper naturalization certificate be issued in his favor and the registration 
thereof in the proper civil registry, this decision to become <span class="SpellE">executory</span> in accordance with the provisions of Section 1 of 
Republic Act No. 530."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Against the above decision, the 
instant appeal had been interposed by the Solicitor General, claiming that the 
trial court erred<span class="GramE">:—</span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">(1) <span class="GramE">in</span> 
finding that petitioner has all the qualifications and none of the 
disqualifications to become a naturalized Filipino citizen: and <br>(2) in not 
holding that the two character witnesses for the petitioner do not meet the 
requirements of the law. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">By his own admission, it is clear 
that petitioner was known by another name, an <i>alias</i> which he had been 
using for quite a number of years. So much so that even the five (5) older 
children (the first to the fifth) adopted a word in his alias (Tan) as their 
family name. The non-inclusion of the other name of petitioner in the 
publication of the petition has resulted fatal, for it has deprived any person, 
knowing him by that name, to come forward and inform the authorities of any 
matter which might affect his application for naturalization. In other words, 
the publication was incomplete and insufficient, thereby affecting the 
jurisdiction of the court to take cognizance of his petition. The unauthorized 
use of the <i>alias</i> is not at all denied by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>. In fact, he recognized the illegality of the use 
when he said that he has not been using it for more than ten (10) years (before 
the presentation of the petition) because he knew that it was prohibited by law. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Moreover, <span class="GramE">We</span> find that the character witnesses of petitioner did not 
measure to the requirements provided for by law, to be considered as "credible 
persons." In the case of <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> vs. Republic, L-10642, 
May 30, 1958, this Court stated that a credible person, for purposes of 
naturalization cases, is one as having a good standing in the community; known 
to be honest and upright; reputedly trustworthy, and reliable so that his words 
may be taken on its face value to serve as warranty of the worthiness of the 
petitioner. This must be so, because said witnesses are in a way, the insurers 
of the character of applicant (Cu vs. Rep., 89 Phil. 473). In the case at bar, 
evidence was not adduced to show that the character witnesses of petitioner had 
the above qualities, and therefore, they could not live up to the category of 
credible persons (<span class="SpellE">Sy</span> Shin vs. Rep., 107 Phil., 718). 
One thing more, <span class="GramE">We</span> find no evidence on record to show 
that petitioner has had intimate social relations with his witnesses. Witness 
<span class="SpellE">Tanchoco</span> declared that he came to know the petitioner 
because said witness was the accountant of the La <span class="SpellE">Compaña</span> Factory, the General <span class="SpellE">Fabrikoid</span> Manufacturing Company and the Atlantic Development 
Company, all of which were managed by the petitioner. The relation then was 
merely on a business level, since there is paucity of evidence to show that they 
had social relations. The lack of social relations is crystallized by the fact 
that <span class="SpellE">Tanchoco</span> did not even know the parents, 
brothel's, sisters and other matters pertaining to petitioner's social life. He 
could not, therefore, be an insurer of petitioner's worthiness. Witness <span class="SpellE">Tanchoco</span> being an employee of petitioner, his partiality is 
not far-fetched. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">PREMISES 
CONSIDERED</span></b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the 
decision of the lower court granting SAW CEN Philippine citizenship should be, 
as it is hereby reversed. Another is entered denying his petition, with costs 
against said Saw <span class="SpellE">Cen</span>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="SpellE"><i><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Bengzon</span></i></span><i><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, C.
