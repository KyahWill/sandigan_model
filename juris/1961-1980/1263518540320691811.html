CARBONELL, JAIME N. FERRER, LINO PATAJO AND CESAR MIRAFLOR, RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><STRONG>MAKASIAR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">This petition for declaratory relief
was filed pursuant to Sec. 19 of R.A. No. 6132 by petitioner Simeon G. del
Rosario against the National Treasurer as well as the Chairman and members of
the Commission on Elections, praying that the entire R.A. No. 6132 be declared
unconstitutional.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Solicitor General filed his
answer to the petition in behalf of respondents.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The petition does not contain
sufficient averments as to the particular right of the petitioner that may be
affected by any provision of the law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Assuming as true his allegation - which respondents specifically deny -
that he is a temporary staff writer of the Weekly Nation Magazine, a permanent
international Research Officer of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization since
October 5, 1957 and as such is on home leave and awaiting recall and
re-instatement to his post in Bangkok, Thailand by the Department of Foreign
Affairs, the same does not indicate that he is a prospective candidate or is a
member of any political party or any civic, religious, professional, or labor
organization whose rights may be impaired by Sec. 6(A), par. 5 and Sec. 8(a) of
R.A. No. 6132, which he challenges as oppressive.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Because he assails the
appropriation of twenty-nine million pesos in Sec. 21 of the law as simply a
waste of public funds, because there is no time limit for the duration of the
Constitutional Convention, which may dissipate its time in pointless discussion
without reaching any consensus or conclusion and thus degenerate into a
"Debating Club, Unlimited", his interest as a taxpayer on this score
to contest the validity of the law may be sustained.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The charge of petitioner
that Congress abdicated its power as a constituent body to propose amendments
in favor of the Constitutional Convention, is refuted by Art. XV of the
Constitution which authorizes Congress sitting as a Constituent Assembly either
to propose amendments or to call a convention for the purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The choice of either alternative is solely
committed to Congress, which cannot be inquired into nor interfered with by this
Tribunal, the same being purely a political question.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, whether there
is necessity for amending the Constitution is also addressed to the wise
judgment of Congress acting as a Constituent Assembly, against which the Court
cannot pit its own judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And whether the
Constitutional Convention will only propose amendments to the Constitution or
entirely overhaul the present Constitution and propose an entirely new
Constitution based on an ideology foreign to the democratic system, is of no moment;
because the same will be submitted to the people for ratification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once ratified by the sovereign people, there
can be no debate about the validity of the new Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that the present
Constitution may be revised and replaced with a new one by the Constitutional
Convention called in Resolutions Nos. 2 and 4 respectively of 1967 and 1969,
because under Sec. 6(A), par. 5, of the law, a candidate may include a concise
statement of his principal constitutional reforms, programs or policies, is no
argument against the validity of the law because "amendment" includes
the "revision" or total overhaul of the entire Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, whether the Constitution is
merely amended in part or revised or totally changed would become immaterial
the moment the same is ratified by the sovereign people.</p>

<p class="BODY">5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court, in a
decision dated <st1:date year="1970" day="11" month="9">September 11, 1970</st1:date>
in the cases of <span class="SpellE">Imbong</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span>,
et. al. and Gonzales vs. <span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span>, et. al., G.R. Nos.
L-32432 and L-32443, held that neither R.A. No. 6132 nor its Sections 2, 5 and
8(a), paragraph one, can be declared unconstitutional.</p>

<p class="BODY">6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court also
sustained the validity of Sec. 4 and the second paragraph of Sec. 8(a) of R.A.
No. 6132 in a decision dated <st1:date year="1970" day="9" month="9">September
 9, 1970</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner impugns the constitutionality
of the title of R.A. No. 6132 as embracing more than one subject and is there­fore
<span class="SpellE">violative</span> of paragraph 1, Sec. 21 of Art. VI of the
Constitution, simply because it failed to include the phrase "TO PROPOSE<span style=""> </span>AMENDMENTS TO THE CONSTITUTION OF THE
PHILIPPINES."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The title of the law reads
"An Act Implementing Resolution of Both Houses Numbered Two as Amended by
Resolution of Both Houses Numbered Four of the Congress of the Philippines
Calling for a Constitutional Convention, Providing for Proportional Repre­sentation
Therein and Other Details Relating to the Election of Delegates to and the
Holding of the Constitutional Convention, Repealing for the Purpose Republic
Act Four Thousand Nine Hundred Fourteen, and for Other Purposes."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">It is patent from the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> title that the inclusion of the phrase "To
propose</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">amendments to the Constitution of the
Philippines" is superfluous and therefore unnecessary; because the very
title expressly states that the act implements Resolutions of Both Houses Nos.
2 and 4, respectively of 1967 and 1969, and both Resolutions Nos. 2 and 4
likewise categorically state in their titles that the Constitutional Convention
called </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">f</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">or therein is "to propose amendments to the
Constitution of the Philippines", which phrase is reiterated in Sec. 1 of
both Resolutions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Moreover, the power to propose
amendments to the Con­stitution is implicit in the call for the convention
itself, whose raison <span class="SpellE">d'etre</span> is to revise the present
Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, there is no
fraud or surprise that is perpetrated by the questioned title on the
legislature and the public, which is sought to be avoided by the constitutional
requirement that only one subject shall be embraced in the bill which shall be
expressed in the title thereof.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Furthermore, it is not required
that the title of the bill be an index to the body of the act or be
comprehensive in matters of detail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is enough that it fairly indicates the general subject and reasonably covers all
the provisions of the act so as not to mislead Congress or the people.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> All the details provided for in R.A. No. 6132 are
germane to and are comprehended by its title.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="font-size: 12pt;">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, the prayer in the petition is hereby denied and R.A.
No. 6132 is not unconstitutional.<span style="">&nbsp;
