<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Crispin Vallejo appeals from a 
decision rendered in Civil Case No. 5422 of the Court of First Instance of 
Occidental <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>, sentencing him to pay to Vicente 
<span class="SpellE">Bantoto</span> and <span class="SpellE">Florita</span> <span class="SpellE">Lanceta</span>, parents of the late <span class="SpellE">Damiana</span> <span class="SpellE">Bantoto</span>, civil indemnity 
in the sum of P3<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, plus P1,000.00 exemplary 
damages and the further sum of P500.00 attorneys' fees, without pronouncement as 
to costs. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The basic facts are not <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>. Appellant Crispin Vallejo was the registered 
owner of a "<span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>" named "<span class="SpellE">Jovil</span> 11", with plate TPU-20948, that was operated by him in 
</span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Bacolod</span></span></st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> through driver Salvador <span class="SpellE">Bobis</span>. On </span><st1:date month="10" day="24" year="1948"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">24 October 
<span class="GramE">1948</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> ,</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> through the driver's negligence, 
the "<span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>" struck a 3-year old girl, <span class="SpellE">Damiana</span> <span class="SpellE">Bantoto</span>, a daughter of 
<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, inflicting serious injuries that led to her 
death a few days later. The City Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> 
filed an information charging <span class="SpellE">Bobis</span> with homicide 
through reckless imprudence, to which <span class="SpellE">Bobis</span> pleaded 
guilty. He was, accordingly, sentenced to 2 months and 1 day of <span class="SpellE">arresto</span> mayor and to indemnify the deceased girl’s heirs 
(<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> herein) in the sum of <span class="GramE">P3 
,000.00</span>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">By amended complaint of 8 October 
1959, <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> Vicente <span class="SpellE">Bantoto</span> and <span class="SpellE">Florita</span> <span class="SpellE">Lanceta</span>, for themselves and their other children, instituted 
the present action against Salvador <span class="SpellE">Bobis</span>, Juan <span class="SpellE">Maceda</span> (later absolved) and Crispin Vallejo in the court of 
first instance, pleading the foregoing facts and seeking to have the three 
defendants declared <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span> responsible for 
damages, consisting of the civil indemnity required of the driver <span class="SpellE">Bobis</span> in the judgment of conviction, plus moral and 
exemplary damages and attorneys’ fees and costs. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><st1:city><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Vallejo</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> moved to dismiss on the ground 
of failure to state a cause of action against him, for the reason that the 
amended complaint did not aver that the driver, <span class="SpellE">Bobis</span>, 
was insolvent. The court overruled the motion to dismiss, and on 20 February 
1960 Vallejo answered the complaint, setting up denials and affirmative 
defenses, specifically averring that the brothers and sisters of the deceased 
were not real parties in interest; that the complaint stated no cause of action 
against Vallejo; that his liability was only subsidiary; that the action was 
barred by prior judgment; and that the liability had been satisfied. <span class="SpellE">Bobis</span> was declared in default. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">At the trial, the court of origin 
(overruling </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Vallejo</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
’s</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
objections) admitted as Exhibit "A" for plaintiffs the writ of execution against 
the driver, Salvador <span class="SpellE">Bobis</span>, issued in the criminal 
case, and as Exhibit "B" the sheriff's return <span class="SpellE">nulla</span> 
bona. </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Vallejo</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> presented no evidence. 
Wherefore, the court absolved defendant <span class="SpellE">Maceda</span> and 
rendered judgment against Crispin Vallejo in the terms described at the start of 
this opinion. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><st1:city><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Vallejo</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> appealed directly to this 
Supreme Court, assigning three errors: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">“I-The trial Court erred in not 
dismissing the complaint for lack of a cause of action. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">II-The trial Court erred in 
admitting as evidence Exhibits "A" and "B" of the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">III-The trial Court erred in 
condemning the defendant-appellant to pay to the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> the sum of P3,000.00 as indemnity, P1,000.00 as 
moral damages, P1,000.00 as exemplary damages, and P500.00 as attorney's fee." 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The first alleged error, 
predicated upon the lack of allegation in the complaint that driver <span class="SpellE">Bobis</span> was insolvent, is without merit. The master's 
liability, under the Revised Penal Code, for the crimes committed by his 
servants and employees in the discharge of their duties, is not predicated upon 
the insolvency of the latter. Article 103 of the Penal Code prescribes that: 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"ART. 103. Subsidiary civil <span class="SpellE">liability</span> of other persons. - The subsidiary liability 
established in the next preceding article shall also apply to employees, 
teachers, persons, and corporations engaged in any kind of industry for felonies 
committed by their servants, pupils, workmen, apprentices, or employees in the 
discharge of their duties." <o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The insolvency of the servant or 
employee is nowhere mentioned in said article as a condition precedent. In 
truth, such insolvency is required only when the liability of the master is 
being made effective by execution levy, but not for the rendition of judgment 
against the master. The subsidiary character of the employer's responsibility 
merely imports that the latter’s property is not to be seized without first 
exhausting that of the servant. And by analogy to a regular guarantor (who is 
the prototype of persons <span class="SpellE">subsidiarily</span> responsible), 
the master may not demand prior exhaustion of the servant's (principal 
obligor's) properties if he can not "point out to the creditor available 
property of the debtor within Philippine territory, sufficient to cover the 
amount of the debt" (Cf. Civil Code, Article 1060). This rule is logical, for as 
between the offended party (as creditor) and the culprit's master or employer, 
it is the latter <span class="GramE">who</span> is in a better position to 
determine the resources and solvency of the servant or employee. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Appellant invokes the following 
passage in our decision in Marquez vs. Castillo, 68 Phil. 571: 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"'The subsidiary liability of the 
master, according to the provisions of Article 103 of the Revised Penal Code, 
arises and takes place only when the servant, subordinate, or employee commits a 
punishable criminal act while in the actual performance of his ordinary duties 
and service, and he is insolvent thereby rendering him incapable, of satisfying 
by himself his own civil liability." <o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The underlined passage is, 
however, mere obiter because the part immediately preceding the quotation shows 
that the ratio <span class="SpellE">decidendi</span> of the case was that the 
accident involved, unlike in the case at bar, did not occur in the performance 
of the driver's assigned duties. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"It should be noted that in said 
stipulation, there is a provision appearing in paragraph 3 thereof, which reads 
as follows: <o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">'That the defendant Bernardo 
Castillo was not riding in the car at the time of the accident, and he did not 
know that his car was taken by the chauffeur Mariano <span class="SpellE">Capulong</span>.' <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"This fact decides the question 
because it clearly shows that the accident did not occur in the course of the 
performance of the duties or service for which said chauffeur Mariano <span class="SpellE">Capulong</span> had been hired. The defendant did not hire him to 
do as he pleased, using the defendant's car as if it were his own. His duties 
and service were confined to driving his master's car as the latter ordered him, 
and the accident did not take place under said circumstances." 
<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">As to the second error assigned, 
the same is non-prejudicial, if at all committed. Supposing, in <span class="SpellE">gratia</span> <span class="SpellE">arqumenti</span>, that Exhibits 
"A" and "B", the execution and the sheriff's return, in the criminal case were 
not admissible at the trial of the case against the master, they would certainly 
be material and admissible when issuance of a writ of execution of the appealed 
judgment is demanded. It is well to note here that this Court has ruled that in 
the absence of collusion the judgment convicting and sentencing the servant to 
pay indemnity is conclusive in an action to enforce the subsidiary liability of 
the master or employer (Martinez vs. <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>, 81 Phil. 
1). Anyway, since <span class="SpellE">Bobis</span>, the driver, was also a 
defendant, the writ of execution issued in the criminal case to enforce the 
civil indemnity, and its return without satisfaction, are not irrelevant 
evidence in the action against him and his employer. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Anent the third error, we agree 
with appellant that, as the case was predicated upon the sentence of conviction 
in the criminal case, the award of exemplary damages was improper. No such 
damages were imposed on the driver, and the master, as person <span class="SpellE">subsidiarily</span> liable, can not incur greater civil liability 
than his convicted employee, any more than a guarantor can be held responsible 
for more than the principal debtor (Cf. Civil Code, Article 2064). 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">But we do not agree that the 
award of attorneys' fees should be disallowed. Appellant had reason to know that 
his driver could not pay the P3<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> indemnity 
imposed in the criminal case, because if he could, or if he had money or <span class="SpellE">leviable</span> property worth that much, <span class="SpellE">Bobis</span> would be operating his own <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> instead of another's. In fact, Article 2208, 
paragraph 9, authorizes the award of counsel fees "in a separate civil action to 
recover the civil liability arising from a crime". <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">As in awarding only P500.00 
attorneys' fees the court below could envisage only the services of counsel up 
to the date of its judgment, and it could not know then that the decision would 
be <span class="GramE">appealed,</span> we are of the opinion that counsel fees 
should now be at least doubled. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">FOR THE FOREGOING 
REASONS</span></strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
the decision under appeal is modified by eliminating the award of P1<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> exemplary damages and doubling the award for counsel 
fees, with the result that appellant shall pay the indemnity of P3,000.00, with 
interest at 6% from the filing of the complaint, plus P1,000.00 attorneys' fees. 
In all other respects, said decision is affirmed. No costs.
