				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On January 4, 1960, petitioner herein &nbsp;Elisa D. Gabriel, filed &nbsp;with &nbsp;the Register of Deeds of &nbsp;Manila, an Adverse claim, against the properties registered in &nbsp;the name &nbsp;of oppositor-appellant, Juanita R. &nbsp;Domingo, &nbsp;her sister. &nbsp;As grounds for the adverse claim, petitioner allege— <blockquote> <p>"Notwithstanding &nbsp;the registration of &nbsp;the foregoing properties in the name of Juanita &nbsp;R. Domingo, the &nbsp;same properties have been included in the amended &nbsp; inventory &nbsp;of &nbsp;the estate &nbsp;of the late Antonia Reyes Vda. &nbsp;de Domingo, filed by Elisa Domingo de Gabriel <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> as they are &nbsp;in fact &nbsp;properties acquired by the deceased during her, lifetime. &nbsp;The registration of the titles &nbsp;of &nbsp;these properties &nbsp;should have been made in &nbsp;the name of &nbsp;said Antonia &nbsp;Reyes Vda. de Domingo, but &nbsp;due &nbsp;to &nbsp;commission &nbsp;of fraud &nbsp;and &nbsp; deceit, &nbsp;by said Juanita R. Domingo, who was then living in the same house with the deceased, all the &nbsp;titles &nbsp;of the above &nbsp;stated properties were registered instead &nbsp;in &nbsp;her name, thus &nbsp;depriving &nbsp;herein adverse claimant who is &nbsp;likewise &nbsp;an heir of Antonia &nbsp;Reyes Vda. de Domingo, of her lawful rights, interests and participations over said properties."</p> </blockquote> <p>On the same date, a &nbsp;similar notice of adverse claim was presented &nbsp;by &nbsp;petitioner with the &nbsp;Register &nbsp;of &nbsp;Deeds &nbsp;of Rizal, on the properties registered in the name of &nbsp;Juanita R. &nbsp;Domingo, located &nbsp;in &nbsp;Rizal Province, &nbsp;the &nbsp;ground for which was &nbsp;stated as follows—</p> <blockquote> <p>"The foregoing properties are included &nbsp;in &nbsp;the amended inventory of the estate of their late mother Antonia Reyes &nbsp;Vda., de Domingo, who is the true owner of said &nbsp;properties, and considering that the registrations &nbsp;in &nbsp;the &nbsp;name of Juanita R. &nbsp;Domingo were only made fraudulently, thus depriving herein adverse &nbsp;claimant of her &nbsp; lawful rights, interest and &nbsp;participations over said properties."</p> </blockquote> <p>For the &nbsp;adverse &nbsp;claim &nbsp;on &nbsp;the &nbsp;Manila &nbsp;properties, Domingo presented an opposition, &nbsp;claiming that the &nbsp;adverse claim was &nbsp;instituted &nbsp;for &nbsp;(1) &nbsp;Harassment; &nbsp;(2) Had no legal &nbsp;basis; and (3) Had &nbsp;done and will do &nbsp; irreparable loss to her.</p> <p>Special Proceeding No. 2658 CFI of Rizal, still pending.</p> <p>The Register of Deeds of Manila, elevated the matter to the Land Registration Commission<span style="font-style: italic;"> en Consulta,</span> wherein he stated—</p> <blockquote> <p>"Because the undersigned is in doubt &nbsp;as to whether the &nbsp;registration of the claim is proper under the circumstances, the same is hereby submitted for &nbsp;proper determination by this Commission." Oppositor Domingo &nbsp;also asked that the &nbsp;adverse claim of Gabriel &nbsp;on &nbsp;her Rizal properties &nbsp;be denied, &nbsp;contending that same was &nbsp;presented only to embarrass &nbsp;her; that said properties &nbsp;were acquired by her pursuant to &nbsp;an extrajudicial partition in which the &nbsp;petitioner &nbsp;Gabriel and &nbsp;their mother (Antonio), &nbsp;were signatories.</p> </blockquote> <p>On &nbsp;January &nbsp;13, &nbsp;1960, &nbsp;the Register of Deeds of &nbsp;Rizal denied &nbsp;registration of &nbsp;the &nbsp;Notice &nbsp;of Adverse &nbsp;Claim, stating—</p> <blockquote> <p>"P.E. No. &nbsp;90080-NOTICE OF ADVERSE CLAIM has/have been found to be legally defective or &nbsp;otherwise not sufficient in &nbsp;law and is/are, &nbsp;therefore, hereby &nbsp; denied on &nbsp;the following &nbsp;ground: 'Where there are other &nbsp;provisions or remedies under this act, the affidavit of adverse claim is not applicable."</p> </blockquote> <p>Under date of January 21, 1960, Elisa D. Gabriel appealed the above denial to the &nbsp;Land &nbsp;Registration Commission.</p> <p>On February 17, &nbsp;1960, the &nbsp;Register of Deeds of Rizal, in his letter transmitting the case to the &nbsp;LRC, tried to justify his denial to annotate the affidavit of Adverse claim, by pointing out that such procedure was not proper, contending that &nbsp;petitioner's case does not &nbsp;come &nbsp;under &nbsp;the provisions &nbsp;of Section 110 of &nbsp;Act 496. &nbsp;&nbsp;If at all, he claims, petitioner should have availed of Section 98 thereof. On March 7, 1960, &nbsp;the LRC &nbsp;heard the two cases, and before any of the parties&nbsp; could &nbsp;file his memorandum, &nbsp;the Register of Deeds &nbsp;of Rizal, &nbsp;presented a &nbsp;Supplemental Memorandum, reiterating his stand. In his reply, &nbsp;Gabriel clarified the issue, &nbsp;stating &nbsp;that the question, at &nbsp;bar concerns the fraudulent registration by oppositor, of &nbsp;the properties &nbsp;subject of &nbsp;the Adverse Claims, and not&nbsp; their fraudulent &nbsp;<i>acquisition.</i></p> <p>The Land &nbsp;Registration Commission, on April 29, &nbsp;1960, issued a resolution, &nbsp;the pertinent portions of which &nbsp;are reproduced hereinbelow—</p> <blockquote> <p>"The only question to be resolved by &nbsp;this Commission in these related <i> consultas</i> is the registration of the two notices of adverse claim &nbsp;filed &nbsp;with the Registries of &nbsp;Manila and &nbsp;Rizal. &nbsp;Whether or not &nbsp;these adverse &nbsp;claims &nbsp;are &nbsp;valid, &nbsp;whether &nbsp;or not &nbsp;they &nbsp;are frivolous &nbsp;and &nbsp; merely intended to &nbsp;harass, and &nbsp;such &nbsp;other litigatious matters raised by &nbsp;the protagonist, are &nbsp;for a court of competent jurisdiction, and not for this Commission, &nbsp;to decide. </p> </blockquote> <p>Sec. 110. of Act No. 496, &nbsp;provides that—</p> <blockquote> <p>"Whoever claims any &nbsp;part &nbsp;or interest in registered land adverse to the &nbsp; registered owner arising subsequent &nbsp;to the date &nbsp;of the original registration, may, &nbsp; if no other &nbsp;provision &nbsp;is made &nbsp;in this &nbsp;Act for registering &nbsp;the same, make a &nbsp;statement in writing &nbsp;setting forth fully his alleged right or interest, and how or under whom acquired, and a &nbsp;reference to the &nbsp;volume &nbsp;and page &nbsp;of the certificate of title of the &nbsp;registered &nbsp;owner, and &nbsp;a &nbsp;description &nbsp;of &nbsp;the land in &nbsp;which the right &nbsp;or interest is &nbsp;claimed.</p> <p>The &nbsp; statement shall be &nbsp;signed and sworn to, and &nbsp;shall state the adverse claimant's residence, and &nbsp;designate a place at &nbsp;which all &nbsp;notices &nbsp;may be served &nbsp;upon &nbsp; him. &nbsp;This &nbsp;statement &nbsp;shall &nbsp;be entitled to registration &nbsp;as an adverse &nbsp;claim,, and &nbsp;the court, upon petition of &nbsp;any party &nbsp;in interest, &nbsp;shall &nbsp;grant &nbsp;a &nbsp;specific &nbsp;hearing upon the &nbsp;question of the validity of such adverse &nbsp;claim and shall enter &nbsp;such &nbsp;decree therein as justice &nbsp;and &nbsp;equity may require. &nbsp;If the claim is adjudged to be invalid, the &nbsp;registration &nbsp;shall be cancelled. &nbsp;&nbsp;If in any &nbsp;case &nbsp;the court &nbsp;after &nbsp;notice &nbsp;and &nbsp;&nbsp;hearing shall find &nbsp;that &nbsp;a claim &nbsp;thus &nbsp;registered &nbsp;was frivolous or &nbsp;vexatious, &nbsp;it may tax &nbsp;the &nbsp;adverse claimant, &nbsp;double or treble the costs in its discretion.</p> <p>It is believed &nbsp;that the two &nbsp;notices of adverse &nbsp;claim filed in both registries &nbsp;substantially comply with the above &nbsp;requirements. &nbsp;And under &nbsp;paragraph 5 &nbsp;of LRC Circular &nbsp;No. 2, &nbsp;dated July 10, 1954, 'where the &nbsp;document sought &nbsp;to &nbsp;be registered &nbsp;is sufficient in law and drawn up in accordance with existing requirements, it &nbsp;becomes incumbent upon the &nbsp;Register of &nbsp;Deeds to perform his &nbsp;ministerial duty without unnecessary delay.</p> <p>The &nbsp; registration &nbsp;of &nbsp;an &nbsp;invalid &nbsp;adverse claim &nbsp;will &nbsp;not do &nbsp;so much harm as &nbsp;the &nbsp;non-registration of a valid &nbsp;one. &nbsp;&nbsp;The notation of an &nbsp;adverse &nbsp;claim, &nbsp;like that of <span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;lis pendens</span>, &nbsp;does &nbsp;not &nbsp;create a non-existent right &nbsp;or lien &nbsp;and &nbsp;only means that a &nbsp;person &nbsp;who purchases or contracts &nbsp;on the property &nbsp;in dispute does so subject to the &nbsp;result or outcome of &nbsp;the dispute. * * *.</p> <p align="CENTER">* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p> <p>In view of the foregoing facts and considerations, &nbsp;this Commission is of the opinion, and so holds, that the notices &nbsp;of adverse claim filed by Elisa D. Gabriel with the Registries of Manila and Rizal are registrable. &nbsp;Registration &nbsp;should &nbsp;not however &nbsp;be &nbsp;confused with validity. &nbsp;The &nbsp;registration &nbsp;of the &nbsp;adverse claims will not by itself alone make them valid. Their validity will be ultimately be decided &nbsp;in Special Proceeding &nbsp;No. 2658 or, in the alternative, in the more expeditious remedy &nbsp;provided for in Sec. 110 of Act No. &nbsp;496., i.e., a speedy hearing &nbsp;upon &nbsp;the question &nbsp;of the validity of &nbsp;the adverse claim."</p> </blockquote> <p>Oppositor Domingo moved for a &nbsp;reconsideration of the above order, contending, in the main, that a &nbsp;Register of Deed exercises some degree of judicial &nbsp;power to determine upon his own responsibility, the &nbsp;legality of instruments brought &nbsp;before &nbsp;him for &nbsp;registration. &nbsp;In &nbsp;other &nbsp;words, oppositor submits that &nbsp; duties of &nbsp;the Registers &nbsp;of &nbsp;Deeds are &nbsp;not wholly ministerial, for &nbsp;they can and/or &nbsp;suspend the &nbsp;registration &nbsp;of documents when they think &nbsp;they are not &nbsp;valid or not registrable. &nbsp;In &nbsp;denying the motion for reconsideration, the Land Registration &nbsp;Commissioner said, in part—</p> <blockquote> <p>"The &nbsp;only &nbsp;question &nbsp;resolved by this &nbsp;Commission was &nbsp;the &nbsp;registrability of the two notices &nbsp;of adverse claims. &nbsp;The allegations and counter- allegations &nbsp;of the &nbsp;contending &nbsp;parties &nbsp;on the validity or invalidity of the adverse claims were not considered. They should be addressed to &nbsp;and decided by &nbsp;a competent &nbsp;court."</p> </blockquote> <p>With the denial of the motion &nbsp;for reconsideration, oppositor brought the matter to this &nbsp;Court &nbsp;on Appeal, claiming that the Land Registration &nbsp;Commission erred &nbsp;(1) in holding the adverse claims registrable; and &nbsp;(2) in holding that &nbsp;it is the mandatory duty of the Register &nbsp;of-Deeds to register the instant notices &nbsp;of adverse &nbsp;claims "whether or not they are valid, &nbsp;whether &nbsp;or not they &nbsp; are frivolous and merely intended to harass."</p> <p>In addition to the well-taken disquisitions of the L.R.C., it should be observed that Section 110 of Act No. 496, which is the legal &nbsp;provision &nbsp;applicable to the &nbsp;case, is divided into two parts: the first refers &nbsp;to &nbsp;the duty of the &nbsp;party who claims any part or interest in registered land adverse to the registered &nbsp;owner, subsequent to the date of the original registration; &nbsp;and the requirements &nbsp;to &nbsp;be &nbsp;complied with &nbsp;in &nbsp;order that ,such statement shall be &nbsp;entitled &nbsp;to registration as an adverse claim, thus &nbsp; showing the ministerial function of the Register of &nbsp;Deeds, &nbsp;when no defect is found on the face of such instrument; and the second applies only when, &nbsp;after registration of the adverse claim, a party &nbsp;files an appropriate petition with &nbsp;a competent court which &nbsp;shall grant a speedy hearing upon the &nbsp;question of the validity of such adverse claim, and to enter a decree, as justice and equity require; and in &nbsp;this hearing, the &nbsp;competent court &nbsp;shall resolve &nbsp;whether &nbsp;the &nbsp;adverse claim is &nbsp;frivolous or vexatious, &nbsp;which shall &nbsp; serve as &nbsp;the basis in &nbsp;taxing the costs. &nbsp;In the &nbsp;instant case, &nbsp;the first part was already &nbsp;acted &nbsp;upon by &nbsp;the L.R.C. which &nbsp;resolved in favor of the registrability of the two &nbsp;adverse claims and this part should &nbsp;have &nbsp;been considered as closed. What is &nbsp;left, is the determination &nbsp;of &nbsp;the validity of &nbsp;the adverse claims by competent court, after the filing of &nbsp;the corresponding &nbsp;petition &nbsp;for hearing, which &nbsp;the appellant had not done.</p> <p>Anent &nbsp;the second assignment &nbsp;of error, the &nbsp;Land Registration Commission did not state that it was mandatory for a Register of &nbsp;Deeds to register invalid or frivolous documents, or those intended to harrass; it merely said that whether the &nbsp;document is invalid, frivolous or intended to harrass, &nbsp;is not the duty of a Register &nbsp;of &nbsp;Deeds to decide, but a &nbsp; court of competent jurisdiction, and &nbsp;that it is &nbsp;his concern to see whether &nbsp;the documents sought to be registered conform &nbsp;with the formal &nbsp;and legal &nbsp;requirements for such documents.</p> <p>Wherefore, the Resolution of the Land Registration Commission, holding the &nbsp;registrability &nbsp;of the Adverse Claims under consideration, &nbsp;should &nbsp;be, &nbsp;as it &nbsp;is &nbsp; hereby affirmed, &nbsp;with costs against oppositor-appellant Juanita R. Domingo.</p> <p><i>Bengzon, C.
