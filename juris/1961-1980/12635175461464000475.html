				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Direct appeal from a sentence of life imprison足ment meted out by the
Court of First Instance of Pangasinan in its Criminal Case No. 23149-I.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant Demetrio de la Cruz was charged together with his
brother, Alberto de la Cruz, and his nephew, Eulogio de la Cruz, with the
murder of Leonardo Sanchez, by shooting the latter to death with a .22 caliber
rifle on 1 June 1964 in Rosales, Pangasinan.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Alberto and Eulogio were first arrested, tried and sentenced to life
imprisonment, but appellant Demetrio managed to avoid arrest and went into
hiding for four (4) years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He finally
surrendered to the authorities on 17 July 1968; was tried on the original
charge, and, despite his protestations of innocence, convicted of murder
qualified by <u>alevosia<i>,</i></u> and sentenced to the same penalty as his
co-accused (<u>reclusion perpetua</u>), to pay an indemnity of P12,000.00 to
the heirs of the deceased and the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is </span>uncontested
that in the morning of the fatal day, 1 June 1964, Alberto de la Cruz had an
altercation with one Victoriano Noveloso, a security guard of Hacienda Guiling
in the municipality of Ro<span style="">sales,
Pangasinan, owned </span>by the brothers Cojuangco.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the encounter, <span style="">Alberto was </span>boxed by Noveloso, and departed saying:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Wait for me, and expect what is to be
expected".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Noveloso proceeded to
the house of <span style="">the </span>hacienda
overseer, Leonardo Sanchez, whom he <span style="">informed
</span>of the previous occurrence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>According to the prosecution wit足<span style="">nesses,
</span>sometime later, Sanchez and Noveloso, accompanied, by another guard,
Laureano Sabado, while <span style="">on </span>the
way to Barrio Camangaan, Rosales, met the appellant, with his brother Alberto,
who bore a .22 <span style="">caliber </span>rifle,
and a nephew of theirs, Eulogio de la Cruz.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Sanchez advised his com<span style="">panions
to stay </span>behind and said he would talk with the trio.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Approaching the De la <span style="">Cruzes, </span>Sanchez raised his left hand and asked them to be calm and
settle <span style="">things; </span>but appellant
Demetrio de la Cruz snatched the rifle held by <span style="">his </span>brother Alberto, and repeatedly fired at Sanchez, hitting him
in the chest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sanchez was able to advise
his companions to run away, which they did.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Later, Sanchez died.</p>

<p class="BODY">Testifying <span style="">in </span>his
own behalf, Demetrio averred that on the morning of 1 June his brother Alberto
arrived at his house, told him about his being boxed by guard Noveloso, and
took his rifle from the trunk where it was kept.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Demetrio attempted to pacify his brother, but
Alberto ran away with the gun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Demetrio
followed, to keep his brother from trouble, but on the way met Sanchez, and
Alberto shot the latter, as he tried to wrest away the rifle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Demetrio snatched the gun from his brother
and led him home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This version was
supported by Alberto and Eulogio de la Cruz, who were taken from the <span style="">penitentiary </span>to testify; and both
asserted it was Alberto who shot Sanchez.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find the defense version not credible, being seriously
infirmed by several <span style="">circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First, </span>by the admitted flight of
Demetrio, who avowed <span style="">having fled to
Isabela </span>and gone into hiding there for about four years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His <span style="">explanation
of having done </span>so for fear of injury at the hands of the <span style="">security guards is not </span>convincing; for
if <span style="">appellant's </span>version is true,
the guards who <span style="">were with the </span>late
Sanchez must have seen that it was Alberto, and not <span style="">Demetrio, who </span>shot and killed the hacienda overseer; and there
would be <span style="">then no reason for </span>Demetrio
to be afraid of retaliation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Secondly,
right at the <span style="">start, the </span>state
witnesses, in their affidavits in support of the <span style="">complaint, laid the blame </span>on Demetrio.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet neither Alberto nor Eulogio had
previously asserted the innocence of Demetrio, not even after the first trial,
when both were convicted of the killing as conspirators.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, it is easy to see that Alberto,
after his own <span style="">conviction, </span>ran no
risk of additional, <span style="">punishment </span>by
avowing having been the one who shot the late Sanchez; and We have repeatedly
held such belated assumptions of guilt by persons pre足viously convicted as
unworthy of credence.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">While We find appellant's guilt proved beyond reasonable doubt,
We agree with the Solicitor General that the crime committed is not murder, but
homicide Merely, there being no adequate showing of <u><span style="">alevosia</span></u><span style="">, </span>since
the shooting was preceded by a parley between the accused and the deceased, and
there is testimony that the latter had attempted to wrest from Alberto de la
Cruz the rifle used to slay him (t.s.n., Estrada, pages 6 and 26; Appeal Brief
for the prosecution, page 7).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
penalty of <u><span style="">reclusion </span>temporal</u>
for homicide should, there足fore, be applied in the medium degree, and the
appealed judgment must be accordingly modified.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We do not believe this appellant is further entitled to the mitigating
circumstance of voluntary surrender, the search for appellant having already
lasted four (4) years, which belies the spontaneity of the surrender.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, applying the indeterminate sentence law, the
appellant is sentenced to a minimum of eight (8) years of <u>prision mayor</u>
and a maximum of fifteen <span style="">(15) years of <u>reclusion
temporal</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In all other respects, the
judgment under appeal is affirmed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
