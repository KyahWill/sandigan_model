				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Review of a sentence of death imposed by the Court of First Instance of 
Bataan, Hon. Ambrosio T. Dollete, presiding, on accused Hermogenes Ararao in 
Criminal Case No. 5104 of said Court, for the murder of one Mrs. Elisa 
Campos.
<p>In an information filed by the Provincial Fiscal of Bataan on June 14, 1957, 
Sixto Arioja, Hermogenes Ararao, Pedro Verano, Alejandro Policarpio, Mario 
Mojica and Rufino Ararao were charged with the murder of one Mrs. Elisa Campos, 
with the qualifying circumstance of evident premeditation and the aggravating 
circumstance of nocturnity.</p>
<p>Sixto Arioja and Pedro Verano pleaded guilty and were sentenced accordingly, 
and so the trial proceeded against the other accused. After trial, judgment was 
rendered by the court below, finding Hermogenes Ararao guilty as leader of the 
group that attacked and assaulted the victim, Mrs. Elisa Campos. The court found 
that the crime was committed with the qualifying circumstance of abuse of 
superior strength and so it sentenced Hermogenes Ararao to death. This 
proceeding is a review of the decision of the court below, insofar as it imposes 
upon Hermogenes Ararao the supreme penalty of death.</p>
<p>The principal witness presented by the prosecution is Pedro Verano, one of 
the accused who had pleaded guilty of the charge. He testified that in the 
evening of June 6, around 9:00, Hermogenes Ararao went to his house to invite 
him to go serenading. Verano agreed and so went with Hermogenes. Sixto Arioja 
and Mario Mojica also joined them. It was their plan to borrow a guitar from 
some neighbors of the place where they would serenade, but they were not able to 
do so. Inspite of the absence of a guitar they went nevertheless to the house of 
the girl they intended to serenade. Upon reaching the house, they gave their 
greetings and a man came out with a lamp. Hermogenes immediately grabbed the 
lamp from him and put out the light. Hermogenes ordered him to go down the 
stairway, to show the way, but he refused to do so. At that instant a girl went 
to the kitchen. Hermogenes immediately pulled her and dragged her out. Then the 
four brought her to the fields. Hermogenes and Arioja led the girl, while Mojica 
and Verano followed them. Verano asked Hermogenes where they were going and the 
latter answered that they were going to the fields.</p>
<p>Upon reaching the fields, Arioja immediately held the girl down and raped 
her. Hermogenes also did the same, and after him Verano himself followed. The 
last one to rape the victim was Mojica.</p>
<p>After raping the girl they brought her to a place known as Patawiran. And 
once there Hermogenes and Arioja declared that the girl should be killed. Verano 
was directed to beat the girl with a piece of wood which Mojica was carrying. At 
that time the girl had already fallen down because Arioja had boxed her on the 
arm and on the abdomen, as a result of which she fell down. Verano followed his 
order and so he hit the girl with a piece of wood. After that Arioja also took 
the piece of wood from Verano and also hit the girl with it, Verano had hit her 
with the piece of wood three times, but as she appeared to be alive yet Arioja 
hit her again several times. After that they left the girl in the place where 
she had fallen down.</p>
<p>The other evidence submitted shows that in the morning of June 7, a 
detachment of the Constabulary at Cabcaben, Bataan received a report from the 
Commanding Officer at Mariveles, that on the previous night of June 6, Mrs. 
Elisa Campos was kidnapped by unknown persons. Upon receipt of the report 
various patrols were organized. The body of the victim was found at the place 
where his assailants had left her. It was already in a decomposed state. A 
physician examined the body and his findings are contained in his report, 
Exhibit "A", as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Autopsy Finding:</p>
<p>A female Filipina, 4 ft. 11 inches in height in a slightly decomposed 
state.</p>
<p>"External Finding:</p>
<ol><li>Bloated face; hair and face matted with dried blood; eyes bulging and tongue 
protruded; Nose and mouth severely contused; right jaw and neck with hematoma. 

<p></p></li><li>Multiple hematoma and contusion on the anterior chest wall; scattered 
hematoma and contusions on both shoulder joints.<p></p> <p></p></li><li>Hematoma and contusion on both inner thighs and both knee joints.<p></p> <p></p></li><li>Contused wound on the right occipital region of the head with comminuted 
depressed fracture of the occipital bone.<p></p> <p></p></li><li>Severe intracranial injuries with cerebral hemorrhage.<p></p> </li><li>Negative vaginal smear for spermatozoa. </li></ol>
<p>"Cause of Death:</p>
<p>Comminuted depressed fracture on the right occipital region of the skull with 
severe intracranial injuries and cerebral hemorrhage."</p></blockquote>
<p>The first person whom the.Constabulary apprehended is Pedro Verano. They 
subject him to questioning and they found out from him that five other persons 
were involved in the kidnapping and they were Sixto Arioja, Hermogenes Ararao, 
Mario Mojica, Alejandro Policarpio and Rufino Ararao. All these individuals were 
picked up by the Constabulary and their written statements were taken before the 
Justice of the Peace. These statements were introduced at the trial. The 
statement of Hermogenes Ararao was presented in court as Exhibit "C". It is 
embodied in the decision of the court below. So are the statements of the other 
accused. The incident of the kidnapping and the killing of the victim is 
described in the statement of Hermogenes Ararao, Exhibit "C", as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Upon arrival at the house of Mang Baswil, I was standing at a distance of 
three (3) arm lengths from where Sixto, Pedro Verano and Alejandro were. After a 
while Pedro fired the gun in front of the house. When the woman went out, Sixto, 
grabbed and carried her on his shoulders to the forest with our company. After 
Sixto had raped, he was followed by Pedro and then Alejandro. Afterwards, Sixto 
boxed the woman at the face, and she fell down. Then Pedro hit her with a piece 
of wood, and when the woman was still showing life, Sixto took the piece of wood 
from Pedro and with it hit also the woman. Then we went home. Upon nearing our 
house, Pedro ordered me to hide his firearm and the two of them threatened to 
kill me if I did not comply. This is all and we went home to 
sleep."</p></blockquote>
<p>Pedro Verano testified that the leader of the gang was Hermogenes Ararao, who 
gave the orders. Verano followed the orders of Ararao because the latter was 
provided with a revolver, which he carried in his waist. Upon investigation, 
Hermogenes Ararao confessed that he had a pistol (without license) with him, and 
that he hid it by the creek near their house at Cabcaben, Mariveles, and that he 
delivered it up voluntarily to the authorities. For the illegal possession of 
the revolver he was also prosecuted and found guilty. All the accused in this 
case were also prosecuted for rape and were convicted.</p>
<p>There is no question that Hermogenes Ararao was among those who kidnapped and 
raped Mrs. Elisa Campos during the night of June 6, 1957. The only controversy 
revolves around the manner of his participation in the killing of the victim; 
for while Verano declared that he was invited by Hermogenes and the latter gave 
orders regarding the killing of the victim, Hermogenes, in his confession, 
declared that he was merely an onlooker. This is the substance of his confession 
in Exhibit "C". At the trial, Hermogenes did not take the witness stand and the 
only witness he presented in his favor was Sixto Arioja, who declared that 
Hermogenes was a companion of theirs in the kidnapping in the evening of June 6; 
that he (Hermogenes) did not do anything; and that it was he, the witness, and 
Verano, who raped and murdered the girl. On cross-examination, however, he was 
confronted with his statement, Exhibit "I". Upon being read his confession, he 
rejected the same and all that is contained therein, except the fact that it was 
he and Verano that committed the rape and hit the victim to death.</p>
<p>Upon examination of Sixto Arioja's statement, Exhibit "I", we find that it 
was Hermogenes who invited him that evening for the purpose of serenading a 
woman; that it was Hermogenes who called at the house of the woman and ordered 
her husband to go down; that it was Hermogenes who fired at the man, then 
ordered Policarpio to go up the house and grab the victim; that after reaching a 
place known as Patawiran, it was Hermogenes who told him to rape the woman and 
that he obeyed Hermogenes; that after they had raped the girl, they started to 
go home, but after they had walked 15 meters, Hermogenes told them to "sock" the 
woman and so they "socked" her and the woman fell down; that after they "socked" 
the woman, they were told to hit her, so the witness hit the woman with a piece 
of wood they were carrying; that after this Hermogenes ordered that the woman be 
hit some more so she will not be left alive.</p>
<p>The facts stated by witness Arioja for Hermogenes Ararao in Exhibit "I", 
clearly show that his (Ariojas) testimony in court, absolving Hermogenes Ararao 
of participation in the rape and leadership in the killing, is not true. 
Arioja's testimony in court is, therefore, fully discredited.</p>
<p>A consideration of the evidence submitted, as above indicated, satisfies Us 
that Hermogenes Ararao was the mastermind and the leader of the group that 
kidnapped Mrs. Elisa Campos and raped and killed her on the evening of June 6, 
1957. His participation as leader is corroborated by the fact that he was then 
only one who was armed with a revolver. We also note that Hermogenes was 21 
years old, Mojica, 16, Policarpio, 21, Sixto Arioja, 18, Verano, 17, so that 
Hermogenes was the oldest in the group, most of his companions being merely 
teenagers. The fact that he did not even care to testify to deny the imputation 
against him by Verano, or his statement taken before the Justice of the Peace, 
Exhibit "C", clearly shows his guilt and participation in the crime as testified 
to by Verano.</p>
<p>But while we are convinced that the finding of the trial court that 
Hermogenes Ararao was the leader of the group that committed the forcible 
abduction, the rape and the killing, the imposition of the supreme penalty on 
him (Hermogenes Ararao) for the killing is not justified. The information 
alleges, as qualifying circumstance of the crime of murder, that of evident 
premeditation. The evidence shows that after using the girl and after going back 
(distance stated in Exhibit "I" of place of rape to place of murder is about 15 
meters) Hermogenes Ararao decided that the victim be killed. Certainly, no 
evident premeditation could have been present, because there was no previously 
concerted plan to kill the victim and no sufficient time elapsed between the 
inception of said plan, if any, and its fulfillment. In this finding, the 
Solicitor General agrees.</p>
<p>However, it is contended by him that another qualifying circumstance, that of 
abuse of superior strength, attended the commission of the crime. We find that 
there was abuse of superior strength, not only because the conspirators were 
many, six in number, and one of them was armed with a revolver and another with 
a piece of wood. But this circumstance of abuse of superior strength can not be 
considered as a qualifying circumstance, for the reason that the same is not 
alleged in the information. It may therefore, only be considered as an 
aggravating circumstance. (People <i>vs</i>. Alonzao, L-5504, prom. July 31, 
1954.)</p>
<p>In view of the above circumstances, we find that there is no qualifying 
circumstance which may be considered as having attended the commission of the 
crime and which will raise the crime committed to murder, because the qualifying 
circumstance of evident premeditation alleged was not proved, and the 
aggravating circumstance of abuse of superior strength, which was proved, is not 
alleged. The offense committed therefore is that of homicide, attended by the 
aggravating circumstances of abuse of superior strength and nocturnity. There 
is. therefore, no justification for imposing the supreme penalty of death upon 
the accused Hermogenes Ararao. Under the facts proved and the allegations 
contained in the information, Hermogenes Ararao can only be found guilty of the 
crime of homicide, with two aggravating circumstances of abuse of superior 
strength and nocturnity.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the judgment of conviction sentencing the accused Hermogenes 
Ararao to the supreme penalty of death is hereby set aside, and another one 
entered finding the accused guilty of homicide, with two aggravating 
circumstances and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of from 17 years, 4 
months and 1 day as minimum to 20 years of <i>reclusion temporal</i> as maximum. 
In all other respects, the decision of the court below is hereby affirmed, with 
costs.</p><i>Bengzon, C.J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Reyes, J.B.L., Paredes, 
Dizon, De Leon,</i> and <i>Natividad, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
