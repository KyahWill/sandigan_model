VS. HON. GREGORIO T. LANTIN, JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF
MANILA; BENITO G. NAVARRO; NATIONAL WORKERS & STEVEDORING UNION; PHILIPPINE
STEAM NAVIGATION COMPANY, AND EMILIANO ROMEO, RESPONDENTS.
<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CASTRO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The respondents Benito Navarro and the National Workers and
Stevedoring Union (hereinafter referred to as the National Union) brought suit
on June 7, 1968 in the Court of First Instance of Manila against the respondent
Philippine Steam Navigation Company (hereinafter referred to as the Company),
the respon­dent <span class="SpellE">Emiliano</span> Romeo and the petitioner
Manila Stevedoring and General Workers Union-PTGWO (hereinafter referred to as
the Manila Union), for breach of contract and for damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Manila Union promptly moved for the
dismissal of the case, mainly on jurisdictional grounds, but the motion was
denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A sub­sequent motion for
reconsideration was likewise denied.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, the present petition for <i>certiorari</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Benito Navarro and <span class="SpellE">Emiliano</span> Romeo were,
prior to <st1:date year="1967" day="20" month="6">June 20, 1967</st1:date>,
partners in an enterprise known as the "Romeo and Navarro Stevedoring
Service." As far back as 1948, the two were engaged in general stevedoring
work at the north harbor of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Port</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Manila</st1:placename></st1:place> and were servicing the
vessels of the respondent Company docking thereat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1967" day="20" month="6">June
 20, 1967</st1:date>, however, the partnership broke up, for reasons nowhere
stated in the record, and both Navarro and Romeo formed their respective
separate work gangs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Following this
event, the stevedores and workers under Navarro joined the National Union
while, at about the same time, those of Romeo joined the Manila Union.</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently the Manila Union presented to the Company demands
for union recognition, privileges and fringe benefits, and the execution of a
collective bargaining agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These
demands were, however, rejected by the Company, the reason given being the
absence of employer-employee relationship with the members of the Manila
Union.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1968" day="17" month="5">May 17, 1968</st1:date> the latter union filed an unfair labor
practice charge against the Company with the Court of Industrial Relations,
docketed as Charge 2478.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Three days
thereafter, or on <st1:date year="1968" day="20" month="5">May 20, 1968</st1:date>,
the same union staged a strike, picketing Pier 4 at the north harbor and the
offices of the Company at Port Area in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the following day, May 21, 1968, the
Company entered into a return-to-work agreement with the Manila Union.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This agreement, in substance, bound the
Company, in consideration of the lifting of the strike, "to enter into a
contract with a CONTRACTOR to be chosen by the Union." The formal contract
with such "contractor" was stated to cover:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"(a) Payment of check-off by the
CONTRACTOR to the mother union; (b) Terms and conditions of employment of the
stevedores for the CONTRACTOR to insure payment of minimum wages and fringe
benefits that are required by law; and (c) Rate and pay­ment of stevedoring and
<span class="SpellE">dockhandling</span> charges."</p>

<p class="BODY">According to Navarro and the National Union, following the
execution of the return-to-work agreement mentioned, above, they found
themselves effectively prevented by members of the Manila Union from doing
their former share of the stevedoring work on the Company's vessels.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A counter-strike staged by the National Union
seemed to have accomplished nothing; so on June 7, 1968 Navarro and the
National Union resorted to a civil suit in the Court of First Instance of
Manila against the Manila Union, the Company and <span class="SpellE">Emiliano</span>
Romeo for breach of contract and for damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">The complaint, as subsequently amended, avers in subs­tance that
on January 1, 1968 the Company awarded separate three-year stevedoring
contracts to Benito Navarro and <span class="SpellE">Emiliano</span> Romeo; that
under these contracts Navarro and Romeo were each to service four vessels
exclusively and two others on rotation ba­sis; that the stipulations of these
contracts were observed by the parties for a period of four and a half months;
that the stevedores and workers under Navarro had joined the National Union
while those of Romeo had in turn joined the Manila Union; that the latter union
presented to the Company demands for recognition, privi­leges and fringe
benefits, and the execution of a collective bar­gaining agreement; that
following the denial of these demands on the ground of lack of
employer-employee relationship, the Mani­la Union struck, employing violence,
threats and intimidation, and prevented Navarro and the members of the National
Union from performing their obligations under Navarro's stevedoring contract with
the Company, thus causing them damages in the sum of P15, 000; that due to the
complete <span class="SpellE">paralyzation</span> of its busi­ness, the Company
was forced to execute with the striking union a return-to-work agreement,
without previous notice to Navarro and the National Union; that Romeo and the
Manila Union treated the agreement as embracing all the vessels of the Company
in­cluding those assigned to Navarro and his men; and that while the Company
subsequently expressed its willingness to allow Navarro and the National Union
to perform their share of the stevedoring work on its vessels, the latter could
not do so without risking a bloody confrontation with the men of the Manila
Union.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">reliefs</span>
sought by Navarro and the National Union from the lower court consist in the
payment of damages, the annulment of the return-to-work agreement between the
Manila Union and the Company, their restoration to their work at the piers, and
the restraining of the Manila Union and its agents from molesting and hampering
Navarro and the National Union in the performance of Navarro's contract with
the Company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The last two <span class="SpellE">reliefs</span> sought were the object of a petition for a
preliminary mandatory injunction in the court below.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 13, 1968 the Manila Union sought the dismissal of the
case on the ground that it involved a labor dispute and was therefore outside
the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance, averring that the Court of
Industrial Relations had earlier taken cognizance of the same issues raised in
the complaint filed by Navarro and the National Union.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After hearing had on the motion to dismiss,
the respondent court, presided by Judge Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Lantin</span>,
issued a resolution denying the motion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A subsequent mo­tion for reconsideration did not fare any better.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner thus promptly sought the
intervention of this Court by way of a special civil action for <i>certiorari</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On January 13, 1969, after due hearing, we
issued a writ of preliminary injunction restraining the respondent court from
proceeding with the trial of the case until further orders.</p>

<p class="BODY">We confront two conflicting versions regarding the pre­cise
nature of the relationship that exists between the Company on the one hand and
the stevedores and workers who service its fleet upon the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner Manila Union, asserting that
an employer-employee relationship binds the two, charges that Navarro and Romeo
are not independent contractors but merely dummies under the employ of the
Company, and that the alleged stevedoring contracts of January 1, 1968 were plain
fa­brications designed to cheat the stevedores and workers of the many rights
afforded them by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further, the
petitioner points out that Navarro and the National Union are mere tools
utilized by the Company to break the back of the petitioner and reclaim the
benefits that had already accrued to its union members.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand, Navarro and the National
Union claim that the stevedores and workers are employees of Navarro and Romeo
rather than of the Company, stressing that the latter two were already
independent contractors of the Company long before the execution of the written
stevedoring contracts of <st1:date year="1968" day="1" month="1">January 1,
 1968</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">As matters now stand, we are not in a position to pass judgment
upon the two conflicting allegations.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The record before us is not adequate to support a finding for either
side.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The res­pondent court from which
the present action originated has not had an opportunity to inquire into the
true and precise nature of the relations among the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let it be remembered that the entirety of the
proceedings had in the respondent court consisted only of an amended complaint,
a motion to dismiss, denial of the latter, a two-page motion for
reconsideration, and denial of the latter motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No answer has been filed; no evidence of whatso­ever
kind has been adduced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner,
in its motion to dis­miss, supplemented by its motion for reconsideration,
relied solely on its position that the complaint alleges facts which if ad­mitted
would constitute a labor dispute cognizable exclusively by the Court of
Industrial Relations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The unfair labor
practice charge (Charge 2478) brought against the Company by the petitioner
Manila Union has not yet entered the stage of initial formal hearing, fol­lowing
its near dismissal at the instance of the Prosecution Division of the CIR.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus the only issue within our competence to
pass upon is whether or not, on the basis of the allegations of the com­plaint
filed by the respondents Navarro and National Union, the res­pondent Court of
First Instance has jurisdiction over the case.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Reading the complaint filed below, through the haze that shrouds
some of the words used therein, we gather that the actionable wrong sought to
be redressed consists in the exclusion, by means of violence and intimidation,
of an independent contractor and his men from work which properly belongs to
them, by another contractor and the latter's followers under the guise of
legitimate unionism.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Damages in the sum
of P15,000 are addi­tionally claimed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The subject-matter of the complaint, thus understood, clearly falls
within the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance.</p>

<p class="BODY">While the complaint charges the Manila Union as having acted
concertedly after failing to obtain its demand for "recog­nition
privileges and other fringe benefits" and "the execution of a
collective bargaining contract," this does not form the subs­tance of the
plaintiff's causes of action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rights
which Navarro and the National Union claim derive, not from any aspect of
employer-employee relationship, but rather primarily from Navarro's stevedoring
contract with the Company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Manila
Union's allegedly coercive interference with this contract is the mischief
sought to be removed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Parenthetically,
the peti­tioner's charge that the entire controversy among the parties to this
case boils down to a labor dispute cognizable by the Court of Industrial
Relations, short of proof, "does not suffice to oust the jurisdiction of
the court of first instance any more than a simple averment that 'no labor
dispute exists' would suffice to confer it."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Before closing, this Court must note that in the unfair labor
practice charge filed by the petitioner Manila Union against the Company for
refusal to bargain and union busting, neither Navarro nor the National Union
has been <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The result of this, of course, is that the CIR cannot render any
decision which will be binding upon these two.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It would seem wiser and appropriate that they be made parties to that
case since their presence in the conflict involved therein appears to be
inextrica­ble as evidenced even by the affidavits submitted by the peti­tioner
Manila Union in support of its charges.</p>

<p class="BODY">We recognize the possibility that the way we resolve the present
case may eventually give rise to an unhappy situation whereby two courts, the
CFI and the CIR, may have to pass upon the same issue of whether or not an
employer-employee relation­ship exists between the stevedores and workers
concerned on the one hand and the Company upon the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This, however, is un­avoidable by reason of
the conflicting manners by which the con­tending parties treat what they allege
as their respective rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Until the
truth is known, unfortunately, we cannot deprive each of them of the remedies
made available by statutes for the pur­suance of those rights.</p>

<p class="BODY">Of course, should the respondent court of first instance find, in
the course of the litigation before it, that there exists an employer-employee
relationship between the stevedores and workers concerned on the one hand and
the Company upon the other, and that the semblance of an unfair labor practice
stirs in the core of the conflicts, a dismissal of the case, to permit the CIR
to go it alone, would be in order.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Public policy will not permit any person to utilize the general remedies
granted by statutes for the purpose of undermining the substantive laws be­nefiting
labor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Needless to say, however, the
dismissal will not prejudice any subsequent action for damages which the proper
party may later on bring as the logical result of a final adjudica­tion by the
CIR, on the merits, of the case before it.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the petition is denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The writ of pre­liminary injunction we issued
on <st1:date year="1969" day="13" month="1">January 13, 1969</st1:date> is
hereby dis­solved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No pronouncement as
to costs.</p>
