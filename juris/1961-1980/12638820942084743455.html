<p class="BODY">The facts, as found by the Court of Appeals, are:</p>

<blockquote>"Appellant J. M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co.
Inc. hereinafter referred to as appellant company was the registered owner of Lot
No. 22, Block 461, Sta. Mesa Heights Subdivision, located at the Northwestern
corner of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> Boulevard and Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City and embraced
by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 49235 of the Registry of Deeds of said
city.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In March, 1962, plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Cronico</span> offered to buy
the lot from the appellant company with the help of Mary E. <span class="SpellE">Venturanza</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They personally talked to Benjamin F.
Bautista, Manager of the Real Estate Department of Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>,
Inc. the appellant company's attorney-in-fact, proposing to buy Lot No.
22.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was required to present proofs
to show her rights to the lot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="8" month="3">March 8, 1962</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cronico</span> exhibited certain documents showing her
priority rights to buy the lot.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In the first week of March, 1962, defendant-appellant Claudio
Ramirez also learned that the lot in question was being sold by the appellant
company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The occupants thereof who also
had priority rights to buy the land informed Claudio Ramirez about the intended
sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Juanita <span class="SpellE">Semilla</span>
and Pedro Fernandez, who were the occupants of the said Lot No. 22 expressed
their willingness to waive their rights although Pedro Fernandez reserved a
condition that a small portion of the land whereon his house stands be sold to
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the same month, March, 1962,
plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Cronico</span> and defendant-appellant Ramirez
sent separate individual letters to appellant company wherein they expressed
their desire to purchase the land and requested information concerning the
area, the price and other terms and conditions of the contract to sell.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two others intimated their desire to buying
the lot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span>
Chung and Angeles Henson.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both, however,
subsequently lost their interest in said lot.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="20" month="3">March 20, 1962</st1:date>,
the appellant company sent separate reply letters to prospective buyers
including plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Cronico</span> and defendant-appellant
Ramirez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were dropped in the Manila
Post Office at <st1:time minute="0" hour="11">11:00</st1:time> in the morning
of <st1:date year="1962" day="21" month="3">March 21, 1962</st1:date> by
registered mail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It so happened that
plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Cronico</span> went to the appellant company's
office on <st1:date year="1962" day="21" month="3">March 21, 1962</st1:date>,
and she was informed that the reply letter of the appellant company to
prospective buyers of the same lot had been mailed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With this information, plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Cronico</span> and Mary E. <span class="SpellE">Venturanza</span>
went to the post office in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
and she was able to get the letter at about <st1:time minute="30" hour="15">3:30</st1:time>
in the afternoon of the same date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
she got the letter, plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Cronico</span> and Mary E. <span class="SpellE">Venturanza</span> went directly to the office of Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span> Inc., <span class="SpellE">Escolta</span>, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
and presented the letter to Benjamin Bautista, Head of the Real Estate
Department of said company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since she
had no money, plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Cronico</span> requested Mary E. <span class="SpellE">Venturanza</span> to issue a check in the amount of P33,572.00 to
cover the down payment for the lot.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, Benjamin Bautista did not accept the check.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He advised plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Cronico</span>
that it is Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span> II who would decide whose
offer to buy may be accepted after the appellant company receives the registry
return cards attached to the registered letters sent to the <span class="SpellE">offerors</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On March 22, 1962, between 10:00 and 11:00 a.m., appellant Ramirez
received from the post office at San Francisco del Monte, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City, the reply letter of the appellant company dated March 20, 1962, wherein
it stated that Lot 22, Block 461, Sta. Mesa Heights Subdivision, was available
for sale under the conditions therein set forth and that the said lot was being
offered for sale on a first come first serve basis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant Ramirez proceeded to the office of
Benjamin Bautista in the same morning stating that he accepted the conditions
stated in the appellant company's letter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Benjamin Bautista advised appellant Ramirez to wait for the decision of
Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span> II.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The next day, <st1:date year="1962" day="23" month="3">March 23, 1962</st1:date>,
appellant Ramirez presented his letter to the appellant company confirming his
verbal acceptance of the terms and conditions in connection with the sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="31" month="3">March
 31, 1962</st1:date>, Atty. Jose E. <span class="SpellE">Patangpo</span> in
behalf of appellant Ramirez wrote the appellant company requesting the early
execution of the proper contract to sell over Lot No. 22.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A check in the amount of P33,572 was enclosed
in the letter to cover the down payment for said lot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The request was favorably considered.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On April 2, 1962, the J. M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp;
Co. Inc., and Claudio R. Ramirez executed contract to sell whereby the
appellant company agreed to sell to <span class="SpellE">apellant</span> Ramirez
the lot in question for a total pride of P167,869.00 subject to the terms and
conditions therein set forth.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Meanwhile, on <st1:date year="1962" day="27" month="3">March 27,
 1962</st1:date>, the appellant company received a letter from Atty. <span class="SpellE">Godofredo</span> Asuncion in behalf of <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cronico</span> requesting that the lot subject of litigation
be sold to her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She tendered a check to
cover the down payment which was, however, returned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="4" month="4">April
 4, 1962</st1:date>, the appellant company sent a letter to the plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> informing her that it had decided to sell the lot
in question to appellant Ramirez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
triggered the instant suit.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On <st1:date year="1962" day="28" month="4">April 28, 1962</st1:date>,
plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Cronico</span>
lodged in the Court of First instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> (<span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City Branch) a complaint against the
defendants-appellants J. M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co., Inc.
and Claudio Ramirez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The main purpose of
the said suit is to annul and set aside the contract to sell executed by and
between appellant company and appellant Ramirez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="30" month="5">May
 30, 1962</st1:date>, Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>, representing
J. M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co. Inc., filed its answer to the
complaint with cross claim against its co-defendant Claudio Ramirez and Luisa <span class="SpellE">Patangco</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
part of defendant Claudio Ramirez, he filed a motion to dismiss on the ground
that the complaint states no cause of action against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He contends that the action for the annulment
of contract may only be instituted by those who are parties thereto or those
who are thereby obliged principally or <span class="SpellE">subsidiarily</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to Claudio Ramirez such action to
annul a deed of sale can not prosper against third persons as they are not
principally or <span class="SpellE">subsidiarily</span> obligated thereby.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion to dismiss was denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So Claudio Ramirez filed his answer reiterating
in his affirmative defenses that since the plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
is not a party to the contract to sell executed by him and the defendant
company, plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Cronico</span>
has no right whatsoever to demand the annulment of said contract.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On November 19,
1968, plaintiff, together with Dr. Lucille E. <span class="SpellE">Venturanza</span>
filed a motion for substitution for party plaintiff whereby plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Cronico</span> expressed her
willingness to be substituted by Dr. Lucille E. <span class="SpellE">Venturanza</span>
as the former had transferred to the latter whatever rights and interests which
she may have over Lot 22, Block 261, Sta. Mesa Heights Subdivision by virtue of
a deed of assignment she executed on July 5, 1968.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court granted the substitution of the
party plaintiff by Dr. Lucille E. <span class="SpellE">Venturanza</span>."</blockquote>

<blockquote>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 31, Decision of Court of Appeals, pp. 1-7)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Anent the first error assigned, the petitioner contends that
"No less than the chief of the general service section of the <st1:place>Manila</st1:place>
post office, <span class="SpellE">Gaspar</span> Bautista, speaking on the
regularity of plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Cronico's</span> receipt of the
letter, testified before the trial court that the means by which plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Cronico</span> received her letter is very regular." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 74, Petitioner's Brief, p. 18).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And that "Anyway, the manner by which
the <span class="SpellE">offerees</span> were to receive their letters was not announced
by the <span class="SpellE">offeror</span> to the contestant such that they could
not be bound thereby.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the rule of
the fittest and without lawlessness should govern, and that was <span class="SpellE">Cronico</span> who proved her diligence and <span class="SpellE">resourcefullness</span>
over Claudio Ramirez." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 74,
Petitioner's Brief, p. 21)</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner also averred that the capability of the plaintiff,
<span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Cronico</span>, to chase
the land in question was not raised as an issue in the answer of the defendant
company and was developed as an afterthought during, the trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is a fact that the petitioner, <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cronico</span>, upon being tipped by Benjamin Bautista, head
of the Real Estate Department of Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>
Inc., that the reply letters of the appellant company were already placed in
the mails on March 21, 1962 at 11:00 o'clock in the morning, immediately went
to the Manila post office and claimed the registered letter addressed to her
without waiting for the ordinary course for registered mails to be
delivered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner took delivery
of the registered letter addressed to her at the entry section of the <st1:place>Manila</st1:place>
post office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While this procedure may be
tolerated by the postal authorities, the act of the petitioner in taking
delivery of her letter at the entry section of the Manila post office without
waiting for said letter to be delivered to her in due course of mail is a
violation of the "first come first served" condition imposed by the
respondent J. M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co. Inc., acting
through Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span> Inc..</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent, Claudio R. Ramirez, received on March 22, 1962 in
the morning the reply letter of the respondent company dated March 20, 1962
stating that Lot 22, Block 461, Sta. Mesa Heights Subdivision was available for
sale under the conditions set forth on the basis of "first come first
served".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent, Claudio R.
Ramirez, pro­ceeded to the office of Benjamin Bautista on the same date and
manifested that he was accepting the conditions stated in the respondent
company's letter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="23" month="3">March 23, 1962</st1:date>, respondent Ramirez
presented his letter to the respondent company confirming his verbal acceptance
of the terms and conditions in connection with the sale.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was only on <st1:date year="1962" day="27" month="3">March 27,
 1962</st1:date> that the respondent company received a letter from Atty. <span class="SpellE">Godofredo</span> Asuncion in behalf of petitioner, <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Cronico</span>, requesting
that the lot subject of litigation be sold to her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The enclosed check to cover the down payment
was returned to petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cronico</span> and on <st1:date year="1962" day="4" month="4">April 4, 1962</st1:date>, the respondent company
wrote said petitioner that it had decided to sell the lot in question to the
respondent Ramirez.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the foregoing circumstances, we con­cur in the finding
of the Court of Appeals that "Viewing the case from the standpoint of
regularity of notice, plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> falls short
of the yardstick." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 42, Decision of
the Court of Appeals, p. 12)</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals entertained serious doubts as to the
financial capability of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Cronico</span> to purchase the property because she was receiving
only the amount of P150.00 a month as her salary from her employment and there
was no showing that she had sources of income other than her job.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, when petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cronico</span>
tried to pay the down payment for the purchase of the land, it was Mary E. <span class="SpellE">Venturanza</span> who drew the check in the amount of P33,572.00
which was rejected by the respondent company.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is also to be noted that in the trial court, <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cronico</span> was substituted by her assignee Lucille E. <span class="SpellE">Venturanza</span>, daughter of Mary E. <span class="SpellE">Venturanza</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is apparent that petitioner, <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Cronico</span>, did not have
the capability to pay and that she acted only as a mere front of the <span class="SpellE">Venturanzas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
correctly pointed out by the Court of Appeals, realtors are given the right to
choose their buyers so as to avoid delinquent payments of monthly installments
which may result in costly court litigations.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention of petitioner, <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cronico</span>, that the promise to sell is supported by a
consideration as to her because she had established her link as successor of
Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Venturanza</span> who bought the lot from Juan
Ramos who in turn acquired said lot from Pedro <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner then argues that since Clause
Seventh of the Compromise Agreement between the respondent company and the <span class="SpellE">Deudors</span> et al. obligated the respondent company to sell to
the buyers of the <span class="SpellE">Deudors</span> listed in Annex B thereof,
Exhibit R-1, and Juan Ramos was the purchaser of the lot from Pedro <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span> with such right to buy from the defendant company
under a new contract with the latter, the said petitioner had established the
onerous cause or consideration apart from the selling price of the lot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Granting, <span class="SpellE"><u>arguendo</u></span>,
that Clause Seventh of the Compromise Agreement constitutes a valid
consideration of the promise to sell apart from the selling price, it appears
that the Compromise Agreement upon which the petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cronico</span>
predicates her right to buy the lot in question has been rescinded and set
aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Deudor</span>
vs. J. M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co., Inc., 2 SCRA 129 and J.
M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co., Inc. vs. <span class="SpellE">Sanvictores</span>
4 SCRA 123, 126) Hence, the promise of the respondent company to sell the lot
in question to the petitioner, <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Cronico</span>, has no consideration separate from the selling
price of said lot.</p>

<p class="BODY">In order that a unilateral promise may be binding upon the <span class="SpellE">promisor</span>, Article 1479, Civil Code of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
requires the concurrence of the condition that the promise be "supported
by a consideration distinct froth the price." Accordingly, the <span class="SpellE">Promisee</span> can not compel the <span class="SpellE">promisor</span>
to comply with the promise, unless the former establishes the existence of said
distinct consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">promisee</span> has the burden of proving such consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Sanchez vs. <span class="SpellE">Rigos</span>,
45 SCRA 368, 372-373) The petitioner, <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Cronico</span>, has not established the existence of a
consideration distinct from the price of the lot in question.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner cannot claim that she had accepted the promise
before it was withdrawn because, as stated above, she had violated the
condition of "first come, first served".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, it was only on <st1:date year="1962" day="27" month="3">March 27, 1962</st1:date> that the respondent company
received a letter from counsel of the petitioner requesting that the lot
subject of this litigation be sold to her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The respondent, Claudio R. Ramirez, had on <st1:date year="1962" day="23" month="3">March 23, 1962</st1:date>, confirmed in writing his verbal acceptance
of the terms and conditions of the sale of the lot in question.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner maintains that the contract to sell (Exhibit 3)
executed by the respondent company in favor of the respondent, Claudio R.
Ramirez, contains a stipulation for her benefit, which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"b)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>that the buyer
Claudio Ramirez has been fully informed by the company of all the circumstances
relative to the offer of <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Cronico</span> to buy said lot and that he agrees and binds
himself to hold the company absolutely free and harmless from all claims and damages
of said <span class="SpellE">Forencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Cronico</span> in
connection with this sale of the lot to him."</blockquote>

<blockquote>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 74, Petitioner's Brief, pp.
31-32)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The foregoing clause cannot by any
stretch of the imagination be considered as a clause "pour <span class="SpellE">autrui</span>" or for the benefit of the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The stipulation does not confer any right
arising from the contract that may be enforced by the petitioner against any of
the parties thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither does it
impose any obligation arising from the contract that may be enforced by any of
the parties thereto against the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The petitioner is not "obliged principally or <span class="SpellE">subsidiarily</span>"
by the contract to sell executed between the respondent company and the
respondent Claudio R. Ramirez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said
stipulation is for the benefit of the respondent company.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention of the petitioner that she has become the <span class="SpellE">obligee</span> or creditor of the respondent company because she
was the first to comply with the terms of the letter-offer has no merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her so called acceptance has no effect
because she violated the condition of "first come, first served" by
taking delivery of the reply letter of the respondent com­pany in the entry
section of the Manila post office and of the fact that her formal letter of
acceptance was only received by the respondent company on March 27, 1962.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of all the foregoing, we find that the Court of Appeals
has not committed any of the errors assigned in the brief of the petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.
R. No. 44479-R is hereby affirmed, without pronouncement as to costs.</p>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>
