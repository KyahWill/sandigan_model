Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Banaag</span> and the Secretary of Agriculture and
Natural Resources from the decision of the Court of First Instance of Manila in
Civil Case No. 27384 setting aside the aforesaid Secretary's orders of June 29
and August 16, 1955 and ordering that the applications of <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span>
Bonilla and Flora <span class="SpellE">Andrada</span> for the lease of Lot No.
7296 and Lot No. 7297, respectively, of the <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>
Cadastre No. 234, Case No. 6, for fishpond purposes, be given due course to the
exclusion of the applications of the <span class="SpellE">Buenaflors</span> and <span class="SpellE">Banaag</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, on <st1:date year="1957" day="14" month="2">February 14, 1957</st1:date> Marcelo <span class="SpellE">Buenaflor</span> withdrew his appeal (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>
p. 41) and the withdrawal was approved on the 22nd of the same month and year
by the Court of Appeals to which the appeal was originally elevated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What remains, therefore, is the appeal of
Vicente <span class="SpellE">Buenaflor</span>, Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Banaag</span>
and the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources.</p>

<p class="BODY">The following STATEMENT OF THE CASE AND OF FACTS made in the
brief submitted by the Office of the Solicitor General is substantially
correct:</p>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1949" day="15" month="8">August 15, 1949</st1:date>,
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> Bonilla filed what is known as
Fishpond Appli­cation No. 3891 (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. <span class="GramE">A, A-1, pp. 175-176, rec.)</span> <span class="GramE">with</span> the
Bureau of Fisheries for a fishpond permit covering Lot No. 7296 of the <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> Cadastre No. 234, Case No. 6, located at Barrio <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>, with an area of 43.8 hectares.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner Flora <span class="SpellE">Andrada</span>
also filed on <st1:date year="1952" day="14" month="4">April 14, 1952</st1:date>
her own fishpond application (F.A. No. 8344) (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. <span class="GramE">B, B-1, pp. 177-178, rec.)</span> <span class="GramE">for</span> the
adjoining lot, Lot No. 7297, which has an area of 68 hectares.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1952" day="8" month="9">September 8, 1952</st1:date>,
respondents Marcelo <span class="SpellE">Buenaflor</span> and Vicente <span class="SpellE">Buenaflor</span> filed Fishpond Application No. 8960 (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. <span class="GramE">C, C-1, pp. 179-80, rec.)</span> <span class="GramE">and</span> 8961 <span style="">(<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. <span class="GramE">D, <span style="">D-1, pp. 181-182, rec.)</span></span></span> <span class="GramE">respectively</span>,
for portions of Lots Nos. 7296 and 7297 of the <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>
Cadastre 234, Case No. 6, which are the same lots applied for by petitioners <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> Bonilla and Flora <span class="SpellE">Andrada</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Banaag</span>
also filed on <st1:date year="1952" day="10" month="9">September 10, 1952</st1:date>
<span style="">his </span>Fishpond Application No.
8968 (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. <span class="GramE">E, E-1, pp. 183-184,
rec.)</span> <span class="GramE">for</span> portions of said lots.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Lot Nos. 7296 and 7297 were not released by the Bureau of
Forestry for fishpond purposes until after the filing of said applications,
that is, on <st1:date year="1952" day="25" month="11">November 25, 1952</st1:date>
and <st1:date year="1952" day="26" month="11">November 26, 1952</st1:date>,
respectively.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The conflict of claims between the petitioners <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> Bonilla and Flora <span class="SpellE">Andrada</span>
and respondents Vicente <span class="SpellE">Buenaflor</span> and Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Banaag</span>, was decided by the Director of Fisheries in his
order of June 22, 1953 (Exhibit "C", pp. 193-195, rec.) wherein he
gave due course to the respective fishpond appli­cations of petitioners <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> Bonilla and Flora <span class="SpellE">Andrada</span>
and rejected the fishpond applications of respondents Marcelo <span class="SpellE">Buenaflor</span>, Vicente <span class="SpellE">Buenaflor</span> and
Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Banaag</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The afore-mentioned order of June 22, 1953 was appealed to
the Office of the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources by said
respondents and on October 19, 1953, the then Acting Secretary of Agriculture
and Natural Resources, the Honorable <span class="SpellE">Placido</span> L. <span class="SpellE">Mapa</span>, rendered a decision (Exhibit ‘H’<span style="">, </span>pp. 196-198, rec.) rejecting the
applications of <span style="">the petitioners and
giving due course to the applications of respondents Marcelo <span class="SpellE">Buenaflor</span>, Vicente <span class="SpellE">Buenaflor</span> and
Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Banaag</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In short, the order of the Director of Fisheries of </span><st1:date year="1953" day="22" month="6"><span style="">June 22,
 1953</span></st1:date><span style=""> was reversed.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Petitioners <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> Bonilla and
Flora <span class="SpellE">Andrada</span> filed a motion for the reconsideration
of the last-mentioned decision (Annex 'A’, pp. 328­-342, rec.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the order of February 12, 1954 (Exhibit
‘I’, pp. 199-200, rec.) respondent Secretary ordered the reinvestigation of the
case between the petitioners and the other respondents in order to determine
the truth or the falsity of the allegations of petitioners in their motion for
reconsideration as to the improvements introduced on the lots in controversy by
Vicente <span class="SpellE">Buenaflor</span> which the petitioners claim were
introduced by said <span class="SpellE">Buenaflor</span> in disobedience of the
order of the Director of Fisheries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
report of the investigation reveals the fact that 'of the improvements
allegedly introduced by <span class="SpellE">Buenaflor</span>, only 21 meters of
the dike fall within the dis­puted area and the bulk of said improvement is
within Lot No. 638 which is a public land.' <span class="GramE">(See Exhibit 'J',
pp. 201-203, rec.)</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“On March 29, 1955, respondent Secretary entered an order (Exhibit
J) setting aside the decision of October 19, 1953 (Exhibit H, pp. 196­-198,
rec.) and giving due course to the respective fishpond applications of
petitioners <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> Bonilla and Flora <span class="SpellE">Andrada</span> while rejecting the applications of the
respondents, Vicente <span class="SpellE">Buenaflor</span>, Marcelo <span class="SpellE">Buenaflor</span> and Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Banaag</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A motion was filed by the above-mentioned respondents from
the order rejecting their fish­pond applications, but the <span style="">same </span>was denied in the order dated May
17, 1955 (Exhibit ‘K’, pp. 204­-205, rec.) on the ground that the improvements
introduced by them on the lots <span style="">in </span>dispute
‘are highly insignificant and disproportionate to the whole area of the
fishpond in question'.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Respondents Vicente <span class="SpellE">Buenaflor</span>,
Marcelo <span class="SpellE">Buena­flor</span> and Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Banaag</span>
filed <span style="">a </span>second motion for
reconsideration and upon further consideration of the case, respondent
Secretary entered the order of June 29, 1955 (Exhibit ‘L’, pp. 207-208, rec.) <span style="">wherein the total area of the two lots in
dispute 111.8 hectares, was divided among the petitioners <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span>
Bonilla and Flora <span class="SpellE">Andrada</span> and the three respondents,
so that each will get 22.36 hectares.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The respondent Secretary declared in said order that the 111.8 hectares
'if divided equally among the five applicants x <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">would
be large enough for each of them to develop and exploit for fish­pond purposes
and would be sufficient for their needs, considering that the greater number of
our people have less or nothing at all.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In deciding so, this Office </span><span style="">is
</span><span style="">not only exercising its sound
discretion </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">to which of the qualified applicants should
receive the benefit and bounty from the government but </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">also acting for the common welfare of all concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The division of the area in controversy among
all the applicants </span><span style="">is, </span><span style="">in our opinion, a just and equitable
disposition of the case and accord with the dictates of a sound policy to give
equal opportunity to all.'<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"The </span>petitioners
<span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> Bonilla and Flora <span class="SpellE">Andrada</span>
filed a motion for reconsideration of the order of <st1:date year="1955" day="29" month="6">June 29, 1955</st1:date> (Exhibit 'L', pp. 207-208, rec.)
but the same was denied in the order of <st1:date year="1955" day="16" month="8">August
 16, 1955</st1:date> (Exhibit 'N', pp. 228-229, rec.)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On September 3, 1955, <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> filed a
petition for <i style="">certiorari</i> and <i style="">mandamus</i> with the Court of First Instance
of Manila (Civil Case No. 27384) to annul and set aside the orders of the
respondent Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources of June 29, 1955 and
August 16 of the same year and to compel the latter to give due course to their
fishpond applications to the exclusion of those filed by the <span class="SpellE">Buena­flors</span> and <span class="SpellE">Banaag</span>, invoking
in their favor the priority rule established under Section 13 (a) of Fisheries
Administrative Order No. 14, as amended.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After trial, the lower
court rendered the decision appealed from.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The action filed by <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> in the
lower court is firstly, for <i style="">certiorari</i>
- upon the ground that the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources
gravely abused his discretion in issuing the orders complained of, with the
result that they were deprived of their priority rights under Section 13(a) of
Fisheries Administrative Order No. 14, as amended by Fisheries Administrative
Order No. 14-3 and secondly, for <i style="">mandamus</i>,
to compel said official to give due <span style="">course
to their applications mentioned heretofore, to the exclusion of similar
applications filed by the <span class="SpellE">Buenaflors</span> and <span class="SpellE">Banaag</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In our
opinion, the action for <i style="">mandamus</i>
depends entirely upon the success or failure of the action for <i style="">certiorari</i> in the sense that should it <span class="GramE">be</span> found that the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural
Resources did not commit any grave abuse of discretion in issuing the orders
complained of, there could be no case for <i style="">mandamus</i>
against him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is not disputed that
Lots Nos. 7296 and 7297 of the <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> Cadastre were
released for fishpond purposes only on November 25 and 26, 1952, respectively -
obviously more than two months after the filing of all the applications
mentioned heretofore.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, it seems clear that the priority rules <span class="SpellE"><span style="">setforth</span></span> in
the Fisheries Administrative Orders relied upon by <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
apply only to public lands suitable for fishpond purposes and actually released
by the Bureau of Fisheries for that particular purpose, because until said
lands had been properly declared available for fishpond purposes, there could
be nothing to apply for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of
fact, in a similar case decided on June 21, 1955 by the Secretary of
Agriculture and Natural Resources, it was held that the priority rule can not
be applied to areas not released for fishpond purposes and, therefore, not yet
under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Fisheries, and that as regards said
areas, conflicting applications must be considered as being on the same level,
their <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> having commenced only at the time
the area was released (Exhibits 11-A, A, N, and R).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While this ruling - affirmed by the Office of
the President of the Philippines (Exhibit 11-A) -is not necessarily binding
upon the courts, it is clear that it is entitled to great weight and must be
accepted as correct unless there is a clear showing that it is really wrong
both on facts and laws, - which is not the case here.</p>

<p class="BODY">Having thus arrived at the conclusion that the priority rule
invoked by <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> does not apply to their case, no
further argument need be adduced to show that the Secretary of Agriculture and
Natural Resources did not commit any grave abuse of discretion in issuing the
orders complained of providing for the equitable and equal division of the
subject area amongst the applicants.</p>

<p class="BODY">The action for <i style="">certiorari</i>
being untenable, as held above, the action for <i style="">mandamus</i> against the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources
has no leg to stand on.</p>

<p class="BODY">The truth of the matter, however, is that even assuming that the
priority rule applies to the conflicting applications involved in this case, We
can not find our way clear to holding that the Secretary of Agriculture and
Natural Resources committed a grave abuse of discretion in issuing the orders
complained of which, in substance, provide for the equal division of the land
in dispute among appellants and <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, with the
further understanding that to appellant Vicente <span class="SpellE">Buenaflor</span>
shall be <span style="">as</span>signed that portion
of Lot No. 7296 where he had made improvements.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We agree with said official's pronouncement that "the welfare of as
many people as possible is the main concern" of his office and that in
line with this policy "available lands of public domain should not be
distributed with an unequal hand, favoring only a few and denying the same
chance to the rest", and that "the 111.8 hectares involved in this
case, if divided equally among the five applicants" x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> their respective share "would be large enough
for each of them to develop and exploit for fishpond purposes and would be
sufficient for their needs, considering that the greater number of our people
have less or nothing at all".</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING</b>, the decision appealed from
is hereby reversed and set aside.</p>
