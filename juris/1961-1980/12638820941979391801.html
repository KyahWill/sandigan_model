<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="24" month="2">February 24, 1962</st1:date>
the acting chief of police of Bacon, <span class="SpellE">Sorsogon</span> filed
in the justice of the peace court a complaint im­puting to Paula <span class="SpellE">Manduriao</span> grave slander with slight physical injuries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He alleged that Paula uttered against Gloria
Serrano on <st1:date year="1962" day="21" month="2">February 21, 1962</st1:date>
the following defamatory words:</p>

<blockquote>"You are a prostitute.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>You are the worst woman in town.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Your family is the dirtiest family in town.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I did not allow my son Raul to marry you
because you were the one who courted him."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">It
was further alleged in the complaint that after uttering those defamatory
words, Paula boxed Gloria on the face and forehead, thus inflicting on her
injuries that would heal in eight days (Criminal Case No. 812).<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">Paula
waived the preliminary investigation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The case was elevated to the Court of First Instance (Criminal Case No.
2952).<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">Because
the fiscal thought that the complaint should be signed by the offended party
(See art. 360, last paragraph, Revised Penal Code; People vs. Padilla, 105
Phil. 45) and that there is no offense of grave slander with <span class="SpellE"><u>lesiones</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>leves</u></span>, he
filed a motion to dismiss the charge of grave slander without prejudice to
filing the proper complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also
moved for the return of the record to the justice of the peace court for the
prosecution of the offense of <span class="SpellE"><u>lesiones</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>leves</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Court of First Instance granted that motion in its order of </span></span><st1:date year="1962" day="20" month="7"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">July 20, 1962</span></span></st1:date><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">On
</span></span><st1:date year="1962" day="12" month="9"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">September 12,
 1962</span></span></st1:date><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">, or after the record was returned to the
inferior court, the chief of police filed an amended complaint in Criminal Case
No. 812 for <span class="SpellE"><u>lesiones</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>leves</u></span>
only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Paula filed a motion to quash
which was denied by the court in its order of </span></span><st1:date year="1962" day="24" month="10"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">October 24, 1962</span></span></st1:date><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">On
February 23, 1963, or after her motion for reconsideration was denied, Paula
filed in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Sorsogon</span> a
petition for prohibition to restrain the justice of the peace court from trying
the case for slight physical injuries against her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She contended that the offense had prescribed
and that the justice of the peace court erred in not dismissing the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Civil Case No. 1815).</span><o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">Respondents</span></span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style=""> justice of the
peace and Gloria Serrano, the offended party, answered the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The parties entered </span></span>into a
stipulation of facts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court in
its decision dated <st1:date year="1975" day="16" month="3">March 16, 1975</st1:date>
dismissed the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It ruled that
the offense had not yet prescribed because the amended complaint retroacted to
the filing of the original complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">Paula <span class="SpellE">Manduriao</span> appealed to the Court
of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That Court in its resolution
of <st1:date year="1967" day="31" month="8">August 31, 1967</st1:date> elevated
the appeal to this Court because it involves only a question of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(CA-G.</span> R. No.
36244-R).</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant <span class="SpellE">Manduriao</span> contends that the
lower court erred in holding that the amended complaint is valid and that the
offense of <span class="SpellE"><u>lesiones</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>leves</u></span>
had not yet prescribed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She re­lies on
the provision in article 90 of the Revised Penal Code that light offenses
prescribe in two months.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">She
argues that the complaint in Criminal Case No. 812 could not have been amended
because after that case was docketed in the Court of First Instance as Criminal
Case No. 2952, it was dismissed and so it became "nonexistent".<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">That
is a captious or misleading argument because the trial court unmistakably
stated in its order that it was dismissing the complaint for grave slander
without prejudice and, at the same time, it was <u>remanding</u> the case for
slight physical injuries to the justice of the peace court for <u>trial on the
merits</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Contrary to appellant's
contention, the slight physical injuries case was not terminated.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">However,
because the two crimes were originally charged in one complaint, the chief of
police had no choice but to amend that complaint by eliminating the charge for
grave slander so that Paula <span class="SpellE">Manduriao</span> would be tried
only for slight physical injuries on the basis of an indictment charging solely
that crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In amending the complaint,
the chief of police merely implemented the order of dismissal issued by the
Court of First Instance.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The contention that the offense of <span class="SpellE"><u>lesiones</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>leves</u></span> had in the meantime prescribed is
palpably unmeritorious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article 91 of
the Revised Penal Code provides that the period of prescription "shall be
interrupted by the filing of the complaint or information, and shall commence
to run again when such proceedings terminate without the accused being
convicted or acquitted, or are unjustifiably stopped for any reason not
imputable to him".</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">The
sixty-day prescriptive period for light offenses was interrupted in this case
when the chief of police filed the original complaint for grave slander with
slight physical injuries in the justice of the peace court on </span></span><st1:date year="1962" day="24" month="2"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">February 24, 1962</span></span></st1:date><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only three days of that period had elapsed
when it was interrupted by the filing of that complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That interruption has continued up to this
time.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">The
trial court did not err in holding that the amended complaint retroacted to the
time of the filing of the original complaint (<span class="SpellE">Arcaya</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Teleron</span>, L-37446, May 31, 1974, 57 SCRA 363, 366,
a case quite similar to the instant case).<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">Finding
no error in the lower court's order dismissing the petition the same is
affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The municipal court of Bacon
is directed to try Criminal Case No. 812.<span style="">&nbsp;
