				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.P., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">The Public <span style="">Service </span>Commission received complaints
to the effect that Philippine Long Distance Telephone Compa­ny <span style="">was discriminating in its </span>servicing
and grant of tele­phone installations.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Specifically, it was reported that <span style="">an application </span>for telephone connection had been filed with said
company by Cesar J. Bautista; that said appli­cation had been coursed through
the Public Service Commis­sion and approved by it; that notwithstanding such
appro­<span style="">val, Philippine </span>Long
Distance Telephone Company has failed to act on said application and, instead,
accorded priority to other applicants whose applications were not approved by
the <span style="">Public Service Commission.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Acting thereon, Public
Service Commissioner Enrique Medina issued on March 19, 1965 an order requiring
Philip­pine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT for short), to appear before
Public Service Commission on March 25, 1965, </span><span style="">at </span><span style="">9:00 A.M., to show
cause why the applied telephone of Cesar J. Bautista should not be installed
and why other applications, not approved by the Commission, have been favorably
acted upon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And in the same order, an
application for telephone connection filed </span>by <span style="">Oscar L. <span class="SpellE">Noblejas</span>, re­ceived by </span>the <span style="">Commission, was endorsed to PLDT for
compliance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">At the proceedings held
on </span><st1:date year="1965" day="25" month="3"><span style="">March 25, 1965</span></st1:date><span style="">,
docketed as Case No. 65-16-OC, Commissioner Medina advised <span class="SpellE">PLDT's</span>
counsel that the complaint against PLDT was for inadequate </span><span style="">service.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>PLDT requested a copy of the complaint but Com­missioner Medina ruled
that it was not necessary to pro­<span style="">vide
PLDT </span>with such copy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">PLDT then informed the Commissioner that Cesar J. Bautista did
file with PLDT on <st1:date year="1964" day="2" month="6">June 2, 1964</st1:date>
an applica­tion for a telephone connection.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It however maintained that Oscar L. <span class="SpellE">Noblejas</span>
had not filed any application ex­cept that endorsed by the Commission in its
aforementioned order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And PLDT stated
that upon its receipt of said or­der, on <st1:date year="1963" day="23" month="3">March 23, <span style="">1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>it entered an application <span style="">in </span>the <span style="">name of <span class="SpellE">Noblejas</span> in its file </span>of requests
for telephone <span style="">service.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">At <span class="SpellE">PLDT's</span>
</span>instance, Commissioner Medina allowed it to present evidence to show why
the telephone service ap­plied for by the complainants had not yet been
installed.</p>

<p class="BODY">PLDT called its first witness, Col. <span class="SpellE">Candido</span>
G. Bautista, its General Commercial Superintendent, to testify on the priority
status of the applications under conside­ration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said witness was thereupon questioned by <span style="">Commis­sioner </span>Medina.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And in the process, he testified that Bau<span style="">tista's requested telephone </span>was not
yet then installed because PLDT <span style="">was
still </span>enlarging its <span class="SpellE">Makati</span> Central Of­fice and
because there were several prior applications.</p>

<p class="BODY">At <span style="">his </span>own
instance, Commissioner Medina disconti­nued the testimony of the first witness
and called on <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Bacani</span>,
an official of the Public Service Commis­<span style="">sion, who testified </span>on the prevalence of complaints of PLDT
customers that preferences are made in repairs and <span style="">installations </span>of telephones on the basis of some bribe given to
PLDT linemen.</p>

<p class="BODY">And, thereafter, Commissioner Medina issued an order dated <st1:date year="1965" day="25" month="3">March <span style="">25,
 1965</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>requiring
PLDT to install a tele­phone at the residence of Cesar J. Bautista within fif­teen
days and another telephone in the residence of Oscar L. <span class="SpellE">Noblejas</span>
within twenty days from the date of said order.</p>

<p class="BODY">Further hearings in the case were set for April 21, 22 and <span style="">23, 1965.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, on <st1:date year="1965" day="31" month="3">March
 31, 1965</st1:date>, PLDT installed Ce­sar J. Bautista's telephone. Such fact
was manifested <span style="">to the Commission and
the incident as to <span class="GramE">said</span> complainant was closed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">At the hearing on <st1:date year="1965" day="21" month="4">April
 21, <span style="">1965</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>Commissioner Medi­na again called on
PLDT Superintendent Col. Bautista.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Af­ter
questioning him, Commissioner Medina called another witness, <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span> de la Rosa, over <span class="SpellE"><span style="">PLDT's</span></span><span style=""> </span>counsel's objec­tions, who up to this time had not been able to
propound questions on the witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Said witness testified that <span style="">his
application for telephone service was installed only after a long delay because
of his refusal to give money to PLDT and that his telephone is always
intercepted by a party line.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After de la Rosa's testimony, <span class="SpellE">PLDT's</span>
counsel was fi­nally given the chance to ask its witness, Col. Bautista,
questions on direct examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said
witness testified <span style="">that while PLDT, in
view </span>of the completion of its expan­sion program <span style="">in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Makati</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">, </span><span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, was able to serve the appli­cation
of Cesar J. Bautista, it could not immediately pro­<span style="">vide </span>telephone service to Oscar L. <span class="SpellE">Noblejas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="">PLDT, </span>he explained, still had to
attend to the applications for te­<span style="">lephone
services in </span>the area of <span class="SpellE">Noblejas</span>' residence
which were filed way ahead of <span class="SpellE">Noblejas</span>' recorded date
of applica­tion and <span class="GramE">that,</span> therefore, <span class="SpellE">Noblejas</span>' application can be at­tended to by PLDT only
after those prior applications shall have been served.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="4" month="5">May <span style="">4, </span>1965</st1:date>, PLDT filed a
motion for reconsidera­tion of the order of <st1:date year="1965" day="25" month="3">March 25, 1965</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="13" month="5">May 13, 1965</st1:date>,
the hearing was resumed. <span class="SpellE">Engr</span>. <span class="SpellE">Con­rado</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tadle</span> of the <span style="">Public
Service </span>Commission, upon being called and questioned by Commissioner
Medina, testified that cable facilities were available to serve the tele­phone
application of <span class="SpellE">Noblejas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said witness, however, admitted on cross
examination that he did not verify whether there were other applicants for
telephone service in the area where <span class="SpellE">Noblejas</span> <span style="">resides, </span>who had filed prior applica­tions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>PLDT then agreed to provide the map showing
the route passed by the cable mentioned by <span class="SpellE">Engr</span>. <span class="SpellE">Tadle</span>, con­taining indications of the various prior
applicants for telephone service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said
map was later submitted (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 6).</p>

<p class="BODY">At said hearing, also, Commissioner Medina denied <span class="SpellE">PLDT's</span> motion for reconsideration, by an order dated <st1:date year="1965" day="13" month="5">May 13, 1965</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">After PLDT formally offered its evidence, Commissio­ner Medina,
on <st1:date year="1965" day="2" month="6">June 2, 1965</st1:date>, issued an
order containing this <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion:</p>

<blockquote>"FOR ALL THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS, the Commission
reiterates its order dated March 25, 1965 with respect to the application of
Oscar L. <span class="SpellE">Noblejas</span> and orders the same be serviced
immediately; and considering that the period of 20 days granted in said order,
has already expired, PLDT is hereby fined Fif­ty (P50.00) Pesos a day, everyday
until the telephone service applied for is fully ins­talled and in service;
provided, however, that if the telephone service of Oscar L. <span class="SpellE">Noblejas</span> is connected and completed on or before June 10,
1965, the fine herein imposed will be con­sidered condoned and wiped out.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Oscar L. <span class="SpellE">Noblejas</span> as well as the
respon­dent PLDT are hereby ordered to inform the PSC in writing on June 11,
1965, whether the telephone applied for has been connected or not.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Should there be other telephone applica­tions in the files of
PLDT <span class="SpellE">unserved</span> until now, without bearing the dates of
filing in the PSC, stamped thereon by the PSC, the PLDT is hereby required to
advise the applicants to renew said applications and course them thru the PSC,
for the purpose of recording thereon the date or dates of filing before the PSC
and such dates shall determine the priority to be ob­served by the PLDT."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">PLDT then appealed to <span class="GramE">Us</span> from the orders dated </span><st1:date year="1965" day="25" month="3"><span style="">March </span>25,
 1965</st1:date>, <st1:date year="1965" day="13" month="5">May 13, 1965</st1:date>
<span style="">and </span><st1:date year="1965" day="2" month="6"><span style="">June 2, </span>1965</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's contentions are reducible to two: First, that <span style="">said </span>orders are invalid for not having
been signed b<span style="">y three Commissioners,
instead of containing Commissioner Medina's signature alone; and, second, the
Public Service Commission cannot legally order it to grant the application of <span class="SpellE">Noblejas</span> for telephone connection ahead of others who had
filed prior applications with PLDT.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Assuming that the present case involves <span class="GramE">an
uncontes­ted proceedings</span> not requiring the vote of three Commissio­ners,
which We do not here decide, the point that is here controlling is that the
records clearly and undisputedly show that there were applicants prior to <span class="SpellE">Noblejas</span> who have not yet been served with telephone
connections.</p>

<p class="BODY">Said applicants, <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> would argue,
cannot be con­sidered entitled to priority because their applications have not
been approved by the Public Service Commission.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And Commissioner Medina would impose the system of deter­mining priority
in accordance with the date of approval of the application by the Commission
rather than their fi­ling with the PLDT.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In </span><span style="">support </span><span style="">of this </span><span style="">procedure,
Commissioner Medina cites the so-called conditions alle</span>g<span style="">edly imposed on PLDT in several cases where
the latter applied for, and was granted, permission of the Commission to
increase its rates and to expand its services.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Said conditions,
contained in the decision in PSC Cases Nos. </span><span style="">61-5270, 61-5280, 61-5271, 61-2111 </span>and <span style="">62-4168, dated July </span>31, 1963, <span style="">included <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, the
following:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"(2) x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> (c) In order to avoid
complaints of favoritism and/or suspicions of discrimination or that the new
telephone connections or transfer are effected for money considera­tion, all
telephone connections and/or transfers after the receipt of this decision shall
be undertaken only upon prior approval of the Public Service Commission."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This point has already been resolved by <span class="GramE">Us</span>
in PLDT vs. Medina, L-24340, July 18, 1967, wherein We ruled that pursuant to <span style="">an amended decision </span>of the Public
Service Commission, dated January 9, 1964, in the <span style="">abovementioned cases, all </span>the conditions imposed in the original
deci­sion were removed and deleted.</p>

<p class="BODY">It follows, therefore, that the priority <span style="">in granting </span>applications for telephone service cannot be the dates
of approval of said application by the Public Service Commis­sion, since no
such <span style="">approval is </span>required.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The priority should be determined in
accordance with the dates of filing of the application with PLDT, the general
rule provided <span style="">for in Sec. </span>3 <span style="">of Public Act </span>3436, <span style="">the law granting telephone franchise to <span style="">the PLDT.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span>And following such a priority system, applicant <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Noblejas</span></span><span style=""> is not </span>entitled to installment of <span style="">his </span>requested telephone until the
prior applicants concerned shall have been served. Respondent Commission,
therefore, should have ordered PLDT to service the prior applicants first,
instead of applicant <span class="SpellE">Noblejas</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed orders are hereby reversed and set
aside and the present complaint against PLDT is hereby dismissed, but PLDT is
hereby enjoined to service the applications in the priority of their dates of
filing with PLDT.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span><span style=""> </span></p>
