No. 40634-R <span class="GramE">have</span> a common factual background.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their subject matter is Cadastral Lot No.

registered in the names of <span class="SpellE">Edelburgo</span> Cheng and <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> Cheng, brothers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The record reveals the following facts:</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><u>L-27614</u>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- On <st1:date year="1966" day="18" month="7"><u>July
 18, 1966</u></st1:date> the Cheng brothers purchased for P75, 000 from the
heirs of Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Belciña</span> Lot No. 434 covered by
Transfer Certificate of Title No. 5066 in <span class="SpellE">Belciña’s</span> name.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">When the Cheng brothers examined the original
of TCT No.</span> T-5066, they discovered that it contained two anno­tations:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>one, a notice of <span class="SpellE"><u>lis</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>pendens</u></span> dated <st1:date year="1966" day="14" month="6">June 14, 1966</st1:date> re­garding Case No. 1656, an action for
declaratory relief filed by Sergio <span class="SpellE">Belciña</span> <span class="SpellE">Montesclaros</span> regarding his claim for Lot No. 434, and, two,
an adverse claim of Lim <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Kee</span>
and Regina Ortega registered on <st1:date year="1966" day="20" month="7"><u>July
 20, 1966</u></st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="15" month="8">August 15, 1966</st1:date>
the Cheng brothers filed in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>
del Norte, <span class="SpellE">Dipolog</span> Branch II a petition to cancel the
said annotations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Copies of the petition
were served on <span class="SpellE">Montesclaros</span> and Lim <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Kee</span> (Miscellaneous Special
Proceeding No. 1446).</p>

<p class="BODY">The Cheng brothers alleged that the annotation of the notice of <span class="SpellE"><u>lis</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>pendens</u></span> and the
adverse claim was irregular because the owner's duplicate of TCT No. T-5066 was
not surrendered to the register of deeds.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Montesclaros</span> opposed the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He contended that his notice of <span class="SpellE"><u>lis</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>pendens</u></span> was
registered in conformity with sec­tion 79 of Act No. 496 and section 24, Rule
14 of the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He averred
that a notice of <span class="SpellE"><u>lis</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>pendens</u></span>
was an involun­tary transaction which could be registered without requiring the
presentation of the owner's duplicate of the title (Rivera vs. <span class="SpellE">Tirona</span>, 109 Phil. 505, 509).</p>

<p class="BODY">Lim <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Kee</span>
and Regina Ortega, who were common-law husband and wife, also opposed the
petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They alleged that they were
adverse claimants because they were mortgagees of the shares in Lot No. 434 of <span class="SpellE">Ildefonso</span>, <span class="SpellE">Saturnino</span> and <span class="SpellE">Onesima</span>, all surnamed <span class="SpellE">Belciña</span>,
three of the seven heirs of Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Belciña</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The mortgages, which were executed before Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Belciña's</span> estate was <span class="SpellE">extrajudicially</span>
partitioned, were evidenced by three deeds dated April 30, June 29 and <st1:date year="1964" day="20" month="10">October 20, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mortgages were given as security for the
payment of the sums of P3<span class="GramE">,500</span>, P3,000 and P3,000,
which the three heirs, respectively, borrowed from Lim <span class="SpellE">Tian</span>
<span class="SpellE">Kee</span> and Regina Ortega.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter were lessees of the building
erected on Lot No. 434.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deeds were
not registered.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court in its order of <st1:date year="1966" day="5" month="9">September 5, 1966</st1:date> granted the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It ordered the cancellation of the adverse
claim and the notice of <span class="SpellE"><u>lis</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>pendens</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
reasoned out that the annotation of the said entries was in violation of
section 55 of Act No. 496 because the <span class="GramE">owner' s</span>
duplicate of the title, which duplicate was in the possession of the Cheng
brothers, was not surrendered to the register of deeds.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lim <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Kee</span>
and Regina Ortega filed a motion for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court denied it in its order of <st1:date year="1966" day="13" month="9">September 13, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that order the lower court amplified its
prior order by directing the register of deeds "to issue a transfer
certificate of title over Lot No. 434" in the names of the Cheng brothers
"without prejudice to whatever actions" Lim <span class="SpellE">Tian</span>
<span class="SpellE">Kee</span> might file to protect his rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Note that the Cheng brothers were able to
secure Transfer Certificate of Title No. 9535 in their names on September 5,
1966 apparently pursuant to the aforementioned court's order of that date and
not because of the order of September 13, 1966).</p>

<p class="BODY">Lim <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Kee</span>
and Regina Ortega appealed to this Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Montesclaros</span> did not appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(He filed in the same court a complaint dated
November 3, 1966 against the heirs of Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Belciña</span>
and the Cheng brothers to recover possession of the lot and to annul TCT No.
9535, the partition of Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Belciña's</span> estate, and
the sale of Lot No. 434 to the Cheng brothers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The case was docketed as <u>Civil Case No. 1698</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lim <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Kee</span> and Regina Ortega were allowed to intervene in that
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What happened to that case and the
prior case, <u>Civil Case No. 1656</u>, is not shown in the record).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><u>L-27148</u>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- On September 16, 1966 Lim <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Kee</span> and Regina Ortega filed
in the same court a petition (supplementing their original petition of September
12, 1966) wherein they prayed that the Cheng brothers be ordered to deliver to
them or to the register of deeds the owner's duplicate of TCT No. 9535 so that
the three mortgage deeds already mentioned may be registered or annotated
(Miscellaneous Special Proceeding No. 1461).</p>

<p class="BODY">The Cheng brothers opposed the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They invoked the court's order in the prior
case, Miscellaneous Special Pro­ceeding No. 1446 (now L-27614), ordering the
cancellation of the adverse claim of Lim <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Kee</span> and Regina Ortega.</p>

<p class="BODY">Judge <span class="SpellE">Doroteo</span> de Guzman, the same judge
who acted in the prior case, dismissed the petition of Lim <span class="SpellE">Tian</span>
<span class="SpellE">Kee</span> and Regina Ortega in his order of <st1:date year="1966" day="23" month="9">September 23, 1966</st1:date> on the ground that
the issues raised in the second case were resolved in the first case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lim <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Kee</span>
and Regina Ortega also appealed to this Court the order of <st1:date year="1966" day="23" month="9">September 23, 1966</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><u>Cheng vs. Lim <span class="SpellE">Tian</span>
<span class="SpellE">Kee</span>, CA-G.</u></span><u> R. No. 40634-<span class="GramE">R<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(</span>L-40813</u>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- On October 12, 1966, or after Lim <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Kee</span> and Regina Ortega had
perfected their appeals in the aforemen­tioned two cases, the Cheng brothers
filed in the same court, <span class="SpellE">Dipolog</span> Branch II of the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del Norte,
against Lim <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Kee</span> and
Regina Ortega an action to quiet title which was also in the nature of an <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> suit.</p>

<p class="BODY">They prayed that they be declared the owners of Lot No. 434 and
that Lim <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Kee</span> and
Regina Ortega be ordered to vacate the said lot and the commercial building
located thereon (<u>Civil Case No. 1693</u>).</p>

<p class="BODY">Lim <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Kee</span>
and Regina Ortega pleaded as defenses in their answer the facts that they were
lessees of the lot and that they were mortgagees of the shares of three of the
seven heirs of the original owner.</p>

<p class="BODY">Civil Case No. 1693 was also assigned to Judge De Guzman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After trial, Judge De Guzman in his decision
dated <st1:date year="1967" day="18" month="9">September 18, 1967</st1:date>
declared the Cheng brothers the owners of the disputed lot, as shown in TCT No.
<span class="GramE">T-9535, and ordered Lim <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Kee</span> and Regina Ortega to pay rentals and to restore the
possession of the lot to the Cheng brothers.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">That judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeals in its
decision of <st1:date year="1975" day="17" month="2">February 17, 1975</st1:date>
with the modification that Lim <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Kee</span> and Regina Ortega need not deliver the possession of
the lot because they had vacated it during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of the appeal or after the building thereon was burned on <st1:date year="1968" day="21" month="2">February 21, 1968</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals further held that the issue as to the
validity of the mortgages, like the question of posses­sion, had become moot.</p>

<p class="BODY">That decision of the Court of Appeals became final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> after the appeal of Lim <span class="SpellE">Tian</span>
<span class="SpellE">Kee</span> was rejected by this Court in its resolution of <st1:date year="1975" day="28" month="7">July 28, 1975</st1:date> in Lim <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Kee</span> vs. Court of Appeals,
L-40813.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Issues and disposition of the appeals in L-27148 and L-27614</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- In L-27614 Lim <span class="SpellE">Tian</span>
<span class="SpellE">Kee</span> and Regina Ortega con­tend that the lower court
erred (1) in <span class="SpellE">cancelling</span> their adverse claim on the
basis of a petition, for cancellation of entries and without passing upon the
validity of the adverse claim; (2) in assuming that their adverse claim was a
voluntary dealing with registered land under section 55 of Act No. 496 which
necessitated the presentation of the owner' s duplicate of the title so that it
could be properly annotated, and (3) in ordering the issuance of a transfer
certificate of title to the Cheng bro­thers although they did not pray for that
relief in their petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">And in L-27148 appellants Lim <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Kee</span> and Regina Ortega contend that the lower court erred in
holding that the issues raised in Case No. 1461 were involved in the prior Case
No. 1446 (L-27614).</p>

<p class="BODY">The Cheng brothers did not bother to file any <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>'
brief in the two cases maybe because in <u>Civil Case No. 1693</u>, which was
their action to quiet title and recover possession of Lot No. 434 from Lim <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Kee</span> and Regina Ortega, they
obtained a favorable decision from the lower court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Cheng brothers in their consolidated motion of January 31,
1976 prayed for the dismissal of the appeals in the two cases on the ground
that the issue raised therein regarding the validity of the mortgages in favor
of Lim <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Kee</span> and Regina
Ortega was already decided by the Court of Appeals in Cheng vs. Lim <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Kee</span>, Civil Case No. 1693 or
CA-G. <span class="GramE">R. No. 40634-R.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Lim <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Kee</span>
and Regina Ortega opposed that con­solidated motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their contention is that the issues in these
two cases are different from the issues decided in Civil Case No. 1693 which
was appealed to the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">In our view, it is not necessary to resolve appellants'
assignments of error and <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>' motion to dismiss
the appeals because these cases may be adjudicated by revolving the issue of
whether the lower court, as a land registration court, had jurisdiction to
entertain the contested petition of the cancellation of the adverse claim and
notice of <span class="SpellE"><u>lis</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>pendens</u></span>
annotated on TCT No. 5066.</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be clarified that Cases Nos. 1446 and 1461 were
erroneously denominated and docketed as "miscellaneous special
proceedings".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The special
proceedings are enumerated in section 1, Rule 72 of the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those two cases are not the special
proceedings enumerated therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
cannot be denominated special proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitions herein for the cancellation of the annota­tions on
a Torrens title and for the annotation of an adverse claim on the owner's
duplicate of the title are incidents involving registered land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those petitions should carry the number of
the land registration record of the lot <span class="GramE">affected</span>
thereby which in these two cases is L. R. C. Cadastral Record No. 77.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 112 of Act No. 496 provides that a
petition filed <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span> "shall be filed and
entitled in the original case in which the decree of registration was
entered".</p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant two cases, what was invoked was the special and
limited jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance as a land registration
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The proceedings initiated in the
petitions are summary in character.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">The petition of the Cheng brothers for the
cancellation of the annotations on TCT No.</span> T-5066 was filed under
section 112.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is settled that relief
under section 112 can only be granted if there is no adverse claim or serious
opposition on the part of any party in interest; otherwise, the case becomes
controversial and should be threshed out in an ordinary case or in the case
where the incident properly belongs (<span class="SpellE">Tangunan</span> vs.
Republic, 94 Phil. 171).</p>

<p class="BODY">In other words, relief under section 112 can only be granted if
there is unanimity among the parties, which means the absence of any serious
controversy as to the title of the party seeking relief under that section (<span class="SpellE">Abella</span> vs. Hon. Rodriguez, 116 Phil. 1277; Enriquez vs. <span class="SpellE">Atienza</span>, 100 Phil. 1072).</p>

<p class="BODY">In Case No. 1446, now L-27614, the oppositions inter­posed by <span class="SpellE">Montesclaros</span>, Lim <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Kee</span> and Regina Ortega ren­dered highly controversial the
petition of the Cheng brothers for the cancellation of the notice of <span class="SpellE"><u>lis</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>pendens</u></span> and
adverse claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the
cancellation of those annotations could not be disposed of in the summary
proceeding under sec­tion 112.</p>

<p class="BODY">Because the Cheng brothers were aware that the con­troversy could
not be set at rest by means of their petition under section 112, they filed
Civil Case No. <u>1693</u> which was an ordinary action to quiet title and to
eject Lim <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Kee</span> and
Regina Ortega from Lot No. 434.</p>

<p class="BODY">And <span class="SpellE">Montesclaros</span>, being cognizant that
Case No. 1446 was not the proper forum for the ventilation of his claim for Lot
No. 434, sued the <span class="SpellE">Belciña</span> heirs and the Cheng
brothers in Civil Case No. <u>1698</u> which was an ordinary action to annul
the extrajudicial adjudication of that lot to the <span class="SpellE">Belciña</span>
heirs and the sale thereof to the Cheng brothers.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the petition of Lim <span class="SpellE">Tian</span>
<span class="SpellE">Kee</span> and Regina Ortega in Case No. 1461 to compel the
Cheng brothers to surrender the owner's duplicate of TCT No. 9535, that matter
was also highly controversial because of the Cheng brothers' opposition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That petition was interwoven with the
petition in Case No. 1446.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
annotation on TCT No. 9535 of the adverse claim of Lim <span class="SpellE">Tian</span>
<span class="SpellE">Kee</span> and Regina Ortega or the mortgages in their favor
could be litigated in Civil Case No. 1693 (as in fact it was resolved by the
trial court in that case) and even in Civil Case No. 1698 where their interven­tion
was allowed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the dismissal of the
petition in Case No. 1461 was proper.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court's orders of September 5 and 13, 1966 in
Miscellaneous Special Proceeding No. 1446 (L-27614) should be reversed and its
order of dismissal dated September 23, 1966 in Miscellaneous Special Proceeding
No. 1461 (L-27148) should be affirmed.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, this ruling does not in anyway affect the final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> judgment in Civil Case No. 1693, as modi­fied by
the Court of Appeals in Cheng vs. Lim <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Kee</span>, CA-G. <span class="GramE">R. No. 40634-R, a decision
which this Court refused to review in Lim <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Kee</span> vs. Court of Appeals, L-40813.</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in L-27614, the orders of the lower court dated
September 5 and 13, 1966 are reversed and set aside and in L-27148, the order
of September 23, 1966 is affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> in L-27614.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs in L- 27148.</p>
